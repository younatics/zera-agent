"(CNN) -- Two recent incidents have people questioning the basic goodness of humanity. In Washington, a man had a fatal heart attack across the street from a fire station. Passers-by said firefighters refused to help him because they hadn't been officially dispatched. At an elementary school in Salt Lake City, staff members seized and discarded children's lunches because their parents owed money on their accounts. (School administrators apologized.) Officials in Washington say they are ""furious"" at the firefighters' inaction. A mother of one of the students in Utah says she was ""blind-sided"" by the school's actions, and a state senator says he is ""incredibly disappointed."" The anger and bewilderment are understandable. But neither incident seems that shocking when considered in light of decades of study of the psychology of obedience and power. Researchers have repeatedly found that allegiance to rules and protocols routinely trumps people's consciences and sense of basic moral responsibility. Most famously, studies by Stanley Milgram at Yale University in the 1960s found that ordinary people were willing to give what they believed were fatal electric shocks to their partners in a bogus ""memory experiment"" simply because a researcher in a white lab coat told them to. The people supposedly getting shocked (who were working with Milgram and not being hurt at all) hollered and pleaded for the shocks to stop, which distressed many of the people administering them, but they kept at it. In fact, roughly two-thirds of the participants kept giving shocks until they had reached the highest voltage level possible, a percentage far higher than Milgram or any of his colleagues anticipated. In a similar vein, the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment run by psychologist Philip Zimbardo took typical Stanford University undergrads and randomly assigned them to be guards or prisoners in a makeshift jail. The guards completely took on their new roles and meted out cruel and sadistic treatment to their ""prisoners."" The authority they were given and the rules they were asked to enforce blinded them to what was right â€” and perhaps the same could be said for those school officials and firefighters. It's important to keep in mind that the participants in Milgram and Zimbardo's studies weren't necessarily bad people. They were likely no worse than you or me. They, too, were likely ""blind-sided by the surprisingly strong ways that rules and circumstance can dictate our behavior. While we would like to believe that humanity has evolved since the 1960s, other researchers have achieved similar results in more recent years. Is the upshot of all this that we're condemned to be unprincipled sheep? That a few rules and regulations can easily blind us to the better angels of our nature? Not so fast. The research shows that while external influences on our behavior can be strong, they are not insurmountable. We can overcome these influences simply by becoming more aware of them. One set of studies found that when people attended social psychology lectures explaining how external pressures can inhibit moral behavior, they became less susceptible to those pressures. Other evidence suggests that being reminded of one's similarities or common humanity with a person in need can motivate us to come to their aid, even when doing so puts ourselves at risk. Perhaps if bystanders' appeals to those firefighters had struck a more personal chord with them, they might have been jarred into action. Finally, throughout history, we have seen examples of people who displayed great altruism, even heroism, while most everyone around them remained bystanders to evil â€” or perpetrators of it. Some evidence suggests that the roots of this caring behavior extend back into childhood. A seminal study by Samuel and Pearl Oliner suggests that one commonality of people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust was that their parents nurtured empathy in them, such as by encouraging them to see the world from other points of view and emphasizing the universal similarity of people. Indeed, the childhood roots of altruism were evoked by another story in the news this week: the story of 10-year-old Danny DiPietro, who noticed that something seemed awry in a neighbor's garage and pressured his mother to investigate. Despite his mother's resistance, Danny persisted until his mother agreed to walk down the street. She found an 80-year-old neighbor who had slipped, couldn't get up, and likely would have died had she spent much more time trapped outside in the freezing cold. Rather than remaining quiet or succumbing to the pressure not to make waves, Danny stayed attuned to his moral instinctsâ€”""something just didn't feel right,"" he said. Sometimes it's nice to be reminded that while sensing what's right can get complicated by adult rules and regulations, it can still come naturally to kids. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Marsh.","Jason Marsh: Stories of school lunches grabbed from kids, man ignored by rescuers draw shock .

"(CNN) -- Human rights activists decried Tuesday a Haitian judge's decision not to try former dictator Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier for human rights violations. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Duvalier must be prosecuted for alleged crimes that include torture, rape and extrajudicial killings. ""The high commissioner has consistently reminded Haiti of its absolute obligation to investigate these well-documented serious human rights violations and to prosecute those responsible for them,"" spokesman Rupert Colville said. Human Rights Watch echoed those concerns in what it called the most important criminal case in Haitian history. ""This ruling is another reminder that Haiti's justice system has almost always been on the side of the powerful, no matter how gruesome or destructive their crimes,"" said Reed Brody, special counsel for the organization. ""We hope that it will be overturned on appeal."" Haiti, said Brody, ""has an obligation to its people to investigate and prosecute the grave violations of human rights under Duvalier's rule."" The investigative magistrate overseeing the case, Carves Jean, ruled that Duvalier will face trial on corruption charges stemming from his 15 years in rule but not for human rights abuses, the Haitian Press Agency reported. Jean said the statute of limitations had run out on those alleged crimes. Duvalier, who called himself ""president for life,"" fled Haiti in 1985. He stunned the world by returning from 25 years of exile in France to his homeland a year ago. Within days of his return to Port-au-Prince, he was charged with human rights crimes as well as financial wrongdoing: He allegedly embezzled hundreds of millions of dollars on which he lived in exile. As such, the statute of limitations has not run out on those allegations. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented what they call systematic violations under Duvalier's rule. Both organizations accuse Duvalier of imprisoning and torturing hundreds of Haitians, including journalists, and using violent means to silence voices of opposition. Amnesty gave the public prosecutor in the Duvalier case 100 documents that it said detailed cases of human rights violations. ""The cases of human rights abuses we documented in Haiti are likely to be only a small proportion of what really happened during Duvalier's rule,"" Javier Zuniga, a special adviser at Amnesty International, said last year. ""We will probably never know the true extent of the horror, but carrying out effective investigations will go a long way towards delivering justice."" Amnesty International's documents told the experiences of cobblers, taxi drivers, filmmakers, mechanics, distillers and even hairdressers, all of whom, they say, were arrested for anti-government activity. Human Rights Watch said the statute of limitations ruling contravenes the decisions of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, by whose judgments Haiti is legally bound. The United Nations human rights office, which had offered technical assistance to Haitian authorities to bring the case to trial, said it was deeply disappointed. ""It is clear under international law that there is no statute of limitations for such crimes, and the U.N. human rights office has provided technical assistance and legal advice stressing this point,"" Colville said. ""We urge the relevant authorities to ensure that justice is, belatedly, delivered to the many victims of human rights abuses committed under the government of Mr. Duvalier. There can be no true reconciliation and forgiveness without justice.""","A Haitian judge says Jean-Claude Duvalier will face corruption charges .

"(CNN) -- The death of actor and comedian Robin Williams has officially been ruled a suicide, the coroner in Marin County, California, said Friday. Alcohol and illegal drugs were not involved, the statement from the coroner's office said. Prescription drugs were found in ""therapeutic concentrations,"" the statement added. Williams was found dead in his Tiburon, California, home August 11 from what investigators suspected was a suicide by hanging. He was 63 years old. The death certificate, obtained by CNN on August 21, says his ashes were scattered off the coast one day later. Investigators believe Williams used a belt to hang himself from a bedroom door, Marin County Assistant Deputy Chief Coroner Lt. Keith Boyd said at the time. Williams was sober but struggling with depression, anxiety and the early stages of Parkinson's disease when he died, his widow, Susan Schneider, said in a statement in August. ""Robin spent so much of his life helping others,"" she said. Whether he was entertaining millions on stage, film or television, our troops on the front lines, or comforting a sick child -- Robin wanted us to laugh and to feel less afraid."" Williams had ""a recent increase in paranoia"" and was sleeping in a stepson's bedroom because of insomnia and anxiety associated with Parkinson's, according to the coroner's report. A pathology report released Friday said Williams was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in November 2013, several years after he first noticed symptoms such as tremors in his left arm and a slowing of his left-hand movements. Last call made to wife . The coroner's report said his body was found about 11:45 a.m. by a personal assistant, who used a paperclip to open the locked door of the bedroom where Williams had been sleeping. Williams was found in a seated position on the floor of the bedroom with a belt secured around his neck and the other end of the belt wedged between a closet door and door frame. The actor was wearing black jeans and a black short-sleeve T-shirt, the coroner's report said. A cellphone recovered from Williams' pants pocket was dead. After recharging the phone, the coroner searched through its texts and emails and found no messages referencing suicide, the report said. The last call on the phone was made the night before to Williams' wife, Susan, and lasted 38 seconds. In one incident the evening before he died, Williams took several wristwatches and put them into a sock and took them to someone's house for safekeeping, an indication of his paranoia, his wife suggested. Also noteworthy, according to Williams' wife, is that he may have learned of the suicide technique from a movie role in which a character Williams portrayed died from autoerotic asphyxiation. Grief and remembrance . Williams' death was met with an outpouring of grief and recollections. Friend Billy Crystal paid tribute to him at the Emmy Awards, and later helped Williams' son, Zak, throw out the first pitch before Game 5 of the World Series while Williams' other children watched. Daughter Zelda got a tattoo in honor of her father. Gilbert Gottfried, another friend, remembered a ""generous"" man who was welcoming to his fellow comedians. ""To see Robin perform was an experience. He was more than a comedian. He was a comedy force of nature,"" he wrote on CNN.com. Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Fallon, Conan O'Brien and David Letterman, among others, also paid tribute to the comedian. David Letterman pays tribute to Robin Williams . Oscar-winning performer . Williams' long career was notable for his manic, improvisational comedy and his deeply felt acting performances. He won an Oscar for playing a therapist in the 1997 film ""Good Will Hunting."" A number of his other films, including ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""Patch Adams,"" were huge box-office hits. He was also active in a number of charitable causes and frequently took part in USO tours. Robin Williams: Full of demons, full of heart . On her Twitter feed, his daughter Zelda remembered her dad with a quote from Antoine De Saint-Exupery's ""The Little Prince."" ""In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night. ... You -- only you -- will have stars that can laugh."" Complete coverage on Robin Williams .

"(CNN) -- Chikungunya -- a tropical disease with a funny name that packs a wallop like having your bones crushed -- has finally taken up residence in the United States. Ever since the first local transmission of chikungunya was reported in the Americas late last year, health officials have been bracing for the arrival of the debilitating, mosquito-borne virus in the United States. Just seven months after the first cases were found in the Caribbean, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first locally acquired case of chikungunya in Florida. Even though chikungunya is not on the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System list, 31 states and two U.S. territories have reported cases of the disease since the beginning of the year. But only Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands reported locally acquired cases. All the other cases were travelers who were infected in countries where the virus was endemic and were diagnosed upon returning to the United States. That ended Thursday, when the CDC reported a man in Florida, who had not recently traveled outside the country, came down with the illness. As of right now, the Florida Department of Health confirmed there are at least two cases. One case is in Miami Dade County and the other is in Palm Beach County. Its arrival did not surprise the chair of the Florida Keys Mosquito Control Board. ""It was just a matter of when. We are prepared in the Keys and have been prepared for some time to deal with chikungunya,"" Steve Smith said. ""From what I am seeing, I'm sure there are more cases out there that we don't know about. It's really a matter of time."" The CDC is working closely with the Florida Department of Health to investigate how the patient came down with the virus. The CDC will also monitor for additional locally acquired U.S. cases in the coming weeks and months. The virus, which can cause joint pain and arthritis-like symptoms, has been on the U.S. public health radar for some time. Usually about 25 to 28 infected travelers bring it to the United States each year. But this new case represents the first time that mosquitoes themselves are thought to have transferred the disease within the continental United States . ""The arrival of chikungunya virus, first in the tropical Americas and now in the United States, underscores the risks posed by this and other exotic pathogens,"" said Roger Nasci, chief of CDC's Arboviral Diseases Branch. ""This emphasizes the importance of CDC's health security initiatives designed to maintain effective surveillance networks, diagnostic laboratories and mosquito control programs both in the United States and around the world."" The virus is not deadly, but it can be extremely painful, with symptoms lasting for weeks. Those with weak immune systems, such as the elderly, are more likely to suffer from the virus' side effects than those who are healthier. About 60% to 90% of those infected will have symptoms, says Nasci. People infected with chikungunya will often have severe joint pain, particularly in their hands and feet, and can also quickly get very high fevers. The good news, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, is that the United States is more sophisticated when it comes to controlling mosquitoes than many other nations and should be able to keep the problem under control. ""We live in a largely air-conditioned environment, and we have a lot of screening (window screens, porch screens),"" Shaffner said. ""So we can separate the humans from the mosquito population, but we cannot be completely be isolated."" Mosquito-borne virus worries CDC . Chikungunya was originally identified in East Africa in the 1950s. Then about 10 years ago, chikungunya spread to the Indian Ocean and India, and a few years later an outbreak in northern Italy sickened about 200 people. Now at least 74 countries plus the United States are reporting local transmission of the virus. The ecological makeup of the United States supports the spread of an illness such as this, especially in the tropical areas of Florida and other Southern states, according to the CDC. The other concern is the type of mosquito that carries the illness. Unlike most mosquitoes that breed and prosper outside from dusk to dawn, the chikungunya virus is most often spread to people by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which are most active during the day, which makes it difficult to use the same chemical mosquito control measures. These are the same mosquitoes that transmit the virus that causes dengue fever. The disease is transmitted from mosquito to human, human to mosquito and so forth. A female mosquito of this type lives three to four weeks and can bite someone every three to four days. Shaffner and other health experts recommend people remember the mosquito-control basics: . -- Use bug spray if you are going out, especially in tropical or wooded areas near water. -- Get rid of standing water in empty plastic pools, flower pots, pet dishes and gutters to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. -- Wear long sleeves and pants.","The first local cases of chikungunya arrived in Florida .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Secret Service offered only vague information in its first criminal filing in federal court about how deep accused fence-jumper Omar Gonzalez entered the White House, in contrast to the dramatic account of the intruder's dash through the building that was revealed by lawmakers Monday. In a sworn affidavit filed with the court on the night of the incident, Secret Service officer Daniel Hochman offered details based on his ""personal observations"" of Gonzalez's sprint inside the White House. In his account, Hochman described how he ""yelled"" at Gonzalez to stop. ""Instead, Omar Gonzalez ran toward the White House,"" Hochman continued. The officer then suggested that Gonzalez was subdued shortly after making his way through the North Portico doors of the White House. ""Moments later, Omar Gonzalez went through the north doors of the White House and entered the White House. Soon thereafter, inside the White House, Omar Gonzalez was apprehended by United States Secret Service Officers,"" Hochman said in the affidavit. As it turned out, Gonzalez made it much farther into the White House than the court filing described. The intruder was stopped in the East Room of the building, a law enforcement official told CNN Monday. Gonzalez appeared in a DC federal court Wednesday and pleaded not guilty on charges of unlawful entry while armed and two other charges. On the night of the incident, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN Secret Service officers apprehended Gonzalez ""just inside the North Portico doors. "" At a hearing of the House Oversight Committee Tuesday, Chairman Darrell Issa grilled Secret Service Director Julia Pierson on the accuracy of the affidavit on just how far Gonzalez penetrated the White House. ""The federal complaint said he was -- he was in fact apprehended in one place. Isn't it true he was apprehended further into the White House,"" Issa asked. Once it was apparent Pierson was not directly answering the question, Issa interjected. ""In fact, the federal complaint and the earlier reports were not accurate, Is that correct? Yes or no, please,"" Issa asked. ""I think the original complaint is accurate that Mr. Gonzalez scaled the fence,"" Pierson responded. Issa cut her off again. ""I want to know if we can rely on reports from your agency,"" Issa complained. A federal law enforcement official told CNN the information provided to reporters on the night of the intrusion was based on what was told to Secret Service spokesmen at that time. But the whereabouts of the fence-jumper's capture was not the only discrepancy that night. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-UT pressed Pierson on statements to the media that indicated Gonzalez was unarmed. On the night of the incident, Leary, the Secret Service spokesman, had told reporters Gonzalez was not carrying a weapon. But Hochman's affidavit from September 19 states Gonzalez ""carried a deadly or dangerous weapon,"" described as a Spyderco VG-10 black folding knife with a three and a half inch serrated blade. ""Why would the Secret Service put out an official press release saying that,"" Chaffetz asked about the agency's failure to disclose the knife found on Gonzalez. ""Did you call them back and say you got that wrong,"" Chaffetz continued. ""I have no knowledge of that,"" Pierson replied. ""Did you read the press release before it went out?"" Chaffetz asked. ""I have read the press release before it went out,"" Pierson answered. Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and Republican who is running for Congress in Maryland, said affidavits from agency officers are sometimes intentionally vague. ""Why give up free information"" to defense attorneys, Bongino said. But Bongino said Pierson's handling of the Gonzalez case is indicative of the ""small, insular group of managers"" in charge of the agency. During Pierson's testimony Tuesday, lawmakers noted her 30 years of service to the embattled agency. Bongino said Pierson's long tenure and promotion to director are more a reflection of what he described as the agency's practice of promoting from within. ""It's a reflection, sadly, of the cabal,"" Bongino said.","Secret Service provided vague details of fence jumping incident in initial affidavit .

"(CNN) -- Jonathan Gruber, who some have called an ""architect"" of Obamacare, spent his Tuesday being grilled by members of Congress for having described too candidly the deception involved in passing the bill. It was a useful hearing but only the beginning of holding accountable the ""experts"" who gave us this catastrophic law. The new Congress now has a much more important chance to demonstrate that deceiving the American people is unacceptable. Republican majorities in the House and Senate can and should use their authority to replace Doug Elmendorf as director of the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO is charged with providing nonpartisan economic analysis to Congress. This position gives the agency an outsized influence on policy, as reporters, commentators, ""fact checkers,"" and many members of Congress (most of whom should know better) treat CBO estimates -- or ""scores"" -- like trump cards in debates over legislation. In the Obamacare debate especially, the CBO projections proved vital and probably decisive. As Gruber explained in his now-infamous remarks, the very survival of the health care bill depended on how CBO scored its various provisions. ""The bill was written in a tortured way to make sure the CBO did not score the mandate as taxes,"" Gruber described. ""If CBO scored the mandate as taxes, the bill dies."" What Gruber didn't say is that Elmendorf's CBO, in essence, relied on Gruber's own model to do its scoring. The first page of CBO's technical description of its health insurance model thanks Gruber, and the document cites him many times. And Gruber actually sat on the CBO's panel of health advisers during at least some of the health care debate. (He says he doesn't remember if it overlapped with his time as a paid adviser to the Obama administration.) So when Gruber describes the deception involved in passing Obamacare, it included at the very least the CBO's acceptance of Gruber's ""tortured"" manipulations, and at worst the opening of CBO models to be adjusted by a paid agent of the White House's political goals. The agency needs a new director for the new Congress, one dedicated to the profound change required to produce honest and accurate scores. This is the first and perhaps most important step Congress can take to show it is dedicated to real change. The CBO is more responsible for giving us Obamacare than Jonathan Gruber is, and as culpable as Democrats in Congress or President Obama. CBO was critical to passing the bill, as Gruber attests, because it provided supporters the numbers they needed to justify their claims. Obamacare advocates said the law would lower the deficit by $109 billion over 10 years. They said it wouldn't cost American jobs. They said it would help the economy. The CBO score backed up those claims. And coming from the supposedly definitive source of economic analysis, that counted for a lot. But as we know now (and many of us knew then), it was all untrue. For one thing, before Obamacare was passed, the CBO didn't even consider the effects the law would have on the labor market. In other words, the agency scored a bill that dramatically changed costs for businesses and individuals, and it assumed no effect on employment or government revenue. In February, four years after Obamacare became law, the CBO updated its projections about the law's effect on the economy, and included the bombshell that it would result in the equivalent of 2.5 million fewer Americans with full-time jobs in 2024. Other economists predict an even larger impact on the economy. Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago estimated the law will reduce the size of the labor market by 3% -- the equivalent of approximately 4 million full-time jobs -- or almost double the impact estimated by the CBO. (The White House is actually trying to sell us on the idea that it's a good thing millions of people will leave the workforce or work less because of subsidies under Obamacare, which gives you some idea of how much it values work.) The CBO, for its part, now admits to Congress that Obamacare reduces government revenues. And an analysis by Republican staff for the Senate Budget Committee has concluded, based on CBO's projections, that the declines in employment and tax revenue mean Obamacare will increase the deficit by $131 billion over a 10-year period. So CBO's estimate was only off by a couple hundred billion. If the CBO had reported in early 2010 that Obamacare would result in the equivalent of 2.5 million fewer people working and would increase the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars, how many Democratic senators would have voted for the law? (Remember, the move to end debate and enact Obamacare in the Senate passed by one vote.) If not for CBO's misleading score, the bill would almost certainly not have become law. A responsible, honest agency would have said the bill was too complicated to score -- that there was simply no way for it to accurately predict how millions of businesses and individuals in an economy this complex would respond to a law as sweeping and convoluted as Obamacare. The challenge of economic prediction is daunting even for much simpler legislation. But instead, the CBO didn't even try to predict how the law would alter economic decisions (using ""dynamic"" scoring, as it should be required to do). Using its static models, the agency assumed key provisions would change no one's behavior. So the score was bogus from the start. Yet despite being proved flagrantly wrong in its predictions, the current staff at the CBO would do it the same way again today! The Republican majority should not even consider reappointing the same leadership at CBO. The Congress would essentially be asking to be Grubered again. In the long run, Congress should find a more accountable, more transparent system of economic analysis, such as getting the views of multiple ratings agencies in competition with each other, the success of which depends on accuracy over time. But in the meantime, we urgently need new leadership at the CBO to push for more accurate, dynamic scores and to be honest and upfront about what economists know and what they don't. This is a change Republicans can make immediately when the new Congress convenes in January and it is entirely within their control. It is one of the most consequential choices they will make. It certainly would be tragic if, after skewering Gruber, they turned around and reappointed another expert who gave us Obamacare.

"(CNN) -- At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- were killed by execution, disease, starvation and overwork under the Khmer Rouge's brutal rule from 1975 to 1979. Three of the ultra-Maoist regime's former leaders have been found guilty for crimes against community by a U.N.-backed tribunal. On Thursday, guilty verdicts were handed down to Nuon Chea, otherwise known as Brother Number Two, and Khieu Samphan, the one-time President of Democratic Kampuchea, as Cambodia was known. Kaing Guek Eav, alias Comrade Duch, the head of an infamous torture prison, was convicted of crimes against humanity in 2010. He was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in 2012, more than 30 years after the fall of the regime. Here's a timeline of the Khmer Rouge regime and the long path to bring its leaders to justice: . 1970: Marshal Lon Nol stages a coup, forcing Prince Norodom Sihanouk out of power. Sihanouk is aligned with the Khmer Rouge, an ultra-Maoist group building up a following in the countryside. April 17, 1975: The Khmer Rouge seize Phnom Penh, completing their taking over of the country. The city's inhabitants are forced to leave the capital, heading out to rural areas. Some two million people are forced out of Cambodia's urban centers. Late 1977: Fighting breaks out between Vietnam and Cambodia. May 25, 1978: Khmer Rouge purges East Zone. January 7, 1979: The Vietnamese take Phnom Penh, beginning 11 years of Vietnamese occupation. The Khmer Rouge move west. Some Cambodians celebrate January 7 as a liberation day from the Khmer Rouge, while others mark it as the start of Vietnamese occupation. 1979: A genocide tribunal in Phnom Penh finds Pol Pot and Ieng Sary guilty of genocide. Neither appeared in court or served any sentence . 1982: Triparty coalition government forms, consisting of Prince Sihanouk, who was exile in China, the Khmer Rouge and non-communist leader Son Sann to create the Triparty Coalition Government. Vietnam helps establish a new government led by Heng Samrin. 1990: Vietnamese troops withdraw from Cambodia. October 23, 1991: Paris peace talks. A peace accord among all Cambodian parties is signed. They approve holding a national election under the supervision of the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge boycott the polls and won't demobilize their forces. May 23-28, 1993: The U.N.-supervised elections are held. A royalist party lead by one of the king's sons, Ranariddh, wins a plurality and forms a coalition government with the Cambodian People's Party. Ranariddh and Hun Sen of the CPP are appointed co-prime minister. Khmer Rouge soldiers continue to wage guerrilla war. 1996: King Norodom Sihanouk pardons top cadre Ieng Sary's genocide sentence from the 1979 genocide tribunal. 1997: The Khmer Rouge tries Pol Pot for crimes allegedly committed within the regime after 1979. Cambodia asks the U.N. to help create a court to prosecute the surviving top leaders of the Khmer Rouge. 1998: Pol Pot dies. Civil war ends in Cambodia. 1999: Considered the end of the Khmer Rouge. 2001: Cambodia's National Assembly passes a law to create a court to try serious crimes committed during the Khmer Rouge regime. 2003: Agreement is reached with the U.N. on how the international community would help and participate in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. The pact was amended in 2004. June 2007: The court becomes fully operational. November 20, 2007: The pre-trial chamber opens its first public hearing on an appeal by Duch, the Khmer Rouge head of the S-21 prison, where some 14,000 people died. July 26, 2010: Duch is found guilty for war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture, and sentenced to 35 years in prison. February 3, 2012: Duch's sentence extended to life in prison. August 7, 2014: Nuon Chea, otherwise known as Brother Number Two, and Khieu Samphan, the one-time President of Democratic Kampuchea, are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court on Monday turned away an appeal from an Ohio judge who wanted to post a copy of the biblical Ten Commandments in his courtroom. The case was among hundreds disposed of by the justices, who returned to start a new term after a three-month recess. Another separate, high-profile petition involved a death row prisoner challenging his conviction in the murder of an 11-year-old Florida girl. The Ohio case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which had successfully prevented Richland County Common Pleas Judge James DeWeese from posting another copy of the Ten Commandments. He first hung the well-known passage from the Bible in 2000, alongside a copy of the Constitution's Bill of Rights, and referred to both as ""the rule of law,"" according to court documents. The Supreme Court five years ago agreed the display violated the Constitution's ban against ""establishment"" of religion, and ordered the poster removed. But the judge soon tacked up another display, called ""Philosophies of Law in Conflict,"" that included the Ten Commandments in a section called ""Moral Absolutes."" A separate section called ""Moral Relativism"" included sources such as the Humanist Manifesto. It was that poster the justices Monday again rejected for public viewing in a government building. DeWeese's attorney, Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice had urged the justices to intervene. ""It's time for the high court to set the record straight: The display by Judge DeWeese is a constitutionally permissible method of explaining his legal and moral philosophy, the same philosophy embraced by our founders,"" he said. The ACLU countered the poster was a clear expression of the judge's religious views, and a clear violation of the long-standing principle of separation of church and state. In a separate appeal, the justices asked Florida to weigh in with a response from an appeal by death row inmate Joseph Smith. The former mechanic was convicted in the horrific murder of Carlie Jane Brucia of Sarasota, who was abducted from near a car wash in 2004. Dramatic surveillance video from a nearby security camera showed the girl being confronted by a man later identified as Smith, who was on probation at the time. The man then grabbed Carlie and brought her to his car. That footage aired on television around the country, and was used by the FBI and local police to launch a desperate search. Smith was later convicted and sentenced to death. The tragedy prompted congressional legislation, Carlie's Law, which tightens parole rules for sex offenders, while also creating an alert system to notify parents when criminal activity is taking place nearby. The high court had rejected an earlier appeal from Smith in June, but the inmate filed another federal claim, saying his right to confront witnesses at trial was violated when prosecutors introduced DNA evidence implicating him. A panel of experts talking about the forensic work did not include the lab technician who actually performed the test. State courts have been at odds on whether such non-testimonial evidence is acceptable, particularly in capital cases. The justices last week accepted review of a case from Illinois raising similar issues. The Florida case is Smith v. Florida (09-10755). The Ohio Ten Commandments case is DeWeese v. ACLU (10-1512).","An Ohio judge wanted to post the Ten Commandments in his courtroom .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps there are still some people asking, ""Craig Ferguson who?"" Too bad. They've been missing something special. The ""Late Late Show"" host shuffles off the stage Friday having hosted an eccentric decade of shows, a program that was often under the radar but always quietly, distinctively ... Craig Ferguson. Put aside the deliberately absurd characters like Secretariat and Geoff the Robot, or the award of a Golden Mouth Organ to guests who knew how to play the harmonica, or the silly theme song. Every talk show has its shtick. What made Ferguson's talk show so different from the others was his determination to go off-script. Not since the heyday of Dick Cavett, or maybe even Jack Paar, had a network host so willingly put himself on the high wire. Ferguson's chops were most obvious right at the beginning of the show, when he did his loose, unstructured monologue. Sometimes he fell flat. Other times he was positively riveting, as when he eulogized his father and mother or gleefully announced his newly gained American citizenship. Or, particularly, the 2007 night he spent more than 12 minutes discussing his alcoholism. Ferguson had no truck with the ""late-night wars"" -- he was friendly with Jimmy Fallon and Conan O'Brien, and Jay Leno will be on his final show -- and he was willing to follow his guests wherever they took him. He started interviews by ripping up the blue cards other hosts depend on, and if his guests wanted to talk about religion and existence -- like Stephen Fry, who was the only guest one night in 2013 -- or nothing in particular -- like frequent visitor Kristen Bell -- he just went along with it. He even credited a guest, Desmond Tutu, with leading him to leave the show, in the best possible way. ""Desmond Tutu saying 'Be as authentically crazy as you are.' It was kind of like God saying 'Just be as crazy as you like.' I felt weirdly released by that,"" he told an audience Monday at Los Angeles' Paley Center. ""Then, ultimately, that leads to me not doing the show."" It's a typically unpredictable finish for an unpredictable performer. But then, Ferguson has often surprised. Little was expected of a guy formerly known as Mr. Wick on ""The Drew Carey Show,"" but Ferguson cut his teeth in Edinburgh's fringe scene, notably as a character named ""Bing Hitler."" He had range and smarts. (Fergusonian tangent: Ferguson was also a punk rock drummer, and the singer in his band was Peter Capaldi. Capaldi is now known as Doctor Who but -- for discerning fans -- is the scathingly profane Malcolm Tucker of ""The Thick of It."" Ferguson, of course, did a whole show pegged to ""Doctor Who"" just because he wanted to.) David Letterman, the ""Late Late Show's"" producer and the man Ferguson called ""boss,"" knew he had something special. ""His show was unlike any other late night show, and I'm telling you, to be unique in the world of television -- virtually impossible,"" Letterman said when Ferguson made his announcement. British actor James Corden will take over in March. At the Paley event, Ferguson told him not to worry. ""I've set the bar very low,"" he said. Not true. It's more like he set the bar on the other side of the room and then limboed under it, did pull-ups with it and threw it like a javelin, letting it land where it may. Ferguson has been quiet about his future. He's been hosting ""Celebrity Name Game,"" a syndicated game show, but it seems like there's room for something a little crazier, a little more unusual. Who knows what tomorrow may bring? After all, tomorrow's just a future yesterday.","Craig Ferguson's final ""Late Late Show"" is Friday .
Ferguson has been unusual host, letting his show wander .
He's also been forthright and honest in his monologues ."
"(CNN) -- Once again, we confront the specter of a school day bathed in bloodshed. A 16-year-old, Alex Hribal, allegedly takes two long knives into a crowded corridor and sends 20 classmates and an adult to the hospital with grave injuries. Arraigned as an adult, Hribal looks all too familiar: thin, scared, vacant-eyed. He looks younger than his years as he is manacled and maneuvered into a police car. We have not yet filled in a motive. Hribal's attorney says, ""He worked well in groups, and this happened. So there's a reason for it -- that's what I'm saying. And we have to get to the bottom of that."" And because it was knives, not guns, it was -- thankfully -- not a massacre. But much about the attack is familiar. Fifteen years ago, my doctoral students and I devoted two years to studying rampage shootings in American high schools in response to the epidemic epitomized by the 1999 Columbine High School shootings. To try to understand what motivates school attackers, we interviewed everyone who had any knowledge of two episodes -- one near Paducah, Kentucky, and the other outside Jonesboro, Arkansas -- that took place in the late '90s. Congress wanted to know about the circumstances that led to these outbursts in communities that have no experience of murderous violence. What we found at the center of the stories we followed were young men who looked a lot like Hribal. Rampage attacks happen in safe, relatively isolated communities. Indeed, they are most common in small rural towns where the biggest public ""stage"" is the local high school, the place the community gathers for events such as football games on Saturdays and everybody knows your name. The perpetrators are often described in the media as loners, but they are not. They are most often ""failed joiners,"" people who work overtime to ingratiate themselves into cliques that reject them. But they don't stop trying. Fading into the background, close to anonymous, but rarely ever thought of as troublemakers, the protagonists look for ways to gain acceptance and attention. They may act like clowns; they sometimes bully other children; they steal -- all to seek the approval of social groups that continuously deny them recognition. In the instances we studied, all that effort starts to pay off the day they start talking about killing people. Suddenly they are the objects of attention. Everyone pivots toward them. They may even find their ""friends"" goading them. Michael Carneal, the shooter in Kentucky, resembled Hribal. Slight and short, he was a freshman who simply could not cut it in the world of high school peers. He was socially awkward and a bit of prankster, but he wasn't a loner. Carneal tried to gain the friendship of many different social groups and finally landed in the laps of the Goths, boys who wore satanic garb and spoke in dark tones but who were actually among the smart ones. They told Carneal that the pistol he stole from home wasn't good enough, that he should come to school in a trench coat sporting a shotgun. Carneal was so eager to gain their approval that he followed these instructions almost to the letter. Three kids huddled together in a prayer group were murdered, one was paralyzed from the waist down and a fifth was hit in the arms, her athletic career ended in an instant. But when Carneal shot these innocents, what was uppermost in his mind was not that he was going to kill kids but rather how this bold act would help him gain traction with the Goths. They would see him as notorious and dangerous rather than a loser who was awkward and boring. He told the forensic psychiatrist who interviewed him after his arrest that he had found a route to popularity. The Goths would visit his house and invite him to their homes. He would have friends once he proved himself worthy of their respect. We don't know yet if the Murrysville, Pennsylvania, suspect fits this profile. The surprise that so many of his schoolmates have expressed comes close to what teachers told us about Carneal: that they could have named 50 others who might have committed this kind of mayhem before they got to him. The son of a lawyer and a homemaker, until the previous year a good student, with no obvious interest in guns, Carneal was not on their radar screen. But many teenagers avoided school on the Monday that Carneal murdered his classmates because they knew something bad was coming. One thing we should be grateful for: The attacker in Pennsylvania was armed only with knives. Had he had access to the weapons Carneal had, we would have seen dozens die rather than suffer these wounds. Knife attacks happen in countries such as Japan where guns are hard to access, and they have been lethal. Just not as deadly as a loaded high-capacity automatic weapon that requires a split second to gun down dozens of people. This is small comfort in Murrysville.","Katherine Newman has studied school rampages, says stabbing attack has echoes of them .

"(CNN) -- Yes, trying to lift 5,000 pounds of cargo to orbit is rocket science -- and it's very hard. Early Tuesday evening, an Antares rocket, built by Orbital Sciences Corp., and its Cygnus cargo ship exploded almost immediately after launch. Yet as disappointing as this incident is, it should not be treated as a sign that NASA's partnerships with the private sector are flawed. This was a technical error, and it should be treated as one. After all, this was only the fifth launch of an Antares rocket, and there is a higher risk of explosion with relatively new rockets than there is with those that have been used for many years, where the bugs have been worked out earlier, often through failures. Antares, as one of several new rockets being commercially developed, signals a new, important way of doing business in space that must be given the chance to mature. Since the 1950s, rocketry has been the purview of the federal government. Only through what may eventually be seen as fortuitous poor planning -- building an International Space Station and then canceling the shuttle transportation program originally intended as the taxi to said station -- has the private sector really stepped in, albeit with an anchor tenant. ""Fix lift,"" meaning bringing down cost-per-pound to orbit and being able to launch on demand (or at least close to it) has been the No. 1 recommendation in the spate of space studies that have littered Washington since the 1980s. Working with the private sector is nothing new. Indeed, development of a product, sector or even geographic region -- which has been most successful when the government invests seed money and then turns development over to the private sector -- has been going on for decades. Back in 1925, the Air Mail Act, under which companies were paid for transporting the mail, provided the private sector an incentive to develop commercial airplanes. In addition, government forts and soldiers provided protection so the railways could be built and the West developed. Yet until recently, space has been anomalous in its development, remaining tied to government funding, bureaucracy and politics, and consequently stifling incentive and entrepreneurship. That has been changing. Orbital Sciences is one of two companies hired to take cargo to the ISS after the shuttle fleet was retired. The other is Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. Both companies developed rockets to carry out that task. Tuesday's ill-fated flight was to be Orbital's third in a series of eight flights under a $1.9 billion contract with NASA. The first two were successful. SpaceX will fly its next contracted flight in December. Hiring private companies to provide launch services is a new way of doing business for NASA, one that should be encouraged and continued. It is the way of the future in space given that NASA budget's has not kept up with external and self-imposed programmatic expectations since the Apollo years. If low Earth orbit launches can be taken care of by the private sector, government funding to NASA can be used in pursuit of more ambitious goals, including human spaceflight. Meanwhile, low Earth orbit launches by private companies will become routine, although we're not there yet. After the Antares explosion, Orbital Sciences stock reportedly fell about 15% in after- hours trading. But while investor concern is understandable to a degree, it also reflects the public's view -- and so investors' view -- of space travel as routine. The reliability figures for old standby rockets makes it seem that way, but new products have bugs to be worked out. Problems are expected and (barely) tolerated in day-to-day technology, but apparently not in rockets. Luckily, there were no injuries from exploding rocket debris, though there was damage on the ground that will need repairing. And the loss of the Antares cargo posed no danger to the crew of the International Space Station where it was headed. There was nothing critical on board, and an unmanned Russian Progress spacecraft successfully launched shortly after the Antares failure, carrying almost three tons of food, fuel and crew supplies. Teams at NASA and Orbital Sciences are already busily at work determining the cause of the failure. In the meantime, a little show of support for American entrepreneurship seems in order. Because when they find the cause of the failure, they will fix it and move forward.","Antares rocket explosion a technical error, writes Joan Johnson-Freese .
Risk of explosion is higher with relatively new rockets like these, she says .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court will not prosecute Israel for a 2010 raid on a Gaza-bound aid ship that left eight Turks and an American dead, even though there's reason to believe war crimes were committed, a prosecutor with the Netherlands-based court said Thursday. While conceding that war crimes may have been committed in the botched raid, the potential cases ""would not be of 'sufficient gravity' to justify further action by the ICC,"" prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said. ""In the final analysis, I have, therefore, concluded that the legal requirements under the Rome Statute to open an investigation have not been met and I am announcing that the preliminary examination has been closed,"" Bensouda said. The case centers on an attempt by groups including the Cyprus-based Free Gaza Movement and a pro-Palestinian Turkish charity to deliver goods to the Palestinian territory despite an Israeli blockade in May 2010. Activists organized a flotilla and departed Cyprus for Gaza, hoping to raise awareness of what it called Israel's ""illegal siege on"" the territory. But Israeli commandos raided one of the ships, the Mavi Marmara, because it violated the Israeli-imposed blockade on the Palestinian territory. Eight Turks and an American citizen of Turkish descent were killed in the raid. Israel said at the time that its troops fired only after they were attacked with knives and other objects after boarding the ship. The Mavi Marmara raid damaged relations between Turkey and Israel, two close allies of the United States that had previously enjoyed military, economic and intelligence-sharing ties. Last year, U.S. President Barack Obama helped broker a telephone apology for the raid from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to his Turkish counterpart. Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the militant group Hamas seized control of the Palestinian territory. It was designed to stop the smuggling of arms into the territory, the Israeli government said. But activists say Israel's embargo of goods into Gaza from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. Bensouda started examining the case last year at the urging of the Comoros, an island nation off Africa's eastern coast. Though the flotilla departed from Cyprus, the Mavi Marmara was registered in the Comoros. CNN's Ivan Watson, Gul Tuysuz and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Potential war crimes not of ""sufficient gravity"" to litigate, a prosecutor says .

"MONTECITO, California (CNN) -- One of three major wildfires burning in southern California appears to be ""human caused,"" a spokesman for the state's fire agency said Sunday. Investigators have eliminated ""all accidental causes"" of the fire that has destroyed 210 homes and injured two people in Santa Barbara County since Thursday, spokesman Doug Lannon said. ""We need the public's help in identifying any activity in or around the afternoon of November 13,"" Lannon said. The fire has burned 1,940 acres, including a monastery and several mansions in the Montecito community, where celebrities, including Oprah Winfrey, have homes. It was 80 percent contained Sunday, the state fire agency said.  Watch expensive homes go up in flames » . Authorities believe the fire started in the Tea Garden Estate, a privately owned multi-acre property, about one mile north of Santa Barbara's exclusive Westmont College. The two other major fires burning Sunday were in Los Angeles County and in Orange and Riverside counties east of Los Angeles. The three blazes have destroyed hundreds of homes, scorched more than 35,000 acres and forced more than 10,000 people to flee their homes since Thursday, authorities said. Authorities on Sunday were searching the wreckage of nearly 500 mobile homes destroyed in Sylmar, one of the areas burned by the fire in Los Angeles County. As of early Sunday afternoon, a third of the mobile homes had been searched, and ""no human remains have been found,"" according to Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Michael Moore. Police had not received any reports of people missing from the park. Moore said 134 residents had been accounted for, and that the others should check in with city authorities. Los Angeles County Coroner Ed Winter said authorities believe ""most of the people from this mobile home park were evacuated,"" and that the search was precautionary. The Los Angeles County blaze erupted late Friday in the steep terrain of the Angeles National Forest on the outskirts of Sylmar, about 20 miles north of Los Angeles.  See images from the Los Angeles County fire » . That fire has burned more than 10,000 acres and is about 40 percent contained, California fire officials said Sunday.

Firefighters were struggling to contain the third blaze, in Orange and Riverside counties, said Lynette Round, a spokeswoman for Orange County Fire Authority. iReport.com: 'Insurmountable' wall of flames looms . Firefighters were hoping that strong winds in southern California would die down Sunday, helping them to quell the blazes. ""If the winds die down it will give the firefighters an upper hand on fighting this,"" Round told CNN on Sunday morning. ""It is a wind-driven fire and with those gusty winds up to 25 miles an hour, it's giving the firefighters a really difficult time. It's hopscotched throughout the county."" Round said 168 homes were destroyed or damaged in the Orange County area. The so-called Triangle Freeway Complex Fire had also damaged a building at a high school, Round said. That blaze, which burned more than 23,700 acres, is 19 percent contained, according to California fire officials.  Watch residents as fire approaches their homes » . Winds -- which have joined with low humidity and unseasonably high temperatures to help strengthen the fires -- were gusting up to 80 mph Saturday. The high temperature in Los Angeles reached 92 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared states of emergency for the affected counties after the fire damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and closed major freeways. The move frees up any state resources needed for fire-fighting, and makes the counties eligible for federal assistance grants.

"SANTA BARBARA, California (CNN) -- A wildfire that has engulfed dozens of homes and displaced thousands of people kept roaring in Southern California on Friday, as fire officials acknowledged they're not sure how much luck they'll have slowing the blaze. Smoke from a wind-fueled wildfire casts a glow over Santa Barbara. ""We have a lot of resources on the line -- our folks are working their hearts out,"" Joe Waterman of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection told reporters. An estimated 30,000 residents of Santa Barbara County have been ordered to evacuate because of the blaze, which has scorched more than 3,500 acres and damaged or destroyed at least 75 homes, emergency officials said. Santa Barbara County Fire Chief Tom Franklin said the fire has displayed a ""roller coaster effect"" because of the changing weather patterns. ""It starts off, looks kind of calm, thinking we're getting the upper hand, turns out we're not,"" Franklin said.

"(CNN) -- As far as fans are concerned, ""Gravity"" is out of this world. The Sandra Bullock/George Clooney space thriller set an October opening weekend record, surpassing ""Paranormal Activity 3's"" $52.6 million debut in 2011, according to EW. Many critics also hailed the film, which centers around characters being set adrift in space. But some in the science community have taken exception to some of the facts presented. Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson took to Twitter over the weekend to offer several ""Mysteries of #Gravity,"" including ""The film #Gravity should be renamed 'Angular Momentum.' "" He points what the film got wrong, from the fact that Bullock's hair didn't free float to why she, as a medical doctor, was on the mission to start with. So here we offer 5 things that couldn't happen in ""Gravity."" Word to the wise: Stop reading now if you have an issue with spoilers (Seriously. You have been warned). 1. The way the shuttle travels . NASA expert Michael A. Interbartolo III didn't even have to wait for the film to come out to dispute this. When the trailer premiered, he wrote that the relative motion of the shuttle in the film appears to be off for the chain of events that follow. ""The way I am seeing it, the shuttle was wings level, payload bay up (Z), right wing into the orbital velocity vector (X direction of travel), nose in Y,"" wrote Interbartolo, who said he flew the shuttle in Mission Control for 11 years. ""The Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris [MMOD] (though most were not really micro Meteoroid) impact puts it into a roll about Y with it still traveling in the velocity vector X, and why are the Forward and Aft reaction control jets not firing to damp the ramp since they were intact in the trailer?"" Translation for you non-science types out there: It's more movie magic than actual science that has the shuttle getting smacked with debris and then heading in the direction it is set. Sandra Bullock keeps defying gravity with her career . 2. Rendezvousing in space is not as easy -- or as quick -- as the film makes it appear . Bullock plays Ryan Stone, a medical engineer on her first mission in space who gets set adrift after an accident. Part of the action involves her trying to make her way back to a fellow astronaut, Clooney's Matt Kowalski. But according to Interbartolo, it's a wonder that Clooney's character doesn't get ""shredded"" by all the debris floating around after the incident, let alone that the pair manage to link up again. ""If it is just her and Clooney, assuming she somehow got back to him after being flung away on the (Remote Manipulator System) free floating trying to get to the space station without a vehicle, that seems unlikely, unless the two orbits just magically intersect at the exact right time for them to be anywhere near the (International Space Station),"" he said. What Buzz Aldrin thinks of 'Gravity' 3. Kowalski's equipment is outdated . Kowalski flies around on a way-cool jet pack that helps him get to Stone when she is in need. Writing for WRAL's science blog, NASA/JPL Solar System Ambassador program volunteer Tony Rice notes that ""The Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) Clooney's character jets around on in the opening scenes does exist but was used only on three early shuttle missions and not since 1984. ""You can see space flown MMUs today hanging above space-flown shuttle orbiters at the Air and Space Museum and Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex,"" Rice wrote. ""The MMU was capable only of short bursts to move astronauts around the shuttle, not crossing distances portrayed in the film and certainly not in the time presented. But it was certainly a cool way to get Bullock and Clooney into the second act."" Read this story or we give away the ending . 4. Bullock's astronaut is way more adept than she should be . After all the space walking, being flung around and dodging debris, Bullock's Stone is still able to navigate not just one but two spacecraft from other countries: a Russian Soyuz and a Chinese Shenzhou. It's amazing, given that Stone points out that she was not the best in training on the United States spacecraft. ""She handles both ships with surprising deftness considering she was only lightly trained on the Soyuz and not at all on the Shenzhou,"" Jeffrey Kluger wrote for Time magazine. ""And throughout the movie, she and Clooney spend a fair bit of time getting whacked around in space, grabbing onto this or that rail or tether on the shuttle or ISS only at the last second to avoid pinwheeling off into the void. In truth, pressurized space gloves are murderously hard to manipulate, providing only limited grip at best and leaving astronauts' hands cold and very painful after a day of work. Making the kinds of one-handed Cirque du Soleil catches Clooney and Bullock accomplish would be impossible."" How Bullock prepared for her role . 5. The Hubble, the International Space Station and a Chinese space station are not neighbors . In the film, Bullock just needs to hop from space station to space station in order to find a refuge from debris and to make it home to Earth. But as the New York Times pointed out, that's not as easy as it looks. Photos: Sandra Bullock: America's sweetheart . ""As we recall from bitter memory, the Hubble and the space station are in vastly different orbits,"" Dennis Overbye wrote. ""Getting from one to the other requires so much energy that not even space shuttles had enough fuel to do it. The telescope is 353 miles high, in an orbit that keeps it near the Equator; the space station is about 100 miles lower, in an orbit that takes it far north, over Russia."" ""To have the movie astronauts Matt Kowalski (Mr. Clooney) and Ryan Stone (Ms. Bullock) zip over to the space station would be like having a pirate tossed overboard in the Caribbean swim to London."" The film's director, Alfonso CuarÃ³n, seemed fully prepared for the criticism after ""Gravity's"" release. ""This is not a documentary,"" the director told collectSPACE.com. ""It is a piece of fiction.""","Fans love ""Gravity,"" but scientists have found some flaws in the film .
Space walking is not as easy as the movie makes it look .
Bullock's character is very skillful ."
"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan has carried out its first executions since lifting a moratorium on the death penalty in terrorism cases following this week's deadly attack on a school in Peshawar. Convicted militants Arshad Mehmood and Aqil, who went by the alias Dr. Usman, were hanged on Friday, according to Pakistani military officials and sources from the Faisalabad District Jail where the militants were being held. Details of their crimes were not immediately available. The executions were the country's first civilian hangings since late 2008, according to Amnesty International and Pakistani media. On Tuesday, members of the Pakistani Taliban scaled the walls of the Army Public School and Degree College and killed at least 145 people -- 132 children, 10 school staff members and three soldiers, the Pakistani military said. More than 100 were injured, many with gunshot wounds. Troops pushed through the complex building by building and killed the seven militants, military spokesman Gen. Asim Bajwa said. The school massacre prompted widespread revulsion across Pakistan. A day after the massacre, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif lifted a moratorium on the death penalty for terrorism cases. In an email, the Taliban said it attacked the school to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by soldiers in tribal areas. It accused the students at the army school of ""following the path of their fathers and brothers to take part in the fight against the tribesmen"" nationwide.

"(CNN) -- A street party turned into a violent melee that injured six police officers in a California beach community Saturday night. About 15,000 people -- many of them students from nearby University of California, Santa Barbara -- crowded the streets of Isla Vista for the annual ""Deltopia"" celebration when ""a major disturbance broke out,"" according to a news release from the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office. It turned ugly when a UCSB police officer was ""hit in the head with a backpack that contained large bottles of alcohol,"" causing a ""significant head injury,"" the release said. A large crowd threw rocks, bricks and bottles at police officers who were arresting the person suspected of hitting the officer, it said. A ""major disturbance, emergency situation"" was declared, and law enforcement officers from nearby Ventura County responded to help the Santa Barbara County deputies already on the scene, the release said. ""Chemical agents and less lethal foam projectiles were deployed to disperse the crowds."" Five more officers -- Santa Barbara County deputies -- were injured, including one who was hit in the face with a brick, and two hit in the hand with bottles, the sheriff said. In all, more than two dozen people were treated at hospitals for injuries. Stop signs were torn down, small fires ignited and property damaged, including several police vehicles, before order was restored early Sunday, the sheriff's office said. At least 18 people were arrested in connection with the disturbance, while another 80 or so were arrested at other times during the party, the sheriff's office said.","About 15,000 people attended ""Deltopia"" party near Santa Barbara, California .

"(CNN) -- Tiffany Sessions is presumed dead, and she's been missing for more years than she lived, but her family and Florida authorities continue to hold out hope that they'll find the killer. On Thursday, Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell announced that authorities believe the ""long journey"" may be nearing its end, as it's ""highly, highly probable"" that Paul Eugene Rowles, a convicted sexual predator who died in prison last year, is the prime suspect in the quarter-century-old case. In February 1989, the blond-haired, brown-eyed Sessions, a junior at the University of Florida, donned red sweatpants and a white Aspen sweatshirt, put on her Walkman and went for her routine hourlong jog down Gainesville's main street toward a dirt trail that cut through the woods. Normally, her roommate would accompany her, but on that day, she had to study and Sessions jogged alone. The 20-year-old economics major never came back, and aside from witnesses who saw a woman resembling Sessions walking before dusk, Sessions left no trace -- no clothing, no Walkman, not even her gold Rolex watch. Rowles lived in the area at the time, and Darnell described him as a man with a ""horrible history of violent crimes against women -- murder, rape, kidnapping."" While there won't likely be a DNA connection, authorities feel circumstantial evidence is overwhelming, she said. Rowles was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder when he died last year. Speaking before the backdrop of a wooded area in Gainesville where murder victim Elizabeth Foster's body was found in 1992, Darnell told reporters a dig was conducted a week and a half ago because the area was a known ""dump site"" for Rowles' victims. In 2012, DNA tied Rowles to Foster's disappearance. Police unsuccessfully tried to interview Rowles before he died, but after his death, they gathered items from his cell, including a journal entry on a calendar that read ""2/9/89"" -- the date Sessions disappeared -- with ""No. 2"" scrawled on both sides of the notation. Police believe it's an indication that Sessions was Rowles' second victim. ""It may not be a smoking gun, but it's close,"" said the missing woman's father, Patrick Sessions. According to police and the family, other factors connect Rowles to Sessions' disappearance. He delivered scaffolding to a construction project along Sessions' jogging path and didn't work the night of her disappearance, for example. Arrest in 40-year-old murder case . ""He was in this community. He murdered in this community,"" Darnell said. Darnell asked the media to distribute photos of Rowles at different points in his life, study the timeline of his life and crimes and ""go back in time 25 years."" She also encouraged anyone with information about Rowles -- no matter how trivial it may seem -- to call 352-384-3323. Authorities are offering $1,000 for any information leading to an arrest. ""We want to have this last piece of conclusive connection so the family can at least have some peace,"" the sheriff said. ""There's no risk. He's dead. Thank goodness he's dead."" The missing woman's mother, Hilary Sessions, appeared at the press conference with the sheriff, at times smiling and optimistic, at other times teary. She thanked numerous people for their help over the years and conceded that police were ""searching for a very small needle in a very big haystack."" Still, she clearly had hope. ""She's my masterpiece,"" Hilary Sessions said. ""It would be nice to be able to put her to rest after all these years."" Patrick Sessions -- who, like some of the law enforcement officers on the scene, wore a baseball cap saying, ""The search for Tiffany Sessions"" -- encouraged anyone with the even ""the vaguest information that we can use"" to come forward and let authorities assess whether the information is useful. ""This is for real. This is our chance to close this case,"" he said. Taken: The coldest case ever solved . Senior couple charged in decades old cold cases .

"(Mental Floss) -- If you've ever collected baseball cards, comic books, stamps, or maybe those limited edition commemorative plates, you understand the concept of the ""Holy Grail"" item. It's that last, hard-to-find, incredibly rare, usually expensive piece that you have to have before you can officially say your collection is complete. If you're a collector of vintage home video game cartridges (or ""carts""), sometimes that can mean paying a pretty penny for the pièce de résistance. 1. Stadium Events (Nintendo Entertainment System) Price Range: $13,000 -- $41,300; $10,000 for the box alone . Why So Expensive?: Stadium Events was released by Bandai in 1987 as one of the few games available in America that was made for the company's Family Fun Fitness mat, a soft, plastic controller you walked, ran, and jumped on to make the characters move. Nintendo bought the rights to the game and the Fitness mat in 1988 and re-released them as World Class Track Meet and the Power Pad controller. To avoid consumer confusion, Nintendo pulled all copies of Stadium Events from shelves and had them destroyed, but not before approximately 200 carts had already been sold. Of those 200, collectors believe that only 10 to 20 complete copies of the game exist today, making them a real rarity. Stadium Events recently made headlines with two high-profile eBay sales. A North Carolina woman was cleaning out her garage and found an old Nintendo and a handful of games, including Stadium Events. She put them up on eBay without high expectations and was amazed to see the bids steadily climb up to $13,105. While the game itself is valuable, the winning bidder was most interested in the cardboard box it came in. Since most kids threw the box away after tearing open a new game, intact boxes for any game are really hard to come by, but especially so for Stadium Events. Empty Stadium Event boxes have been known to sell for $10,000 alone. After hearing of the success of this eBay seller, a man in Kansas dug up a factory-sealed copy of the game that he thought was worthless. However, his game became only the second known sealed copy in existence. He'd purchased the game in 1987, but could never find the Fitness mat to go with it. It was still sealed because he'd meant to return it. When his eBay auction ended on February 26, 2010, the game sold for an amazing $41,300. The same game repackaged by Nintendo, World Class Track Meet, generally sells for less than $3 on eBay. Mental Floss: 6 people who accidentally found a fortune . 2. 1990 Nintendo World Championships (NES) Price Range: Gray: $4,000 -- $6,100; Gold: $15,000 -- $21,000 . Why So Expensive?: In 1990, Nintendo held a 30-city gaming tournament to find the best player in the world. Players had to get the best score in demo versions of three games -- Super Mario Bros., Rad Racer, and Tetris -- all within a six-minute time limit. At the end of each city's tournament, the winners of each of three age groups were given special gray Championship cartridges exactly like those used in the competition, which means only 90 of these cartridges were distributed. The gold version was sent out to those who won a promotional contest in the pages of Nintendo Power magazine. Only 26 gold games were produced, so they're especially hard to find and command a higher price today. 3. Nintendo Campus Challenge (NES) Price Range: $14,000 -- $20,100 . Why So Expensive?: In the early 1990s, Nintendo held competitions on college campuses and at popular Spring Break destinations. Like the World Championships, players had six minutes to play for high scores on demo versions of Super Mario Bros. 3, PinBot, and Dr. Mario. Most copies of the game were destroyed after the competition ended, but one Nintendo employee kept his cart and sold it to Rob Walters at a garage sale in 2006. This garage sale is legendary among retrogamers, as Rob bought all kinds of NES Holy Grails for only $1,000. By the time he re-sold everything, he'd made 50 times that. Part of that $50,000 was the Campus Challenge cartridge, which went for $14,000. Shortly after, the buyer of the cart turned around and sold it on eBay for $20,100. As far as anyone knows, it's the only copy of the game in the world. 4. Atlantis II (Atari 2600) Price Range: $5,000 -- $6,000 . Why So Expensive?: It's never mentioned in the same breath as Pac-Man or Donkey Kong, but Atlantis was a pretty popular game in 1982. The gameplay was similar to Missile Command, with players defending their base from overhead attack by enemy ships. The developer held a tournament called Destination Atlantis, where players were invited to send in photos of their TV screens displaying their high scores. The best players were then sent Atlantis II, a special edition of the game that featured faster enemy ships worth fewer points, making it harder to get a high score, but easier to determine the true champions. Because this version was not mass produced, its pretty rare today. But if you find a copy of the original Atlantis at a garage sale, it might be a good idea to pick it up anyway. The competition cart had the exact same colorful label of the regular Atlantis, but had a small, white sticker slapped on the front that read ""Atlantis II."" The label was easily peeled off, so a quick Google search will show you how to determine if you bought a $3 Atari game or a $6,000 one. Mental Floss: 8 video game lawsuits . 5. Air Raid (Atari 2600) Price Range: $1,000 -- $3,000 . Why So Expensive?: Air Raid is a bit of an enigma for Atari fans. Some say it was the one and only game produced by a company called ""Menavision"" (or perhaps ""Menovision""). The game is so shrouded in mystery, it can't even be verified that ""Air Raid"" is its official title -- there's no name on the label. The name was based on the gameplay, which is similar to Atlantis and Missile Command, and by the picture on the label of a city being attacked by flying saucers, jets, and helicopters. This strange cartridge appeared around 1984 in a bright blue ""T-handle"" casing that is very different from the standard, square, black Atari carts sold in North America, but is similar in style to those sold in Brazil. Furthermore, while a few second-hand copies have been sold, no one can ever say they were the original owner. The mystery, as well as the fact there are only 12 known copies, make it a must-have for serious Atari collectors. 6. Star Wars Ewok Adventure (Atari 2600) Price: $1,680 . Why So Expensive?: Advertised in Parker Brothers' 1983 retail catalog as Revenge of the Jedi: Game I but affectionately known as Ewok Adventure, the cart became legendary for never being sold. In the game, players took control of an Ewok and flew a hang glider over the forest moon of Endor in an attempt to blow up an Imperial base. You could avoid or kill enemy Stormtroopers, Speeder Bikes, or Imperial AT-ST Walkers, or you could instead commandeer these vehicles to take out the base. The game was shot down by Parker Brothers' marketing department, which felt the controls were too hard to master, so it was never produced. The game's designer, Larry Gelberg, gave the one and only known prototype copy to a friend's son, who later sold it for $1680. Mental Floss: Cheetos, lip balm and other weird brand extensions . 7. Kizuna Encounter (Neo Geo) Price Range: $12,000 -- $13,500 . Why So Expensive?: One of the main games that all Neo Geo fanatics are looking for is a particular version of Kizuna Encounter, a 1996 fighting game similar to Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter. The game itself has received solid reviews, but isn't groundbreaking by any means. However, it was produced in such small quantities for the European market that collectors speculate fewer than 15 copies were made. The Japanese version, which is exactly the same except for different packaging, is fairly common and sells for about $50. 8. Ultimate 11 (Neo Geo) Price Range: $8,000 -- $10,000 . Why So Expensive?: Ultimate 11 was the final game in the Super Sidekicks series, a popular franchise of soccer games that sold very well. For some reason, though, Ultimate 11 was not produced in large quantities, and there are now fewer than 10 known copies in existence. That kind of rarity makes it a must-have for collectors. In late 2009, a private sale was reportedly made between two members of the collectors' forums at neo-geo.com. The buyer paid an astonishing $55,000 to acquire both Kizuna Encounter and Ultimate 11. The original owner purchased the games around 10 years ago, when Kizuna was selling for $500 and Ultimate for $400. The new owner has said he will not sell them, even if he were offered $100,000.

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite mounting pressure from some lawmakers and dissent within the ranks of his top advisers, President Barack Obama decided not to release photos of Osama bin Laden's dead body, a White House spokesman said Wednesday. ""It is not in our national security interest ... to allow these images to become icons to rally opinion against the United States,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters. ""We have no need to publish those photographs to establish that Osama bin Laden was killed,"" he said. Shortly after U.S. officials announced the decision, a news agency published photographs it said were taken by a Pakistani security official shortly after the raid. The images, published by Reuters Wednesday, showed three men lying in pools of blood and the wreckage of a U.S. helicopter abandoned during the assault. None of the pictures appeared to show bin Laden's dead body. White House officials remained firm in their assertion that releasing graphic photos of bin Laden could incite more violence. To further explain the controversial choice, Carney read Obama's remarks from the transcript of a Wednesday afternoon interview. ""That's not who we are. We don't trot out this stuff as trophies. The fact of the matter is that this is someone who is deserving of the justice he received. ... We don't need to spike the football,"" Obama told CBS News. Obama's decision settles the debate over whether the United States will release the images. But opinions about whether the U.S. government's photographs should be public were anything but unanimous among U.S. lawmakers and members of the public at home and abroad. Some argued releasing the images would put to rest any critics or conspiracy theories, while others countered that the graphic photos would only inflame jihadists. A senior Democratic official close to the White House told CNN that the president was ""never in favor"" of releasing the photos, even as CIA chief Leon Panetta made it sound like their release was imminent. Carney said Obama consulted Cabinet and security officials before he made his choice Wednesday morning, and a majority of them weighed in against releasing the photographs. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were among those who supported Obama's inclination to keep the pictures classified, the senior Democratic official said. But Panetta said Tuesday he thought a photograph of bin Laden's body would be released at some point. ""I just think it's important -- they know we have it -- to release it,"" the CIA director said. The president's inner circle was not happy with those remarks, the senior Democratic official said. But a senior Obama administration official said debates over the pros and cons of releasing the photos were ""not at all contentious."" The official admitted that ""leaks are possible,"" but said that did not sway the president from reaching his decision. Carney stressed that Obama wanted to hear differing perspectives to inform his choice. ""He wanted to hear the opinions of others, but he was very clear about his view on this,"" Carney said. ""There are obviously arguments to be made on either side."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the decision a ""mistake."" ""I know bin Laden is dead. But the best way to protect and defend our interests overseas is to prove that fact to the rest of the world,"" he said in a written statement. ""I'm afraid the decision made today by President Obama will unnecessarily prolong this debate."" Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, also said Obama made the wrong choice about the photos. ""I want to see them, personally,"" he said. ""I did three tours. I'm not talking as a member of the Armed Services Committee -- (but) as a Marine who did three tours because of 9/11. As Americans we deserve to see them."" But House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, said he shares the president's view. ""In my opinion, there's no end served by releasing a picture of someone who has been killed, and I think there is absolute proof that Osama bin Laden was in fact the person ... killed,"" he said. Lawmakers involved in national security began debating the issue well before Obama's decision. The top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee has argued they should be made public right away. ""I think the question is, what's the negative that could come from it?"" asked Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia. ""One of these days they're going to be released; it's a question of whether it be now on our terms or (let) somebody else do it."" Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, who chairs the Armed Services Committee -- and who has not seen the photos -- had argued that the United States should wait to allow the emotions of people around the world who may be sympathetic to bin Laden to cool down. ""I'd let a little time pass so we that we don't play into the hands of people who want to retaliate with what obviously will be a sensational picture. I would not want to feed that sensation, so I'd wait days or weeks,"" he said. Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson suggested temporarily keeping the photos confidential, but releasing them eventually. In a letter sent to the White House Wednesday, he proposed establishing a review process ""to release all relevant photographs as early as 10 years from now,"" or when the president ""determines their release would no longer endanger the lives of Americans."" While some Republican leaders criticized Obama, the debate over the photographs did not entirely split along party lines. Republican House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers of Michigan said he was against releasing any photos, saying that he didn't want to make the job of U.S. troops abroad ""any harder than it already is."" ""Imagine how the American people would react if al Qaeda killed one of our troops or military leaders, and put photos of the body on the Internet. Osama bin Laden is not a trophy -- he is dead and let's now focus on continuing the fight until al Qaeda has been eliminated,"" he said. House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King, a Republican from New York who has argued that the photographs should not be classified, said he understood Obama's call. ""While I have said that a photo release may be a good way to combat the predictable conspiracy theories about bin Laden's death, this is a decision for the President to make, and I respect his decision,"" he said in a statement. Obama's choice comes as a poll shows that a majority of Americans support making the photographs public. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday, 56% of those asked said yes, the government should release a photo of bin Laden's body. Another 39% said no. The poll of 700 adults had a sampling margin of 3.5%. The government has said it matched DNA to confirm that the body was bin Laden's, and most have accepted that news as evidence of the outcome of the operation. Some groups, however -- including the Taliban -- have questioned the assertion. ""Obama has not got any strong evidence that can prove his claim over killing of the Sheikh Osama bin Laden,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahed said. ""And secondly, the closest sources for Sheikh Osama bin Laden have not confirmed"" the death. And at a university in the affluent Pakistani town where U.S. officials say troops killed bin Laden, a group of students clamored to tell CNN why they doubted the al Qaeda leader had been killed in the raid. ""If it is true, then why they are not showing his body?"" one asked. Similar doubt and demands for evidence that bin Laden is dead echoed on the streets of Islamabad. ""I believe this is all fake,"" one man said. ""Wherever he is, he's alive."" But the White House has dismissed such criticisms. ""There are going to be some folks who deny it. The fact of the matter is, you will not see bin Laden walking on this Earth again,"" Obama told CBS. None of the photos published by Reuters appeared to show bin Laden. One photo shows a man, clad in a T-shirt, lying in a large pool of blood that appears to spread from the back of his head. Two other men pictured appear to have died from extensive head and chest wounds. The White House has received three sets of photographs, according to a senior U.S. official. One batch, which clearly shows bin Laden's body, was taken at a hangar in Afghanistan, the official said. The official described one of the images as a clear, but gruesome, picture of the al Qaeda leader's face. Bin Laden is shown with a massive open head wound across both eyes, the official said, adding that the image would not be appropriate for the front pages of newspapers. The other photos include the raid on the compound and bin Laden's burial at sea, according to the official. CNN's Ed Henry, John King, Jessica Yellin, Ted Barrett, Ed Hornick, Dana Bash, Dan Lothian, Susan Candiotti, Nick Paton Walsh and Leone Lakhani contributed to this report.","NEW: A news agency publishes graphic photos taken by a Pakistani security official .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A threatened Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program carries enormous risks for the Jewish state, including international isolation, retaliation at home and abroad, and steep economic costs. And that's if it works. While Israel has the most advanced military in the Middle East -- including a suspected-but-undeclared nuclear arsenal of its own -- Israeli analysts say there's no guarantee that a unilateral strike will roll back an Iranian program it sees as a threat to its survival. Yet that's the choice observers say the Jewish state may soon face, and some argue the benefits would outweigh the costs military action would incur. A successful raid would set back Iran's uranium enrichment effort by ""several years,"" said Ephraim Kam, the deputy director at the Israeli Institute for National Security Studies. And in a recent op-ed in The New York Times, Amos Yadlin, Israel's former head of military intelligence, argued that previous Israeli strikes against nuclear installations in Iraq and Syria successfully forced those countries to drop their nuclear programs. ""This could be the outcome in Iran if military action is followed by tough sanctions, stricter international inspections and an embargo on the sale of nuclear components to Tehran,"" Yadlin wrote. ""Iran, like Iraq and Syria before it, will have to recognize that the precedent for military action has been set, and can be repeated."" Israeli authorities argue that if Iran develops nuclear weapons, it would trigger a Middle Eastern arms race among Iran's rivals for regional influence. ""Failure to prevent Iran from nearing the nuclear threshold will undoubtedly intensify the drive of other states in the region for nuclear weapons,"" said Shmuel Bar, director of studies at the Israeli Institute of Policy and Strategy. ""The initial countries, which will attempt to acquire a military nuclear capability, would include Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, Iraq, Libya and in its path, other North African countries."" A successful Israeli attack on Iran would eliminate the need for other countries in the region to develop such programs, proponents argue. And a severe blow to Iran could also weaken its proxies along Israel's borders, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Both groups receive generous Iranian backing and have staged attacks against Israel and Israeli targets overseas. Weakening Iran could free Israel to act more aggressively in combating those groups in the future, according to some Israeli analysts who fear the groups would become more brazen backed by a nuclear-armed Iran. ""If the Iranian regime weakens as a result of a successful attack, this would undoubtedly have an impact on Hamas and Hezbollah,"" said Yossi Melman, an independent Israeli commentator on security and strategic affairs. He said Hezbollah ""is likely to suffer a heavy price if it chooses to join the battle and attack Israel,"" while by knocking out Iran's nuclear fuel plants, ""Israel will show its determination of not allowing Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon in hope that it understands the message for the future."" But Iran has pledged a swift and powerful response to any attack, most likely through missile attacks on Israel. ""This may come in the shape of a large number of rockets and missiles fired from Iran itself, possibly also by Hezbollah and Hamas,"" Kam said. According to Israeli military estimates, there are tens of thousands of short-range rockets that could be fired from Hezbollah-controlled southern Lebanon and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip, while a much smaller number of long-range missiles could be launched from Iran. ""The whole of Israel is vulnerable,"" Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Dan Meridor warned recently. ""They are not just going to hit Israeli soldiers. The main aim is at civilian populations."" And Kam said Iran and its allies may respond indirectly as well, by carrying out attacks ""against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world."" In addition, it might try to disrupt the world energy markets and antagonize Persian Gulf Arab regimes by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the choke point for about 20% of the global oil trade. Iran says its production of enriched uranium is strictly to fuel civilian power plants and a medical research reactor. But the United States and Israel accuse it of working toward nuclear weaponry. The International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, says it can no longer verify that the Iranian program is strictly peaceful. Analysts CNN consulted say an Israeli attack may spur Tehran to pursue the bomb openly. ""Even if a few nuclear plants are destroyed, it will take several years to rebuild them and give Iran legitimacy to say, 'We were attacked by a nuclear power, and now we must defend ourselves,'"" Melman told CNN. Meanwhile, Meir Javedanfar, an Iran expert at Israel's Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, warns that an attack could lead Iranians to rally around the flag, bolstering the hand of theocratic government and further setting back the Western hopes for regime change. ""The regime is likely to use such opportunity to eradicate any form of opposition against it in the country,"" Javedanfar said. And an unsuccessful attack could further tarnish the reputation of an Israeli military that came under severe criticism at home following its 2006 war with Hezbollah. Hezbollah claimed victory after that conflict and enjoyed a surge in regional popularity, while Israeli commanders came under fire for being inadequately prepared for the fight. ""During the operation, one needs to take into account that it may fail, that targets will not be destroyed and that a large number of Israeli planes would be taken down,"" Kam said. In addition, an Israeli attack conducted without prior notification to the United States could severely strain relations with Washington, its leading ally -- especially if American military or civilian sites in the region were targeted as part of an Iranian retaliation. Israeli relations with Jordan and Egypt, the two Arab countries with which it maintains peace treaties, could be hurt. A sharp rise in energy prices as the result of a regional conflict would not do Israel any favors in the court of global opinion, possibly prompting boycott and sanctions campaigns. Israeli airspace could be closed to commercial traffic, and the country's lucrative tourism industry would be expected to grind to a halt. And a prolonged conflict could result in the closure or slowdown of a variety of industries and businesses costing the Israeli economy billions of dollars. ""The economy could lose a year's growth and even go into negative growth, many will lose their jobs and unemployment will rise,"" Adam Reuter, chairman of an Israeli investment house and the CEO of the Financial Immunities consulting firm, recently told Israeli news portal Ynet. Couple those prospects with the high cost of rebuilding damaged civilian and military infrastructure, and the price tag of a unilateral strike quickly goes up. ""The biggest disadvantage of all is war,"" Melman said. ""There is always an uncertainty. Once you start a war, you never know how it is going to finish.""","Israel could face isolation and retaliation if it attacks Iran .

"(CNN) -- In a historic turnaround, the ballot box is showing America's shifting attitudes about same-sex marriage. After gay marriage rights died at the polls dozens of times in the past, on Tuesday they passed in at least two states. Rarely do popular votes reflect such dramatic social changes. The result: Maryland and Maine will now allow couples like Chyrino Patane and James Trinidad to tie the knot. The Maryland couple has been together for seven years, and now, after the historic vote, they plan to marry in the next six months to a year. ""Both families will be at the wedding,"" Patane said. But the win was hard fought and the margin of victory was small. ""We've lost at the ballot box 32 times,"" said Paul Guequierre of Human Rights Campaign. ""History was made tonight."" In Maine, Erica Tobey and Ali Ouellette wed in September, but only now will the women's marriage be recognized under Maine law. ""It's hard to overstate the national significance of this vote,"" Marc Solomon, campaign director at Freedom to Marry, said of the Maine referendum. Related: French ministers back same-sex marriage . In Maryland, where just 51.9% of voters approved gay marriage rights, ""It was a little bit pins and needles,"" said Human Rights Campaign's Kevin Nix. ""It was going to be a close call all along."" A similar ballot measure in Washington state is pending. And in Minnesota, voters rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. Pollsters got a hint of the coming change. Recent national surveys have shown shifting attitudes toward same-sex marriage, with a majority of Americans now approving of marriages between two men or two women. A June CNN/ORC poll, for example, reflected such a shift in opinion in the U.S. Support has been growing for decades. In the 1990s, most Americans told pollsters they did not know anyone close to them who was gay. By 2010, the number of Americans who said they had a gay or lesbian close friend or family member was 49%. This year, that number stands at 60%. Maryland, Maine approve same-sex marriage . Election Day brought two additional gains for proponents of same-sex marriage: Wisconsin elected America's first openly lesbian senator, Democrat Tammy Baldwin, and President Obama became the first president to openly support same-sex marriage and get re-elected. Wisconsin's Baldwin is first openly gay person elected to Senate . ""I have never been this happy after an election in my 17 years of voting,"" said Derek Hurder from Hampden, Maine, who's been with his partner, Chris McLaughlin, for a year and a half. They're not yet ready for marriage, but they were elated about having the option. And they both voted to re-elect the president. The change in attitude makes them feel more comfortable, but that has its limits. ""I wouldn't feel safe walking down the street holding hands,"" Hurder said. Patane and Trinidad share their Catholic faith and are despondent that the church won't recognize their union. ""I believe in a religious marriage,"" Trinidad said. ""I recognize that it's going to be a nonreligious wedding."" Tobey and Ouellette, who met four years ago, tied the knot last September -- in a church. ""We are affiliated with the United Methodist Church, which on the whole does not support same-sex marriage,"" Tobey said. But their church made a hearty exception. ""We had three pastors who know us and love us and agreed to do that for us."" The legal situation led the couple to do things in reverse order. After their wedding, they applied for a name change. Now that the referendum has passed, they'll apply for a marriage license. Maine should begin granting marriage licenses to same-sex couples in mid-December, according to same-sex marriage supporters at Freedom to Marry. What the measures say . The two measures that passed, called ""Question 1"" in Maine and ""Question 6"" in Maryland, contain similar language. The words man and woman ""relating to the marital relationship or familial relationships must be construed to be gender-neutral for all purposes,"" the Maine measure says. Maryland's ballot reads, ""Civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license."" Both measures also explicitly mention the right of clergy to refuse to wed gay and lesbian couples if it goes against their religious convictions. ""This chapter does not require any member of the clergy to perform or any church, religious denomination or other religious institution to host any marriage in violation of the religious beliefs of that member of the clergy, church, religious denomination or other religious institution,"" Maine's Question 1 states. The governments of Maine and Maryland had passed laws permitting same-sex marriage, but activists opposed to the laws collected enough signatures to put them on a ballot, said Fred Sainz, a spokesman for Human Rights Campaign, which raised $32 million for its campaigns on the referendums that included radio and television ads, social media strategy and on-the-ground canvassing by thousands of volunteers. Opponents of same-sex marriage say the new laws in both states will redefine marriage for everyone as a genderless union and endanger the fabric of society. ""Such a radical change in the definition of marriage will produce a host of societal conflicts that government -- exercising its enormous enforcement powers -- will have to resolve,"" argues Maryland Marriage Alliance. The group also published an online opinion by parents stating that legalizing same-sex marriage would lead to the promotion of homosexuality in school curriculum. Election results raise questions about Christian right's influence . Sainz believes the campaigns supporting the Maine measure paid off. In 2009, a similar referendum in Maine failed when voters rejected the governor's decision to allow same-sex marriage. Tuesday's results represent a remarkable turnaround. ""The secret to our success is that we won over hearts and minds,"" Sainz said. ""Americans are fair and want to see their gay and lesbian friends, co-workers and family members have the freedom to marry."" Thirty-eight states have passed bans on marriages between people of the same gender, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. In the six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia where gays and lesbians have previously won marriage rights, it was because of actions taken by judges or legislators, not voters. On election night, Tobey joined friends as they all watched results on TV. She wasn't expecting Maine's ballot to pass. But then they heard the news. ""I said: 'Hey, did that just happen?' "" She did a double take. CNN's Rose Arce contributed to this report.","Voters in Maine and Maryland approve same-sex marriage .
It's the first time voters have approved same-sex marriage .
In the past, only judges or legislatures had approved it .
The votes show a dramatic shift in attitudes over the decades ."
"New Delhi (CNN) -- India on Wednesday executed Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the last surviving gunman from the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai that killed more than 160 people, a government official said. Kasab, a Pakistani, was hanged at Yerwada Jail in Pune, a city southeast of Mumbai, said K.S. Dhatwalia, a spokesman for the Indian home ministry. It was the first use of capital punishment in India in eight years. Read more: Mumbai attack survivor: 'It's like a dead man living' The execution took place after Kasab's last attempt to avoid the death penalty, a clemency petition, was rejected earlier this month by President Pranab Mukherjee. Kasab was one of 10 heavily armed men who in November 2008 attacked landmarks around Mumbai, including high-end hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and the Jewish cultural center Chabad House. He was photographed holding an assault weapon during the three days of violence. Indian forces killed the nine other suspects. Read more: The Mumbai attacks: Getting the story amid chaos . A Mumbai court sentenced Kasab to death in 2010 after he was convicted of murder, conspiracy and waging war on India. He pursued the appeals process through the Indian justice system, but the Supreme Court in August upheld his death sentence. Kasab was buried in the ""surrounding area"" of the jail following his execution on Wednesday, Dhatwalia said. Pakistani authorities didn't respond to requests for comment on the matter.

""It's a strong message that India does not and will not tolerate terrorism,"" said Prakash Javadekar, a party spokesman. The use of capital punishment is not common in India. The last state execution was in 2004, when a man was hanged for the rape and murder of a teenage girl. India blamed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistani-based terror group allied with al Qaeda, for the Mumbai siege. Indian authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on the Indian parliament. The group has denied responsibility.

"(CNN) -- Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes has offered to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life behind bars in exchange for avoiding the death penalty, according to court documents filed Wednesday. Prosecutors have not accepted the offer. Previously, they had said they would make a decision on whether to seek the death penalty against the 25-year-old Holmes at a hearing April 1. ""Prior to arraignment, Mr. Holmes made an offer to the prosecution to resolve this case by pleading guilty and spending the rest of his life in prison, without any opportunity for parole,"" the documents read. ""If the prosecution elects not to pursue the death penalty, then it is Mr. Holmes' position that this case could be resolved on April 1."" This month, a judge entered a standard plea of not guilty for Holmes, who is accused of opening fire at a Colorado movie theater that left 12 people dead and 58 injured on July 20, 2012. In the documents filed Wednesday, his attorneys said they are still exploring a mental health defense, ""and counsel will vigorously present and argue any and all appropriate defenses at a trial or sentencing proceeding, as necessary."" Holmes' lawyers blast Colorado's insanity defense laws . ""Nevertheless, Mr. Holmes is currently willing to resolve the case to bring the proceedings to a speedy and definite conclusion for all involved,"" they said. Holmes is charged with a total of 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other charges. Federal agents have said the former University of Colorado doctoral student planned the attack for months. He began buying guns in May 2012, allegedly building an arsenal of two Glock handguns, an AR-15 rifle, a shotgun and 6,295 rounds of ammunition. Authorities say Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives, then traveled to the movie theater armed with the weapons, tear gas and body armor planning to kill audience members during a screening of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises."" Witnesses who spoke to CNN said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats. ""This is not a 'whodunit.' Everybody knows that James Holmes committed these horrible murders. The question is what punishment he will get,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

"London (CNN) -- Let's play spot the villain. On Monday, a group of children from Stalham Academy in Norfolk, UK, received an unexpected message in their Christmas sermon. The Reverend Margaret McPhee, a trainee vicar, shared with them the simple truth that Santa Claus doesn't exist. The real meaning of Christmas, she said, wasn't Santa, Barbie and Xboxes. It was about the birth of the baby Jesus and the light that he brought to the world. Parents were hyperbolically outraged. One posted on Facebook that McPhee had ""put me off taking my children to church just in case something else gets said."" This was the second such incident this month. A few weeks ago, when Father Dennis Higgins, a devoted, octogenarian Catholic priest, dared to -- shock horror -- tell children the truth at church, a local headmaster by the name of Brendan Hickey intervened. ""I want to reassure all Year Three pupils at St. Anne's, and their parents, that I have personally spoken to Father Christmas and told him about what has happened,"" he lied. ""He was sorry to hear about the confusion and has promised me that he will arrange for his elves to write to each of the children and reassure them that he will definitely be coming to visit them this Christmas."" So who are the real villains here? Father Dennis, Rev. McPhee and their inconvenient truth-telling? Or Hickey and the disgruntled parents? In my view, anybody in their right mind will side with the clergy. Over recent decades, Santa worship has got out of hand. Rather than a light-hearted part of festive make-believe, it has become an elaborate con that many parents insinuate into their children's lives. A British mother, Laura Cole, made the headlines when she filmed her children crying after writing them a note -- ostensibly from Santa -- saying that they would not receive any ""lovely presents"" this year because they were on the big bully's ""naughty list."" One of the children was eight years old. And he still fell for it. This may be an extreme example, but it reflects the extent to which most children have been conned. It has become standard practice for parents to pretend to be in contact with Santa by letter and telephone before Christmas. These days, almost every parent in Britain puts out a glass of sherry ""for Santa"" and mince pies ""for the reindeer"" on Christmas eve, before consuming them as the children sleep, to create the illusion that Santa ""has visited."" A similar tradition flourishes in the United States and elsewhere. A mother I know even told her son that a shooting star was Santa coming to deliver presents on his sleigh. Another example of the depth of the deception came earlier this month, when a small girl called Natalie asked a Pentagon spokesman at a news conference if he was ""tracking Santa."" The answer, believe it or not, was yes: the North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) has a website claiming to monitor Santa's progress using their advanced detection systems over Christmas. That's just a bit of fun, of course, and harmless in its way. But in the context of the Great Santa Deception, it takes on a different hue. Is it really right that children should believe that this stuff is, so to speak, gospel? It's madness. Somehow, parents have gone beyond the light-hearted Santa of decades past, and are intent on manipulating their children into actually believing that he exists. The energy and forethought that some people expend on Santa propaganda is astonishing. And who is Santa, anyway? A blend of Turkish, Scandinavian, English and north European folklore -- some of it Pagan and some of it Christian -- popularized in the 1930s by a Coca-Cola advertising executive (with the unlikely name of Haddon Sundblom). Don't get me wrong: I have no problem with the Santa ritual as a sort of game, allowing children to believe or disbelieve as they like. But messing with your kid's reality -- that stinks. What's wrong with it, I hear you ask? What possible harm could it do? Isn't it all a bit of festive fun, that makes children's Christmas more special? Well, there are several problems with the cult of Santa. Firstly, the man is a lie. Quite literally, a big, fat lie. And selling lies to your children isn't a good thing, unless in exceptional circumstances. In fact, I'd go so far as to call it an abuse of trust, especially if you use it to frighten your kids into ""being good."" Secondly, propagating the Santa myth is profoundly cynical. At the heart of the con is the tacit belief that the world is not magical enough on its own, that it has to be sexed up with a Santa. From this point of view, explaining the truth about how shooting stars are formed would be boring, and revealing that the presents come from mummy and daddy would be a downer; kids need to believe in a fantasy figure if they're going to have a magical Christmas. How jaded! Surely it is far more awe-inspiring, not to mention instructive, to explain that a shooting star is a speck of spacedust bursting into flame up as it plummets through the Earth's atmosphere. Surely it is more meaningful to understand that your parents have bought you presents with love, rather than outsourced the job to an elderly man with a team of elves and reindeer behind him. Lastly, Santa has become the icon of materialism. Presents are a significant part of Christmas, but we can all agree that they should have more to do with togetherness and goodwill than with imaginary old men and booty. Now, I'm not religious myself, but it doesn't take a genius to make the correlation between the decline of organized religion in recent decades, and the rise of the Santa movement. It seems like if you remove formalized faith from children's lives, it must be replaced by an equally powerful belief in something else. God may be dead -- but Santa lives. If my kids were going to believe in anything, however, I'd much rather it was God than Santa. At least there is a long, rich tradition behind God. At least He is synonymous with a complex moral and ethical code. At least He can offer some kind of genuine spiritual solace to those that believe in Him. Unlike that villainous old red-belly.

"(CNN) -- When the players line up on the field for the crucial U.S.-Germany match on Thursday, fans may see Jurgen Klinsmann's lips moving during both countries' national anthems. Klinsmann coached the German national team in the 2006 World Cup. Eight years later, he's coaching Team USA. In the run-up to the 2014 World Cup, Klinsmann rubbed American soccer fans the wrong way with his frank early assessment that the team wasn't ready to win the championship. He irked others when he brought on five German-born players while dropping Landon Donovan, Team U.S.A.'s all-time highest scorer. But the team's successes under Klinsmann this year have silenced the grumbling, as they have fought their way through initial play in Group G against competitors with a reputation for being so tough that it has been nicknamed the ""Group of Death."" If the U.S. pulls through to the next round Thursday, it will be as much due to the dogged determination of the players on the field as Klinsmann's coaching skills off it. A national hero . Outside of the United States, Klinsmann is very well-known. In Germany, he's a household name, one of its brightest football stars. He likes to tell his life's story from the start. ""I grew up in a family bakery where I saw my dad working long hours every day -- 12, 14, sometimes 16 hours -- and he barely could get sleep,"" Klinsmann said. That work ethic is in his DNA, he said. And he stuck it into soccer at the earliest, signing his first pro contract at age 16. By age 24, he became the top scorer in the German premiere league, the Bundesliga, and was celebrated as player of the year. Two years later, in 1990, he played on the German national team, when it took its third World Cup trophy. Klinsmann also played in the professional leagues of Italy, France and England. In 1998, he retired from play and moved to California with his American wife, Debbie, whom he met, while she was working abroad in Europe. Eight years later, Klinsmann practically became a national hero in his native Germany as its team's head coach, when the country hosted the 2006 World Cup. He changed the way Germany played the game, teaching them to shed their conservative defense-minded approach for an aggressive offensive one. Though he did not lead the team to the top prize -- they came in third -- something even more wonderful happened: Germany shed a layer of its dark historic burden. Feeling despised for Nazi Germany's ruthlessness in World War II, flag-waving patriotism was a taboo for Germans. During the cup, global adoration poured in on them, and they broke out the flags to celebrate. Klinsmann stood in the center of it all. Millions thanked him for his leadership. Fan crowds were dotted with signs reading: ""Danke, Klinsi!"" A master psychologist . The U.S. coach's style -- and his main strength -- could be summed up in one word: psychology. Players seem to connect with him. They describe him as personable, easy to talk to. He rallies and motivates them; he irons out ego conflicts, analysts have said. Tensions over German-born players existed on the U.S. national team long before Klinsmann took the top coaching job in 2011, said Major League Soccer analyst Matthew Doyle. It fractured the locker room. Klinsmann seems to have changed that, and players have become greatly committed to the team. Team spirit has long been his strength, said CNN sports reporter Patrick Snell. ""It's not a team full of superstars,"" Snell said. ""It's a team that never knows when it's beaten."" Klinsmann also handles the public well, Snell said. His candor about Team U.S.A.'s readiness served to downplay expectations. He is a pro at controlling narratives, deflecting media hype away from players and onto himself. ""I think he is a very shrewd manipulator of the media,"" Snell said. Meet the team U.S.A. players with ties to Germany . The hero's shadow . ""That bugs me,"" analyst Doyle said. He feels like Klinsmann has contributed to media narratives he has grown tired of: The U.S. team is David; Germany is Goliath. Klinsmann is the savior. ""He's not the savior, and we don't need saving,"" Doyle said. The team improved greatly in the 10-plus years before Klinsmann came along, and the new coach is building on that success, he believes. The United States has shined in international tournaments, coming in first and second. It spent a decade fighting to get the upper hand on the formidable Mexican national team. And it has beaten the Italian team in Italy. For all his real strengths, Klinsmann has some weaknesses, too, Doyle said. Some of his stints coaching professional teams have proved lackluster. In Germany, Klinsmann has come under fire from current national team captain Philipp Lahm, who has said the current U.S. coach lacks tactical finesse. And he has left some vulnerabilities in American team's lineup, when he had better alternatives at hand, Doyle said. ""A guy like Landon Donovan gets left at home. That frustrates me,"" he said. The team has also made a serious consistent error. ""Four games in a row now after the 80th minute, we have given up a goal,"" he said. In his eyes, Klinsmann is no better than his recent predecessors -- unless he beats Germany on Thursday. Do that, and all is forgiven. No more questions. The moment of truth . The strengths of Germany's coach, Joachim Loew, fall right where Klinsmann's weaknesses lie. He is the master tactician and technician. The two once made a great team -- they balanced each other out, when Loew worked under Klinsmann in 2006. And they have become the closest of friends. Standing across from him, his former team and his native country will feel strange. ""Facing Germany, obviously, for me personally will be a very emotional situation,"" he said. ""Having both anthems play before the game, looking at their bench."" The German press has reported that he will sing along with them. He has already taken a beating from disillusioned journalists there for singing ""The Star Spangled Banner."" ""Coach Jurgen Klinsmann obviously sings every national anthem,"" wrote one German news website. Once that's over, then it's game on, Doyle said. He has no doubts Klinsmann will do anything to win. ""He's a fierce and ruthless competitor."" ""We have been waiting for this game quite a long time,"" Klinsmann said. ""It's massive, there's no other word to say."" And he has changed the narrative of the U.S. team: . ""We are by no means any underdog here."" CNN's Joe McCurdy and Ravi Ubha contributed to this report .","In the game against Germany, the U.S. coach may sing both national anthems .
He is more than a soccer star in Germany -- practically a national hero .
He is known as a great team builder and motivator .
But tactic and technique could be a weakness, and he has had some coaching failures ."
"(CNN) -- A former international rugby star has shocked the sports world by revealing that he is gay. Gareth Thomas, Wales' most-capped player after appearing in 100 Tests, made the surprise announcement in an interview with British newspaper The Daily Mail. The 35-year-old retired from internationals after the 2007 World Cup, but still plays for Welsh provincial side Cardiff Blues. He is the first openly gay top-level rugby player, although top referee Nigel Owens came out in 2007. While homosexuality in a macho code such as rugby is rarely acknowledged, top-level tennis players such as Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Amelie Mauresmo have discussed being lesbian. Former NBA basketball star John Amaechi came out in his memoir in 2007 a couple of years after his retirement, while Olympic diving champion Greg Louganis was candid about his sexuality and tested positive for HIV in 1988. Thomas married his childhood sweetheart Jemma in 2002, but they separated in 2006 and their divorce is being finalized. ""I've been through all sorts of emotions with this -- tears, anger and absolute despair,"" he said. ""I wasn't sure if I ever wanted to let people know and, to be honest, I feel anxious about people's reactions and the effect it might have on my family."" He said he knew he had was gay from as young as 16 or 17, but hid it as he sought to establish his rugby career, later going on to captain the British and Irish Lions and becoming one of the top backs in international rugby. ""I could never accept it because I knew I would never be accepted as a gay man and still achieve what I wanted to achieve in the game,"" he said. ""I became a master of disguise and could play the straight man down to a tee, sometimes over-compensating by getting into fights or being overly aggressive because I didn't want the real me to be found out. But when you withdraw into yourself you start to feel lonely, upset, ashamed."" The player finally revealed he was gay to Wales coach Scott Johnson after a match in November 2006, and the Australian then informed his teammates Stephen Jones and Martyn Williams. ""They came in, patted me on the back and said, 'We don't care,'"" Thomas said. ""Two of my best mates in rugby didn't even blink an eyelid. ""It's pretty tough for me being the only international rugby player prepared to break the taboo. Statistically I can't be the only one, but I'm not aware of any other gay player still in the game. ""I'd love for it, in 10 years' time, not to even be an issue in sport, and for people to say: 'So what?' ""I don't want to be known as a gay rugby player. I am a rugby player first and foremost. I am a man. I just happen to be gay. It's irrelevant. What I choose to do when I close the door at home has nothing to do with what I have achieved in rugby.""","Former international rugby star Gareth Thomas of Wales reveals that he is gay .

"(CNN) -- Those lights you put up for the holidays don't just brighten your neighborhood -- they are providing NASA with new data about how cities illuminate the night. Just how much brightness do the traditional Christmas lights add across the United States? Between the day after Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, nighttime lights in many major U.S. cities shine 20% to 50% brighter than average, according to NASA. The data comes from satellite imagery -- from the NOAA/NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite -- and the use of an algorithm to account for other sources of light. The NASA team examined light output in 2012 and 2013 in 70 cities during a study of urban energy use. The increased brightness is more pronounced in suburban areas, according to NASA. ""In most suburbs and outskirts of major cities, light intensity increased by 30 (percent) to 50 percent,"" NASA said in a statement. ""Lights in the central urban areas did not increase as much as in the suburbs, but still brightened by 20 (percent) to 30 percent."" The changes in brightness during the holidays is not unique to the United States. The researchers also found that cities in the Middle East are brightened during the holy month of Ramadan. Light use in Saudi Arabian cities increased by 60% to 100% during Ramadan, NASA reported. Cairo also shone brighter.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown said Thursday he had signed a bill that will require public schools in the state to teach students about the contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. The bill, believed to be the first of its kind in the nation, will also require teachers to provide instruction on the role of people with disabilities. ""History should be honest,"" Brown said in a statement. ""This bill revises existing laws that prohibit discrimination in education and ensures that the important contributions of Americans from all backgrounds and walks of life are included in our history books. It represents an important step forward for our state, and I thank Senator Leno for his hard work on this historic legislation."" The governor was referring to the bill's author, Sen. Mark Leno, a San Francisco Democrat. California law already requires state schools to teach about the contributions of Native Americans, African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and Asian-Americans, among other groups. ""Today we are making history in California by ensuring that our textbooks and instructional materials no longer exclude the contributions of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) Americans,"" Sen. Leno said in a statement. Separately, he said the bill is thought to be the first of its kind in the nation. It will take effect in January, however, state textbooks are not likely to be updated until 2015, he said. Leno's office cited research that shows students who learn about LGBT people are more likely to report their schools are inclusive and fair. The bill, which passed the state legislature this month and the senate in April, according to the senator's office, is not without controversy. It has drawn criticism from some religious and conservative groups, like the Traditional Values Coalition, a lobby organization that says it speaks on behalf of more than 43,000 churches. ""It is an outrage that Governor Jerry Brown has opened the classroom door for homosexual activists to indoctrinate the minds of California's youth, since no factual materials would be allowed to be presented,"" Rev. Louis Sheldon, chairman and founder of the Traditional Values Coalition, said in a statement. ""If parents don't already have their children out of public schools, this should cause them to remove them,"" he said.","The bill is believed to be the first of its kind in the nation .

"(CNN) -- There aren't too many times when I'm speechless about what I consider an outrageous example of parenting. This is one of those times. An Instagram photo surfaced over the weekend of a child wearing a Ray Rice costume and dragging a doll ostensibly meant to symbolize the wife of the embattled former NFL star, Janay Rice. (The person who posted the photo with the caption ""Greatest costume ever"" appears to have since taken down their Instagram account.) As most of us sadly know by now from the surveillance video that has been seen around the world, Rice dragged his then-fiancee out of an elevator after knocking her out in February. And so a kids' costume of Rice dragging his wife? Are you kidding me? Thankfully, some parents across the country have the words I can't seem to find. Halloween costumes to avoid this year . ""Utterly disgusting!"" is what Mike Heenan, a father of two young daughters and organizer of the SF Dads Group, called ""the seemingly celebratory suggestion of domestic violence in dragging around a Janay Rice doll."" ""Not just insensitive. Idiotic! Dangerous! Disgraceful!"" said Heenan, who is also the founder of the blog At-Home Dad Matters. On Facebook, Alison Bucalo, a mom of two boys in Ridgewood, New Jersey, said she would never let her little guys wear something ""so tasteless."" ""What's the purpose? To be funny? To shock? To show zero class? What is the lesson here?"" she asked. This Ray Rice costume for kids is just the latest example of what seems to be a trend in wildly inappropriate children's Halloween costumes, with selections ranging from meth dealers Walter White and Jesse Pinkman from TV's ""Breaking Bad"" to a baby cigarette to serial killer Hannibal Lecter. 5 scary good healthy Halloween treats . On the video-sharing site for tweens called KidzVuz, a girl who goes by the name ""citykid"" was horrified to see costumes such as a ""terrorist"" and a ""little Hitler."" ""People actually made these for their kids to wear,"" she said incredulously. ""Just because it's Halloween that doesn't mean you can cross these kinds of lines."" Well said, citykid. She also pointed out the growing popularity of oversexualized costumes for our girls. ""By making these costumes manufacturers are encouraging tween girls to dress twice their age."" Melissa Atkins Wardy, a mom of two and author of ""Redefining Girly,"" said it is ""especially concerning"" when hypersexualized costumes ""dominate the girls market."" Pink, princess-y and sexy too soon . ""It reflects a litmus test of our society and conveys the message to girls they are valued for their looks,"" said Wardy, who is also the founder and chief executive officer of PigtailPals & Ballcap Buddies, which offers empowering T-shirts for girls and boys. ""Instead of dressing like a true fire fighter/super hero/doctor/bug/witch, they face row after row of the sexy version of those things, size 5T,"" Wardy said. ""While a little girl may not understand what 'sexy' is, the older children and adults around her certainly do, and it impacts the way we talk to and respond to girls."" Pam Moore, host of the blog Whatevs, said she's seen costumes such as a ""sexy mermaid"" or a ""sexy Starbucks beverage"" for children on Pinterest. ""Basically, anything that could be described as 'sexy' is inappropriate for a young girl,"" said Moore, who blogs about motherhood, fitness, home birth and life in Boulder, Colorado.

""I would ask myself if this costume is getting a laugh at anyone's expense. If so, that costume is probably not OK,"" she said. ""Is the costume sexy?

"(CNN) -- One day, California wakes up and every single Latino has inexplicably disappeared. No business owner, doctor, nurse, soldier, teacher, entertainer, athlete or politician can be found. No bus driver, farm worker, cook, gardener or nanny. All gone. California -- the ninth largest economy in the world -- grinds to a halt because Latinos have vanished. Chaos and tragedy follow. This scenario is what Sergio Arau's satiric film, ""A Day Without a Mexican,"" explores. This modern-day fable provides a cautionary tale on the assumptions we make about the 11 million unauthorized immigrants who live and work in America every day. An oft-repeated mantra used to malign these ""economic refugees"" -- a term that more closely defines who they actually are, rather than the inflammatory ""illegal immigrant"" -- is that they don't pay taxes. They send their kids to our schools, and they don't pay taxes. They earn their wages, and they don't pay income tax. Such incendiary assertions are coded language designed explicitly to generate a negative reaction. The facts, which most people don't know, refute such claims entirely. Sales tax. Like everyone in the country, every time a refugee goes to a store and buys something, they pay sales tax. They buy milk; they pay sales tax. They buy shoes; they pay sales tax. They buy a television; they pay sales tax. Property tax. When refugees rent -- whether it's in an apartment building, a room in a house or a house -- a portion of that rent is passed on to the landlord, who pays property tax to the state. Payroll tax. President Reagan's 1986 immigration reform law penalizes employers who knowingly hire undocumented workers. This policy has generated a black-market business for fake identity documents. In less than an hour you can obtain a fake green card, Social Security number and driver's license. Most refugees, then, do provide the necessary documents -- fake or otherwise -- to employers and when they get their paycheck, up to 15% of their earnings goes to Uncle Sam to pay Social Security and Medicare. But since it's illegal for them to receive Social Security and Medicare benefits, this creates a windfall for Uncle Sam. The ""Earnings Suspense File,"" used to track names and Social Security numbers that don't match government records, grew an average of $67 billion per year from 2000 to 2007 (the most recent years for which data is available), three times faster than the file grew in the 1990s. In 2007, $11.2 billion went into the Social Security Trust Fund and $2.6 billion went into Medicare, for a total that year of $13.8 billion. Given the financial climate in America these past years, these are funds we can ill afford to do without. This week, in his testimony to the Congressional Budget Committee, Stephen Goss, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, said that because of the country's growing aging population and decline in birth rates, the Disability Insurance Trust fund reserves will be depleted by 2018 and the Social Security Trust Fund will follow suit by 2036. Goss told The Washington Post recently that the windfall from economic refugees has saved the retirement system from insolvency. A similar phenomenon holds true on the state level. In December 2006, Texas was the first state to conduct a comprehensive financial analysis of the impact of undocumented immigrants on a state's budget and economy. The stunning results showed that ""undocumented immigrants produced $1.58 billion in state revenues, which exceeded the $1.16 billion in state services they received."" Carole Keeton Strayhorn, the former Texas Comptroller, said, ""Bottom line, undocumented immigrants in the state of Texas are adding $17.7 billion to our gross state product ... we net $428 million at the state level because of the taxes they're paying in."" A few years ago, the Congressional Budget Office evaluated the impact of economic refugees on the budgets of state and local governments. It concluded, ""Over the past two decades, most efforts to estimate the fiscal impact of immigration in the United States have concluded that, in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants -- both legal and unauthorized -- exceed the cost of the services they use."" The film ""A Day Without a Mexican"" was made in 2004. No Mexicans -- or Colombians or Argentines or Guatemalans or Panamanians, for that matter -- have mysteriously disappeared from our country. In the long run, a day without Mexicans would deal a devastating blow not just to California, but to the U.S. economy. It is time to cease the mantras that enforce the idea that illegal immigrants are nothing more than leeches to our society, and embrace the realities of what these people actually contribute to our economy: a financial fountain we would be foolish to shut off. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Garcia.","Charles Garcia: Not having illegal immigrants would be devastating blow to U.S. economy .

"(CNN) -- Thailand's festering southern insurgency has come a long way since the early 2000s when ousted premier Thaksin Shinawatra dismissed the insurgents as mere ""sparrow bandits."" Initially unwilling to take seriously what could emerge as a threat to Thai national integrity, Bangkok has over the past decade attempted to paint its restive southern Muslim states as suffering from little more than a small-scale insurgency led by shadowy groups with nebulous demands. In the light of the last week's brazen attack in southern Thailand in which 16 militants were killed in an hour-long firefight at a naval base, analysts say that argument is looking increasingly threadbare. Well-armed, motivated and increasingly audacious, the Muslim insurgency in the southern provinces of Pattani, Yala, Narathiwat, Satun and Songkhla has emerged with a clear goal: the creation of a separate Muslim state for the region's 1.8 million Muslim ethnic Malays. The insurgency has so far claimed more than 5,300 lives and left more than 9,000 injured in nine years of escalating attacks that have included drive-by shootings, bomb blasts and beheadings, according to Deep South Watch, an non-government that monitors the conflict in the southern provinces. ""We are seeing a greater radicalization of the insurgency,"" said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher on Thailand at Human Rights Watch (HRW). ""They don't want the presence of anyone in the region apart from ethnic Malays and this they've made clear with public announcements."" The Pattani Independence Fighters (Pejuang Kemerdekaan Pattani) come under the umbrella of the BRN-Coordinate (National Revolution Front-Coordinate) -- a group that combines ethnic Malay nationalism and Islamist ideologies in equal measure. Their aim is to create an independent state called Pattani Darulsalam (Islamic Land of Pattani) using violence and terror to oppose what they claim is a Thai Buddhist occupation. The Thai government has sent more than 150,000 soldiers to the region to protect it from an estimated 3,000 to 9,000 rebel (or juwae as they are called locally) fighters, according to estimates from human rights groups. While government statistics put Thai Buddhists at just 6% of the region's population, Muslims complain they dominate the region. Education, in particular, has been one of the fault lines in the conflict, with hard line Muslims viewing the school system as a tool of Thai colonialism. Human Rights Watch say 157 teachers have been killed since 2004. The southern provinces were once part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate until they were annexed by Thailand -- then called Siam -- in 1909. While calls for secession have simmered since then, an insurgent raid to steal weapons from an army camp in January, 2004, led to a crackdown by the Thai military, which sparked the modern insurgency. Later that year, the Thai military opened fire on protesters at Tak Bai in Pattani, killing seven people. Almost 1,300 protesters were detained at the scene, stripped and some of them tortured, while others were transported to Inkayut Military Camp in the province -- a journey of five hours. Detainees were stacked into military vans so tightly that 78 people died of suffocation en route. The government has since tried to reverse its heavy handed policy in the region, using instead a heart-and-minds campaign to pacify the provinces. According to Lt. General Ditthaporn Sasasmit of the Internal Security Operations Command, the operation has been a success. ""If we compare it to nine years ago, the situation was very bad,"" he told CNN. ""Every time officers tried to round up or search suspect targets, we received strong resistance from locals. ""Now we have prevented many attacks thanks to information given out by local residents - a good example is the latest military base attack; insurgents lost a lot of lives."" Despite this, non-government agencies say there is unlikely to be peace in the region in the near-term. According to Phasuk, the 2004 Tak Bai incident marked a turning point in the insurgency, radicalizing a younger generation. ""The commander in this latest attack was a survivor of the Tak Bai incident,"" Phasuk said, referring to the failed attack on a Thai military camp in Narathiwat province on February 13 that left insurgent commander Maroso Chantrawadee and 15 other militants dead. ""What we are seeing is a transfer of power within the insurgency from an older generation, which favors negotiation, to a younger radicalized generation who see negotiation as an act of betrayal to the ideology of separatism,"" he said. ""There is now a split in the leadership."" The Tak Bai incident, viewed by many as a strategic blunder on the part of the Thai military, has been instrumental in turning ""unarmed sympathizers into brutal insurgents,"" Phasuk said. ""This man (Chantrawadee) survived torture at Tak Bai and many of the new generation of commanders also survived Tak Bai."" Certainly if leaflets found in Narathiwat's Bacho district on February 14, the day following last week's attack, are anything to go by, the insurgency is showing no signs of easing. ""We will retaliate in every way for our losses. ... From now on, we will attack and kill Buddhist Thai teachers and Buddhist Thai people. We will attack Buddhist Thai community...One Muslim life must be repaid with 10 Buddhist Thai lives,"" reads the leaflets according to HRW. One of the features of the campaign, which has had a marked escalation since last March, is that insurgents have shown little regard for Muslims that they see as collaborating with Thai authorities. Everyone from imams to Muslim rubber farmers has been targeted by death squads and bombs detonated in Thai ethnic areas have indiscriminately claimed Muslim lives. ""The new radical leadership has no problems with collateral victims in its campaign. Their attitude is that Muslims should not be living next to ethnic Thais anyway,"" Phasuk said. Amnesty International's latest report on the armed conflict called on insurgents to halt the campaign of targeting civilians. ""The insurgents seem to be attacking many of the very people on whose behalf they are ostensibly fighting, destroying their lives and livelihoods,"" said Donna Guest, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific deputy director, at the 2011 release of the report. ""Whatever their grievances, they do not justify this serious and systematic violation of international law."" Human Rights Watch said that while insurgents use human rights abuses by the Thai military as an excuse for its reprisals, Bangkok -- where the government has a long tradition of drawing its legitimacy through the army -- needed the political courage to hold the military accountable. ""If this had happened, it may have slowed down radicalization,"" Phasuk said.","Thailand's southern insurgency has dragged on for almost a decade .
About 5,300 people have been killed and more than 9,000 injured .
Muslim separatists are calling for an independent state .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two aid workers killed in Afghanistan had a deep commitment to the country, and knew the risks associated with humanitarian work there, friends and family of the victims' said Saturday. The aid workers were said to be among 10 members of a medical team who were shot and killed Thursday by gunmen in Badakhshan, a remote northeastern region of the country. Among the dead were six Americans, two Afghans, a Briton and a German, said Dirk Frans, director of International Assistance Mission. He said two other Afghans on the team are alive. Aqa Nwor Kentoz, the police chief in the province, says the gunmen stopped the group on the road, took their belongings and shot them one by one. An Afghan was released because he was reciting excerpts from the Quran, Kentoz said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Libby Little, the wife of team leader Tom Little, confirmed to CNN that her husband was among the six Americans killed. Speaking from her home in Delmar, New York, Little said she knew the worst had happened when she didn't hear from her husband after 24 hours. She described a system they established years ago -- he would give her a short, 30-second call every 12 hours to let her know he was OK. When two cycles went by without a call from her husband, she said she knew something was wrong. Frans would not confirm Little's death, only acknowledging Little was the leader of the medical team. Libby Little described her husband as deeply devoted to the Afghan people -- a feeling shared by another member of the team, British citizen Dr. Karen Woo, who also was believed to have been killed in the attack. Woo's friend, Firuz Rahimi, confirmed her death to CNN and said his friend gave up a comfortable life in London to work in Afghanistan. Rahimi said he spoke with Woo three weeks ago, while she was packing for a trip with IAM to Nuristan. He told CNN that Woo had medicine and medical equipment procured after a period of fundraising. Woo was excited about the trip but was fully aware of the risks she faced making this kind of journey, he said. Libby Little said her husband was also intimately aware of the risks. She described Tom Little as very familiar with the area where he was killed and had been working in the country for 30 years. Libby Little said she doesn't, however, know exactly what happened on the remote road in Badakhshan province. She told CNN affiliate WTEN that no one she has spoken to is sure, either. Fighting back tears, Little said the area is so remote that no one has been able to get to the scene to investigate. She said local villagers saw the aftermath and traveled to a larger population center to let authorities know. Her account couldn't be immediately verified by CNN. Badakhshan, bordered by Tajikistan to the north and Pakistan to the south, is a sparsely populated region comprised of a majority Tajik population and an Uzbek and Kyrgyz minority. Badakhshan was the only province that was not controlled by the Taliban when it ruled Afghanistan. IAM's website said an eye-care team had been in Nuristan province ""at the invitation of communities there. After having completed their medical work the team was returning to Kabul."" Little told WTN that her husband had a ""rare opportunity"" to get to a remote camp involved with eye care. The group was actually assisting three medical camps, she said. Tom Little was helping train people to do work at the camps, according to his wife. Hans Ronnlund, the assistant to the executive director of the mission group, denied statements by the Taliban that the medical staff was carrying Bibles. Ronnlund said the International Assistance Mission is a humanitarian development organization formed by various Christian groups, but said medical staffers do not carry Bibles. ""We cannot understand how they can say that,"" he said. Libby Little was similarly insistent that IAM was not a missionary group. She said that IAM is a Christian group, but that it focuses on providing services such as teaching English or providing medical care. She noted that IAM was invited by the Afghan government and points out that its workers received visas allowing them entrance to the country. Little said she had 40 ""wonderful years"" with her husband and that he ""had a rich life serving the Afghan people,"" adding that ""his work was done. That's a good thing for anybody."" Elsewhere in Afghanistan, in the southern Helmand province, international and Afghan forces killed 14 insurgents in an exchange of fire, said NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). In a separate bombing incident, two Afghans were killed and five others wounded near Heyderabad, in Helmand province. Also Saturday, ISAF reported the deaths of two international service members in a bombing in southern Afghanistan. Their nationalities were not yet disclosed.

"(CNN) -- Detroit became the largest U.S. city to exit bankruptcy this week, with the effective approval of a plan to slash $7 billion in debt and reinvest $1.4 billion to improve city services. The move set in motion the ""Grand Bargain,"" an $816 million deal that ensured the bankruptcy's timely and fair resolution, by helping to honor city retirees and preserve the Detroit Institute of Arts. Retired public employees and artwork -- two civic assets rarely thought of in the same breath. But in Detroit -- and, indeed, in countless cities across the country -- the duo constitute an essential part of the city soul. Take Diego Rivera's Detroit Industry Murals, a work as iconic as any on display in the DIA. The murals personify the spirit of Detroit, where citizens of varying backgrounds came together to build the city with their own hands. It is this spirit of hard work and determination that made Detroit an envy of the world -- and that persists in communities throughout the region today. For much of the last 18 months, though, the pensions of tens of thousands of Detroit's retirees, along with the world-class art collection at the DIA, were put at risk in Detroit's bankruptcy. As the museum and retirees led the news, the focus was not the enduring spirit of the murals, nor the toil of Detroit's workforce. The question, instead, centered on the whether Detroit needed them at all. How much would the city cut from retirees' pensions plans? What art could be sold from the DIA? At the Kresge Foundation, a philanthropy rooted in Detroit and committed to expanding opportunity in cities nationwide, we fundamentally rejected this way of thinking. We refused to stand by while pensioners were dealt a devastating blow to their livelihoods. We couldn't keep quiet as assets of one of our community's greatest treasures were stripped. So we -- along with dozens of partners across the private, public and philanthropic sectors -- contributed to the Grand Bargain. In doing so, we affirmed our commitment not only to Detroit's future, but to an even Grander Bargain: The notion that government and the citizens it represents can join together in pursuit of the common good. This social compact, and the set of values it embodies, must be embraced as cities look to succeed in the 21st century. With Detroit's bankruptcy now behind us, it's time to step back and reflect. Why did so many put so much money into art and pensions? And what can we take from this chapter in one of America's greatest cities? First, the Grand Bargain is a study in collaboration between diverse -- and even unexpected -- stakeholders. When our group of foundations first announced this investment in January, we hoped our involvement would bolster the spirit of positive engagement and creativity in Detroit, encouraging others to invest strategically across the region. It did. Local and national philanthropies, retirees and unions, elected officials on both sides of the aisle and from all corners of Michigan, businesses from the ""Big Three"" automakers to JP Morgan Chase, cultural advocates, a groundswell of Detroit residents -- all came together to forge this compromise, underscoring that no one entity, or sector, can do it alone. In an age of budget constraints and political polarization, cooperation is not only possible, but indeed critical to solving our most pressing urban problems. Second, this deal highlights the need to move beyond accepted ways of thinking â€” to reject the status quo, particularly when it is shrouded in pessimism. It's one thing to pay lip service to Detroit's most vulnerable residents and a vital civic asset. It's entirely another to develop a legal framework and garner the support necessary to do so. Revitalizing American cities will require the same nimbleness, innovation and risk-taking that were on display in Detroit. It will require real risk -- of resources and reputation. Third, our investment says something about the values we, as foundations, think are essential to prosperity and inclusion. Shoring up pension funds helps families, bolsters the local economy and relieves pressure on municipal operating budgets. Treasured cultural beacons like the DIA strengthen metropolitan areas, attract residents and visitors alike, and add to citizens' connection to the city. And in Detroit, supporting the dignity of retired city employees and preserving the art were, above all else, essential to hastening the city's bankruptcy and putting it back in the starting blocks. There's no doubt that Detroit's emergence from bankruptcy has been hard. We faced tough questions about the accountability of non-elected decision-makers; and about the feasibility of improving Detroit's public services, remediating blight and rebuilding the tax base. Retirees who negotiated in good faith still face pain and hardship. The road ahead will be challenging, as institutions need rebuilding, communities need repairing, and the trust of citizens needs restoring. But it is the positive characteristics of the Grand Bargain that form the basis of Detroit's future -- and that serve as inspiration for other cities to tackle similar, seemingly insurmountable challenges. Resilience and hope triumphed in Detroit. All strands of our community joined to weave a fabric of possibility that will forever change this city. There have been times over this last year when our aspirations to get back to work seemed beyond reach. But the stakes were too high to fail; there was simply too much potential to give up. In Detroit, each person, institution, and community rose to the challenge. It's time to do that once again -- not just in the Motor City, but across the nation. If there's a lesson from Detroit's bankruptcy, it is that. We can, and we will, protect our cities.","Rip Rapson: Detroit exited bankruptcy this week, saved pensions, city's art collection .

"(CNN)  -- California voters have just rejected Proposition 19, the ballot initiative that would have legalized marijuana under state law. Where did Prop 19 go wrong? Prop 19 failed in part because many proponents emphasized the wrong arguments for legalization. Many advocates promised major benefits to California's budget because of reduced expenditure on marijuana prohibition and increased revenue from marijuana taxation. Other supporters claimed that Mexican drug violence would fall substantially. Both claims were overblown. The budgetary benefits, while not insignificant, would have been small compared with California's fiscal mess. Mexican drug violence is mainly associated with the cocaine and methamphetamine trades, as well as from marijuana traffic to other states. Many voters sensed that Prop 19 supporters were overreaching, and this made them suspicious of all the arguments in its favor. Common sense should have recognized that since marijuana was close to legal already, Prop 19 would not have had dramatic effects. Prop 19 failed also because it overreached. One feature attempted to protect the ""rights"" of employees who get fired or disciplined for using marijuana, including a provision that employers could only discipline marijuana use that ""actually impairs job performance."" That is a much higher bar than required by current policy. This provision allowed Prop 19 opponents to claim that workplaces would become infested with impaired pot users. That assertion is not well-founded, but that is not the point. Prop 19 did not need to address employee marijuana-testing in the first place. A more effective position for Prop 19 supporters would have been that employee marijuana-testing should be unencumbered by state or federal law. That would allow employers to protect themselves and their employees against perceived risks from marijuana, thereby promoting support for legalization. A final problem with Prop 19 is that it would only have legalized marijuana under state law, since federal law also bans marijuana. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, moreover, announced just weeks before Tuesday's election that the administration would enforce the federal law fully even if Prop 19 passed. This legal limbo would have kept the marijuana market underground, limiting tax revenue and continuing the ills of black market. This ambiguity also dimmed support by making state-level legalization feel like an empty gesture. So what is the path to legalizing marijuana in the United States? First and foremost, advocates must emphasize that in a free society, the burden of proof should be on prohibitionists to justify the interference with liberty that results from outlawing marijuana, a burden the prohibitionists have never met. Any calm assessment of marijuana versus alcohol, for example, shows that alcohol is the substance with the greater potential for harm. Ancillary benefits of legalization are naturally important: by eliminating the black market, legalization promises reduced crime and corruption, fewer infringements on civil liberties, better quality control for marijuana users, along with budgetary benefits. But these considerations are unlikely to convince the majority until more people agree that government should not interfere in the private decision to consume marijuana. Marijuana advocates should also focus on federal law, in addition to or even instead of state law. Legalization proponents have long despaired of affecting change at the federal level and assumed that state-by-state change would someday bring down federal prohibition. That position is understandable, and it has achieved some success, such as the decriminalization of medicalization of marijuana in many states. Yet it's hard to see the federal apparatus yielding ground without direct elimination of its authorization; the stakes for those who hold this power are too high. Legalizers can also argue compellingly that no reasonable interpretation of the Constitution justifies federal imposition of a marijuana ban. A final key to legalizing marijuana is to get conservatives, not just liberals, more involved. A number of well-known conservatives have advocated legalization, such as Milton Friedman, George Schultz, and William Buckley, but the general perception is that legalizers are ""stoners, "" acting mainly out of self-interest. Yet legalization can appeal to conservatives, especially if the arguments emphasize freedom, personal responsibility, and the Constitution, along with up-front clarity about the goal: legal production and use of marijuana for adults, whatever their motivations. Past liberal efforts, such as medical marijuana, invite charges of hypocrisy and weaken support. Marijuana can and should be legal, Prop 19's failure notwithstanding. But the strategy for achieving that end must change. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey A. Miron.","Jeffrey A. Miron: Prop 19 advocates didn't present right reasons for making pot legal .

"London (CNN) -- What do will.i.am and Iron Man have in common? They're both rather partial to bionic limbs. In his latest music video, ""Scream & Shout,"" a human hand can be glimpsed clasping what appears to be a sophisticated robot hand stolen from the set of a high-budget sci-fi film. What many of the video's 97 million (and counting) viewers may not realize, however, is that the appendage in question is a genuine prosthetic hand that, its makers claim, has taken us one step closer to truly simulating the real thing. Unlike conventional prosthetics, the i-limb Ultra boasts five individually-powered articulating digits, as well as a fully rotatable thumb and wrist, enabling the user to perform a variety of complex grips. ""The first generation (of prosthetics) had what I call a pincer grip -- the fingers are reflexed so they do not change shape and they move in one plane,"" explains David Gow, the British inventor and engineer behind i-limb. ""Whereas what we produced is something that rotates at the knuckles."" The i-limb is the latest in ""myoelectric prosthesis"" -- a process that uses electrical sensors to detect tiny muscular movements in the residual limb, which are then translated by an on-board computer into natural, intuitive movement of the mechanized hand. In practice, this requires the wearer to learn a language of muscle movements around the wrist, which correspond to a vast array of pre-programmed hand and finger motions. Although it requires a fair bit of concentration to begin with, Gow says that -- much like playing an instrument -- the mechanism is intuitive once muscle memory takes over. As well as the practical benefits afforded by the added range of grips, Gow believes the i-limb carries a significant psychological advantage because finger movements are what most people associate with the human hand. ""When you have only one shape for the hand and it is not a particularly everyday natural one, it looks strange,"" he says. People who've used the i-limb ""say they see the digit as what gives them the sense of having a hand back."" Donald McKillop lost his right arm in an accident at home 35 years ago. He was one of the first amputees to try an initial version of the i-limb back in 2007. ""Every day I'm finding new things with it -- it's absolutely amazing ... It's the hand I thought I'd never have again,"" he said. But of course, although it can rotate 360 degrees, the i-limb is still far from measuring up to the real thing. ""We can't approach the subtlety of skin, sensation of temperature, touching things yet,"" admits Gow. ""But we've broken through the barrier of making a hand that looks like a medical device."" As things stand, the i-limb is also prohibitively expensive. Including fitting and training, a hand costs in the region of $100,000. Perhaps in part because of this, most of the 4,000 or so i-limb users in the world are war veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. Gow notes, however, that the potential market is huge: there are presently an estimated two million upper limb amputees across the globe. Touch Bionics, the company that Gow founded to produce the i-limb, is looking to take its share. Gow, who left the company in 2009, says sales are accelerating and 2012 saw turnover reach over $16 million. For the Scotland-based engineer, who abandoned his career in the defense industry to dedicate himself to the study of prosthetics, the i-limb is much more than a business. ""I have seen hundreds of people ... I have seen the father that says 'thank you' on behalf of his son,"" Gow says, wiping a tear from his eye. ""That means an awful lot because you don't, as an engineer, get many moments where you articulate human emotions about these things.""","The i-Limb is the first prosthetic hand that has five individually-powered articulating digits .

"(CNN) -- The video of Ray Rice knocking his then-fiancee Janay Palmer unconscious and then dragging her body out of an elevator brought the topic of domestic violence to the nation's attention. Unfortunately, the series of events in this case -- the initial abuse, then the victim-blaming, and the NFL's response -- is not unique to the hyper-masculine culture of the NFL, but is a microcosm of what occurs in our society more broadly. I have seen this far too often in my work specializing in domestic violence law. What the nation saw in the video of Ray Rice's abuse happens every day in America. In our country, one-in-three high school girls and women experience intimate partner violence,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That is: one-third of our female population experiences untold physical, psychological, and developmental harm. Stated another way, domestic abuse occurs at rates higher than the combined number of automobile accidents, stranger rapes, and muggings that women experience. Janay Rice's experience is not really sensational or extraordinary, it is ordinary. She has asked the public to leave her family alone, but we don't have to talk about her to talk about domestic violence. Instead, we could talk about my client whose husband called 911 saying, ""I think I've killed my wife."" He was an elementary school teacher, not a professional athlete or celebrity, so there was no media coverage of the severe injuries he inflicted or the five-year jail sentence he received after nearly killing his wife. We could talk about another client whose boyfriend (now husband) burned her with a scalding hot iron, permanently scarring her arm, and later tried to run her over with his car. Or we could talk about my many clients who have been raped, beaten unconscious, and otherwise brutalized by their intimate partners. And this is only the physical abuse; emotional and psychological abuse often inflict deeper harm. Nor is the NFL's permissive, slow, and underwhelming response to domestic violence unusual in our country. Sadly, our society and legal systems have largely failed to prevent or respond to intimate partner violence. Historically, as long as a husband didn't kill or maim his wife, he would not be prosecuted. During the 1800s and 1900s, legal doctrine gave the husband the right of chastisement over his wife and immunity for marital rape. Laws against domestic violence are recent and it wasn't until the mid-1990s that each state had protection order laws. Even with laws in place, police and prosecutors are frequently slow to act, and by the time an abuse survivor seeks police or court intervention, he or she has typically experienced repeated and severe abuse. The question of how to prevent abuse persists. To prevent domestic violence, we must grapple with the causes of violence and the societal forces that condone and perpetuate abuse. Gender inequality and masculine norms of dominance, toughness, and control chiefly contribute to the continuation of abuse. The other major factor is the intergenerational effect of domestic violence, with research showing that witnessing abuse between one's parents is the strongest risk factor for transmitting abusive behavior across generations. I can respect that Janay Rice does not wish to be tokenized or become a national spokesperson. Let's instead have a larger conversation about prevention and intervention in our domestic violence epidemic.","Jane Stoever: The abuse Janay Rice suffered not extraordinary in U.S. It's painfully ordinary .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Undeterred by an overnight crackdown by authorities, protesters in the center of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, rebuilt barricades Wednesday that had been torn down hour earlier by riot police. As the day continued, police pulled back from the city's Independence Square, or Maidan, and the country's leaders sought to play down fears of a further clampdown. Earlier, hundreds of officers used chainsaws to pull down the barriers, which had been manned by pro-Western demonstrators. Clashes led to reports of injuries on both sides. Angry about the refusal of Ukraine's Russian-allied President Viktor Yanukovych to sign an agreement that would strengthen cooperation with the European Union, thousands of demonstrators have been camped out for days in Independence Square. They also continue to occupy Kiev's City Hall. Wednesday's predawn crackdown on protesters brought condemnation from Western leaders. But U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland, after a two-hour meeting with Yanukovych on Wednesday, said there was still ""a way out"" for his government. ""It was a tough conversation, but it was a realistic one,"" she told reporters in Kiev. ""I made it absolutely clear to him that what happened last night, what has been happening in security terms here, is absolutely impermissible in a European state, in a democratic state. ""But we also made clear that we believe there is a way out for Ukraine, that it is still possible to save Ukraine's European future and that ... we want to see the President lead."" A picture posted to Twitter by the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoff Pyatt, showed Nuland handing food earlier Wednesday to security forces and protesters in the square. Talks . Yanukovych called for talks. ""I invite representatives of all political forces, priests, public figures to hold the nationwide dialogue,"" he said on the official presidency website. ""Personally I am ready to take part in such panel discussion. In order to achieve compromise, I urge the opposition not to refuse, not to choose the path of confrontation and ultimatums."" But his jailed chief political opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko, dismissed any call for negotiations, urging Ukrainians to ""stand up,"" and repeating previous opposition calls for early elections. ""No negotiations or roundtables with bandits -- only the immediate resignation of Yanukovych and his entourage,"" a statement posted on her official website said. ""I also appeal to the leaders of the democratic world. Every time a Berkut (riot police) baton strikes a blow on a peaceful protester defending Maidan it is a blow to the universal values that you are trying to make the foundation of human life."" Tymoshenko has been in jail for two years after being convicted of abuse of power in 2011. The verdict was decried by the EU and other critics as a sham. During allies in Independence Square, protesters have carried her picture. Interior minister: 'No crackdown' Earlier, Ukrainian Interior Minister Vitaliy Zakharchenko said there would be no attempt to disperse the protesters and that police were just trying to keep the roads clear. ""I want to reassure everyone -- there will be no crackdown of the Maidan,"" he said, according to the official Ukrinform news agency. ""Nobody is infringing on citizens' right to peaceful protests. However, one cannot ignore the rights and lawful interests of other citizens."" Before that, the Interior Ministry said 10 policemen were injured between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. while acting on a court order to dislodge protesters from the city center and restore the free movement of traffic. It was not clear how many protesters were hurt in the clashes. City officials put the number at 30, while Health Minister Raisa Bogatyryova said 13 were hurt. Footage from the scene showed black-helmeted, heavily armored riot police advancing toward the protesters, who were wearing orange hard hats. Ukrainian opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, a former heavyweight boxing champion, said Yanukovych had ""burned the bridge to a civilized resolution of the political crisis,"" according to his Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party. Klitschko said the demonstrators' goals were ""a full reload of the government and punishment for those guilty in clearing up the protests."" Meanwhile, Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov told a government meeting Wednesday that Ukraine was still open to signing the European integration deal if the European Union would agree to providing financial assistance to Ukraine of around 20 billion euros ($27.5 billion). He suggested European officials were more interested in monitoring the protests than in discussing a financial deal that would benefit the Ukrainian people, according to a government news release. U.S. 'disgust' at crackdown . In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that ""all options"" were under consideration in Ukraine, including sanctions. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry condemned the crackdown on protesters. ""The United States expresses its disgust with the decision of Ukrainian authorities to meet the peaceful protest in ... Maidan Square with riot police, bulldozers, and batons, rather than with respect for democratic rights and human dignity,"" he said in a statement. ""This response is neither acceptable, nor does it befit a democracy."" Kerry urged the ""utmost restraint"" by authorities, saying ""human life must be protected."" UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the Ukraine government's decision to send in riot police against peaceful protesters. ""The concerns of protesters should be met with dialogue, not violence,"" he said. The police crackdown came hours after EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton met with Yanukovych and visited the protest site in the central square. ""The moves that were made to try and clear the blockades were done in a way that was unacceptable,"" Ashton told CNN in Kiev on Wednesday. ""And when I spoke with (Yanukovych) for three-and-a-half hours yesterday, one of the things we talked about was the importance of dialogue and the importance of convening what the three former presidents have described as ... a roundtable. ... It's harder to convene a dialogue when people have seen what they believe has been inappropriate action."" Ashton had met Tuesday with opposition leaders. The scenes of protest are reminiscent of the uprising that swept Yanukovych from office nine years ago during the Orange Revolution, when he was prime minister. East vs. West . Yanukovych's refusal to sign the EU deal represents a U-turn in the country's advance toward closer relations with the West. An EU agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion, protesters say. They accuse Yanukovych of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union. Moscow has leverage that may have affected Yanukovych's decision to backpedal on the EU talks because Russia supplies Ukraine with natural gas. Yanukovych said Tuesday that he was ""strongly against opposing relations with Europe in favor of relations with Russia and vice versa."" The EU is also pressuring Yanukovych to free Tymoshenko . The Orange Revolution that swept Yanukovych from office in 2004 also brought the pro-Western Tymoshenko to power. CNN's Diana Magnay and journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev, and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of children have been systematically raped, beaten and sex trafficked in a northern English town for more than 12 years. And it is still going on, a government commissioned report says. The ""appalling"" revelations also expose cultural tensions and lack of communication between authorities and the town's ethnic minorities that may have helped stop it. Social counselors saw evidence of sexual exploitation early on, but turned a blind eye, according to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Exploitation in Rotherham. The city's government recently made the inquiry's report available on its website. And so the abuses amassed, which included gang rape and death threats at gunpoint. At least 1,400 cases of abuse went on between 1997 and 2013 -- a conservative estimate, the report says. This year, specialist investigators are handling 51 cases. Other teams are looking at additional cases. Opinion: What's behind sex abuse of 1,400 children . Torturous sexual abuse . The exploitation has reached a level tantamount to torture, according to the report. ""There were examples of children who had been doused in petrol and threatened with being set alight, threatened with guns, made to witness brutally violent rapes and threatened they would be next if they told anyone,"" the report says. Some victims were not even in their teens. ""Girls as young as 11 were raped by large numbers of male perpetrators,"" the inquiry says. The report accuses politicians, social services and police of ""blatant"" failure to stop them, citing an inability to traverse cultural barriers with Rotherham's small Muslim community. Fear of label of racism . The perpetrators often worked together and were mostly of Pakistani heritage; the victims were mostly white girls, the report says. An earlier report said that ""Asian"" gangs originally were exploiting women and girls ""for their personal gratification"" but later turned to making money with it, passing girls around. Social counselors often took a hands-off approach to the cases for fear of being branded as racists or stoking a right-wing backlash in the city. ""Several (counselors) interviewed believed that by opening up these issues they could be 'giving oxygen' to racist perspectives that might in turn attract extremist political groups and threaten community cohesion. To some extent this concern was valid, with the apparent targeting of the town by groups such as the English Defence League,"" the report says. Though known victims were mostly white, the report delved into an underbelly of alleged systematic abuse by select groups of Asian men against women in their own ethnic groups. These often go unreported, because the victims fear vengeance or public shame in their communities, the report says. Perpetrators may be using that fear to blackmail these victims into continued sexual servitude. Community left out . Cultural differences also hindered effective involvement with concerned members of Rotherham's Pakistani community. Authorities turned to male community leaders and imams and greatly left out women. Many ethnic Pakistani women told the Inquiry that it made them feel disenfranchised and prevented people from speaking openly about abuse. Members of both genders said they missed any direct engagement on the topic by officials. ""This needed to be addressed urgently, rather than 'tiptoeing' around the issue,"" the report said. Under the rug . Some social counselors also hoped cases they were seeing were one-off occurrences and hoped they would go away. That may have been bolstered by the fact that the vast majority of child sexual abusers in Britain are white males. Research reports on the problem began appearing a few years ago, but they had little effect. ""The first of these reports was effectively suppressed, because some senior officers disbelieved the data it contained,"" the report said. Social services managers downplayed the problem. Officials thought reports were exaggerated. Law enforcement gave it little importance. ""Police gave no priority to (child sexual abuse), regarding many child victims with contempt and failing to act on their abuse as a crime,"" the report said. Improvement but frustration . By the time awareness of the problem increased by 2009, thinly staffed social service workers were overwhelmed by the number of potential victims. There has been a marked improvement in training police to recognize sexual abuse and work together with social services, the inquiry says. ""But the team struggles to keep pace with the demands of its workload,"" according to the report. And finances are running low. And still, few cases even make it to court.","Abuses included gang rape, trafficking, beating, threats at gunpoint .
Victims were as young as 11 years old, the report says .
Social counselors, police, officials turned a blind eye, report says .
Most suspects were ethnic minorities, and authorities were afraid of being branded racists ."
"(CNN) -- Camille Olivia Hanks was studying at the University of Maryland when she met Bill Cosby in the early '60s. He was doing stand-up comedy in Washington when the two were set up on a blind date. They fell in love and she left school to support his burgeoning career in entertainment. By 1964, the two were married and they would go on to have five children together. In 1997, their son Ennis (who inspired the character Theo Huxtable) was murdered, and a few years later Dr. Camille Cosby did a one-on-one with Oprah explaining how she'd eventually been able to find joy after mourning the loss of a child. Throughout that interview it was so clear that you were looking at the real-life Clair Huxtable that even Oprah seemed a bit star-struck by her poise and grace. During her 2000 appearance on Oprah, Camille revealed: . ""I became keenly aware of myself in my mid-thirties. I went through a transition. I decided to go back to school, because I had dropped out of college to marry Bill when I was 19. I had five children, and I decided to go back. I didn't feel fulfilled educationally. I dropped out of school at the end of my sophomore year. So I went back, and when I did, my self-esteem grew. I got my master's, then decided to get my doctoral degree. Education helped me to come out of myself."" When asked why she wasn't content to just settle for being the wife of a famous entertainer she continued: . ""I don't know exactly what it was, except that for me, integrity is important. For me friendships are important, family is important, and it is a blessing if we can have monetary benefits. That's wonderful, and I love it. But I have to have the security of people who really care about me, and me about them. I want to be surrounded by people who have integrity. And, of course, my name is Camille, not Bill."" That was a beautiful answer. But a lot has changed since then. These days, Camille Cosby is standing alongside her husband during what may turn out to be the worst month of his long career. For the last few weeks, the beloved TV dad who used to sell us Jell-O pudding pops has been at the center of an ever-growing scandal. He has canceled several appearances, Netflix has postponed the launch of his stand-up special, NBC nixed plans for a new comedy show, and this week Janice Dickinson became the latest woman to make allegations against him; telling E News that he raped her in 1982 after she'd done a stint in rehab. Cosby is arguably the most successful African-American performer in television history, but this isn't the first time he has found himself under scrutiny for extramarital affairs. In his biography, ""Cosby: His Life and Times,"" Mark Whitaker makes mention of the legendary comedian's ""roving eye"" and even tells an anecdote about how he finally cut back on his womanizing by breaking up with his long-time girlfriend. Now it seems those softball admissions about having a weakness for beautiful women may have been shrouding something much more sinister than an affair. From thegrio.com: Dear Bill Cosby, heed your own advice and be accountable . In the last decade alone, more than a dozen women have accused Cosby of rape or sexual assault. No formal charges have ever been successfully filed, so even with all the media speculation, these claims are technically only allegations. But there is one person in this melee whose anguish is virtually indisputable: his wife, Camille. So how does a woman like that end up spending 50 years of her life beside a man who is now alleged to be a serial rapist? One can only imagine the embarrassment she must be experiencing through all this. But her dilemma is a lot more common than you may think. In a world that asks you to be a mother, a wife, a businesswoman and an alluring sexual being, women grapple with finding the balance between respecting themselves and prioritizing their relationships. While many say they would leave a spouse who cheats, experts estimate that approximately 50-75% of couples rocked by an affair stay together. There are many reasons why some women choose to stay: the fear of being alone, financial dependency, belief that they can alter the behavior of their mate, professional status of their partner, deep emotional investment and family obligations. It is hard enough to come back from infidelity in private, let alone when you have the added stress of being a public figure. Both Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Edwards have weathered similar storms with men they devoted their lives to. And one could argue that it is a lose/lose situation for any wife who finds herself in that position: If you stay, people judge you for not standing up for yourself, and if you leave there is endless speculation about why your marriage failed. But this isn't just a simple case of being cheated on. There are some very serious stories coming to the forefront from those who describe Cosby as a sexual predator, who for decades allegedly drugged and violated young women who looked up to him as a mentor. During one of Cosby's old routines, he actually jokes about drugging young women. Coincidentally the set is from his album ""It's True! It's True!"" which was released in 1969, the same year Joan Tarshis claims he drugged and raped her. We can only speculate on what Camille's reasons are for staying in her marriage, when she found out about each rape claim, or whether she believes in her husband's innocence. She's been stoic and tight-lipped through all this, exuding the unflappable composure that she is known for. During the Monica Lewinsky scandal, many believed that had Hillary Clinton left her husband, his political career would have collapsed. Hillary Clinton may have well understood that her marriage wasn't just a union between a man and a woman but a much larger political machine. Perhaps Camille Cosby, who is equally responsible for her husband's career, feels a similar responsibility to maintaining the legacy and philanthropic institution she and her husband have built together. Few knew that in the original ""Cosby Show"" pitch, Bill had planned to have Heathcliff be a limousine driver who was married to a Latina handywoman. Programming executives weren't too thrilled with that idea, but it was Camille who convinced her husband to go in another direction. According to another excerpt in Whitaker's book: . ""The producers felt strongly that both [parents on the show] should be college graduates. As Cosby had proved in his stand-up act, the war of wits between parents and children was even funnier if the parents thought of themselves as highly intelligent people. ""Finally, shortly before 1 in the morning, Cosby said the words that made Carsey think that she might be getting someplace: 'I think my wife would agree with you.' "" 'You will not be a chauffeur!' Camille said when he briefed her on the meeting. 'Why not?' Cosby asked. 'Because I'm not going to be a carpenter!' Camille said."" That snippet gives a rare glimpse into the type of bond these two have, and also illustrates that Mrs. Cosby has not just been her husband's muse, but also a trusted adviser who keeps his career on track, behind the scenes. Sunday when NPR host Scott Simon asked Cosby about the resurfaced rape charges, he was met with a wall of silence. Later on, Simon admitted to CNN that during that awkward moment in the interview, the one thing he couldn't do was look at Camille. ""I did not look at Mrs. Cosby, and I don't mind saying I might've been a little uncomfortable doing that anyway,"" Simon said. That's what many find so unsettling about all this: the deafening silence of it all. The same man who has spent years waxing poetic about every social issue under the sun has now fallen completely mute on us, with his equally reticent wife by his side. The Cosbys' union remains seemingly stable through half a century of life's ups and downs, and as someone who respects the institution of marriage I find that commendable. But when does the adage of ""stand by your man"" go too far? I'm rooting for black love as much as the next person -- but not like this.

"(CNN) -- If running a 42 kilometer foot race was not tough enough, Sunday's Beijing International Marathon saw thousands of competitors brave a ""hazardous"" smog which engulfed the Chinese capital. Many runners wore face or gas marks to attempt to protect themselves from the effects of the poor air quality but there were several withdrawals before and during the race as runners feared for their health. It did not stop Ethiopia's Girmay Birhanu Gebru from winning the 34th edition of the race in two hours 10 minutes and 42 seconds, with his compatriot Fatuma Sado Dergo taking the women's title. But many leading runners did stay away -- perhaps taking their cue from Gebru's compatriot, the great Haile Gebrselassie, who opted out of running the marathon in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing because he was asthmatic and feared the effects of smog. This is caused by tiny particles known as PM2.5, which can embed themselves deep in the lungs, and had reached more than 400 micrograms per cubic meter as the runners lined up for the start in Tiananmen Square. The recommended daily average maximum level of exposure as prescribed by the World Health Organization is just 25 micrograms. The United States embassy in Beijing, which monitors air quality daily, described the conditions on its official website as ""hazardous"" -- with the advice to ""avoid prolonged or heavy exertion."" The conditions proved too much for British runner Chas Pope, 39, who pulled out after 10km. ""When I looked at the state of the mask after 10 km I decided enough was enough,"" he tweeted. ""It felt pretty ridiculous given we're meant to be running for health and fitness."" Organizers reportedly decided against abandoning the race because of the large number of overseas entrants who had traveled to Beijing for the annual race. But they made available 140,000 sponges so runners could get some relief on the course by hoping to wipe away the particles of smog at regular intervals. At the finish near the Olympic Park many runners complained about the conditions, but there were no immediate reports of any serious health problems among competitors. China, like many rapidly emerging economies, has suffered from poor air quality and pollution, particularly in its major cities. Experts say it is caused, in the main, by the use of coal in electricity and power generation and emissions from the growing number of motor vehicles. For the Beijing Games in 2008, the government imposed draconian restrictions on car use in the Chinese capital and factories were ordered to reduce their production.","Sunday's Beijing Marathon hit by poor air quality in Chinese capital .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- There's a bit of a trend brewing this summer concert season -- put together a couple of big-name acts for a nationwide tour, then record a song together to promote the event. Members of Styx, REO Speedwagon and Journey in 2003. Styx and REO have teamed up for a song and tour. It started with classic rockers REO Speedwagon and Styx, with their ""Can't Stop Rockin' "" tour and single of the same name. Now Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire are getting on the bandwagon. The two horn-heavy bands have recorded three songs especially for their joint 30-city summer tour. It's part of a charity campaign to benefit food banks across the country -- ""Three Songs for Three Cans or Three Dollars."" Chicago and Earth, Wind & Fire team up on the new song ""You."" The bands also take a stab at each other's material, with Chicago recording Earth, Wind & Fire's ""I Can't Let You Go"" and Earth, Wind & Fire covering Chicago's ""Wishing You Were Here."" ""The fact that the artists and bands, in this case, are touring together builds excitement with the possibility of the live performance that is exclusive to the tour,"" said Bruce Burch of the University of Georgia's Music Business School. It's ""sort of a 'once in a lifetime' type of attraction that helps to sell concert tickets, merchandise and, hopefully, CDs and downloads."" Concertgoers who contribute three cans of food or donate at least $3 will get a download card to access the tunes. People who don't make the shows will be able to donate online and download the songs at www.ewfandchicago.com. The Web site is expected to launch in early June. ""This is a dream come true,"" said Earth, Wind & Fire's Philip Bailey, who came up with the three-songs promotion. ""We want to invite everyone to help us do our small part to help feed America,"" added Chicago's trumpeter Lee Loughnane. Artists jamming together on stage is nothing new, and occasionally the songs are released as singles -- U2 and B.B. King's ""When Love Comes to Town,"" from the 1988 album and film ""Rattle and Hum,"" for example. Of course, duets promoting two hot artists or bands are hardly new either. Remember Josh Groban and Charlotte Church on ""The Prayer"" or ""Almost Paradise"" by Ann Wilson of Heart and Mike Reno of Loverboy from the ""Footloose"" soundtrack? ""Hip-hop artists have been using duets for some time to reach audiences of both artists,"" Burch said. In some cases, more than two artists collaborate. ""Even before that, country artists used this means to reach a larger audience for both artists,"" he said, noting the collaborations between George Jones and Tammy Wynette, and Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn. The new songs for the 2009 tours flip conventional wisdom. For decades, groups have recorded albums, then gone on tour to promote them. Specifically recording songs to promote a tour featuring a pairing of acts is a new idea -- and possibly one whose time has come, given the re-emergence of singles in the digital download age. Of course, it all depends on the success of the song. In the case of REO Speedwagon and Styx, they've scored a hit with their new tune. It's been riding near the top of the classic rock charts -- the biggest original hit by either band in years. ""The jam ... is just plain, old-school, rock 'n' roll fun,"" REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin said on the band's Web site. Should other bands follow suit and score hits, it might prompt other classic pop artists to join forces not only on tour, but in the studio as well.","REO Speedwagon and Styx have combined for hit and tour .

"(CNN) -- The discovery of horse DNA in hamburgers on sale at supermarkets in Ireland and Britain is testing the appetite of meat lovers there. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland said Tuesday that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study were found to contain horse DNA, and 23 of them tested positive for pig DNA. Read more: Multi-state beef recall tied to potential E. coli contamination . The horse-tainted burgers, on sale at several different supermarket chains, came from two meat processing plants in Ireland and one in Britain, the Irish authority said.

Read more: Bacteria seen in nearly half of U.S. meat . In nine out of the 10 burger samples, the horse DNA was found at very low levels, the authority said, but in one sample from Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, the horsemeat accounted for about 29% of the burger. Tesco responded by pulling from its shelves all products from the company that had supplied the dubious burgers. Read more: How severe weather makes people go hungry . ""We understand that many of our customers will be concerned by this news, and we apologize sincerely for any distress,"" Tesco said. The retailer is working with Irish and British authorities and the supplier to work out what had happened, it said. Alan Reilly, the chief executive of the Irish food authority, said there was a ""plausible explanation"" for the pig meat finding its way into the burgers, since meat from different animals is processed at the same plants. But he said there was ""no clear explanation at this time"" for the presence of the horsemeat. Report: Unsafe food putting lives at risk . ""In Ireland, it is not in our culture to eat horsemeat and therefore, we do not expect to find it in a burger,"" Reilly said.

"(CNN) -- Some headlines are hailing her as the bravest woman in Mexico. Marisol Valles Garcia, all of 20 years old, says she's just tired of everyone being afraid. Valles Garcia, a criminology student, became the police chief this week of Praxedis G. Guerrero, one of the most violent municipalities in the border state of Chihuahua. She was the only person who accepted the top job in a police force whose officers have been abducted and even killed. ""Yes, there is fear,"" Valles Garcia said Wednesday in an interview with CNN en Español. ""It's like all human beings. There will always be fear, but what we want to achieve in our municipality is tranquility and security."" There's good reason for the fear. Just this past weekend, a 59-year-old local mayor, Rito Grado Serrano, and his 37-year-old son, Rogoberto Grado Villa, were killed in a house in which they they were hiding in nearby Ciudad Juarez. Another area mayor was killed in June. Juarez is the bloodiest city in Mexico, with a reported 2,500 people killed in drug violence this year. Praxedis G. Guerrero is located about 35 miles southeast of Ciudad Juarez. Both are in the state of Chihuahua, which borders Texas. Nationwide, the federal government says, more than 28,000 people have lost their lives since Mexican President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels after taking office in December 2006. Valles Garcia sees a non-violent role for her 13-member force, which will be mostly female and unarmed. ""The weapons we have are principles and values, which are the best weapons for prevention,"" she told CNN en Español. ""Our work will be pure prevention. We are not going to be doing anything else other than prevention."" Valles Garcia said she aims to establish programs in neighborhoods and schools, to win back security in public spaces and to foster greater cooperation among neighbors so they can form watch committees. She has recruited three other women to join the force in the small municipality of 8,500 people, the government-run Notimex news agency said this week. Valles Garcia said Wednesday she gladly accepted when Mayor Jose Luis Guerrero offered her the job. The first couple of days have gone smoothly, she said. ""Truthfully, we have been very tranquil,"" she said. ""The people have received us very well. They have even supported us. They say it's a great project and they will be with us 100 percent."" Still, the notion of a largely female police force being helmed by a woman -- and a young one at that -- does not seem to sit well with some people in a country that still retains vestiges of machismo. ""Are there no men in Chihuahua?"" read a headline on a blog on the Periodista Digital website. But Valles Garcia believes what the job may need is a woman's touch. ""We are simply going to talk with them, with the people, with the families, giving them confidence so they will quit being afraid, so they can leave their houses,"" she told CNN en Español. ""We have hope that we are going to exchange fear for tranquility and security.""","Marisol Valles Garcia, a criminology student, is the only person who accepted the job .

"(CNN) -- Egypt's emergency law -- which was in place for more than 30 years -- has been lifted, a spokesman for the ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said Thursday. The unpopular and wide-ranging law became a focal point for demonstrations demanding the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak more than a year ago. The emergency law gave authorities broad leeway to arrest citizens and hold them indefinitely without charges, according to Human Rights Watch. It was first enacted in 1958. Although it was suspended during the rule of President Anwar Sadat, it had been in place since Mubarak took power in 1981, according to the group. Abolishing the emergency law was on top of the lists of demands announced by pro-democracy protesters during the 2011 uprising. The law was partially suspended by the country's military rulers early this year, but critics said that move didn't go far enough. Human Rights Watch urged Egypt's new parliament to act Wednesday, saying it had ""an opportunity to close an abusive chapter in Egypt's history"" by ending all measures related to the law when its current extension expired Thursday. ""The Egyptian parliament should make sure that this state of emergency, a hallmark of Hosni Mubarak's abusive police state, has no future,"" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said in an online statement. ""Parliament should also initiate a comprehensive investigation into human rights violations that flourished under the emergency law, and the public prosecutor should make sure that the key people responsible for systematic torture and enforced disappearance are prosecuted."" The rights group quotes the Muslim Brotherhood's presidential candidate, Mohamed Morsi, as saying Tuesday: ""There is no going back to the state of emergency, we do not need the state of emergency ... the existing laws are sufficient."" Morsi is one of two candidates who made it through a first round of voting this month. He will face former Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik in a June 16-17 runoff vote. The head of Egypt's ruling military council, Hussein Tantawi, announced the partial suspension of the emergency law in January. But opposition figures said the suspension was simply a sop to appease protesters. The suspension did not include crimes by ""thugs"" who commit acts of violence against citizens or use weapons to destroy public and government property, officials said. Journalist Mohammed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: Human Rights Watch urges an investigation into abuses committed under the law .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Vivek Murthy, the Obama administration's nominee for surgeon general, will visit the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday for his Senate confirmation hearing. Many may not even know we need to appoint someone to the position, but they shouldn't fret. They're not alone. The role of ""America's doctor"" has declined over the last several decades to near-irrelevance. At a time when Americans have fallen behind on key health metrics across the board, the nation's leading spokesman for public health has less influence than ever before. The office has endured everything from political interference to undersized budgets, making it impossible to carry out the job effectively. Have you ever heard of Boris Lushniak? How about Regina Benjamin? The recent surgeons general aren't exactly household names. But with each changing of the guard, we can -- and should -- hope for a leader who revitalizes the post. Perhaps Murthy might do just that. At 36 when nominated, he stands to be the youngest surgeon general ever appointed. He's already accomplished quite a bit, from co-founding a clinical trial operations company to helping start Doctors for America, a national health care advocacy group. Some observers, including myself, have raised concerns about his partisan ties to the Obama administration. Still, if confirmed, Murthy should do everything he can to strengthen the impact of the office. In November, right after Murthy's nomination, I published four initiatives in JAMA Internal Medicine for the next surgeon general to pursue. These recommendations do not come close to addressing all of our health needs, but they have the potential to restore the profile of the surgeon general and improve our public health: . Help Americans understand health care system . We haven't stopped arguing about the Affordable Care Act. Yet countless surveys show that most Americans don't understand the legislation, let alone the health care system at all. As recently as last month, more than 30% of Americans surveyed still weren't familiar with the law. ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" shamed people on the sidewalk for thinking Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act were different. And, whether it's insurance terms or broader trends in health care costs, the public doesn't seem to have a clue what's going on. That's where the surgeon general comes in. Americans need a public figure who can transcend the partisan fray to explain the intricacies of health care. A national tour is in order. Nonetheless, whether on television or Facebook, the surgeon general could spread awareness about navigating health care: a system that functions best when its patients are informed. Surgeon general links colon cancer, diabetes to smoking . Change the way we look at obesity . Obesity remains one of the greatest threats to American health, but our attitudes toward this issue are profoundly lopsided. In our culture, being overweight represents a failure of will power, a tendency toward sloth. Public health campaigns point to personal responsibility as the answer to this crisis. If we would just get off the couch and eat healthier, everything would be solved. It's time we re-evaluate how we look at and tackle obesity. Rather than narrowly concentrating on notions such as individual will power, we must address the systemic causes of obesity -- fast-food advertising to children, federal legislation that subsidizes processed foods and undeveloped food tax policies, among others. Organizations such as the Institute of Medicine have already shifted their focus toward these kinds of structural determinants. By translating the message to the public, the surgeon general can lead the charge. Is obesity the next smoking? Stand up for vaccines . Enough is enough. Though dozens of peer-reviewed studies have refuted the extreme claims of the anti-vaccination movement, the idea that vaccines are inherently dangerous somehow persists. States such as Oregon and Colorado have seen thousands of parents exempt their children from immunizations. Katie Couric ran a national television program stoking fears about the safety of human papillomavirus vaccines. Last year, congressional representatives introduced the Vaccine Safety Study Act to evaluate whether vaccines cause autism -- apparently, it's a bipartisan issue now. Americans have to understand the science is clear. Vaccines are among the most powerful public health tools in the history of human medicine. Without them, we expose others and ourselves to terrible, needless suffering. The surgeon general should release a report defending the facts and get the message out. Give an annual 'State of American Health' update to Congress . Our leaders in government -- and the broader public -- need to keep abreast of the most pressing health issues of the day. But we don't have a unified approach to fulfill that goal. The surgeon general should introduce an annual ""State of American Health"" report, with testimony to Congress. This yearly update could highlight recent scientific findings to results from prior initiatives, specific policy proposals to expectations for the months ahead. The report should be a nonpartisan, independent analysis of the nation's health. With this platform, the surgeon general should remind us that our prosperity depends not only on economic policy and national security but also public health. Whether or not the next surgeon general follows these recommendations, one thing is obvious: Americans have become older, fatter and sicker, yet the nation's doctor has disappeared. The brand of the surgeon general remains intact, and Americans trust this figure for guidance. But we need an outspoken, independent leader to bring public health to the forefront of our national conversation. Dr. Murthy, are you up for the job? The opinions expressed are solely those of Nathaniel P. Morris.","Dr. Vivek Murthy is the nominee for next surgeon general .
The surgeon general should help educate on health care, Nathaniel P. Morris says .
Changing the way the U.S. views obesity is important, Morris says .
An annual congressional update also could be helpful, he says ."
"(CNN) -- An attorney for a man charged in the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham and assault of a different woman indicated Friday that he wants his client to undergo a sanity evaluation. That development came as Jesse Matthew was arraigned Friday in the latter case in which he's accused of sexually assaulting a woman in Fairfax, Virginia, in 2005. Matthew separately is charged with abducting Graham, the 18-year-old sophomore whose body was found on an abandoned Virginia farm October 18, more than a month after she was last seen in Charlottesville. In Friday's arraignment in the Fairfax case, defense attorney James Camblos tried to introduce a motion seeking an evaluation for his client. A judge cut Camblos short, saying that motion could be filed and considered later once a jurist was permanently assigned to the case. Fairfax County prosecutor Ray Morrogh told reporters Friday that Camblos' motion sought a sanity evaluation that would help determine Matthew's competency to stand trial. Matthew made a virtual appearance at the Fairfax hearing via video from jail in Charlottesville, where he's being held in connection with the Graham case. In Friday's hearing, he was arraigned on three charges in the 2005 case: abduction, sexual assault and attempted capital murder. Analysts say he may be tried first in Fairfax, because authorities there have had more time to build their case, and they have both DNA evidence as well as a potential eyewitness. Woman was dragged, sexually assaulted . In the Fairfax case, authorities say that on September 24, 2005, a young woman returning from a grocery store was grabbed from behind by an assailant and sexually assaulted. ""We saw her purse on the front sidewalk,"" said neighbor Stacey Simkins. ""He had already dragged her behind our units to the dark pool area."" Simkins did not see the suspect's face, but she immediately called police. ""The offender was scared away by a passer-by,"" the FBI said in a statement, ""but the victim got a good look at him."" The victim helped authorities draw up a composite sketch, and now she could potentially be called as a witness at trial. ""I'd rather not say where she is, but she is cooperative,"" Morrogh, the prosecutor, said last week. Evidence may be challenged . In addition to the victim's potential testimony, the FBI also said it has DNA evidence in the case. But DNA evidence can be challenged in court, said HLN legal analyst and defense attorney Joey Jackson, as can the testimony of the victim. ""When someone is undergoing a trauma, as in this case the victim was, you have to wonder whether that traumatic experience could make what she saw reliable,"" Jackson said. ""On the other hand, the prosecution will argue that it's emblazoned in her memory."" Still, testimony and forensics may not be the only evidence in the Fairfax case. Now that investigators have the name of a possible suspect, Jackson said, they are likely chasing dozens of new threads, searching for evidence. For example, they would be looking for cell phone records, texts, surveillance video or toll booth receipts that might link Matthew to the crime scene, or any friends or relatives or business associates that might place him in Fairfax. Matthew's attorney to represent him in both cases . Camblos, Matthew's attorney in Charlottesville, declined to comment on the charges or the evidence against his client in either city. The Fairfax County judge granted Matthew's request to have Camblos represent him in the 2005 case, though the judge also appointed a public defender. In Charlottesville, prosecutors on October 24 said that they are still weighing which additional charges they will file in the Graham case. The case could be more difficult to make, according to defense attorney Scott Goodman, since there may be no witnesses who could testify. It is also unclear what forensic evidence may exist in the case, aside from a surveillance video from the night of Graham's disappearance -- on September 13 -- that shows Matthew, 32, apparently following her in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area. ""In Charlottesville, the case is much more complicated than Fairfax, because the Charlottesville case relies almost wholly on circumstantial evidence,"" Goodman said. Matthew was taken into custody September 24 while camping on a beach in Galveston, Texas, some 1,300 miles from Charlottesville. He is the only person detained in connection with Graham's disappearance, and was charged with abduction with the intent to defile.

"(CNN) -- Come December 18, we'll have to say goodbye to our favorite blowhard political character, ""Stephen Colbert."" That's the day the real Colbert will retire ""Colbert"" the character as he signs off from his Comedy Central show, ""The Colbert Report,"" in preparation to take over for David Letterman in 2015. For all of us Colbert fans, it feels like losing an old friend who we've grown to know, laugh with (and at) over the past nine years. You see, when Colbert takes over Letterman's show next year, he will no longer be ""Colbert,"" but rather the real Colbert. But here's the thing: What happens if we don't find the real Colbert as entertaining and engaging as the fictional ""Colbert""? After all, ""Colbert"" is a bigger-than-life character and the reason his humor works so well is because it's delivered in a comedic voice. Here are just a few examples: . ""Why would we go to war on women? They don't have any oil."" ""Contraception leads to more babies being born out of wedlock, the exact same way that fire extinguishers cause fires."" ""If we don't cut expensive things like Head Start, child nutrition programs, and teachers, what sort of future are we leaving for our children?"" ""Join me in standing up against any actual knowledge about guns. Let the CDC know they can take away our ignorance when the pry it from our cold, dead minds."" These jokes aren't nearly as funny -- if funny at all -- if not told via ""Colbert,"" complete with his pompousness, arching eyebrow and screaming eagle. Therein lies Colbert's challenge. Now, before my fellow Colbert fans turn on me, I'm not suggesting Colbert isn't capable of being funny outside of ""Colbert."" He's truly an immensely talented performer who trained at the famed Second City in Chicago and has been making us laugh for years. But why drop ""Colbert"" when it's that very character that got Colbert the ""Letterman"" gig in the first place? Please don't tell me it's in response to the views of people like Rush Limbaugh -- an unintentional ""Colbert"" -- who remarked when Colbert was announced as Letterman's replacement: ""CBS has just declared war on the heartland of America. No longer is comedy going to be a covert assault on traditional American values, conservatism. Now it's just wide out in the open."" Why would anyone care what Limbaugh says? (Seriously, why?!) But I bet that Limbaugh's views resonated with some CBS executives who actually were concerned that ""Colbert"" could alienate some more conservative viewers. (As if conservatives can't laugh at themselves ...) And that's a real concern for CBS since Letterman's show in 2013 reportedly garnered $179 million in ad revenue for the network. No one at CBS wants that figure to go down. But those same TV executives should keep in mind that in the sweeps ratings period in May, ""The Colbert Report"" was almost tied with the number of viewers ""Letterman"" attracted in the coveted 18-49 age demographic. And Colbert's reach will be even greater when he moves to network TV and is no longer just on Comedy Central, which reaches only 85% of the country. To be candid, I have another concern about Colbert dumping ""Colbert."" I was watching some clips of Colbert being himself. He comes across as thoughtful, well-spoken and analytical. Those are admirable qualities in the real world, but not so much for a TV personality who will have to carry a weekly late night comedy show. We aren't talking ""Charlie Rose,"" we are talking a late-night comedy show where the competition for viewers is fierce. For example, I watched an interview of Colbert by the late Tim Russert on ""Meet the Press"" in 2007. Colbert was low energy and pleasant. But I kept waiting for ""Colbert"" to emerge. And in 2013 Colbert appeared on Slate's ""Political Gabfest,"" where his knowledge of the Nixon administration was impressive. But he was low key, wonky, and, frankly (dare I say?) almost boring. (And I love politics.) I'm not in any way suggesting that Colbert needs to be a nonstop joke machine. What I'm saying is that ""Colbert"" the character has set the bar high for Colbert the person. The success of ""Colbert"" is as much about the jokes that come out of his mouth as it's about his character's point of view, energy, mannerism, etc. And we Colbert fans, along with the far less friendly TV critics, will no doubt compare ""Colbert"" to Colbert when he takes the reins at his CBS show. Expect to see reviews that say along the lines of, ""we miss 'Colbert'"" or worse, ""Colbert is not as funny as 'Colbert.'"" But there's one bright spot for ""Colbert"" fans that Colbert told Russert. He mentioned being taught years ago at Second City to ""wear a character as light as a cap,"" so that you can easily move in and out of it. That means ""Colbert"" will likely never be too far away from Colbert. Hopefully, that will mean that we'll see glimmers of our old friend from time to time.","On December 18, we'll have to say goodbye to the political character, ""Stephen Colbert""

"(CNN) -- If you want a place to see the majestic sweep of the Milky Way -- or even any star at night -- then put Hong Kong at the bottom of your must-visit list. The local urban night sky is as much as 1,000 times brighter than international norms making it the most light polluted city in the world, according to a study by the faculty of science at the University of Hong Kong. Much more than the romantic flicker of neon through a bedroom window, Hong Kong residents now have to contend with shopping precincts that are lit up like football stadiums and golf driving ranges that rise like daybreak on the horizon. Study leader Jason Pun Chun-shing said the group could find no other place on the planet that was as light polluted as Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong is an extremely densely populated place which is why the city has such a severe problem,"" he told CNN. However, he said unregulated lighting on buildings and the Hong Kong government's obsession with providing public safety had made the city world's biggest light trap. ""In Hong Kong, the government tends to play things on the safe side,"" he said. ""Certainly, I'm all for safety -- these are extremely important issues -- on the other hand, when you go near some public places, city parks for instance, they are lit up like the daytime in the evening. ""I think some of it is simply overdoing it,"" Pun said. He said of particular concern was spotlighting that was directed at the sky to create a dramatic effect. Unlike other major world cities -- among them Sydney and London -- Hong Kong has no laws controlling urban lighting. The study found that even rural areas of Hong Kong, including the nearby island of Lantau and the city's Wetland Park to the north -- a world famous staging post for migratory birds -- were also being affected by man made lighting. The Wetland Park was on average 100 times brighter than the standard, the study found. The international standard for night skies is set by the International Astronomical Union and refers to a night sky unaffected by man made lighting. Ironically, Hong Kong's most light polluted place was the Hong Kong Space Museum at Tsim Sha Tsui which was more than 1,000 times brighter than international norms due to the large number of billboards and floodlights nearby. Developed by physicists at the University of Hong Kong, the study -- Hong Kong Night Sky Brightness Monitoring Network (NSN) -- took more than 5 million night sky brightness measurements over a period of nearly three years. The study team said it now has the largest database on night sky brightness in the world. Even measurements at Hong Kong's Astropark observatory, located deep in Sai Kung Country Park, showed problems of light pollution. ""Even though the Astropark was the darkest station in our study, its night sky is still at least 20 times brighter than the international dark sky standard before 11pm,"" Pun said. ""Light pollution is swiftly destroying the few remaining star-gazing locations in Hong Kong."" While the study started looking at light pollution from an astronomer's perspective, ecologists also joined the project to gauge the impact of light pollution on wildlife. ""There have been many studies showing definitively that wasteful light has a big ecological impact, in particular for nocturnal animals that depend on the amount of light to regulate their lives. It's part of the reason why we set up a station near the Wetland Park because it's such an ecologically important area,"" Pun said. Nevertheless, for Chan Yuk Lung who runs the astronomy club at Queen's College -- a senior secondary school whose rooftop observatory in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay is in one of the brightest areas of the city -- the problem of light pollution is overstated. ""The sky is bright, no doubt, but the brightness is caused by the particles in the air not directly by the surrounding light,"" Chan said. ""We have very polluted air in Hong Kong and we have a lot of floating particles in the air and these floating particles reflect light back into our eyes -- this is why we feel the sky is so bright at night."" He said modern filters on the telescope can obviate the problems of light refracted by the particles. ""The major problem for us isn't city lights, it's clouds,"" he said, adding that Hong Kong has more than 200 cloudy nights a year.","Hong Kong University study finds Hong Kong is the most light polluted city on Earth .

"(CNN) -- When you're about to settle in for four days of serious gaming, while crammed into a single room with a couple thousand of your peers, there are some unique concerns. To stand out, you want your computer rig to look cool. And to stay connected, you want it to actually be cool. At QuakeCon, the bring-your-own-computer gaming fest that celebrated its 18th anniversary earlier this month in Dallas, the results of those concerns were some of the coolest-looking computer setups you're likely to see. Nearly 10,000 people attended the event to see the latest PC games from select companies, but also to witness the spectacle of 2,800 people playing computer games against one another in the same place. Part of the allure is competing against opponents from six different continents (Paging gamers from Antarctica!) and potentially being able to see them face-to-face instead of just talk over voice chat. The experience is unlike playing on your Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 in the comfort of your home. These gamers are all in one big, chilly room and connected to each other by 63,400 feet of cable. It's called the BYOC -- bring-your-own-computer -- room and is as much a showcase for players' modding skills as it is a place to play. Sometimes the modifications are purely aesthetic; sometimes they're to increase the computer tower's effectiveness and, sometimes, they address both.

"(CNN) -- Yes it's a dive hotel, but not that kind of dive hotel. An Italian spa complex has just opened a swimming pool certified by the Guinness Book of Records as the world's deepest. Named the Y-40 Deep Joy, the pool is now the star attraction at the Hotel Millepini, located in the Montegrotto Terme resort area, near Venice. This isn't the kind of facility aimed at jaded business travelers hoping to cram in a few laps before they head upstairs to order room service. Deep Joy features a shaft that plunges down ... And down ... And down until it hits a depth of 42 meters (138 feet), a space that could easily accommodate a 13-story building. Designed by architect Emanuele Boaretto and a year in the making, Deep Joy is expected to attract scuba enthusiasts and freedivers -- aquatic athletes whose incredible lung control allows them to spend minutes at depth on a single breath. Thermal springs . The pool is filled with 4.3 million liters (1.1 million gallons) of thermal water from local springs, allowing divers to plunge without the skin suits they'd need in open seas or lakes. It also contains underwater caves aimed at training scuba divers to negotiate sub-aquatic landscapes. There's also a suspended transparent viewing tunnel that allows spectators to watch the divers in action. Deep Joy was inaugurated earlier this year at a ceremony in which Italian world freediving champions Umberto Pelizzari and Ilaria Molinari (who dressed like a mermaid for the occasion) plumbed its depths. The pool's creators hope it will transform Montegrotto Terme into an international diving center and raise the profile of what is said to be Europe's largest area of thermal springs.

"(CNN) -- Two major wildfires have burned more than 18,000 acres along Florida's eastern coast, state officials said Tuesday. ""At this time, we have been fortunate that the fires have not resulted in any human loss,"" said Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Adam Putnam. ""All Floridians should use caution in and around these areas to safeguard themselves from smoke, ash and the flames themselves."" One fire, which began Monday in northern Brevard and southern Volusia counties, has destroyed a mobile home, several outbuildings and several camp structures, the Agriculture Department said in a news release. It had scorched more than 16,000 acres and was being driven by high winds. The Florida Division of Forestry deployed 22 tractor plow units, two helicopters and two air tankers to help fight the fire, which was about 25% contained, the department said. More than 150 personnel are engaged in the effort to contain the fire, it said. Cliff Frazier, a wildfire mitigation specialist with the Florida Division of Forestry, said crews will work throught the night and traffic on some roads may be affected. Meanwhile, a second wildfire had burned close to 2,000 acres in St. Johns County, south of State Road 206 on Interstate 95, below St. Augustine, the department said. It also was about 20% contained. That blaze crossed I-95 and U.S. 1, causing both roads to be closed at times because of smoke and poor visibility, the department said. The Florida Division of Forestry has 15 tractor plows and three brush trucks with 20 county fire department engines, six county water tenders and three bulldozers assisting with the fire, the Agriculture Department said. More than 137 people are working on snuffing that fire. Its cause was unknown Tuesday afternoon. As winds shift, the first fire could be blown to the south and into more heavily populated areas of Brevard County, said Fred Jodts, division chief for Brevard County Fire Rescue. Light rain fell Tuesday morning, helping to slow the fire and provide firefighters more time to organize their response, but it didn't eliminate the danger, Jodts said. ""It gives us a break. It's not going to put the fire out,"" he said. A voluntary evacuation in the city of Mims was lifted Tuesday evening and shelters were closed, according to the Brevard County Office of Emergency Management. The agency reported a Brevard firefighter suffered second-degree burns to the face. The cause of the fire is unknown, Frazier said, but he added that the combination of severe freezes this winter that killed surface vegetation and low rain totals made conditions ripe for a fire. Lee Francis got an upfront look at the fire when it came within a half-mile of the farm where she lives with her husband. They had gone to a police line to check on the situation when the fire jumped U.S. 1 and headed for their home, she said. They returned home to hose down the house, yard and vehicles amid the fire's orange glow. ""We could see flames and the smoke was very thick,"" she said. ""We could see when the firefighters would get it beat back, the glow would subside, then it would flare up again.""

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A man raced into Berlin's Madame Tussauds wax museum Saturday and ripped the head off a waxwork of Adolf Hitler, police said. A wax likeness of Adolf Hitler sits in Berlin's Madame Tussaud's wax museum before Saturday's attack. Police said the 41-year-old entered the exhibit shortly after the museum doors opened and ""made for the Hitler figure,"" scuffling with a guard assigned to protect it and the manager before tearing the head off the life-size statue. The man was arrested and is now in custody, Berlin police spokeswoman Uwe Kozelnik said. He told officers he wanted to protest the figure being included in the museum. Museum official Nathalie Ruoss said organizers would decide Monday what to do about the figure.  Watch a museum official describe the attack » . Saturday was the opening day of the Berlin branch of the famous Madame Tussauds wax museum. The presence of the waxwork, which depicted the Nazi dictator sitting at his desk in his bunker shortly before he committed suicide in 1945, in the new museum led to criticism in German media over recent weeks. But the museum's defenders argued Hitler's role in German history must not be ignored. Hitler was shown with a sullen expression, his head slightly down, and one hand on the desk. Police said the man is now being investigated for causing damages and bodily harm -- the manager was slightly injured in the leg -- but that he would probably be released later in the day. Berlin is the eighth wax museum for London-based Madame Tussauds, known for its lifelike waxworks depicting famous people including celebrities, politicians, sports stars, artists, and scientists. Famous Germans included in the exhibits are Chancellor Angela Merkel, scientist Albert Einstein, composer Johann Sebastian Bach, and tennis champion Boris Becker.

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans promised Wednesday to block legislative action on every issue being considered by the lame-duck Congress until the dispute over extending the Bush-era tax cuts is resolved and an extension of current government funding is approved. All 42 Senate Republicans signed a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, vowing to prevent a vote on ""any legislative item until the Senate has acted to fund the government and we have prevented the tax increase that is currently awaiting all American taxpayers."" ""With little time left in this congressional session, legislative scheduling should be focused on these critical priorities. While there are other items that might ultimately be worthy of the Senate's attention, we cannot agree to prioritize any matters above the critical issues of funding the government and preventing a job-killing tax hike,"" the letter said. The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts enacted by former President George W. Bush will expire after December 31 if Congress fails to reach an agreement on their extension. Top Democrats and Republicans disagree sharply over whether the current tax rates should be extended just for families earning $250,000 or under per year or for everyone regardless of income. Republicans contend that a failure to extend all of the tax cuts would hamper an already-sluggish economy. President Barack Obama and Democratic congressional leaders argue that the roughly $700 billion price tag attached to an extension of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans would be fiscally irresponsible. White House and congressional tax negotiators began deliberations Wednesday morning. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner characterized the initial talks as ""very civil"" and said that while everything was discussed, there were no surprises. House Democrats, meanwhile, announced their intention to move forward with a vote Thursday to permanently extend the breaks only for families earning $250,000 or less. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, called the move necessary to show ""our position very clearly that Democrats support tax cuts for the middle class."" House Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, called it a ""non-starter"" and ""political chicanery"" that threatened to undermine the talks. On the spending side, a continuing resolution responsible for funding the government is scheduled to expire Friday. Democrats are trying to pass several pieces of legislation before a more Republican Congress is sworn in in January, including the START nuclear arms treaty with Russia, a repeal of the ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military, and the so-called DREAM Act, which would create a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants. Reid blasted the GOP letter on the Senate floor Wednesday morning, calling it part of a ""cynical"" and transparent"" Republican strategy to ""obstruct"" and ""delay"" legislative progress while blaming the Democrats for failing to effectively govern. ""Last month, the American people issued their verdict on the Democrat's priorities,"" replied Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""We need to show the American people that we care more about them and their ability to pay their bills than we do about the special interests' legislative Christmas-list.""

"(CNN) -- Attention minions of Colonel Meow: . We regretfully announce that at some terrible hour on Wednesday - Colonel Meow Time - Colonel Meow, dear leader, feline overlord, and supreme dictator of the Colonel Meow Empire, merged with the infinite. To mark this occasion of feline loss, we ask that all minions observe a moment of silent contemplation ... ... thank you for your kind attention. This moment has been duly noted on your timecards and will be deducted from your pay. That is all. Yes, The Colonel is dead. And the Internet mourns the passing of a truly magnificent animal. An animal who struck fear into the hearts of lesser beings. An animal who became an icon. An animal who routinely pooped in his own fur. ""Bask, I say! Bask in the glory of my partially digested Fancy Feast!"" Though the ever-scowling Colonel Meow may not have been quite as world-famous and instantly recognizable as Grumpy Cat, he was definitely first. And definitely the greatest. And, most of all, he was the scariest. You see, whereas Grumpy Cat generally looked bothered and forlorn, Colonel Meow was proud, plotting and evil, as though he might actually murder a small human just for sport. Slowly. While listening to ""O Fortuna."" To the Internet world he was an ""adorable fearsome dictator"" whose toothy anger-face ruled over all mankind. Not bad for a cat of humble roots. And with no testicles. Colonel Meow's rise to power started in a roadside gutter -- sad, scared, and alone. And not completely dissimilar to how I spend my weekends. (Things are weird at home.) Eventually rescued from the mean streets, he was taken in by the Seattle Himalayan and Persian Society, and later adopted at Petco by a loving human named Anna Marie Avey. Who soon became known simply as ""Slave Beast."" Colonel Meow's true rise to power began when Avey and her husband, Eric Rosario, began posting images of him on Instagram. Almost immediately, he was a star, and The Colonel commanded allegiance from a growing number of faithful admirers. His minions. And though he didn't actually accomplish much during his reign -- save for countless naps and a finely-developed palate for Scotch -- Colonel Meow did, however, leave this world with at least one true medal of honor. He holds the Guinness World Record for ""cat with the longest fur."" In fact, three independent vets measured and confirmed his coat, which averaged out to 22.89 centimeters. That's roughly 9 inches of furry greatness. Now, not only was he the world's angriest cat, he was also the fluffiest. So fluffy you could die. Which, if those were his wishes, you most certainly would. But Colonel Meow also had a gentle side, which sort of reads like my profile on Christian Mingle. He was scared of the things he coughed up. He liked to be held. And he enjoyed having his butt scratched. And, somewhat surprisingly, he also had an unexpected best friend named Boots -- a golden retriever he lovingly described on Facebook as ""stupid."" But, mostly, Colonel Meow was fearsome. And powerful. And for a brief, incredible moment in time, it was truly The Colonel's world. The rest of us just got to live in it. I chose not to wear pants. However, in November 2013, it all came crashing down. Colonel Meow suddenly became ill and was hospitalized with heart problems. And only a couple months later, he was gone. Grumpy Cat responded to the news on Twitter: Rest in peace @colonel_meow. A grumpy day indeed. #RIPColonelMeow . Another Internet-famous cat, Lil Bub, also expressed her condolences: Dear @colonel_meow -- You are without question the most regal feline I have ever known. See you in space dear friend. And space is exactly where Colonel Meow now looks down upon his minions, a proud and regal cat floating through eternity. Slowly. While listening to ""O Fortuna.""

"(CNN) -- Akilah Monifa wasn't a foodie until she lost 222 pounds. The San Francisco-based communications director says she never used to taste her food. She ate mainly to feed an addiction. ""I ate a lot of junk, and I wasn't mindful about what I ate,"" Monifa said. But unlike with drugs or alcohol, where an addict can stop the behavior that they are addicted to, she knew she couldn't stop eating. So she decided instead to stop eating and drinking out of habit. She started with small changes. She gave up diet soda first. For her it was a real sacrifice. ""I would drink maybe six to eight Diet Cokes a day. I know people think it's OK to drink since it doesn't have calories, but I realized I never really had it on its own,"" Monifa said. ""I was usually rinsing down a big bag of chips with it."" So she gave up chips. After that she stopped eating the M&Ms, their bright colors always taunting her from the bowl at a woman's desk outside her office door. The tipping point . At her heaviest, Monifa weighed over 400 pounds. She says there was no one moment when she realized she needed to lose weight. The knowledge came in small waves. Her daughter complained she walked too slow. She couldn't join her friends on rides at the amusement park because she exceeded the weight limits. When she flew she had to use a seatbelt extender and actually got bumped once from a flight. When she got off the plane the gate agent told her he would put it in her profile that she had to buy two seats. Monifa, 57, doesn't know exactly how she put on the weight. She just knows she gained about 10 to 15 pounds a year after the age of 15. ""I don't know at what point I remember thinking, 'Woops, I'm over 200 pounds now,'"" Monifa said. Subconsciously, she may have been avoiding situations where she'd have to confront it. ""I then started telling myself things like, 'I'll never weigh more than 200 pounds. Then it became I'll never weigh more than 250, then 300, then 350. Then it became 400,"" Monifa said. Her mother, and then her partner, bought her clothes. She stopped weighing herself when she got to 389 pounds. She later realized she had even stopped looking in the mirror. ""There was a window on a department store, and I remember seeing someone out of the corner of my eye and thinking 'Who is that big fat person behind me?' It slowly dawned on me. That was me."" The surgery . She decided she had to do something drastic. She looked into gastric bypass; a friend had lost 110 pounds with the surgery. With gastric bypass, doctors create a small pouch at the top of your stomach and bypass the rest to send food straight to the small intestine. The walnut-sized pouch can only hold about an ounce of food. ""Right when I was thinking about it, I got a call from a friend who said that woman had passed,"" Monifa said. ""I put the surgery off. I wasn't losing my life over it."" Three years ago, she worked up the nerve to look into it again. Her insurance covered a program at Stanford. It started on the right note with a lecture from the physician who would do her surgery. He said he had done 2,000 surgeries and had no fatalities. He was also from Alabama, which is where Monifa grew up. ""I took that as a sign that it was going to be OK,"" she said. In August 2012, she had surgery. She weighed 330 pounds. The first two weeks weren't bad. She didn't mind the liquid, high-protein diet. She soon graduated to eating small quantities. But then she slipped into an old habit. She was running late on the way to the gym. She stopped at a drive-thru. After one bite she threw up. That's when she gave up fast food for good. By the time she went back to work in October she was down to 280 pounds. ""None of the clothes I had fit, so I posted that on Facebook and people started giving me clothes in vast quantities. People were so incredibly supportive."" They were also confused. ""It's funny, when people hear that you have had gastric bypass, it's almost like they think you've had liposuction and had the fat removed, but that's not the case,"" Monifa said. ""A lot of what helps you lose weight afterward are all the changes you have to make."" She eats five or six small meals a day and takes advantage of San Francisco's reputation as an inventive mecca for foodies. She now enjoys fresh vegetables from the farmer's market or a new take on a classic Asian dish. She'll eat anything baked, broiled or grilled. She eats slowly to enjoy the taste and the smell and the quality. And if she does get a craving, she'll eat a tiny amount of something rather than the entire container. ""I bought a quart of vanilla ice cream when I moved into my place a year ago, and it is still there,"" Monifa said. Group therapy helped. Setting exercise goals did, too. Her step counter reminds her to get at least 10,000 steps each day. And she didn't just join one gym, she joined two. A 24-hour facility by her house in Oakland and a gym right down the street from work in San Francisco. ""Since that one is a lot of money, it motivates me to go every day,"" Monifa said. ""And it feels like a treat. It's that fancy. I feel like a woman of luxury on the scene."" Socializing now is about activity, rather than food. She takes walks with friends and plays basketball with her son. She plays tennis and swims. When she does dine out she looks at the menu online and decides what healthy option to have ahead of time so she's not tempted. She cuts her meal into a smaller portion and takes the leftovers home. The true transformation . The 5-foot-11-inch woman is down to 179 pounds. Her goal used to be 190. ""I feel good, and I feel healthy,"" Monifa said. Her sleep apnea equipment and high blood pressure medicine are gone. Her lower back and joint pain disappeared. And she takes the time to celebrate what she calls the NSVs: the little non-scale victories. Signing up for a charity walk, she relished when the staff insisted she take a medium T-shirt rather than her request for ""the largest size you have."" She tucks in her shirt now, showing off her waist. She has even started to date. And finally, after all these years, she looks in the mirror. ""I've never felt good about myself, about my looks. Now I feel like I could attract someone. My friend from college jokes that it is time I should be in a lesbian power couple, but really now I just want someone who can hold their own with me in this world. ""I finally see that I'm worth it.""","Akilah Monifa went from more than 400 pounds to 178 .
Her sleep apnea is gone, and she doesn't need high blood pressure medicine .
Actually tasting her food and really seeing herself made the difference ."
"(CNN) -- Los Angeles firefighters spent Monday morning battling two fires, both in apartment buildings: one under construction, the other under renovation, fire officials said. A 911 caller reported the first fire at 906 N. Fremont Ave. just before 1:30 a.m. The location was directly across the street from a fire station. ""That address had a multistory apartment building under construction, a total of seven floors in the wood-frame stage, approximately 1.3 million square feet of area space,"" Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas said. ""More than two-thirds of (the building) was on fire, causing significant exposure issues for two nearby high-rise buildings,"" he added. It took 250 firefighters to get the massive blaze under control. No one was injured. CNN iReporter Andrew Gottesman lives close to the scene. He told CNN he saw the fire from his window and it ""seemed incredibly large."" Gottesman described the inferno as scary sight. ""It was incredibly nerve racking being so close, and I actually was expecting to have to evacuate my building."" 'Incredibly large' blaze . ""The cause is under investigation, and the loss is being tabulated. We estimate that it will be in the multimillion-dollars of loss range,"" Terrazas said. The second fire was reported in a smaller apartment building about eight blocks away on West Seventh Street just after 4 a.m. Fire officials don't know whether the blazes are related, but it took 100 firefighters to get the second fire under control . The fires also caused traffic headaches. Parts of the 110 and 101 freeways were closed as fire crews battled the flames.

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts pharmacy linked to a meningitis outbreak says its cleaning contractor should share blame for the apparent mishap that left dozens dead nationwide. The New England Compounding Center sent a letter to UniFirst Corp. demanding it share responsibility for a tainted steroid used to treat pain and inflammation, according to a filing this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission. UniFirst Corp. acknowledged that it provided ""once-a-month cleaning services,"" but added that the pharmacy's claims are ""without merit,"" the filing says. Last week, the compounding center announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. The company said that it ""seeks to establish a fund to compensate individuals and families affected"" by the outbreak, which has been linked to 39 fatalities among the 656 cases tallied in 19 states. Patients contracted fungal meningitis -- which results in inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord -- after their spines were injected with a contaminated, preservative-free steroid called methylprednisolone acetate, health officials have said. According to health agencies, the compounding center did not follow proper sterilization procedures and distributed its products without knowing whether they had passed sterility tests. Owner of firm linked to deadly meningitis outbreak takes Fifth before Congress . In addition, it distributed vials containing a steroid that was contaminated with ""visible black particulate matter"" later identified as fungus, according to a report from the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy. The contamination problem came to light in the fall, after the first fungal meningitis cases were reported. The New England Compounding Center voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid in September. In October, the pharmacy board, which is part of the state's Department of Public Health, said it had ""identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk."" The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said they have identified bacterial and/or fungal contamination in unopened vials of some of the compounding center's products. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is looking into what went wrong at the company and why it was allowed to continue to function despite a history of problems. FDA: Problems found at another facility of sister company of pharmacy tied to meningitis . Federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the practices at the Framingham-based company, and the state pharmacy board has voted to permanently revoke the company's license to operate as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists. Symptoms of fungal meningitis can include headache, fever, nausea, stiff neck, weakness or numbness anywhere in the body, slurred speech, pain or swelling at the injection site and sensitivity to light, according to the CDC. Treatment, which can have toxic side effects, is expected to continue for infected patients for ""many months,"" Dr. John Jernigan told reporters last month.

"Washington (CNN) -- Secret Service investigators interviewed Omar Gonzalez twice, well before he scaled a White House fence with a large knife in his pocket, determining both times that they didn't have enough reason to keep him, a law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. Gonzaelez, a 42-year-old Iraq war veteran who apparently suffers from PTSD, hopped the north fence late last Friday and sprinted just inside the north portico White House doors before being stopped, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary has said. At the time -- which happened to be mere minutes after President Barack Obama and his daughters flew via helicopter from the South Lawn to Camp David -- Gonzalez had a Spyderco VG-10 folding knife with a 3Â½-inch serrated blade in his pants, according to an affidavit. In his car, he had more than 800 rounds of ammunition, two hatchets and a machete. Secret Service beefs up presence . An official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said soon after the incident that Gonzalez was known to the Secret Service even if he hadn't been arrested by the agency before. On Tuesday, the details of these interactions became clearer. Investigators from the Secret Service -- whose mission includes protecting U.S. leaders -- interviewed Gonzalez after his July 19 arrest in Wythe County, Virginia, on charges of possessing a shotgun and sniper rifle as well as eluding and evading arrest. Virginia State Police contacted the Secret Service after tying Gonzalez to a map with a circle around the White House or a line pointing to it, said the law enforcement official. The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also notified. The discovery of the map led Secret Service investigators to ask Gonzalez standard protective intelligence questions and then let him go after determining that he did not pose a threat to the President, according to the law enforcement official. ""That could easily be explained as somebody who wants to tour DC,"" the official said of the map, explaining why it wasn't tied to any devious plot. Just over a month later, on August 25, Secret Service agents stopped Gonzalez outside the White House's South Lawn after noticing he was carrying a camping hatchet. The agency knew then of the Virginia incident, and the related Secret Service interview, from the previous month, the law enforcement official said. Once again, Secret Service investigators talked to Gonzalez at the agency's Washington field office. The law enforcement official said that -- after getting permission from Gonzalez -- the Secret Service found empty gun cases in his car. Investigators figured the cases were empty because Gonzalez's guns were seized in the July arrest, the official said. When asked why the Secret Service didn't detain Gonzalez at this point, the law enforcement official responded, ""For what? ... We can't randomly commit people."" Gonzalez's former stepson, Jerry S. Murphy, told CNN's Mary Grace Lucas that Gonzalez suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and paranoia. Murphy said Gonzalez's mental state seemed to deteriorate after each of his three deployments to Iraq. The Secret Service is reviewing security policies and procedures in light of last Friday's incident at the White House, as well as one the following day. In that separate incident Saturday, a man -- identified by Leary as New Jersey resident Kevin Carr -- was arrested on an unlawful entry charge after he allegedly drove up to a security barrier and tried to walk to and enter the White House. In addition to its internal review, the Secret Service in recent days has done things such as increasing the number of officers patrolling near the White House and boosting surveillance measures. The agency has also set up a makeshift fence -- basically bike racks zip-tied together -- along the North Lawn as a temporary response to Friday's incident, according to the law enforcement official.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- At the gadget industry's annual crystal-ball convention, laptops look more like products of Aston Martin than Fisher-Price. With sales of budget laptops plummeting, computer makers are swinging the pendulum toward sleeker, metallic and pricier portable PCs that they're calling Ultrabooks. Many of these were shown for the first time here this week at the International Consumer Electronics Show. Most PC giants have committed to building Ultrabooks. The laptops typically use flash memory instead of hard drives, have no disc readers in order to stay thin, and weigh less than three pounds. Some computer makers see Ultrabooks as an evolution of the laptop in response to demands created by lightweight tablet computers. This view is even shared by PC companies that produce tablets of their own. ""We have learned a lot from the tablet,"" Lenovo Group CEO Yang Yuanqing said in an interview. ""I don't think the desktop will die."" Similarly, Dell CEO Michael Dell told an audience in Bangalore, India, on Monday that tablets and smartphones are not a preferable way to browse the Web compared to computers. Dell has not had success in the smartphone market and failed in its brief foray into tablets, though the company plans to return this year, Reuters reports. Lenovo, the second-largest PC maker, makes tablets based on Google's Android software but has not had much success with them. ""The tablet is a niche market,"" Yuanqing said. ""People still cannot give up the keyboard and the larger screen."" Ultrabooks often draw comparisons to Apple's MacBook Air, which sells well in spite of the iPad's continued dominance of the tablet computing market. Apple is expected to increase its sales of that line of laptops to 8.9 million next year, but competitors are expected to sell about 10 million Ultrabooks, according to International Strategy & Investment Group analyst Brian Marshall. The Ultrabook's prospects for bolstering the PC industry come at an opportune time. Global shipments of PCs fell 1.4% compared to the same three-month period last year, according to industry research firm Gartner. The rare decline comes amid a slowdown in computer demand from the United States and Europe, the Gartner report said. Companies such as Dell and Acer, the third- and fourth-largest Windows PC vendors respectively, were major proponents of netbooks and happened to be among those hit the hardest. Analysts have suggested that the past success of netbooks was a fad born in a bleaker economy and that consumers are now turning away from lower-quality equipment. Sprint Nextel plans to take a cautious approach rather than throwing its support behind the emerging Ultrabooks trend, Fared Adib, the company's product chief, said in an interview. Sprint had sold cellular-equipped netbooks at its stores but got burned when customer interest evaporated. ""Instead of jumping in and being a first mover, sometimes be a follower,"" Adib said. Yet, the computer industry is embracing the Ultrabook, and at CES, the laptops have been met with enthusiasm. Hewlett-Packard announced that the Envy 14 Spectre will arrive in stores on February 8 costing $1,400. The 14-inch laptop has reflective, black Gorilla Glass on its lid and weighs less than four pounds. Lenovo showed off several new Ultrabooks at CES. All laptops are poised to be like Ultrabooks in the future, said Yuanqing, the Lenovo CEO. However, ""the price is the main obstacle,"" he said. The IdeaPad Yoga from Lenovo, typically a bargain brand in the United States, won some fans at CES despite its $1,200 price tag. The laptop's screen can bend backwards creating a stand for watching video or transforming into a traditional touchscreen tablet. It will be available in the second half of the year, after the launch of Microsoft's Windows 8, Yuanqing said. Dell's Ultrabook may be the most practical option for many consumers. The XPS 13 has an aluminum lid and weighs about three pounds. It won major praise for its price, $999, and overall features, which includes the ability to download e-mail while the laptop is in sleep mode. ARM Holdings, the mobile chip maker that will enter the PC market this year when Microsoft adopts its architecture in Windows 8, welcomes the move toward slimmer computers. But the Ultrabook is a creation of Intel, a competitor of ARM. ""Ultrabooks is really just a marketing concept built around the success of Apple's fashionable products,"" ARM CEO Warren East said in an interview. ARM was created as a joint venture in 1990 that included Apple, which now uses ARM chips in the iPhone and iPad, though not in laptops. Intel had pressed its partners to invest in lighter, high-end laptops, and those negotiations are now paying off. To promote Ultrabooks at its CES news conference, Intel brought on Black Eyed Peas band member Will.i.am, who described Ultrabooks as ""the new ghetto blaster.""","Ultrabooks have drummed up buzz at CES .
Ultrabooks are slimmer, lighter and metallic laptops .
The initiative is being led by Intel, the PC chip maker ."

"Cairo (CNN) -- Anti-government protesters defied Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy's curfew order in cities along the Suez Canal and clashed with police and troops in restive Port Said, state-run news outlets reported early Tuesday. Twenty minutes after the 9 p.m. curfew began, demonstrators chanted, ""With our souls, with our blood, we will sacrifice for you, Port Said,"" state-run television reported. Egyptian troops beat back an attempt by a half-dozen armed gunmen to storm a prison in Port Said, where dozens of people were killed in clashes over the weekend, according to the news service EgyNews. Nine people were injured in earlier clashes at a police station, said Abdel Rahman Farah, a supervisor of Port Said Hospitals. In the port city of Alexandria, west of Port Said, protesters sat on train tracks, disrupting rail travel at the Sidi Gaber station. There were also anti-government demonstrations in Cairo, and protesters took to the streets of Suez and clashed with security forces, state-run Nile TV reported. Morsy declared a limited state of emergency for hot spots Sunday and announced a 30-day nighttime curfew for the provinces of Port Said, Ismailia and Suez. The Islamist-dominated Shura Council approved Morsy's declaration of the state of emergency in the three governorates. The legislative body also granted the armed forces judicial powers to ""safeguard state institutions against saboteurs and restore security."" The embattled country's latest cycle of violence stemmed from two seemingly unrelated events. On Friday, the second anniversary of the 2011 Egyptian revolution, protesters angry with the slow pace of change as well as anti-Morsy demonstrators fought with his supporters and police in cities such as Suez and Ismailia. At least seven people were killed in those clashes, including several by gunfire. It was not immediately clear who was responsible. Then on Saturday, a judge issued death sentences for 21 people from Port Said for their roles in a football game riot last year. Those sentences sparked deadly clashes between security forces and relatives of the convicted, some of whom tried to storm the prison in Port Said. At least 38 people, including civilians and soldiers, have been killed there in the past two days. In a speech Sunday night, Morsy decried the behavior of ""criminals,"" saying recent violence ""does not have anything to do with the Egyptian revolution. ... In fact, it is against the revolution."" But he acknowledged the legitimate dissent in Egypt, saying ""dialogue is the only way to bring about stability and security."" To this end, he invited representatives from 11 political parties to a meeting Monday. But a key opposition leader issued conditions before accepting Morsy's call for dialogue. ""Without accepting his responsibility as a president for the latest bloody events, promising to form a government of national salvation and commissioning a balanced committee to amend the constitution, any dialogue will be a waste of time,"" said Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the Constitution Party and a member of the opposition National Salvation Front. On Sunday, the National Salvation Front called for ""peaceful protests"" and held the president responsible ""for the excessive violence used by security forces against protesters,"" according to a statement posted on the state-run Al-Ahram news website. The group made several demands before it would urge people to stop protesting, including the formation of a new government and making changes to what it called the ""distorted constitution"" that voters passed, in a referendum, last month. Morsy's supporters warned the opposition against such demands Monday. ""We would like for the political forces, especially the National Salvation Front, to realize how important this defining moment is and to put the interest of the nation above all,"" said Gamal Tag, senior leader of the Freedom and Justice Party, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. ""They need to know that President Morsy's call for dialogue is not out of weakness, but it is out of his responsibility as president. ... Some forces are still putting conditions and obstacles before this national dialogue in order to make it fail. These people do not put forward the national interest. They are looking for personal gains."" The latest strife comes as Egyptians mark the second anniversary of one of the most violent and significant days in the Egyptian revolution. January 28, 2011, was dubbed the ""Friday of Rage"" because thousands of peaceful protesters seeking an end to President Hosni Mubarak's three-decade rule in Cairo were met with excessive force. It was also the day that Mubarak cut off Internet and cell phone service as many Egyptians decided to join the revolution seeking his ouster. Some liberal factions are calling Monday the ""Monday of Rage,"" and groups such as the National Salvation Front plan to demonstrate near Cairo's Tahrir Square in memory of those killed two years ago. Amir Ahmed reported Atlanta, and Reza Sayah reported from Cairo. CNN's Holly Yan, Greg Botelho, Yasmin Amer and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","NEW: Troops push back attempt to storm a prison in Port Said .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Reality TV star Tila Tequila said she wants to bankrupt organizers of the ""Gathering of the Juggalos"" festival where an angry crowd attacked her with rocks and bottles last weekend. ""I'm hoping this will be the last juggalos gathering that they will ever have,"" Tequila said Monday in an interview with E-Online. Her lawyer is preparing to sue the festival, which is organized for fans of the hip-hop group Insane Clown Posse. Festival organizers did not respond to CNN requests for a response. This was the event's 11th year, the fourth in rural Hardin County, Illinois. Cuts on the Playboy model and singer's face required stitches. And her body is covered with bruises, she said. An angry crowd pelted Tequila with rocks, bottles and human excrement as she performed early Saturday, she said. ""If you just look at these people, or monsters, whatever they are, they looked very angry and violent,"" Tequila said. Video obtained by CNN showed Tequila standing her ground on stage for several minutes, continuing to perform her songs while several bodyguards tried to protect her. ""I'm not going anywhere,"" she shouted back. The assault subsided briefly when comedian Tom Green, who had performed earlier, diverted the crowd's attention with a dance. After Green left the stage, a large rock soared from the crowd, striking Tequila's face. Blood streamed down her cheek. Green described a mob of hundreds chasing Tequila from the stage and surrounding a trailer where she sought refuge. They rocked the trailer and smashed its windows, he said. Tequila eventually escaped, but only after windows in her sports utility vehicle were smashed, according to the local sheriff. The fans are mostly young people who sometimes wear clown make up and are referred to as juggalos and juggalettes.","Tequila plans to sue ""Gathering of the Juggalos"" organizers .

"London (CNN) -- Four men were arrested Tuesday in London on suspicion of planning an act of terrorism, one that the city's police commissioner described as ""quite a serious case."" Armed police officers assisted in the arrests of the men -- two of whom are 20 years old, while the others are 21 -- according to London's Metropolitan Police. It is rare for police in Britain to execute warrants accompanied by armed officers, unless the threat is deemed serious. A UK security source said Tuesday that authorities may have foiled a terror plot aimed at Britain in its early stages. Islamic terrorism was ""the clear reason"" for the plot, according to the source. Scotland Yard has announced that the four are being held on suspicion related to the ""commission, preparation or instigation of act of terrorism."" Authorities have not detailed exactly where or when such terrorist attacks might have occurred or what or who they might have involved. The arrests come nearly two weeks after police arrested at least 10 other men in the United Kingdom on suspicion of terror offenses, including supporting a banned organization and encouraging terrorism. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, in an interview with BBC local radio, said a lot of recent arrests are ""linked back to Syria and Iraq."" That is where the Islamist extremist group ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, has waged a bloody and largely successful campaign to take over vast swaths of land -- while terrorizing and, in many cases, killing those civilians who don't subscribe to its extreme brand of Islam in the process. Two British aid workers are believed to have been beheaded by ISIS, in addition to a pair of Americans. Britain is among the nations that have gone after the Islamist extremist group militarily in Iraq, while the United States and some of its allies are targeting the group inside Syria. ""These are arrests that, some way or other, have that link,"" Hogan-Howe said of the Syrian and Iraq tie. 10 arrests in late September . As of Tuesday night, authorities hadn't released the names of the four men arrested. Nor is it known what their future will hold. ""They have all been taken to police stations in central London and remain in custody,"" Metropolitan Police said. Even after the arrests, officers searched other homes and vehicles in west and central London as part of the investigation, authorities said. Police didn't say whether Tuesday's moves were connected to the September 25 and September 26 arrests of 10 other men. Those men, ages 22 to 51, were detained in London and elsewhere in the country on suspicion of being members of a banned organization, supporting a banned organization and encouraging terrorism. An 11th man was arrested September 26 on suspicion of assisting an offender. Police did not give the identities of those arrested in September nor name the banned organization concerned. But the UK's Press Association news agency cited sources as saying radical British cleric Anjem Choudary was among those arrested. Choudary, who was a co-founder of the banned UK Islamist group Al Muhajiroun, told CNN in August that the world had been split into two camps. There's a ""camp which believes that sovereignty and supremacy belongs to God. They are the Islamic State, at the head of which is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,"" Choudary said. ""In the other camp you have those people who believe sovereignty and supremacy belongs to man. At the head of that camp is Barack Obama."" ""I believe this Islamic State will spread, rapidly, and I believe it will be in Europe and even America within decades,"" Choudary said. The self-proclaimed Islamic State, commonly referred to as ISIS or ISIL, is a Sunni Muslim extremist group that has captured parts of Syria and Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate. The British military recently joined a U.S.-led bombing campaign against ISIS in Iraq. The United States and some Middle Eastern nations also are conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. UK authorities believe at least 500 British citizens have gone to Iraq and Syria, many of them to fight with ISIS and other Islamist groups -- and that most will try to return, bringing their extremist views with them. The UK Home Office raised its terror threat level in August from ""substantial"" to ""severe."" Days later, the government announced new measures to combat the threat from Islamist extremism, including the banning of Britons' coming home once they have joined with jihadists abroad. CNN's Victoria Eastwood reported from London and Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Was it the end of the world at the summer box office? There certainly was plenty of destruction to go around. Not only were several cities destroyed, including San Francisco (""Godzilla"") and Chicago (""Transformers: Age of Extinction""), there was also the kind of destruction Hollywood hates: that of their receipts. Summer ticket sales, as of the last week in August, were down 15% over summer 2013, according to The New York Times, quoting movie business tabulator Rentrak. For movies released in the May-August window, grosses were down a whopping 25% -- $3.67 billion this year vs. $4.85 billion last year, according to boxofficemojo.com. Nonetheless, with the exceptions of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and a handful of others, there was an ""eh"" feeling to much of what hit the multiplex between May and August of this year. CGI carnage, gross-out comedy, comic-book saviors: Haven't we seen this movie before? Consider this: 2014 was the first summer since 2001 in which there was no movie that topped $300 million domestically. Studios like to tout $200 million as a blockbuster benchmark, but $300 million is real high-flying territory: ""The Avengers,"" the ""Iron Man"" films, ""The Dark Knight,"" films with what they call ""legs,"" that create return business and draw in some lukewarm moviegoers. (To be fair, ""Guardians"" may still get there.) As Forbes' Scott Mendelson notes, there were various reasons for the down summer, and not all of them were bad: Some planned films were rescheduled, and others were aimed as much at overseas markets as at the United States. (The mediocre ""Amazing Spider-Man 2"" barely cracked $200 million in the United States but earned another $500 million in international markets.) Still, the results provide a great deal of food for thought. Here are a few points to ponder: . 1. Don't reach for the stars. Tom Cruise (""Edge of Tomorrow""), Adam Sandler (""Blended"") and Melissa McCarthy (""Tammy"") couldn't carry their respective movies to blockbuster territory. Only Angelina Jolie (""Maleficent"") succeeded, with Scarlett Johansson (""Lucy"") getting an honorable mention. However, it might be worth it to keep an eye on Shailene Woodley, the up-and-coming light of ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Sure, the film was based on a beloved book, but the film's success caught many observers by surprise -- and Woodley was at the center of it all. With her previous turn in the equally successful ""Divergent,"" she's coming on strong. 2. Blow it up good! As mentioned, destruction was high on Hollywood's list, especially when Michael Bay is involved. The Bay-directed ""Transformers"" stomped on the planet again, ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (produced by Bay) did some damage and ""Godzilla"" visited San Francisco. But more than destruction, apocalypse was in the air: witness ""Edge of Tomorrow,"" ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""The Purge: Anarchy."" And we go to the movies to escape from real life? 3. Comedy was not pretty. Only two movies topped $100 million domestically among comedies this summer: ""Neighbors,"" with the sneaky, shambling Seth Rogen, and ""22 Jump Street."" The latter was an interesting twist on the sequel, a follow-up that knew it was a follow-up and took every opportunity to make that the source of the comedy. (In going along for the ride, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube were excellent self-parodies.) But ""Tammy"" performed tepidly (though some may disagree), ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" found one more way to go and ""Sex Tape"" was erased. You know what they say: Dying is easy, comedy is hard. 4. Look to the East. Who needs the USA? ""Transformers"" had a relatively mediocre turnout in America, grossing less than $250 million -- good enough to become the No. 2 film of the summer, but only No. 4 among the four ""Transformers"" films. On the other hand, overseas the film picked up $821 million -- including more than $300 million in China, becoming that country's highest-grossing film of all time. That was no accident: China is the second biggest film market in the world, and Hollywood is catering to it more and more. 5. Time is your friend. Perhaps the most talked-about film of the summer -- at least in markets where it has played -- is ""Boyhood,"" Richard Linklater's ode to one child's growing up. Linklater took a risk in deciding to follow his protagonist, played by Ellar Coltrane, and his other actors for 12 years, trusting that a film shot over that time would come together. It worked beautifully, with a 99% critics' approval on RottenTomatoes.com and early Oscar talk. In the past, watching someone age in a film was a sociological curiosity: witness Michael Apted's ""Up"" films, which have revisited a group of students every seven years. Now that we're in the YouTube age, in which every part of our lives is put on video, it'll be interesting to see if Linklater's concept becomes more normalized.","No movie topped $300 million, but there were no ""Lone Ranger""-level flops, either .

"(CNN) -- It's an early Christmas for Madonna fans. The singer didn't plan on releasing her new album ""Rebel Heart"" anytime soon, but that all changed after unfinished versions of her newest songs found their way on the Internet. Early mixes from the Queen of Pop's 13th album had been leaked, and longtime manager Guy Oseary asked the public to help find those responsible. Madonna fired back by officially releasing six new tracks Saturday morning, which are now up for sale on iTunes. In a tweet, the singer wrote, ""Happy early X-Mas!"" and linked to where people go could to purchase her new songs. The tracks available immediately for download include ""Living for Love,"" an upbeat anthem, ""Devil Pray,"" a haunting composition, ""Ghosttown,"" an emotional mantra, ""Illuminati,"" an electronic orchestra of melodies, as well as two other songs. Madonna took to Instagram this past week, thanking fans for not listening to the tracks floating around online. ""Thank you for not listening! Thank you for your loyalty! Thank you for waiting and if you have heard please know they are unfinished demos stolen long ago and not ready to be presented to the world,"" she wrote in her post. Earlier this month, the singer posted a photo of her smashed iPod on Instagram after discovering the leak of her track ""Rebel Heart."" In her post she wrote, ""This broken ipod is a symbol of my broken heart! That my music has been stolen and leaked! I have been violated as a human and an artist!"" Leaks have tormented Madonna in the past. In 2003, the singer's website was defaced and every song off her ""American Life"" album was leaked online. Rolling Stone reported that Madonna had wanted her newest single, ""Living for Love,"" to be released on Valentine's Day, with the rest of the album coming out in spring.","Demos from Madonna's newest album were leaked online .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Fess Parker, best known for playing Daniel Boone in a 1960s television series, died Thursday at his home near Santa Barbara, California, his publicist said. He was 85. Parker followed his acting career with successful hotel and winery ventures around Santa Barbara. A statement issued by his family did not reveal the cause of death. Parker is survived by his wife of 50 years, Marcella, their son and daughter, 11 grandchildren and one great-grandchild who ""spent a great deal of time with Fess in his final months and weeks,"" the statement said. A native of Texas, Parker served in the U.S. Navy during World War II before graduating from the University of Texas-Austin in 1950. He moved to Los Angeles in the early 1950s to pursue acting. Walt Disney cast Parker in the lead role of ""Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier,"" co-starring Buddy Ebsen. He followed that with several more Disney films, including ""Davy Crockett and the River Boat Pirates,"" ""The Great Locomotive Chase"" and ""Smoky."" His TV career took off in 1964 with the title role in NBC's ""Daniel Boone,"" which aired for for six seasons. When the series ended in 1970, Parker became a real estate developer in Santa Barbara. ""After successfully opening three high-end mobile home parks, the 360-room Fess Parker Doubletree Resort opened in 1985,"" the family statement said. ""It is one of the most successful hotels on the Santa Barbara waterfront."" Parker and his family also opened Fess Parker Winery on the Foxen in Los Olivos, California.

"(CNN) -- He was the so-called ""Fastest Man on No Legs,"" and his inspiring story captured the imagination of the world at the London Olympics. Now, Pistorius is playing the lead role in a more tragic tale that began in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013. The Olympic and Paralympic sprinter is facing a maximum five-year prison sentence after he was found guilty of the negligent killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on February 14, 2013. He claimed he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder and was cleared of murder. Despite a seven-month trial, much remains in question about what happened at his upmarket home in Pretoria, South Africa around 4 a.m. that Thursday morning, leaving stunned fans at a loss to explain how their hero could have fallen so far and so fast. Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow in the last few weeks before his sentencing, Pistorius told her that he was ""not scared to go to jail."" But it may prove to be the greatest challenge yet for a man who's already overcome many difficulties. Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius, 27, had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday, but through sheer determination carved out a career in world-class athletics. In 2012, he became the first double amputee to compete against able-bodied runners at the London 2012 Olympics, adding to his fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" a reference to his carbon fiber prosthetic legs. While he failed to win a medal, Pistorius' presence on the track was hailed as a triumph over adversity and a victory over critics who claimed his blades gave him an unfair advantage over the able-bodied. He did take home medals from the Paralympic Games. For many, he was an example of what could be achieved through a potent mix of determination, positivity and skill. Who is Oscar Pistorius, really? Soon after his arrest, the athlete's image was pulled from billboards across South Africa. Sponsors suspended their deals as admirers questioned whether Pistorius' sporting successes had perhaps obscured a more complex character off the track. Was Pistorius violent? On the edge? In a story titled ""The Fast Life of Oscar Pistorius"" published in the New York Times, writer Michael Sokolove wrote: ""Pistorius is, as well, blessed with an uncommon temperament -- a fierce, even frenzied need to take on the world at maximum speed and with minimum caution."" After the shooting, a police spokeswoman said there had been ""previous incidents"" at Pistorius' home, including ""allegations of a domestic nature,"" but did not say what they had been. Besides the five-year prison term for culpable homicide, the athlete was also given a three-year sentence, suspended for five years, on a weapons charge stemming from an incident in which he discharged a loaded firearm in a restaurant. The sprinter moved into his uncle Arnold's house in Pretoria after the shooting. Video surfaced last June of Pistorius training, but he has not returned to the track in an official capacity. In an exclusive interview last summer, Arnold Pistorius said his nephew was heartbroken. ""What can you say if the person you love the most dies, and you were the instrument?"" he told CNN. ""How would you feel? It's unthinkable."" It was known that Pistorius owned guns. He was a keen shooter and despite his disability he was not afraid to take risks. During a visit to Pistorius' house a few years ago, he showed CNN images of himself water-skiing, scuba diving and quad bike riding. ""I grew up in a family where disability was never an issue. We didn't really speak about my disability, not because it was a topic that was taboo... it was just never an issue. And that's the mentality that I've had,"" Pistorius told CNN in late 2012. From a young age, Pistorius dedicated himself to being the best he could be at sport. ""I was never much of an academic at school so I had to find something which I enjoyed. I started sports and from a very young age, my mother said to us 'sports is not about being the best, but it's about giving your best.' Divided reaction . Support from Pistorius' family has been firm and unwavering since Steenkamp's death. ""We have no doubt there is no substance to the allegation and that the State's own case, including its own forensic evidence, strongly refutes any possibility of a premeditated murder or indeed any murder at all,"" said Arnold Pistorius before the athlete's conviction. Pistorius' agent, Peet Van Zyl, referred to the sprinter as his ""friend and a great professional athlete."" He said thousands of people had sent messages of support from all over the world in the wake of the shooting. Steenkamp's family is skeptical about the man who killed their daughter. Her father Barry Steenkamp told the Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld: ""It doesn't matter how rich [Pistorius] is ... and how good his legal team is. He needs to live with himself if he lets his legal team lie for him."" READ MORE: Oscar Pistorius' affidavit to court in full . ""But if he's telling the truth, I may forgive him one day,"" he said. But ''if it didn't happen as he described it, he should suffer. And he will suffer ... only he knows."" At the supermarket down the road from his house, parking attendant Andre Tsekedi told CNN last February that he saw Pistorius and Steenkamp a few days before the shooting: ""They were holding hands and looked so happy."" Another, Samuel Motau, described Pistorius as ""a very generous man."" ""He tipped us $10 every time. The only reason I never went to bed hungry was because of Oscar Pistorius."" Growing up . As a child, Pistorius competed in water polo, cricket, tennis, triathlons and Olympic wrestling and boxing, before he smashed his knee while playing rugby at the age of 16. He took up track running as part of his rehabilitation, and within one year he was covering 100 meters faster than the existing Paralympic world record. In 2004, Pistorius took his first gold at the Athens Paralympics and one year later competed against able-bodied Olympics for the first time, at the South African Championships. Pistorius' career on the track suffered a setback in 2009 when he suffered serious head injuries in a boating accident. It took him almost eight weeks to recover, a period of time the athlete has described as ""fairly difficult"" as it marked the first season in four or five years in which he didn't record a personal best. Soon after the London Olympics, Pistorius led his national team onto the track as South African flag-bearer in the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games. He went on to set a new world record in the 200-meter event but later suffered a shock defeat in the final, his first competitive loss over the distance in nine years. During the very last track event of the Paralympics, Pistorius again picked himself up and smashed the 400-meter T44 Paralympic record in a time of 46.68 to take gold. It ended a summer he later described as ""a dream come true,"" according to his website. Beyond the track . Pistorius' determination to succeed made him one of the world's most recognizable athletes. He appeared on the cover of men's magazine, GQ Style, under the headline ""Man of the Future,"" and was named on People magazine's 2012 list of ""Sexiest Man Alive."" According to his website, Pistorius is an ambassador for the Mineseeker Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to clear landmines worldwide. When asked about his thoughts on being a role model, Pistorius told CNN before the shooting: ""I think it's a massive blessing. ""Obviously, being an international sportsman, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that. So having to remember that there are kids out there, especially, that look up to you is definitely something that you need to keep at the back of your mind."" Pistorius has more than 300,000 followers on Twitter, tens of thousands of whom added in the days since his arrest last year. His account laid dormant for a year until the anniversary of Steenkamp's death in February, when he tweeted a link to ""a few words from my heart"" on his website. The message said: ""No words can adequately capture my feelings about the devastating accident that has caused such heartache for everyone who truly loved -- and continues to love Reeva. The pain and sadness -- especially for Reeva's parents, family and friends consumes me with sorrow. The loss of Reeva and the complete trauma of that day, I will carry with me for the rest of my life.""

"(CNN) -- Florida appears set to recognize same-sex marriages on January 6, after the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday declined to further delay a lower court's finding that the state's ban on the unions is unconstitutional. The high court Friday night, without explanation, rejected the Florida attorney general's request to intervene. A U.S. District judge in Florida had ruled in August the state's ban was unconstitutional but stayed the ruling to allow for appeals. The case hasn't been completely settled. Neither the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals nor the Supreme Court have ruled on the merits, and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has defended the ban, has expressed ""confusion"" over whether all 67 counties will issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples before appeals are settled. But the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida said it expects the state to fully recognize same-sex marriages when U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle's stay expires at the end of January 5. ""This is a thrilling day for all Florida families. As we explained to the court, every day that the ban remains in place, couples are suffering real harms,"" ACLU of Florida attorney Daniel Tilley said. ""We are grateful that the court recognized that, and that as a result, those days are finally coming to an end."" Florida would become the 36th state to recognize same-sex marriage, in addition to the District of Columbia. In August, Hinkle ruled the Florida ban -- first put into law in 1977 and written into the state's constitution after a 2008 referendum -- violates the ""due process"" and ""equal protection"" provisions in the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. His ruling applied to whether same-sex couples can marry in Florida as well as to whether such marriages elsewhere should be recognized in the Sunshine State. As part of the ruling, Hinkle ordered that Washington County, Florida, must issue a marriage license to two plaintiffs -- a same-sex couple -- who sued the state. He then stayed his own ruling, saying some time needed to pass to allow higher courts to reverse his decision. Bondi filed an appeal with the 11th Circuit. That court has yet to hear, or schedule a hearing on, arguments on the merits. Both Hinkle and the 11th Circuit declined this fall to extend the stay. On Monday, Bondi asked the high court to extend the delay until the state exhausted its appeals. ""The public is not served by on-again, off-again marriage laws,"" her office argued in this week's application. After the Supreme Court declined to intervene, Bondi issued a statement acknowledging January 5 as the stay's final day. But, earlier this week, she said that there would be ""confusion about the effect of (Hinkle's ruling), which is directed to only one of Florida's 67 clerks of court."" Bondi's statement didn't directly address her earlier county concerns. A Bondi spokeswoman did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Saturday on whether all 67 counties must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples once Hinkle's stay expires. Tilley, the ACLU of Florida attorney, indicated that he expects they will. ""We expect public officials in all of Florida's 67 counties to understand the significance of this development and look forward to full implementation of Judge Hinkle's decision across our state,"" Tilley said. U.S. district and circuit courts overturned many states' same-sex marriage bans after the Supreme Court rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 2013. One federal appeals court -- the Sixth Circuit -- upheld bans in Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and Kentucky in November, a move that could force the Supreme Court to take up the issue. CNN's Joe Sutton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Supreme Court declines to further delay judge's ruling that state's ban is unconstitutional .

"Washington (CNN) -- Supporting a congressional campaign usually means donating money, knocking on doors and making phone calls. Rarely does it mean acting like a nudist in a television ad that will be played throughout your community. That is, until the Kelly Kultala for Congress campaign asked exactly that from their supporters. Kultala, a Democrat running to oust Kansas Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, released an ad on Thursday that featured a handful of seemingly naked people urging viewers to support the Democrat in November's election. The people in the ad, however, are not actual nudists. They are supporters of the Kultala campaign who agreed to appear on TV with different objects in front of their naked bits. ""They are volunteers who agreed to do it because they support our campaign and our message,"" said Jacob Becklund, the Kultala campaign manager. "" It should also be noted that nobody was actually nude during filming."" According to Becklund, ""It was a pretty easy sell to all of our volunteers,"" even though the ad -- which comes with a ""high five figure (cost) behind it"" -- will be seen on cable and broadcast in the Kansas City market starting Friday. The (faux) nudity in the ad -- titled ""Naked Truth"" -- was a knock on Yoder, who in 2011 skinny dipped in the Sea of Galilee in Israel, a decision for which he was reprimanded by House Republicans in 2012. ""Awhile back, Congressman Yoder made news by skinny dipping on the job,"" Kultala says in the ad. ""But it is more shameless what he is doing to Kansas."" The ad then features the seemingly naked volunteers citing different aspects of Yoder's record, including that ""Yoder lines the pockets of his millionaire donors with big tax cuts. And they line his, when he has pockets."" ""We thought it was a humorous hook,"" Becklund said, "" to get people to pay attention to the message.""","Kelly Kultala for Congress campaign releases an ad with folks seemingly naked .

"(CNN) -- When CNN highlighted some excellent historic restaurants in major cities across the country last month, readers wondered why their small-town and smaller-city favorites didn't make the cut. Thus, in this follow-up tribute to more laudable veteran restaurants, we've zeroed in -- thanks to suggestions from our commenters -- on the decades-old, and in certain cases centuries-old, icons that thrive outside of America's biggest metropolises. Columbia Restaurant, 1905 . The Hernandez/Gonzmart family claims the title of Florida's oldest restaurant and America's oldest Spanish restaurant with their 107-year-old icon Columbia in the Ybor City area of Tampa. What started as a corner cafe for the cigar workers in town has ballooned into a 1,700-seat restaurant specializing in Cuban and Spanish cuisine. Live jazz and flamenco shows are offered on most nights, and the gift shop comes complete with cigar rolling demonstrations in the afternoon. The restaurant expanded with locations across Florida -- including one in Tampa International Airport -- but the locals still stop in here for the famous Cuban sandwiches, the 1905 salad, tossed tableside and the old-school Spanish decor. 2117 East 7th Avenue, Tampa, Florida (813) 248-4961 . Louis' Lunch, 1895 . The supposed originator of the hamburger, Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut, has been serving beef patties on white toast since before buns were even invented. Legend has it that in 1900, a customer asked the restaurant's founder, Louis Lassen, for a quick meal he could eat on the run. He broiled some steak trimmings, put them between two slices of bread, and voila, the burger was born. Over a hundred years later the lunch wagon has evolved into a squat, Victorian-looking restaurant, featuring wooden chairs and carved graffiti-ridden tables and a menu offering just four items: burgers, potato chips, potato salad and pie. The patties are placed on vertical, antique 1898 cast iron grills that cook the burgers on both sides simultaneously to medium rare. And don't ask for ketchup. Only three condiments are offered: cheese spread, tomatoes and onions. 261-263 Crown Street, New Haven, Connecticut (203) 562-5507 . Samoa Cookhouse, 1893 . Back in the heyday of logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, companies set up cookhouses to feed their workers. These mess halls/community centers offered three hot meals a day (and cold meals on Sundays) for an affordable price, served family style. The Louisiana-Pacific Samoa Cookhouse in Samoa, California, began as one such kitchen in 1893 and continues the tradition of serving affordable, family-style meals in a no-frills setting. Current menu items include French toast, pancakes and sausage for breakfast, chicken parm and pot roast for lunch, and roast beef, short ribs and ham for dinner. Those with a strong sense of nostalgia should check out the restaurant's museum on the second level, which is filled with old photographs along with logging and maritime relics. 908 Vance Avenue, Samoa, California (707) 442-1659 . Smackdown: Tampa Bay area boasts sandy shores, surrealism . Brookville Hotel, 1870 . When the Brookville Hotel, the home of famous, affordable and hearty fried chicken dinners, was forced to move locations in 2000 due to a sewage issue, the owners decided to make an exact replica of their former home, one their loyal regulars would recognize. The new version, located 40 miles away from Brookville in Abilene, Kansas, includes a rebuilt facade and as many of the old doors and fixtures from the original hotel restaurant, with origins dating back to 1870, as possible. Brookville Hotel stopped welcoming overnight guests decades ago, but the name lives on. The chicken dinner, served since the current owners' great-grandmother originated it in 1915, includes coleslaw, half a fried chicken, mashed potatoes, creamed corn, biscuits and ice cream, all for $15. 105 E. Lafayette, Abilene, Kansas (785) 263-2244 . Shady Glen, 1948 . Manchester, Connecticut, institution Shady Glen began back in 1948 as a classic soda fountain and ice cream maker, the offshoot of a dairy farm. When the original owners, John and Bernice Rieg, decided to branch out to lure business in the colder months, they added savory diner staples to their menu -- including a special take on the classic griddle-top cheeseburger featuring a giant crown (using four slices) of crispy cheese. Burgers and homemade ice cream are still served in the old diner today, which was enlarged and renovated over the decades but has kept the same look since 1978. 840 Middle Turnpike E, Manchester, Connecticut (860) 649-4245 . Cold Springs Tavern, 1886 . Cold Springs Tavern, founded in 1886 on a site established as a stagecoach stop in the 1860s, is located 20 minutes north of Santa Barbara, California, nestled on a mountainside off a winding road. Its buildings, a group of low log cabins outfitted with fireplaces, taxidermy and animal hides, have been preserved through the decades, making this a local destination, even without much signage or promotion. The place is big with bikers, especially on Sundays when live music is offered and the Log Cabin Bar offers their locally famous tri-tip steak sandwiches. 5995 Stagecoach Rd., Santa Barbara, California (805) 967-0066 . Race for the next presidential birthplace . Red Fox Inn and Tavern, 1728 . Those looking for an old Colonial experience should seek out the Red Fox Inn and Tavern, right in the middle of Northern Virginia's hunt country. Founded in 1728, the inn housed presidents and Revolutionary War heroes, was a medical center for the Confederate Army during the Civil War, and has attracted famed guests like Jackie Onassis and Elizabeth Taylor. The tavern looks as it might have in the 18th century, with thick stone walls, large fireplaces, beamed low ceilings and long oak tables. The menu changes seasonally but features old Southern classics like fried chicken, crab cakes and peanut soup. 2 East Washington Street, Middleburg, Virginia (540) 687-6301 . Al's Restaurant, 1925 . A guide to old-school American restaurants wouldn't be complete without a grand steakhouse, and Al's Restaurant, a St. Louis fixture since 1925, fits the bill. Stepping inside the restaurant, located in an unassuming building by the city's waterfront, is like entering a time warp. Though Al's began as an outpost selling egg sandwiches to the dock workers nearby, the founders' son transformed it into a fine-dining chop house with white tablecloths, wood paneled walls and a verbal menu -- servers come around with raw cuts of meat and fish to choose from -- of chops, steaks and seafood. It's not cheap by any stretch, but Al's is a staple in the area and is run by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the original immigrant founders. 1200 North 1st St., St. Louis, Missouri (314) 421-6399 . Chef Vola's, 1921 . Up until the 1980s, when the current owners bought it, Chef Vola's had no phone number, no signage and survived for 60 years in the basement of an Atlantic City row house strictly by word of mouth. Though it's a little easier to access now, reservations are still tough to come by, with good reason. The setting is unique in that it feels like someone's home -- until recently diners had to walk through the dishwashing area to get to the bathroom -- and the vibe is that of a large family gathering. And then there's the food: fettuccine in clam sauce, a primal-sized veal parmigiana on the bone, steak charred ""Pittsburgh style,"" famed banana cream and caramel ricotta pies, and dozens of others delectables. Try calling the day of to see if there are any cancellations, and note it's BYOB and cash only. 111 S. Albion Pl., Atlantic City, New Jersey (609) 345-2022 . Oktoberfest closer to home: Five U.S. festivals . The Bright Star, 1907 . A large contingent of customers have been coming to The Bright Star, a 105-year-old casual Greek/Southern restaurant in downtown Bessemer, Alabama, for decades. A large contingent of the restaurant's workers have been there even longer. And its owners, Nicky and Jimmy Koikos, one of whom is there almost every shift, have been keeping the family tradition alive since 1966. Why all the dedication? First there's the fresh seafood, trucked in from the Gulf Coast daily and served with a Greek flair. But also, it serves as a community gathering place and hub for Bessemer locals, growing from a 25-seat cafe to a 330-seat restaurant over the decades. Specialties include the seafood gumbo, the Greek snapper and the lemon ice box pie. 304 19th St. North, Bessemer, Alabama (205) 424-9444 .

"(CNN) -- An Idaho man accused of uttering a racial slur and slapping a crying 19-month-old boy on a Delta Air Lines flight is now out of a job. Joe Rickey Hundley of Hayden, Idaho, was charged with assaulting a minor in the February 8 incident. His company, which initially suspended him, said Sunday that Hundley no longer has his job. ""Reports of the recent behavior of one of our business unit executives while on personal travel are offensive and disturbing,"" said a statement from AGC Aerospace & Defense. ""We have taken this matter very seriously and worked diligently to examine it since learning of the matter on Friday afternoon. ""As of Sunday, the executive is no longer employed with the company."" AGC Aerospace & Defense supplies technology and other services to the military and businesses. Hundley's attorney, Marcia Shein, said her client is being unfairly portrayed. ""This has escalated into a racist issue and I want to be clear he is not a racist,"" Shein said. She said that Hundley is dealing with unspecified issues. The attorney for the child's family, John Thompson, said the family has not decided yet whether to sue. But he said Monday family members believe Hundley should be punished beyond the loss of his job and possible one-year federal prison sentence. ""The family wants to make sure that Mr. Hundley and anyone like Mr. Hundley never does something like that again,"" he said on CNN's ""Starting Point."" Affidavit: Slap with an open hand . According to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta last week, the boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, 33, of Minnesota and her son were seated in row 28, seat B, on Delta Flight 721 that originated in Minneapolis. She spent part of the flight in the rear of the plane to get away from Hundley, who she said smelled like alcohol and was slurring his speech, according to Thompson. As the plane began its descent into Atlanta, the boy began to cry because of the altitude change and his mother tried to soothe him. Then Hundley, who was seated next to the mother and son, allegedly told her to ""shut that (N-word) baby up."" Hundley then turned around and slapped the child in the face with an open hand, which caused him to scream even louder, an FBI affidavit said. The boy suffered a scratch below his right eye. Other passengers on the plane assisted Bennett, and one of them heard the slur and witnessed the alleged assault, the affidavit said. Court appearance not yet set . Shein said that even if her client did use the slur, it does not make him a racist. ""I could not believe that he would say something like that, and to a baby or about a baby. And then to hit him was just, I felt like I was in another world. I was shaking,"" Bennett told CNN affiliate KARE in Minneapolis. Hundley's first court appearance will be in Atlanta, Shein said. It has not yet been set, she said. Hundley must first surrender to authorities, which he has not yet done, she said. The charge of simple assault on someone under age 16 carries a prison sentence of one year, court papers said. In 2007, Hundley pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge filed in Virginia, according to court records. Air rage: Passengers 'quicker to snap' Lawsuit potential . Thompson said the familyy will evaluate evidence before deciding whether to sue anyone, including Hundley or Delta. Thompson said Bennett saw Hundley order two drinks while she was seated and saw him being served another one while she stood at the rear of the plane. Thompson said he wasn't sure if Bennett complained to flight attendants about Hundley's behavior. The family might have a case against Delta for serving Hundley alcohol if he was already intoxicated, CNN legal contributor Paul Callan said. InSession legal analyst Joey Jackson said he doesn't think there's a significant case because the child was not seriously harmed. ""While this conduct was offensive, it's abhorrent, it should never happen under any circumstance, the issue of a civil case regarding money will be how are you affected,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- As German Gen. Erwin Rommel chased British forces across the North African desert, a stray Royal Air Force fighter crashed in the blistering sands of the Egyptian Sahara on June 28, 1942. The pilot was never heard from again. The damaged Kittyhawk P-40 -- a couple of hundred miles from civilization -- was presumed lost forever. Until now. In what experts consider nothing short of a miracle, a Polish oil company worker recently discovered the plane believed to have been flown by missing Flight Sgt. Dennis Copping. And almost 70 years after the accident, it's extraordinarily well-preserved. The fighter's ""state of preservation is incredible,"" British military historian Andy Saunders told CNN. ""The thing just landed there in the desert and the pilot clearly got out. ... It is a complete time capsule really (and) an exceptionally rare find. These things just don't happen."" Most of the plane's fuselage, wings, tail and cockpit instruments remain intact. For safety reasons, Egyptian officials have removed its ammunition and guns. See additional photos . Copping's plane -- authorities have not confirmed his identity, though it has been widely reported in British newspapers -- crashed after the 24-year-old pilot got lost while trying to fly it from one RAF base to another for repairs to its front landing gear, which wouldn't retract. Copping, part of the RAF's Egyptian 260 Squadron, was trying to get the American-built plane back in fighting condition in the run-up to what would prove to be the pivotal Battle of El Alamein. The young pilot, according to Saunders, apparently became disoriented during the flight and headed in the wrong direction. Another RAF pilot flying nearby ""tried all sorts of things"" to get his attention, but Copping ""bizarrely"" ignored a series of warnings, Saunders said. By the time Copping realized his mistake, he was too low on fuel to turn around. Several pieces of evidence at the crash site -- including a parachute believed to have been used as shelter from the sun -- indicate the strong probability Copping survived the landing. He almost certainly could not, however, survive the blazing Sahara heat for long. Copping ""would have stayed by the aircraft initially,"" Saunders noted. While the plane's glass valve radio was likely knocked out of commission by the crash, ""the parachute gives him shelter and a means to be identified from the air. The guy also would have had a little silver signaling mirror to attract passing aircraft and a pistol with a limited number of flares."" Why would Copping leave the wreckage? ""Maybe he got desperate when he saw nobody was coming for him, and thought (the) only way to survive was to walk out"" and look for help, Saunders speculated. RAF pilots in North Africa at that time didn't have much in terms of rations. Copping's supply would have been very limited, assuming he had food or water at all. Pilots were ""flying with very basic life support systems,"" Saunders said. ""His chances of survival were not good."" As Copping's story becomes known, British authorities are hoping to bring his plane back to the United Kingdom and put it on display at the RAF Museum in London. Museum representatives are working with the British Embassy in Cairo and Britain's Ministry of Defence on a possible recovery operation. ""It's an incredible story,"" said museum spokesman Michael Creane. ""It's a perfect story in so many ways. It's incredible the plane sat there in this untouched part of the world for so long. ... We're dedicated to recovering it as fast as we can. This would be a fantastic asset.""","Oil company worker finds World War II-era Royal Air Force fighter in Egypt's Sahara Desert .

"(CNN) -- To erase some of the emotional scars left behind from the December shooting massacre at the Sandy Hook Elementary School, an advisory board wants the building torn down and replaced. The Sandy Hook Task Force voted unanimously late Friday to recommend to the Newtown, Connecticut, board of education to build a new school on the site of the existing building. Adam Lanza burst into the Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012 armed with a semiautomatic Bushmaster .223 caliber rifle and two handguns. He opened fire killing 26 people, 20 of them children, before taking his own life. Gunmaker says new law forcing it to leave Connecticut . He had previously shot his mother, Nancy Lanza, to death in their home, police said. She was a gun enthusiast, who kept a collection of guns, including assault rifles, in a lock box in her basement. Adam Lanza had a gun safe in his room, an investigation revealed. The shooting reignited a national debate on gun control and the possibility of legal restrictions on assault rifles. Newtown shooting details revealed in newly released documents . Students from Sandy Hook now attend Chalk Hill Middle School in the nearby town of Monroe. Part of the building was transformed to resemble an elementary school, and security was increased by adding new locks and surveillance cameras, a school official has said. The school also enlisted the help of a comfort dog for the school children to bond with. Sandy Hook's task force had considered other alternatives, such as renovating the existing building or building a new school on a different site. Its recommendation must be approved by the school board then by a vote in a popular referendum, before the plans can be carried out. Connecticut governor signs sweeping gun measure .

"(CNN) -- In a blog post late Wednesday, actress and avid gamer Felicia Day weighed in on the roiling #Gamergate controversy, saying that by doing so she feared retribution from someone who might leak personal details about her online. ""I have had stalkers and restraining orders issued in the past, I have had people show up on my doorstep when my personal information was HARD to get,"" wrote Day, best known for her roles on the CW show ""Supernatural"" and the web series ""The Guild."" She added: ""To have my location revealed to the world would give a entry point for a few mentally ill people who have fixated on me, and allow them to show up and make good on the kind of threats I've received that make me paranoid to walk around a convention alone."" As it turns out, Day's concerns were justified. Within an hour, an anonymous commenter had posted her real-world address and personal email. The practice, called ""doxxing,"" involves publishing someone's vulnerable personal information online as a form of punishment. The episode made Day the latest prominent woman to be harassed online over #Gamergate, the term for a loosely defined movement defending hardcore games and gamers against criticisms from feminists and others. Why #Gamergate won't die . Some of the vitriol has spilled from the Internet into the physical world. In recent weeks, game designer Zoe Quinn, gaming critic Anita Sarkeesian and game designer Brianna Wu have all received threats of violence on Twitter and other platforms. Observers on Twitter noted this week that Day was targeted while notable #Gamergate critics who are male, such as actor Wil Wheaton and former NFL player Chris Kluwe, had escaped being ""doxxed"" as of Thursday afternoon. In her essay, Day urged people not to let fears over #Gamergate drive them away from gaming. ""Games are beautiful, they are creative, they are worlds to immerse yourself in. They are art. And they are worth fighting for, even if the atmosphere is ugly right now,"" she wrote. She later added: ""I know this entry will probably draw contempt from people in the Gamer Gate movement. Something to scorn, something to rile them up against me and everything I've ever made. Especially, and most hurtfully, to mock my vulnerability. I just have one thing to say to you who do that: I'm genuinely sorry you are so angry."" Share your views on #Gamergate . By Thursday, the actress seemed to be taking a more optimistic view. ""I posted this essay yesterday afternoon on Tumblr. Yes, personal information was leaked shortly after, but the better thing to concentrate on is that the majority of replies were overwhelmingly kind and supportive on social media,"" she wrote on Facebook.

"(CNN) -- Authorities launched an international manhunt Thursday for a Canadian man suspected of dismembering an acquaintance and mailing body parts to political party headquarters. Canadian police believe Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov, has fled the country, prompting Interpol, the global police agency, to add his name to its most wanted list. The self-described porn star posting a video of the killing and dismemberment online. ""We believe he filmed himself,"" said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. ""It's gross."" ""This is a very deranged person,"" he said. ""He is looking for attention and he got it but not in a positive way."" Magnotta knew the victim, whom Lafreniere said he could not identify. He said the headless body was too mutilated to make any immediate identification. Magnotta had no prior police record but his name and photos were all over the Internet. Animal rights activists accused him of being a serial kitten killer and launched a campaign to find him. Magnotta had what appears to be his own website, on which he says he was the victim of cyberstalkers. Lafreniere said police found evidence suggesting he had fled Canada. He once wrote online about how to disappear after committing a crime. Police have reason to believe he might have gone to eastern Europe, given his Russian alias and writings on his Web page. Lefreniere said there was a possibility he might have re-entered Canada under another name. He said Magnotta was good at disguising himself. Police were first alerted to the grisly act when a severed foot in a package arrived by mail at Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa. Police Sgt. Steve Hodgsontold reporters that staffers had begun to open the package before calling police. ""The odor coming from the package was just horrible, and I'm sure many of us will never forget it,"" Conservative Party spokesman Fred Delorey told Canada's CBC news. A severed hand turned up the same day at a postal distribution center, where it was intercepted. It was addressed to the Liberal Party. On Wednesday, a third body part -- a torso -- turned up behind a Montreal apartment building, where the suspect was a tenant. It had been stuffed into a suitcase. The foot and hand belong to the same victim, Lafreniere said, and police believe the torso does as well. ""We are still missing pieces of this puzzle in terms of body parts,"" he said. Two people associated with the beige brick apartment building where Magnotta lived noticed the suitcase outside the building. ""I had my eye on it, because it looked like a nice suitcase,"" resident Richard Payette told CBC. But something about it struck him has odd. Later, a janitor made the shocking discovery, and police were alerted. Arriving officers cordoned off the area. The scene inside the apartment was no less disturbing. ""I've been a police officer for more than 20 years now, and I met officers that were doing an investigation for more than 30 years, and they said they never saw a scene like that,"" Lafreniere said. Dried blood stained the table, the bed, the bathtub and the refrigerator of apartment 208. Police say they have found a video online of Magnotta committing the murder in Montreal. His image and information related to him were later recovered from a ""very graphic"" website, Lafreniere said. At least one of the websites examined by authorities was pornographic. Magnotta also was notorious among animal rights activists who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used the carcasses in sexual acts. He was dubbed the ""Vacuum Kitten Killer"" by a Facebook group started in December 2010 to track down the man responsible for posting a video on YouTube of the kitten deaths. ""We are patiently waiting for more information on the case and have faith in the Montreal Police,"" the website said Thursday. ""Members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual, who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed. Information gathered by group members was passed onto the authorities in Canada, and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals."" Lafreniere said police were aware of the animal allegations. On what appears to be his own website, Magnotta defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking. ""Once and for all I will set the record straight,"" he wrote. ""Many hoax websites are created using my image and name, posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website (sic) have, I feel I don't need to list them specifically but people need not be told, not to believe what they read and to take it as fact."" The website has writing in Arabic and Russian and images of Magnotta, half naked and with lips pouted. Several Canadian newspapers also reported that Magnotta had dated notorious Canadian killer Karla Homolka. Lafreniere said he could not confirm any links and that she was not part of the investigation. Police described him as being 5 feet 8 inches tall and about 135 pounds with black hair and blue eyes. They said they are asking the public for help in finding Magnotta, after a ""coast-to-coast"" warrant was issued for his arrest. Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he's apprehended. ""We need to bring him to justice,"" Lafreniere said. CNN's David Ariosto, Jake Carpenter, Paula Newton and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Police believe Luka Rocco Magnotta has fled Canada .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson was an international superstar, and many in the black community herald him for breaking down racial barriers in the music industry. Michael Jackson was one of the first black global superstars. ""Michael Jackson made culture accept a person of color way before Tiger Woods, way before Oprah Winfrey, way before Barack Obama,"" said the Rev. Al Sharpton. ""Michael did with music what they later did in sports and in politics and in television. And no controversy will erase the historic impact."" As the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson and his brothers ""became a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists,"" said Mark Anthony Neal, a professor of black popular culture at Duke University's Department of African and African American Studies. ""You basically had five working-class black boys with Afros and bell bottoms, and they really didn't have to trade any of that stuff in order to become mainstream stars,"" Neal said. Young Michael Jackson was the first black ""bubblegum teen star"" in the vein of Monkees singer Davy Jones, Neal said. Jackson continued as a pioneer in the black culture when he broke barriers by appearing on MTV, and by breaking sales records with the 1982 album, ""Thriller.""  Timeline: The life of a ""King"" » . ""At the time that he releases 'Thriller,' I always argue that MTV was arguably the best example of cultural apartheid in the United States,"" Neal said. The former president of CBS Records, Walter Yetnikoff, remembered with scorn that MTV would not play ""Billie Jean"" or ""Beat It"" because it billed itself as a rock station. Looking back on that era, a 1991 Los Angeles Times article quoted MTV founder and then-CEO Robert Pittman as saying the channel's format didn't lend itself to other musical styles, including R&B and country. And Pittman accused his critics of attempting to impose their musical pluralism on the channel's die-hard rock fans. But Yetnikoff said he threatened to pull videos of his other artists unless MTV played Jackson's videos.  Watch Yetnikoff talk about getting Jackson's videos played » . Soon Jackson's videos were heavily in rotation on MTV. Showcasing a black artist paved the way for the popular show, ""Yo! MTV Raps,"" and other black artists, Neal said. In turn, Jackson became one of the first African-Americans to be a global icon. He also influenced a new generation of black musicians, including Usher, Ne-Yo and Kanye West, according to Joycelyn Wilson, a professor of African-American studies at Morehouse College, who specializes in popular culture and hip-hop studies.  Slideshow: Michael Jackson and his music » . Changing appearance . Jackson's changing physical appearance in the past two decades led to criticism he was trying to be less black. ""Here's a man who started off looking very typically African-American and ended up looking like something few people would have recognized early in his career. His nose was trimmed, his lips were different ... his skin was different,"" said Cheryl Contee, who writes as Jill Tubman on Jack & Jill Politics, a blog centered on African-American issues. ""The only thing that seemed to almost stay the same were his eyes,"" said Contee, who also called Jackson ""a genius and more than a trailblazer."" ""I think [it] troubled a lot of people that he left his skin color behind and seemed somehow to be ashamed of who he was [when] he was born,"" Contee said. But during a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Jackson shot down rumors that he was dying his skin to make it lighter. He told the talk show host that he had vitiligo, a disorder that destroyed his skin pigmentation. Black popular culture professor Neal said Jackson's physical changes did not reflect his life on the whole. ""I think if you solely pay attention to Michael Jackson's physicality, you actually miss something that's much more complex. ... Michael Jackson artistically and aesthetically never turned his back on blackness. His work was always in conversation with black culture both in the United States and more globally,"" said Neal.

"Editor's note: This story is based on interrogation reports that form part of the prosecution case in the forthcoming trial of six Belgian citizens charged with participation in a terrorist group. Versions of those documents were obtained by CNN from the defense attorney of one of those suspects. The statement by Bryant Vinas was compiled from an interview he gave Belgian prosecutors in March 2009 in New York and was confirmed by U.S. prosecutors as authentic. The statement by Walid Othmani was given to French investigators and was authenticated by Belgian prosecutors. Al Qaeda recruits say they received training in how to handle rockets, explosives and bombs. (CNN) -- The interrogations of two accused Westerners who say they trained and fought with al Qaeda in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region provide an inside view of the terror group's organizational structures. Arguably, they shed more light on the state of al Qaeda than any material previously released into the public domain. The documents reveal training programs and the protective measures the terrorist organization has taken against increasingly effective U.S. missile strikes. Bryant Vinas -- a U.S. citizen who says he traveled to Pakistan in September 2007 to fight against Americans in Afghanistan -- stated that between March and July 2008 he attended three al Qaeda training courses, which focused on weapons, explosives, and rocket-based or -propelled weaponry. During these classes, attended by 10-20 recruits, Vinas was taught how to handle a large variety of weapons and explosives, some of them of military grade sophistication, according to his account. Read how al Qaeda is now operating . Vinas stated he became familiar with seeing, smelling and touching different explosives such as TNT, as well as plastic explosives such as RDX, Semtex, C3 and C4 -- the explosive U.S. authorities have stated was used in al Qaeda's attack on the USS Cole in 2000. Vinas also learned how to make vests for suicide bombers. Vinas stated he was also instructed how to prepare and place fuses, how to test batteries, how to use voltmeters and how to build circuitry for a bomb. Read how Vinas met with al Qaeda leaders . According to his account, al Qaeda also offered a wide variety of other courses including electronics, sniper, and poisons training. Instruction in the actual construction of bombs, he stated, was offered to al Qaeda recruits who had become more advanced in their training. Vinas' training during this period was very similar to the training described by members of a French-Belgian group who also spent time in the tribal areas of Pakistan in 2008. Walid Othmani, a French recruit, stated the group were given explosives training and taught how to fire rocket launchers and RPGs. Othmani provided French interrogators with an account of his time in Pakistan after being arrested on his return to Europe. Three other members of his group are now in Belgian custody awaiting trial for ""participation in a terrorist group."" Belgian prosecutors told CNN Othmani has been charged in France with participation in a criminal conspiracy with the aim of preparing a terrorist act. A Belgian legal document detailing his interrogation report was obtained by CNN. Like Vinas, Othmani said the group had been required to sign forms before their training. Othmani stated his group was required to pledge absolute obedience to their handlers and indicate whether they wanted to become suicide bombers. Othmani provided interesting new details about the training facilities being used by al Qaeda in the tribal areas. His group trained in a small mountain shack, a far cry from the large camps al Qaeda had run in Taliban-era Afghanistan, when it had been able to operate with little danger of being targeted by military strikes. Othmani's account made clear that al Qaeda has had to decentralize its operations in Pakistan in response to the growing effectiveness of U.S. Predator strikes. However the wide number of training courses described by both Vinas and Othmani suggest that al Qaeda has been able to adapt well to the new security environment. By operating a larger number of smaller facilities, al Qaeda would also appear to have increased its resilience to attack. Read how al Qaeda is looking for Western targets . While the classrooms are safer from drone attacks than the pre-9/11 sessions on the mountainsides the content seems to have changed to match new targeting plans. Suicide vest and IED construction show how the curriculum is being modified for today's combat with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Making and handling explosives, as well as fuse construction, show the sessions may also be geared for killing in Europe and the United States. These are the very skills the July 7, 2005 London bombers Shehzad Tanweer and Mohammed Siddique Khan came to Pakistan to learn. Al Qaeda, it would seem, may still want to pull off the spectacular attack in Europe or the United States. Vinas says he took a course in propelled weaponry with Hicham Bouhali Zrioul, a former taxi driver in Brussels, Belgium, whom he first met in March 2008 and formed a friendship with. Vinas stated that when they completed their training, Al Qaeda instructors did a written evaluation of their performance. Vinas had been judged qualified to participate in missile attacks against U.S. and NATO bases in Afghanistan, according to his account. That suggests al Qaeda has maintained its capacity for administration and paperwork even in a harsher security environment. When their training finished in the summer of 2008, Vinas and Zrioul lived in the same house in the mountains of Waziristan. Zrioul managed to acquire a computer which he rigged up to watch jihadist videos. During a mountain walk with Zrioul one day, Vinas says he was told about a new course being taught by al Qaeda called ""international operations"" set up by al Qaeda's head of international operations whom Vinas later identified as Abu Hafith. Hafith, he stated, was responsible for recruitment and direction of terrorist cells, and attacks outside Pakistan and Afghanistan. Hafith was identified by his initials in the legal document but CNN obtained his name from a source briefed on the case. He is believed to be still at large in the Pakistan-Afghan border area. Vinas was told that the training course that Hafith set up focused on kidnapping and assassination, including instruction on the use of silencers and how to break into and enter a property. The revelations raise the possibility that al Qaeda was developing a program of targeted assassinations. Though al Qaeda has carried out some assassinations in the past, most of its attacks in the West have not targeted any particular individuals but crowded areas, such as mass transport. According to Othmani, al Qaeda fighters totaled between 300-500 in Pakistan's Tribal Areas -- spread out in groups of 10. Such decentralization was a function of the growing deadliness of U.S. Predator strikes. Hicham Beyayo, a Belgian jihadist volunteer, said the group moved around a lot because such strikes were known to be ""very effective,"" his lawyer Christophe Marchand, told CNN. The loss of an increasing number of operatives, stated Othmani, prompted an order from al Qaeda's top command for fighters to remain inside as much as possible. In order to keep in touch, jihadists operated a courier service across the region, according to the Frenchman's testimony. The decentralization of al Qaeda's structures appears to have created some costs for recruits. Two members of the Belgian-French group now in custody describe feeling increasingly cut off, bored, and fed up with the primitive living conditions in their mountain shacks, according to documents obtained by CNN and the defense lawyer of one of those charged. They often did not seem to know what their next orders would be or where their handlers would take them. They also described being deeply frustrated at being repeatedly given false promises that they would be able to fight in Afghanistan. Othmani also described the group's frustration at having to pay for their own weapons and training -- at a cost of 1,300 euros each (about $1,800) -- which if true might lend credence to reports that al Qaeda has come under financial strain. Vinas, for his part, made no mention of having to make payments to his handlers. Vinas and Othmani's accounts also suggest that al Qaeda may be having leadership problems. While able to find fresh recruits to replace those killed and arrested, the group seems to have more difficulty replacing senior military trainers and other key operational figures. A former U.S. government official, specializing in counter-terrorism, commented that the insider accounts suggest the same people are leading training as a decade ago. The only difference, there are fewer of them.","Al Qaeda recruit tells of weapons and explosives training courses .

"New York (CNN) -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is asking state legislators to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana that are in public view. Saying the aim was to avoid unnecessary misdemeanor charges against thousands of New Yorkers -- ""disproportionately black and Hispanic youth,"" according to a statement from the governor's office -- the legislation ""brings consistency and fairness"" to New York's marijuana laws. ""There is a blatant inconsistency. If you possess marijuana privately it is a violation, if you show it in public it's a crime. It's incongruous. It's inconsistent the way it has been enforced,"" Cuomo told reporters at a press conference in Albany on Monday. In 1977, New York's legislature reduced the penalty for possessing 25 grams or less of marijuana to a non-criminal violation carrying a fine of no more than $100 for first-time offenders -- as long as the marijuana was in private possession and not in public view. If the marijuana is out and viewable in public -- as it might be when someone is asked to empty his or her pockets during a so-called police ""stop and frisk"" -- it becomes a Class B misdemeanor. Selling and smoking or burning marijuana is still a crime, and Cuomo is not suggesting changing that. ""The statute as currently written unnecessarily subjects tens of thousands of people to criminal arrest and prosecution for very small quantities of marijuana,"" said New York State Assembly member Hakeem Jeffries. ""The overwhelming majority of people who have been arrested as a result of the way that the statute is currently written come from the black and Latino community,"" Jeffries said, adding that statistics and studies show that marijuana possession and use ""is far more racially diverse."" According to data released by the governor's office, 2,000 arrests for small amounts of marijuana were made in 1990. In 2011, over 50,000 arrests were made. Fifty percent of those arrested were under 25 years old, and 82% were black or Latino. Less than 10% were ever convicted of a crime. ""The human costs to each defendant charged with a misdemeanor are serious,"" said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., supporting Cuomo's proposal. ""The simple and fair change proposed by Gov. Cuomo will help us redirect significant resources to the most violent criminals and serious crime problems, and, frankly, it is the right thing to do."" According to the governor's office, 94% of arrests for small amounts of marijuana in the state are in New York City, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the New York Police Department and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly have come under fire in recent years for the department's much-criticized ""stop and frisk"" policy. Bloomberg wants to ban large sodas . ""Overly punitive charges have a harmful effect on our justice system. They can ruin lives, waste taxpayer money on unneeded trials, and breed distrust between communities and law enforcement,"" said Gabriel Sayegh, New York state director for the Drug Policy Alliance. Last year Kelly issued a policy order directing officers to issue violations, rather than misdemeanors, for small amounts of marijuana discovered during street searches, and Monday, Bloomberg issued a statement in support of Cuomo's comments. ""The governor's proposal today is consistent with the commissioner's directive, and strikes the right balance by ensuring that the NYPD will continue to have the tools it needs to maintain public safety -- including making arrests for selling or smoking marijuana,"" he said. ""Thanks to the NYPD, our city has come a long way from the days when marijuana was routinely sold and smoked on our streets without repercussions."" At the press conference Monday, Kelly said, ""I was asked to respond to criticism by some members of the (City) Council that the Police Department was making, quote, 'too many' arrests for small amounts of marijuana. And my response to them, was, 'Well, your option is to go to Albany and get the law changed' -- better that than having New York City police officers turn a blind eye to the law as it was written, and as it is still written.""","A 1977 law makes private possession of 25 grams or less a non-criminal violation .
But if the marijuana is publicly visible, the same amount is a Class B misdemeanor .
Cuomo is asking that small amounts even in public view be decriminalized .

"(CNN) -- After nearly seven weeks on the run, suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein is in custody, Pennsylvania State Police spokeswoman Connie Devens said Thursday. According to a local government official briefed on the matter, Frein was caught at an abandoned airport between Henryville and Tannersville. He was reportedly taken into custody without incident. A U.S. Marshal's Service special operations team tracked Frein to the abandoned airport while it was in process of clearing the area, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the capture. Its work, that source said, was also aided by intelligence and eyewitness accounts gathered throughout the course of the manhunt. Frein was armed with two guns when he was arrested, according to another law enforcement source. One was a pistol and the other a rifle, the source said. A separate law enforcement official told CNN that knives were recovered from Frein's hiding place, and that authorities are currently searching the area for more weapons. Frein, 31, is suspected in the September 12 ambush shooting that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove. ""Let me assure everybody here ... justice will be served,"" Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett said Thursday night at a news conference about Frein's capture. Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty for Frein, Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin told reporters. The suspect is now sitting in a cell at the same barracks outside which the two officers were ambushed, authorities said. He was cuffed with Cpl. Dickson's handcuffs, officials said. The search . The weeks-long search yielded a mishmash of purported personal effects. Police have said they found an empty pack of Serbian cigarettes. Frein claims to have fought with Serbians in Africa and has studied Russian and Serbian languages, according to the FBI, which named him one of its Ten Most Wanted fugitives. Two fully functional pipe bombs and soiled adult diapers were also found, perhaps used by Frein to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time. Police have not spoken about a possible motive for the crime, other than that Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. Authorities have said a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack for years. The manhunt involved as many as 1,000 officers at times, some from other states. The search for the self-styled survivalist cost at least several million dollars. Frein's capture took so long because he hid in a wooded area that took a long time to search, said state police Commissioner Frank Noonan. Community on edge . The hunt for Frein turned life upside down for people inside the search area. Helicopters buzzed overhead and police seemed to be everywhere, all the time. ""Every night, every day, but mostly at night, the helicopters would be flying over our house, waking us up at 1 o'clock in the morning,"" said Cory Batzel, in Swiftwater, Pennsylvania, before Frein was caught. The fugitive was reportedly spotted in a wooded area in the town of Swiftwater, about 8 miles southeast of the Canadensis area, where his family has a home. ""It's kind of scary -- a little bit nerve-wracking -- because we live so close to it,"" said Marissa Labarre, who rode the bus to school with Frein when they were children. She remembered him as quiet, but not ""weird,"" and definitely not the type of person you'd expect to kill a cop. ""You hear of stuff like this, but you never know the person, or it's like hours from you. You know, it's on the news but it's not ever close to home. So it's a little bit scary,"" said Labarre. CNN's Pamela Brown, Rob Frehse, Susan Candiotti, Shimon Prokupecz, Faith Karimi and Evan Perez contributed to this report.","NEW: Prosecutors intend to seek the death penalty for Frein, says district attorney .

"Editor's note: This story is based on interrogation reports that form part of the prosecution case in the forthcoming trial of six Belgian citizens charged with participation in a terrorist group. Versions of those documents were obtained by CNN from the defense attorney of one of those suspects. The statement by Bryant Vinas was compiled from an interview he gave Belgian prosecutors in March 2009 in New York, and was confirmed by U.S. prosecutors as authentic. The statement by Walid Othmani was given to French investigators, and was authenticated by Belgian prosecutors. Vinas is believed to have lived in this Patchogue, New York, house with his father until 2007. (CNN) -- On September 10, 2007, almost exactly six years after al Qaeda attacked the United States, Bryant Neal Vinas, a 24-year-old American citizen born in Queens, New York, boarded a flight from the city en route to Lahore, in eastern Pakistan, determined to fight jihad in neighboring Afghanistan. Brought up a Catholic by his Latin American immigrant parents, who divorced when he was young, Vinas tried to join the U.S. Army in 2002 but dropped out after just a few weeks. In 2004 -- for reasons which are still unclear -- he converted to Islam and started frequenting a mosque in Long Island near where he lived with his father. During the next three years he became radicalized, U.S. officials have stated, in no small part because of his exposure to pro-al Qaeda Web sites. It is possible that Vinas was also influenced by people he came across in the New York area. A former U.S. government official told CNN that youths influenced by the ideas of the British pro-al Qaeda extremist group Al Muhajiroun were known to have hung out in the vicinity of the mosque at the same time as Vinas. Read how al Qaeda is changing . The former official told CNN that they were a splinter group of the Al Muhajiroun followers who used to hang out in the New York-Long Island area in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Al Muhajiroun's American members, the former official stated, included Syed Hashmi, a Brooklyn college graduate who traveled to Pakistan in 2003 and now awaits trial on charges of providing material support to the terrorist network. He has pleaded not guilty. Another who belonged to Al Muhajiroun was Mohammed Junaid Babar, a trainee Queens taxi driver, who met two of the July 7, 2005, London bombers in Pakistan and who in 2004 pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorists in Pakistan. Al Muhajiroun was formally disbanded in October 2004 but still operates, CNN has discovered, under a variety of guises. Anjem Choudhary, the former deputy leader of Al Muhajiroun, told CNN Monday that New York was one of the organization's main hubs before 2004. He says dozens of followers from the New York area still regularly tune into online sermons put together by the group's founder Omar Bakri Mohammed in Tripoli, Lebanon, where he has been living since being banned from the UK after the 2005 London bombings. Choudhary stated that he and Bakri were still loosely affiliated with The Islamic Thinkers Society, a New York based organization, which says the peaceful restoration of the Islamic Caliphate is one of its objectives. A March 5, 2009, posting on the homepage of its Web site states that Bakri Mohammed is ""a man who has inspired thousands across the world to rise for Islam."" The Islamic Thinkers Society exists legally in the United States and says it is committed solely to the political and intellectual struggle for Islam. When Vinas arrived in Lahore he had little idea about how he was going to gain access to the fighting in Afghanistan, according to his own account. But a few days after he arrived he sought help from a New York friend, whom he knew moved in militant circles. One introduction led to another and eventually Vinas met a jihadist commander about to return to Afghanistan. Identified in legal documents as S.S., the commander agreed to let him join his group. CNN has learned from a source briefed on the case that the initials S.S. stand for a man who goes by the name of Shah Saab, and is believed to be somewhere in Pakistan's tribal areas. At the end of September, Vinas was whisked in the commander's car into Pakistan's tribal areas and then across the border into Afghanistan to join up with a small band of fighters targeting a U.S. base. The raid, however, was called off at the last minute because of American aircraft circling above. His quick introduction to the fighting appears to have been unusual. Vinas stated it was standard for fighters to undergo military training before being selected for such missions. Read how al Qaeda training tactics are adapting . It is possible he persuaded his handlers that his brief stint as a U.S. army recruit justified him being fast-tracked; or perhaps the jihadist group just needed more fighters. On his return to Mohmand, a district in Pakistan's tribal areas, Vinas was asked by one of the fighters if he wanted to become a suicide bomber. Vinas, according to his own account, accepted and was sent to Peshawar, Pakistan, for more instruction. But his handlers there judged that he had not received enough religious instruction to launch such an attack. Perhaps it was dawning on them just how valuable an American recruit might one day be. Vinas stated that at this point he traveled back to a village in Waziristan where he spent time with a number of al Qaeda members, including Saudis and Yemenis. In March 2008 he successfully persuaded one of them, a Yemeni he identified as Soufran, to recommend him for formal membership in the terrorist group. Only Soufran's initials appeared in the legal document but CNN obtained his name from a source briefed on the case. His current whereabouts are unknown. According to Vinas, al Qaeda recruits were asked to fill out forms with personal information and hand over their passports when they joined the organization, but were not required to sign a contract or take part in a ceremony to become a member of al Qaeda. Between March and July 2008 Vinas stated that he attended three al Qaeda training courses, which focused on weapons, explosives, and rocket-based or -propelled weaponry. Vinas stated that when training was completed, al Qaeda instructors did a written evaluation of performances. Vinas was judged qualified to participate in missile attacks against U.S. and NATO bases in Afghanistan, according to his account. During his travels Vinas met some of al Qaeda's top leaders, leaders he was able to identify to U.S. authorities after his capture. Read how al Qaeda is looking at Western targets . According to U.S. investigators, quoted by the Los Angeles Times, Vinas says he met with Abu Yayha al Libi, one of al Qaeda's principal spokesmen, and Rashid Rauf, the British al Qaeda operative suspected of coordinating a plot against transatlantic aviation in August 2006. Rauf, who was arrested that August in Pakistan, escaped from custody in December 2007 but is believed to have been killed in a Predator strike in North Waziristan in November 2008. Vinas says he also met with an individual by the name of Abdullah Saeed, whom he says replaced Abu Leith al Libbi as al Qaeda's military chief in Afghanistan and Pakistan in January 2008. A former Jihadist told CNN that Saeed is almost certainly Mustafa Abu Al-Yazid, an Egyptian also known as Sheikh Saeed. In June, Al-Yazid released an audio recording complaining of a lack of funds for the fighting in Afghanistan. Vinas stated he met with Saeed in the late summer of 2008 in Waziristan, and al Qaeda's military chief personally instructed him to join a group of fighters targeting U.S. bases from the tribal areas of Pakistan. In January this year Vinas pleaded guilty to having targeted an American base in September of that year. That attack, however, appears to have been a failure. Creeping up towards the American forward operating base Vinas and other al Qaeda fighters' first attempt to fire on the base was botched by radio problems. The second rocket attack fell short of the base, according to Vinas' account. Vinas' life as an al Qaeda fighter saw him rotate between fighting behind enemy lines in Afghanistan, training in remote mountain dwellings in the tribal areas, and spending downtime in Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, where he was eventually arrested in November 2008 and transferred into American custody.","Army dropout Bryant Neal Vinas says he went to Pakistan to join al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- The death of a Georgian luge athlete Friday ahead of the opening of the 2010 Winter Olympics occurred amid concerns about the speed of the record-setting track at the Whistler Sliding Center, according to a Georgian official. ""There were some questions asked by other athletes even before this tragic accident,"" said Nikolas Rurua, Georgia's deputy minister for culture and sports, adding that there had been several crashes in the same area. ""But at this moment it would be premature for me to jump to any conclusions."" Nodar Kumaritashvili, 21, was on his final official training run when he had a ""serious crash"" near the end of the 4,500-foot-long course and was propelled off the track, according to the International Olympic Committee. Video of the crash shows Kumaritashvili lying motionless after being thrown from his sled and striking a steel pole as he was coming out of the course's last turn. He was given CPR by medical staff on site before being transported to a hospital where doctors were unable to revive him, the IOC said. Luge death shows danger of fast tracks . Kumaritashvili was scheduled to compete in the men's singles luge event, which begins Saturday. The official training session was being held just hours before the opening ceremony for the Winter Games. An investigation into the cause of the crash is under way, the IOC said, and the track was closed after the accident, Rurua said. He urged a thorough examination ""to prevent devastating events in the future."" The luge is often called the ""fastest sport on ice."" Sliders use their legs and shoulders to steer small fiberglass sleds down an icy track, at times approaching or surpassing speeds of 90 mph, according to the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics Web site. They are positioned on their backs with their feet straight out in front of them and their heads back to be as aerodynamic as possible. Sports Illustrated's David Epstein, who is covering the Olympics for the magazine, told CNN's ""Situation Room"" that the Whistler course is the fastest in the world ""and not by a little."" He noted that while most luge courses ""flatten out"" around the 11th turn, the Whistler track ""just keeps on dropping, so there's really kind of no break from gathering speed toward the end."" Epstein said some athletes had been complaining about the speed of the course and speculating that this Winter Games could be the first time the sport sees a competitor hit 100 mph. ""That's 15 to 20 mph faster than any course in the rest of the world,"" Epstein said. A track speed record -- and world speed record -- was recorded at Whistler on February 21, 2009, when a single men's luge athlete topped 95 mph during competition. American luger Tony Benshoof held the previous world speed record of 86.8 mph set in 2001. Kumaritashvili was traveling at 88 mph at the time of his crash, Epstein said. Benshoof said Friday that he had had problems in the lower portion of the track during one of his training runs. ""Because of the physics of the curves, and going at 95 mph, there's a really small margin for error,"" Benshoof said. ""You really need to get it right from curve nine to get as far as curve 13, because once you get to curve 11 and 12, you're going too fast to correct yourself."" Kumaritashvili crashed on the 16th and final turn of the course. IOC President Jacques Rogge declined to comment Friday on what safety precautions may be put into place pending the outcome of the investigation. ""This is a time of sorrow, not a time to look for reasons,"" he said during an emotional news conference confirming Kumaritashvili's death. ""That will come in due time."" Full statement from IOC . Rurua said members of the Georgian team will dedicate their event performances to their fallen teammate. The somber seven-member delegation wore black armbands to Friday night's opening ceremonies and a black ribbon was tied atop the Georgian flag in tribute to Kumaritashvili. The team received a standing ovation from the 60,000 spectators in attendance. ""It is difficult to remain composed,"" Rogge said. ""This is a very sad day. The IOC is in deep mourning."" Rurua described Kumaritashvili as a ""well-qualified"" and hard-working athlete from an area of Georgia with a long tradition in snow sports. He said members of the Georgian team will dedicate their event performances to their fallen teammate. ""[Kumaritashvili] came to Canada with hopes and dreams that this would be a magnificent occasion in his life,"" said John Furlong of the Vancouver Organizing Committee. ""We are heartbroken beyond words to be sitting here."" Rogge said the IOC has been in contact with the Georgian Olympic Committee, Kumaritashvili's family and the president of the Georgian republic to express their condolences. Rurua said Kumaritashvili's cousin, who is a coach for the team, was the only relative present in Vancouver. The last time a luge athlete was killed during an Olympics was in 1964 when the sport was first introduced, Epstein said. Friday's death was the first time an athlete had been killed during the games since 1992, when a Swiss skier crashed into a snow-clearing machine on a public trail while training in the closing days of the games, according to NBC News, the official broadcaster of the Vancouver Games. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Luge slider from Georgia killed hours before the opening ceremony .

"(CNN) -- On the evening of Whitney Houston's death, renowned recording artist Tony Bennett told the audience of Clive Davis' Beverly Hills party, ""First it was Michael Jackson, then it was Amy Winehouse, and now, the magnificent Whitney Houston. I'd like to have every gentleman and lady in this room commit themselves to get our government to legalize drugs -- so they'll have to get it through a doctor, not to some gangsters who just sell it under the table."" Bennett's idiotic comments were followed closely by the often original, but in this case mistaken, Arianna Huffington. On Monday morning's edition of ""CNN Starting Point With Soledad O'Brien,"" she agreed with Bennett: ""The point I think is absolutely fair -- that the war on drugs has failed, and we are not acknowledging it. We are spending over $50 billion a year fighting a war that has become a war on our own people."" First, we do not know the immediate cause of Houston's death. But we do know that she had a long and public struggle with drugs, both legal and illegal. But legalizing drugs and making them more readily available would not have saved her life, or the life of Michael Jackson, or the thousands of other drug-related deaths each year. Lest Tony Bennett forget, Michael Jackson died from acute propofol intoxication administered to him by a doctor. Amy Winehouse died from alcohol poisoning -- a legal, easily available substance. A fatal combination of painkillers, sleeping pills and anti-depressants -- all legal prescription drugs -- killed Heath Ledger. Brittany Murphy died from multiple drug intoxications (only prescription and over-the-counter medications according to the medical exam) combined with pneumonia. And Anna Nicole Smith overdosed on prescription and over-the-counter drugs. All these drugs are legal and prescribed by doctors. Contrary to what Tony Bennett and other legalizers would like to think, legalization does not prevent the abuse and misuse of drugs. In fact, it accelerates it. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, prescription drug abuse is the nation's fastest-growing drug problem. In 2007, there were 28,000 deaths from prescription drug overdoses. This is five times higher than the number in 1990. More people die in America every year from prescription drug abuse (i.e., legal and available drugs) than from heroin and cocaine combined. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the number of deaths from prescription narcotics increased fourfold over the past 10 years. This coincided with a fourfold increase in the number of prescriptions written for powerful painkillers. Legalization increases supply and when you increase supply, you increase the use and misuse of deadly drugs. As for Bennett's envy of Amsterdam, he should realize that its legalization experiment has backfired. With the legalization of marijuana came an increase in drug addictions and dependency followed by illegal drug trafficking, human trafficking and crime. After a rapid influx of organized crime, the Netherlands has announced that it will ban foreigners from the country's pot shops starting in 2013. Drug decriminalization in Portugal has also been a failure. As of 2007, Portugal was still the country with the most cases of injected drug related AIDS, and it was the only European country to show a significant increase in homicides from 2001 to 2006. ""With 219 deaths by drug 'overdose' a year, Portugal has one of the worst records, reporting more than one death every two days. Along with Greece, Austria and Finland, Portugal is one of the countries that recorded an increase in drug overdose by over 30% in 2005,"" according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Bennett and Huffington's misguided solutions would result in more tragic deaths like Houston's. Illicit drugs are not harmful because they are illegal, they are illegal precisely because they are harmful. It is my hope that in the national dialogue surrounding Houston's death, our country's loudest voices would speak honestly and seriously about the drug problems in America. In the 1980s and '90s, the U.S. beat back the cocaine and heroine epidemics, not by legalization or decriminalization, but by tough law enforcement, strong prevention and education programs and public outcry. You could hardly watch TV without seeing the Partnership For a Drug-Free America's famous ""This is your brain on drugs"" advertisements. If we are to be successful today, we must reignite that same national effort. Whitney Houston's mother, Cissy Houston, understood the seriousness of drug abuse. In a 2009 interview with Oprah Winfrey, Houston recalled how her mother showed up one day at her doorstep with sheriff's officers and a court order in a drug intervention. ""(My mother) says, 'I have a court (injunction) here,' "" Houston said. ""Either you do it my way, or we're just not going to do this at all. We are both going to go on TV, and you're going to retire.'"" If more Americans, celebrities in particular, spoke and acted like Cissy Houston, rather than like Bennett or Huffington, fewer Americans would be victims to drug addiction.

"(CNN) -- While most children wait and hope Santa visits them at home on Christmas Eve, this year dozens of Denver-area children went directly to the big man's Arctic home turf. The children, many of whom are being treated for serious illnesses or are victims of abuse or homelessness, were flown to the ""North Pole"" this holiday season on a Fantasy Flight. The Fantasy Flight program began in 1992 at Washington's Dulles International Airport, and has since spread to Los Angeles and other airports around the country. Though the destination may be fantasy, the flight is not. Airline employees and retirees volunteer their time, and United Airlines donates the jets. Children are selected from the Make-A-Wish-Foundation, children's hospitals and various youth social service establishments. At Denver International Airport, this year's group of kids was greeted by United Airlines ticket agents, who had boarding passes ready to go -- stamped with the code for the kids' final destination: NTP. After being entertained by a dance group and treated to lunch, the children and their families were escorted through airport security to their gate, where flight attendants and several pilots greeted them with Christmas carols. Once on board the decorated plane, the kids buckled up for takeoff. Rob Fiebig, whose 6-year-old daughter Paige has cancer, was overwhelmed with emotion at the chance to make her Christmas so special. ""This is such a wonderful day, to bring all of these kids together and many of them flying on a plane for the first time. We're just so grateful,"" Fiebig said. His daughter spends one month every year receiving treatment at the Ronald McDonald House. When asked what she was looking forward to the most, Paige responded, ""I'm just excited to see Santa and Mrs. Claus."" After flying for about an hour, the ""rocket plane"" landed at the North Pole, where it was personally welcomed by Santa and all of his helpers. While the adults on board may have thought the scene resembled a huge, decorated airplane hangar, the kids knew better. Singing and cheers filled the plane, and children jockeyed to meet their host. Airbus pilot Capt. Paul Purkey has been at the controls of this particular Fantasy Flight several times and looks forward to taking the kids to the North Pole every year. ""The first time I saw it, it was breathtaking,"" he said. ""You have Santa on the hoist, going around the airplane, and the kids are mesmerized by the whole experience. It's a wonderful adventure."" After finally meeting the man responsible for bringing them so much joy, each child was sent home with a bag of gifts -- one so large many of them needed help carrying it out. Andrea Farley's younger cousin Grace has Down syndrome. Farley helped Grace lug her presents home. ""It's really important for them to have this opportunity,"" she said on the way. ""These kids will talk about this all year long.""","Fantasy Flight brings kids to the North Pole to visit Santa .

"(CNN) -- Syria has four chemical weapons facilities that it did not previously disclose to the United Nations, a Western diplomat told CNN on Tuesday. The diplomat said Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. special envoy overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical stockpiles, briefed the U.N. Security Council. Three of the sites are research and development facilities and one is a production facility, according to the source. Syria disclosed the information during ongoing meetings between the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and Syrian authorities, Kaag told the council members, according to the source. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power tweeted shortly after: ""Must keep pressure on regime so it doesn't hide (chemical weapons) capability."" In August 2013, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters that a team of experts had gathered to go to Syria to investigate reports of chemical weapons. In September 2013, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released the inspectors' report, which says there was ""clear and convincing evidence"" that sarin, a nerve agent developed for chemical warfare, was used in a Damascus attack. Later that month, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution requiring Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons arsenal, and President Bashar al-Assad promised to adhere to the resolution. The following month, Syria began dismantling its chemical weapons program. In July, 600 metric tons of chemical weapons from Syria were transferred to a U.S. ship for destruction in what marked the demise of the last of the country's declared chemical weapons stockpiles. At the time, officials said it was a major milestone. But inspectors have said they couldn't say for sure whether some undeclared weapons were still lurking somewhere in the country. And in August, there were new allegations of chlorine attacks, officials said. After inspectors' findings were detailed in Tuesday's closed-door Security Council briefing, diplomats took to Twitter with statements that echoed accusations aimed at the Syrian government a year ago. ""Witnesses of chlorine gas attacks described them as carried out by helicopters, which only Syrian regime has. All fingers point to Assad,"" Power said. ""Connect the dots: @OPCW sure chlorine used in #Syria, witnesses saw it dropped by helicopters, which only Assad has. Who's responsible? #UNSC,"" the Lithuanian mission to the United Nations, a current member of the Security Council, tweeted. The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to CNN. Asked about the revelation of additional Syrian chemical weapons facilities, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki pointed to a recent statement from Secretary of State John Kerry, which said the United States was ""gravely concerned"" about the recent reports of chlorine attacks in Syria. ""This finding, coupled with deep concerns regarding the accuracy and completeness of Syria's declaration to the (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), raises especially troubling concerns that continued chemical attacks on the Syrian people by the regime could occur,"" Kerry said last month. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Ben Brumfield, Diana Magnay and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Investigators also detail August chlorine attack allegations .

"(CNN) -- Even if Lindsey Vonn competes at the Olympics in Sochi in February, what kind of form will the four-time World Cup overall champion be in? Vonn missed a gate in a downhill in Val d'Isere, France on Saturday -- with boyfriend Tiger Woods watching -- and then said her ailing right knee was to blame. She was seeking to become just the second woman -- behind Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proll -- to win 60 World Cup races. ""I didn't hurt myself more than I'm already hurt,"" the American told reporters. ""Unfortunately I have no (anterior cruciate ligament) and it gave out on me. ""My knee is loose and it's not stable and that's the way it's going to be from here on out. I just have to get used to it."" The reigning Olympic and World Cup downhill champ hurt the knee at the world championships last February -- she subsequently underwent reconstructive surgery -- and aggravated the problem in a crash in training last month. But Vonn made a quick recovery and placed fifth in a Super-G in Lake Louise, Canada before deciding to skip last week's races in St. Moritz, Switzerland. ""It's certainly not the return I had anticipated,"" Vonn said. ""It was Tiger's first time on a World Cup race and I was really hoping to win my 60th as a present for him."" Vonn added she would probably only race once or twice more prior to the Olympics in Russia. ""I just need to be more careful of how many races I do,"" she said. ""I'm at risk of doing more damage to my knee and my meniscus. So I'm going to play it safe and race really minimal races."" Marianne Kaufmann-Abderhalden of Switzerland earned a maiden World Cup victory, beating Slovenia's Tina Maze by 0.29 seconds and Austria's Cornelia Huetter by 0.50 seconds. Kaufmann-Abderhalden trails Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch by six points in the downhill standings. Hoefl-Riesch was ninth Saturday. Oh, Canada .

"New York (CNN) -- Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan will be unable to withstand mounting U.S. pressure and their only option will be to break with al Qaeda and join a peaceful dialogue on the country's future, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday. ""They cannot wait us out. They cannot defeat us. And they cannot escape this choice,"" Clinton said in a major address on U.S. policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In her remarks to the Asia Society, Clinton reaffirmed President Barack Obama's pledge to begin withdrawing troops this July, based on conditions on the ground, and said all troops will be out of the country by the end of 2014. Clinton said the United States and its NATO allies in Afghanistan are simultaneously pursuing ""three surges"" aimed at ending the nearly decade-old conflict. The military offensive will be supported by civilian efforts to bolster Afghanistan's government and an ""intensified diplomatic push,"" she said. ""As the military surge weakens the insurgents and pressures them to consider alternatives to armed resistance, the civilian surge creates economic and social incentives for participating in peaceful society,"" Clinton said. Also being launched, she said, is a ""diplomatic surge to move this conflict toward a political outcome that shatters the alliance between the Taliban and al Qaeda, ends the insurgency and helps produce a stable Afghanistan and a peaceful region."" ""That would leave al Qaeda alone and on the run,"" she said. Although the reconciliation process must be Afghan-led, Clinton said, it will draw in other countries in the region and the international community. Such efforts could build upon President Karzai's plans for reconciliation, including the Peace Jirga in June and the High Peace Council which is holding meetings throughout the country. The process, she said, must be accepted by ""all of Afghanistan's major ethnic and political blocs"" and must include women. She said that in order to join reconciliation efforts, the Taliban must renounce violence, abandon their alliance with al-Qaeda, and abide by the constitution of Afghanistan. ""If former militants are willing to meet these red lines, they would then be able to participate in the political life of the country under the constitution,"" she said. She acknowledged that the success of reconciliation efforts depends on the participation of Pakistan, which she said plays a ""pivotal role."" While Clinton said Pakistan will have to be part of the process and its concerns must be taken into account by the Afghan government, she also said Pakistan must respect Afghan sovereignty and take steps to prevent the Afghan Taliban from conducting the insurgency from Pakistani territory. Warning that Pakistan is at risk of major instability that would hamper the war effort in Afghanistan, she urged the Pakistani government to implement broad reforms and stop fomenting anti-American sentiment. Clinton announced that retired veteran diplomat Marc Grossman, a former U.S. ambassador to Turkey who served in Pakistan early in his career, will be the new special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, replacing Richard Holbrooke, who died in December. As Republicans in Congress propose sharp budget cuts, Clinton warned it is critical to maintain funding for Afghanistan's civilian reconstruction. ""Retreating from the civilian side of the mission -- as some funding proposals currently before Congress would do -- would be a grave mistake,"" she said.","Mounting pressure is putting the Taliban in a bind, Clinton says .
An ""intensified diplomatic push"" will join the military and civilian surges, she says .
The aim is to shatter the alliance between the Taliban and al Qaeda, she says ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- One of three remaining defendants in the ""Bling Ring"" pleaded no contest Friday to burglarizing the home of Lindsay Lohan in 2009 and was sentenced, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office said in a news release. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler sentenced Diana Tamayo, 22, to three years of probation and ordered her to complete 60 days of work for the California Department of Transportation. That could involve picking up trash from the side of the road, said DA spokeswoman Jane Robison. Tamayo was given credit for the 10 days she served in jail. It was not clear whether she had legal representation. In exchange for the plea, the DA's office asked for the dismissal of a felony count of conspiracy to commit burglary and a count of receiving stolen property. Tamayo is to return to court on November 8 for a restitution hearing. The two remaining defendants in the case -- Courtney Leigh Ames, 21; and Roy Lopez Jr., 30 -- also are to appear on that date for a pretrial hearing. They are charged with conspiracy, first-degree residential burglary and receiving stolen property. The three are among five people indicted in 2010. The indictment alleges that, between September 2008 and August 2009, they took more than $3 million in jewelry, clothes and accessories from the homes of Orlando Bloom, Paris Hilton, Brian Austin-Green and Megan Fox, Lindsay Lohan and ""The Hills"" reality star Audrina Patridge. Two ringleaders, Nicholas Prugo and Rachel Lee, pleaded earlier. Lee was sentenced last year to four years in prison for burglarizing Patridge's home. Lee pleaded no contest to one count of first-degree residential burglary. Lohan's home was burglarized on August 2009, and an estimated $128,000 in jewelry, designer clothes and accessories was taken, authorities said. Authorities said they believe an obsession with celebrity culture -- and breaking inside their homes and wearing their clothing -- could have been the motivation for the crimes. The group allegedly studied celebrity magazines to pick out clothing and jewelry that they wanted, and then studied satellite maps of the victim's homes before deciding on the best method for entry, police said. At first, police treated each robbery as a separate incident, but after noticing similarities on surveillance video from the homes of Patridge and Lohan, they concluded that the incidents were related. ""There's nothing to suggest that these kids were criminal masterminds -- this wasn't an 'Ocean's 11' caper,"" Los Angeles Police Department Officer Brett Goodkin told CNN in 2009. ""It's really a series of quite run-of-the-mill residential burglaries, except they targeted the victims for who they are."" The ring has also been dubbed the Hollywood Hills Burglar Bunch.","Diana Tamayo, 22, is sentenced to three years of probation .

"(CNN) -- The biology professor charged in the shooting deaths Friday of three faculty members at the University of Alabama in Huntsville fatally shot her brother more than 23 years ago, police said Saturday. Amy Bishop Anderson, who was then known as Amy Bishop, was never charged in her brother's death, Braintree, Massachusetts, Police Chief Paul Frazier told reporters. Police records detailing the 1986 incident are missing, and a log of the incident lists it as an accidental shooting, he said. But the account told by Frazier differs from the one published at the time by a Boston newspaper. ""It is a far different story I believe than what was reported back then,"" Frazier said. ""I cannot tell you what the thought process was behind our releasing her at the time."" A December 8, 1986, article in the Boston Globe states that Anderson asked her mother how to unload a round from a 12-gauge shotgun and accidentally shot her brother while she was handling the weapon. The article cited then-Police Chief John Polio as the source. However, Frazier said an officer, who was involved in the case and still works for the department, told him that Anderson shot her brother in the chest during an argument. The woman allegedly fired a shot in her bedroom without hitting anyone, then argued with her brother and shot him. She fired yet another round in the home before fleeing, Frazier said. Police arrested Anderson after she pointed a weapon at a vehicle near the house in an attempt to get the driver to stop, but it drove on, Frazier said. But during the booking process, Chief Polio called and told the officers to release her, Frazier said. In a telephone call with CNN, Polio -- now 87 and retired -- denied ever calling in the order. He said detectives had interviewed Anderson and her mother -- Judith Baker, who was a member of the police department's personnel board -- as well as the lead investigator, Capt. Theodore Buker, who has since died. Buker told him that the shooting appeared accidental and the two men agreed she should be released to her mother, Polio said. A request was then filed with the office of District Attorney Bill Delahunt to conduct an inquiry, but Delahunt never did so, he said. Delahunt, now a Democratic congressman representing Massachusetts, was in Jerusalem on Saturday and unable to comment on the case, spokesman Mark Forest told CNN. Polio acknowledged that an argument had occurred during the shooting and said that the other shots, including one fired into the ceiling, did not appear aimed at anyone. He also recalled that Anderson had fled the scene. But, he said, he could not remember what he had told the newspaper in reference to the case or why details, including the argument, were not reported. Polio rejected as ""laughable"" any suggestions that the suspect's mother might have influenced their handling of the case. ""There was no cover up,"" Polio said. ""Absolutely no cover up and no missing records. The records were all there when I left. Where they went in the last 22 years and two police chiefs subsequent, I don't know."" Anderson, a Harvard-educated professor, has been charged with capital murder. Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes said Anderson, 45, was attending a faculty meeting on the third floor of the sciences building Friday afternoon when she shot six colleagues, killing three. Anderson, a professor and researcher at the university, was arrested as she was leaving the building, Reyes told reporters Saturday. He said a 9 mm handgun was recovered from the second floor of the building late Friday. Anderson is charged with one count of capital murder, a crime that involved two or more intentional deaths and is eligible for the death penalty in Alabama. Madison County District Attorney Rob Broussard said officials were considering other charges, including attempted murder. University spokesman Ray Garner has identified the dead as Gopi Podila, chairman of the biological sciences department; Maria Davis, associate professor of biology; and Adriel Johnson, associate professor of biology. The injured were Joseph Leahy, associate professor of biology, in critical condition; Luis Cruz-Vera, assistant professor of biology, in stable condition; and Stephanie Monticello, staff assistant, also in stable condition. They were taken to Huntsville Hospital. Authorities have not ruled out the possibility of other suspects in connection with the shooting. Investigators have interviewed Anderson's husband, Jim. Anderson had been working at the university since 2003 and was up for tenure, Garner said. However, authorities wouldn't discuss possible motives or whether the issue of tenure may have played a role in the shooting. Garner said the meeting at Shelby Hall was for faculty and staff in the sciences department, but he gave no other details. The incident occurred shortly before 4 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), and residence halls were locked down 10 minutes later. An alert notifying the campus about the incident was issued at 4:42 p.m. CT. Pressed on the amount of time that passed before a campus alert was sent notifying students and faculty about the shooting and the lockdown, university police Chief Chuck Gailes said the lag ""didn't impact the safety of people on campus and in the building."" He said there is no specific timeframe that dictates how quickly such an alert is issued, but he said it would be an issue officials will look into. University President David Williams said there would be a prayer service Sunday. ""We are a resilient community, and we know we will come together to overcome these difficult times,"" he said. Williams said the campus would open for employees next week but there would be no classes. Kourtney Lattimore, a 19-year-old sophomore studying nursing, was one of about 100 students who attended the suspect's anatomy class from 10:20 to 11:15 a.m. Friday., when the subject included neurons. ""Nothing seemed to be off at all,"" she said about her teacher, who wore a pink sweater in class. ""We were all shocked, like, all of us just couldn't believe it."" Lattimore said her anatomy class was not the only one affected by Friday's events. Leahy -- who was wounded in the shooting -- taught her infection and immunity class, she said. Reached at the couple's home, Jim Anderson told CNN that his wife has an attorney whom he would not identify. He described his wife as a good teacher.","NEW: Charged professor killed brother in 1986, Massachusetts police say .

"San Pedro Sula, Honduras (CNN) -- At the morgue in San Pedro Sula, the second largest city in Honduras, a grim new tally greets Dr. Hector Hernandez every morning. On Monday, the number was four. On Tuesday, five. Some are riddled with bullets; in one case 72 bullet wounds. Others are bound by their hands and feet and strangled. The ceaseless river of bodies flowing through the morgue in San Pedro Sula is a sobering testament to one reason so many people leave Central America to risk it all on a long, perilous journey to the United States. In a country with rampant crime and little economic opportunity, even the prospect of a dangerous journey is overshadowed by the potential reward of a new life north of the border. Hernandez, the city's director of forensic medicine, needs no reminder. One of the most troubling cases for him came in a week ago: a 13-year-old girl with her throat slit ear to ear. Her body was found in a shallow grave in a backyard. The circumstances of her death are still under investigation. Each body brought in tells of brutality and violence, of the city's devastating gang activity. Fueled by the drug trade, rival gangs duel here for recruits, territory and cash. From January to June of this year, the city experienced 538 homicides. A gun was used in 423 deaths. It's these tragic figures that have led to the city being dubbed ""the murder capital of the world."" The saddest room . The small room where families learn of their loved ones' fate has a crucifix, auditorium-style seats and a wall filled with pictures of the city's missing. Sisters Albertina Eriquez and Suyapa Arguete sit in two of those seats. Their eyes are red and swollen with tears. A terrible call came over the weekend. Eriquez's son and Arguete's nephew, Jorge Villalobo, 24, was found dead. His wife and three children, ages 12, 6 and 2, were on a Disney vacation in the United States, and Villalobo was to join them soon. A gunman or gunmen had another idea. Villalobo's body was one of the four brought in Monday. Hernandez suspects Villalobo, a businessman who family members say fought extortion from the gangs, was robbed and died from gunshot wounds. The gangs are watching . Hernandez doesn't take chances with his own security. When he was promoted to his current position about a year ago, he was given two full-time bodyguards. His family left the city for their own protection. In fact, Hernandez says the mere act of claiming a body or attending a funeral can make people here a target for gang members who stalk the morgue and cemetery looking for their next mark. Forty-eight bodies are unclaimed at the morgue. After 30 days, they'll be buried in the city's public cemetery. DNA, dental records and fingerprints are retained for the day when a loved one shows up or a killer is caught. Leave or die . Hernandez says he believes the situation is getting a bit better. In May, the worst month, the body tally hovered around nine per day, he said. Yet the fear pulsating through San Pedro Sula remains. Villalobo's aunt says that people in the roughest neighborhoods leave Honduras because they ""don't have another option."" Hernandez says he believes many families haven't claimed their loved ones' bodies because they believe their family members have migrated.

"(CNN) -- With fish as witnesses, the president of Maldives and his Cabinet wore scuba gear and used hand signals Saturday at an underwater meeting to highlight the threat climate change poses to the archipelago nation. The Maldives declaration will be presented at a U.N. summit on climate change in December. The meeting, chaired by President Mohamed Nasheed, took place around a table about 16 feet (5 meters) underwater, according to the president's Web site. Bubbles ascended from the face masks the president and the Cabinet wore, and fish swam around them. At the meeting, the Cabinet signed a declaration calling for global cuts in carbon emissions that will be presented before a U.N. climate summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December. ""We are trying to send our message to let the world know what is happening and what will happen to the Maldives if climate change isn't checked,"" Nasheed said, according to his Web site. Asked what would happen if Copenhagen fails, the president said, ""we are all going to die,"" according to the site. The ministers signed their wet suits, which are being auctioned, to raise money for coral reef protection in the Maldives, the Web site said. Maldives is grappling with the very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels. The Maldives is an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands south-southwest of India. Most of it lies just 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) above sea level. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change has forecast a rise in sea levels of at least 7.1 inches (18 cm) by the end of the century. The country's capital, Male, is protected by sea walls. But creating a similar barrier around the rest of the country will be cost-prohibitive.  Watch how the Maldives are fighting to survive » . Soon after his election in November, Nasheed raised the possibility of finding a new homeland for the country's 396,000 residents. The tourist nation wants to set aside part of its annual billion-dollar revenue into buying a new homeland, he said at the time. ""We will invest in land,"" he said. ""We do not want to end up in refugee tents if the worst happens."" Nasheed's government said it has broached the idea with several countries and found them to be ""receptive."" Lands owned by Sri Lanka and India were possibilities because the countries have similar cultures, cuisine and climate as the Maldives. Australia is also being considered because of the vast unoccupied land it owns. CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","President, Cabinet don scuba gear to sign carbon emissions declaration .

"(CNN) -- NBC's medical correspondent Dr. Nancy Snyderman has issued an apology after she reportedly violated the quarantine her team was placed in when their cameraman contracted Ebola. During the NBC Nightly News broadcast on Monday, anchor Brian Williams read out the following statement from Snyderman: . ""While under voluntary quarantine guidelines, which called for our team to avoid public contact for 21 days, members of our group violated those guidelines and understand that our quarantine is now mandatory until 21 days have passed. We remain healthy and our temperatures are normal. ""As a health professional I know that we have no symptoms and pose no risk to the public, but I am deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused. We are thrilled that Ashoka (Mukpo) is getting better and our thoughts continue to be with the thousands affected by Ebola whose stories we all went to cover."" Trip to Liberia . Snyderman and her team went into a 21-day voluntary isolation after Mukpo, their freelance cameraman, was found to have contracted Ebola. The team had been in Liberia, a hotspot for the outbreak. Mukpo is recovering at the Nebraska Medical Center where he is receiving an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001. Twenty one days is standard length for quarantine because that's how long the disease's incubation period is. But the NBC crew apparently broke its word. Takeout order . The website Planet Princeton reported that Snyderman went to a restaurant to pick up a takeout order. Shortly after, the New Jersey Department of Health mandated the crew remain quarantined. ""Unfortunately, the NBC crew violated this agreement and so the Department of Health Friday evening issued a mandatory quarantine order to ensure that the crew will remain confined until October 22,"" the health department said. ""The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community,"" it read. Expressing appreciation . Meanwhile, Mukpo posted a status update on his Facebook page Monday, thanking everyone for their concerns. ""There have been some dark and profoundly frightening moments in this ordeal, but I want everyone to know that your good energy, love, and support was felt in a very direct way over these last two weeks,"" he wrote. I won't ever know exactly when I slipped up and contracted the virus.

"(CNN) -- British authorities overnight arrested four men for suspected terrorism, police said on Friday, adding to the scores that have been rounded up in recent months as part of efforts to prevent homegrown attacks. The men, ages 19 to 27, were rounded in four different southern England locales between 8:31 p.m. (3:31 p.m. ET) Thursday and 2:55 a.m. Friday, according to London's Metropolitan Police. Armed police -- who are rarely deployed in the United Kingdom -- took part in three of the arrests, though no shots were fired, the Metropolitan Police said. The force's Terrorism Command, working with the regional South East Counter Terrorism Unit and Britain's intelligence agency MI5, made the arrests as ""part of an ongoing investigation into Islamist-related terrorism."" The four are hardly the first to be taken into custody for suspicions tied to Britain's Terrorism Act 2000. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said last month that counter-terrorism officers were ""running exceptionally high numbers of counter-terrorism investigations, the likes of which we have not seen for several years.""

"(CNN) -- It was a big applause line, one of many for former President Bill Clinton Wednesday night. Speaking to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, Clinton -- whose presidency unfolded during a boom era for the U.S. economy -- told delegates that Democratic administrations had a nearly 2-to-1 advantage over Republicans in creating jobs. ""Since 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24,"" Clinton said. ""In those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the job score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42."" Fact Check: The not-so-empty factory . Since Clinton repeatedly invoked ""arithmetic"" as the secret to his administration's success, we thought we'd check his. The facts: . Clinton's math is a bit off, but not substantially. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures examined by CNN, he understated the net number of private jobs created under Democratic administrations and overstated the number of jobs created in GOP eras. But the ratio is basically correct: A net increase of 44.7 million jobs created during the Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Clinton and Obama administrations, compared to a 23.3 million figure during the Nixon, Ford, Reagan and both Bush administrations. Fact Check: Would Romney bankrupt Medicare by 2016? Republican numbers were crimped by recessions that occurred more frequently during their administrations -- in 1969 and 1973, 1981, 1990, 2001 and 2007. The only recession to occur during a Democratic presidency was in early 1980, during the Carter administration, while the 2007 recession lasted nearly six months into the Obama administration. Democrats, meanwhile, were also helped by population growth: A bigger country should produce more jobs, and Democrats have held office for nearly 12 of the past 20 years. Conclusion: . Economists constantly argue over which presidents get the credit or the blame for what happened on their watches, of course. But in terms of the numbers Clinton cited, his claim is remarkably close, and the discrepancy doesn't contradict his argument. Fact Check: Obama, Romney and Osama bin Laden . CNN's Matt Smith, Caitlin Stark and Tom Foreman contributed to this report.","Clinton says Democratic administrations produce more private-sector jobs .

"Arusha, Tanzania (CNN) -- In most doctors' waiting rooms, it's the nurse who calls the mother and child for their vaccination. In Tanzania's Arusha National Park, nurse Neema Baynet has to go out and find her patients. With the Maasai tribes constantly on the move searching for water and fresh pasture for their cattle, Baynet can spend up to five days traveling 100 km searching the savannah for remote communities for whom her mobile immunization clinics are the only protection against deadly disease. ""A week before we set off, we send out a message to the communities and ask them to spread the word that we are coming so we can vaccinate as many children as possible,"" says Baynet. ""Tell them the chanjos [vaccines] are coming. Bring your children!"" Despite the beauty of the backdrop of mountains, lakes and stunning savannah, Arusha's geography poses severe logistical challenges that leave Maasai mothers waiting days rather than hours for the nurse -- not because of a backlog of patients but because the nurse struggles to reach them. There are rivers to cross, rough tracks that turn into mud beds in the rainy season, impassable even for 4x4 vehicles, and sometimes no real track to follow. The terrain means health workers often sleep in their vehicle and are forced to complete their journey by foot -- in a region renowned for its dangerous wildlife. ""We do not often see lions,"" says Baynet, ""but we can hear them at night and see their tracks by day."" See also: Wildlife puts Tanzania on the tourist map . In the soaring temperatures of Arusha's equatorial climate, Baynet's quest to find her patients is also a race against time: modern vaccines must be kept cool to preserve their powers of prevention, and a cold box packed with ice is Baynet's very temporary defense. Yet the children of the Maasai cannot afford to miss out on the protective powers of vaccines. ""When a child falls sick in such areas, the greatest problem is getting them medical help,"" says Osmand Swai, clinical officer at a health center in the Maasai village of Gelai Lumbwa. ""They have to be carried over vast distances to reach the nearest doctor. When they arrive, they are usually in a very bad condition."" Nasieku Engishon lives in the Maasai settlement of Engirirat, near Gelai Lumbwa. She almost lost her 10-month-old daughter to pneumonia and diarrhea. ""When a child becomes sick, we carry them to the health center,"" she says. ""Carrying a sick child, it can take four to six hours to get there."" As a tribe that was decimated by disease and famine in the 19th century, the Maasai themselves are keenly aware of the importance of vaccinating their children. ""There was an outbreak of measles here last August and a lot of children became very sick,"" says Narangrang Laiseri, from Gelai Lumbwa. ""They took them to hospital, but five from this area died. I was lucky -- my son had been vaccinated against measles and he was one of the ones who got better quickly."" See also: Fighting cancer with cell phones: Innovation to save lives in Africa . The need to get to hard-to-reach people like the Maasai and the rest of the estimated 8% of Tanzania's population that do not receive basic life-saving vaccines has taken on a new urgency with the country's recent launch of a five-year development plan. The government wants to shift the national economy up a gear in its drive to transform Tanzania into a middle-income country by 2025, and it is now widely acknowledged that investing in children's health through vaccination is critical to building solid economic foundations. Healthy children do better in school and have a better chance to reach their full economic potential. Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikweke is hosting this week's high-level gathering of over 650 immunization experts in the capital, Dar-es-Salaam. The GAVI Alliance Partners' Forum (5-7 December) will focus on how to achieve equity in children's access to life-saving vaccines. To mark the event, the health ministry will launch two new vaccines into the national immunization program -- pneumococcal and rotavirus -- tackling the primary causes of pneumonia and diarrhea -- two of the leading killers of under-fives in Tanzania. Tanzania's One Plan aims to ensure that these new vaccines reach all children, from the Maasai in the north to the islands of Zanzibar, where boats are used to deliver medicine to the more remote of the archipelago's many islands. ""We have a strategy to reach every child with vaccination and we engage communities in planning and implementing it,"" says Yussuf Makame, manager of Zanzibar's Expanded Programme on Immunisation. However, Maasai mothers remain fearful that the sheer geographical scale of Arusha means that for them the waiting game is destined to go on. ""Of course we know how important it is to vaccinate our children,"" says Laiseri. ""Whenever we hear the vaccinators are coming, people bring their children. But sometimes they are so far away, they do not hear about the vaccination in time.""","Getting vaccines to wandering Maasai tribes in Tanzania can take days .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Former TV chef Juan-Carlos Cruz entered a plea of not guilty Monday in his initial appearance on a murder-for-hire charge in Los Angeles. The former host of the Food Network's ""Calorie Commando"" was charged Monday with attempted murder and solicitation of murder for allegedly trying to hire homeless men to kill his wife, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. He remained behind bars pending a $2 million bond payment. A preliminary hearing was set for June 23. The criminal complaint filed Monday accused Cruz, 48, of trying to hire David Carrington and David Walters -- homeless men who go by the street names Little Dave and Big Dave -- to murder Jennifer Campbell, Cruz's wife. It was not immediately clear who was Little Dave and who was Big Dave. If convicted, Cruz could face up to life in prison, the prosecution spokeswoman said. Assistant Deputy District Attorney Joseph Marcus would not talk about the case, but the homeless men allegedly solicited to carry out the hit did speak with celebrity news and gossip website TMZ on Saturday. One of them called Cruz ""very meticulous"" but ""very cheap"" in his planning. The plan fell apart when one of the men whom Cruz allegedly recruited told Santa Monica police, said Sgt. Jay Trisler. Trisler confirmed that men interviewed by TMZ are the chief witnesses against Cruz. Little Dave told TMZ he was approached first by Cruz, who asked him to kill his wife for cash, and he told his friend Big Dave. Big Dave said he told a Santa Monica police officer about the plot after he was arrested for loitering. ""We're very fortunate that we have a relationship and rapport with some of the homeless and that they were able to give us information,"" Trisler said. Santa Monica police began their undercover investigation of Cruz on May 7, Trisler said. Cruz was arrested at a dog park in the Cheviot Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles on Thursday afternoon, he said. Big Dave and Little Dave got a place to stay while the investigation was under way. Santa Monica police put them in a hotel room to keep them out of sight, Big Dave said. ""They gave us two pizzas, a 12-pack of beer and a bottle of San Jose,"" he said. ""I love them."" Cruz, a Los Angeles resident, was an overweight pastry chef at Hotel Bel Air until he changed his focus to promote low-calorie recipes. He authored ""The Juan-Carlos Cruz Calorie Countdown Cookbook: A 5-Week Eating Strategy for Sustainable Weight Loss,"" which was published in 2007. The Food Network issued a short statement Monday saying that Cruz ""has not been under contract or associated with Food Network for a number of years.""

"(CNN) -- Richard Turere, 13, doesn't like lions. In fact, he hates them. Yet this bright Maasai boy has devised an innovative solution that's helping the survival of these magnificent beasts -- by keeping them away from humans. Living on the edge of Nairobi National Park, in Kenya, Turere first became responsible for herding and safeguarding his family's cattle when he was just nine. But often, his valuable livestock would be raided by the lions roaming the park's sweet savannah grasses, leaving him to count the losses. ""I grew up hating lions very much,"" says Turere, who is from Kitengela, just south of the capital Nairobi. ""They used to come at night and feed on our cattle when we were sleeping."" Read this: Boy's website tracks big beasts . So, at the age of 11, Turere decided it was time to find a way of protecting his family's cows, goats and sheep from falling prey to hungry lions. His light bulb moment came with one small observation. ""One day, when I was walking around,"" he says, ""I discovered that the lions were scared of the moving light."" Turere realized that lions were afraid of venturing near the farm's stockade when someone was walking around with a flashlight. He put his young mind to work and a few weeks later he'd come up with an innovative, simple and low-cost system to scare the predators away. He fitted a series of flashing LED bulbs onto poles around the livestock enclosure, facing outward. The lights were wired to a box with switches and to an old car battery powered by a solar panel. They were designed to flicker on and off intermittently, thus tricking the lions into believing that someone was moving around carrying a flashlight. And it worked. Since Turere rigged up his ""Lion Lights,"" his family has not lost any livestock to the wild beasts, to the great delight of his father and astonishment of his neighbors. Read this: Teaching lions and humans to get along . What's even more impressive is that Turere devised and installed the whole system by himself, without ever receiving any training in electronics or engineering. The 13-year-old's remarkable ingenuity has been recognized with an invitation to the TED 2013 conference, being held this week in California, where he'll share the stage with some of the world's greatest thinkers, innovators and scientists. ""I did it myself, no one taught me, I just came up with it,"" says Turere. ""I had to look after my dad's cows and make sure that they were safe."" Human-wildlife conflict . Nairobi is the world's only capital with a national park, where wild lions, rhinos and other beasts roam free against the urban backdrop of skyscrapers rising from the nearby bustling city center. Each year, thousands of camera-toting tourists visit the park -- which is fenced along its northern boundary but open in the south -- hoping to catch a glimpse of the lions inhabiting its rolling plains and valleys. Read this: Orphaned girl starts university at 14 . But for the pastoralists and Maasai tribes around the park, a lion sighting is usually bad news; valuable livestock are often lost to lions looking for easy prey, prompting rural communities to take matters into their own hands. In some cases they've killed whole prides that they perceived as threat, or as retaliation for lost livestock. The use of pesticides such as Furadan -- a tablespoon of which costs less than a dollar and is enough to kill a lion -- has become a particularly ruthless way of doing so. The rising human-wildlife conflict, coupled with a fast-growing urban encroachment, means that Kenya is now home to less than 2,000 lions, a massive drop compared to the 15,000 that lived there just a decade ago. Large sums have been spent in recent years by officials in a bid to protect the lions and strengthen Kenya's tourism industry. Yet conservationists say that many of these top-down initiatives fail to gain traction with local populations. And this is why inventions like Turere's -- home grown, simple, affordable and effective -- can make a big difference. Indeed, several neighbors of the Turere family in Kitengela have sought Turere's help, asking him to install the system in their enclosures. In total, around 75 ""Lion Light"" systems have so far been rigged up around Kenya. ""This is a solution that was invented by somebody in the community,"" explains Paula Kahumbu, executive director of the Kenya Land Conservation Trust and chairman of the Friends of Nairobi National Park. ""Therefore the support for it is very high."" Bright ideas, bright future . Kahumbu and her colleagues first came across Turere's innovation some two years ago in the course of their fieldwork. Stunned by the boy's achievements, they helped him get a scholarship at Brookhouse International School, one of Kenya's top educational institutions, where he started last April. ""Richard is quite an extraordinary boy,"" says Kahumbu. She describes him as a ""very smart, curious and surprisingly confident [boy] for his age and background,"" who's integrated smoothly among his new classmates, most of whom are from wealthy families. ""One thing that's unique about Richard is that if you give him a problem, he'll keep working at it until he can fix it,"" she adds. ""He doesn't give up; he doesn't find things too difficult; he's not afraid of being unable to do something and I think this is why he is such a good innovator -- because he's not worried that it might not work, he's going to try and do it anyway."" Turere says his dream is to work in aviation when he grows up. ""Three years ago when I was in the savannah herding my father's cattle I used to see the planes flying over and landing at the airport and I was like, one day I'll be a pilot and an aircraft engineer,"" he says. For this remarkable boy, it's clear that the sky is the limit.","Richard Turere, 13, has found an innovative way to protect his family's cattle from lions .

"(CNN) -- Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel are getting their group back together this spring for a reunion tour of Asia and Australia, according to a source close to the group. Art Garfunkel and Paul Simon, here performing at a 2007 gala, are planning to tour this summer. Reunion plans apparently began after Simon and Garfunkel played three songs together during Simon's two-night gig at New York's Beacon Theatre in February. Tour rehearsals begin in New York in May and the tour will launch in New Zealand around the first week of June, according to the source. Shows in Australia and possibly Japan will follow, the source said. Simon's manager, Jeff Kramer, has asked the group's musicians to clear their calendars -- which means canceling other shows -- from late May through June, the source said. Kramer, in a statement to Rolling Stone magazine after the February show, hinted that a tour was in the works. No official announcement has been made and Simon's publicist has not responded to CNN requests for comment. ""Yes there have been conversations taking place, but nothing has been confirmed,"" Kramer told Rolling Stone. Simon and Garfunkel last reunited for their ""Old Friends"" tour in 2003 and 2004, which Rolling Stone estimated earned $123 million.

"New York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama marked the dedication of the long-awaited September 11 Memorial Museum Thursday with families, survivors and rescuers at the site, saying the ""sacred place of healing and hope"" will ensure that ""generations yet unborn will never forget"" the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil. ""It is an honor for us to join in your memories, to recall and to reflect, and above all to reaffirm the true spirit of 9/11: love, compassion, sacrifice and to enshrine it forever in the heart of our nation,"" the President said before the gray bedrock of the fallen towers. Both chilling and somber, the memorial will take visitors back to the day the twin towers of the World Trade Center were felled by hijacked jet planes on a clear September morning nearly 13 years ago. It also remembers those who lost their lives outside of New York the same day, when a hijacked jet flew into the Pentagon and another went down in a field in Pennsylvania. ""Here we tell their story so that generations yet unborn will never forget,"" Obama said. ""Of coworkers who led others to safety, of passengers who stormed the cockpit, our men and women in uniform who rushed into an inferno, our first responders who charged up those stairs, a generation of service members, our 9/11 generation who have served with honor in more than a decade of war."" The sacrifices of that day and the toil to build the museum demonstrates that the United States is ""a nation that stands tall and united and unafraid because no act of terror can match the strength or the character of our country,"" the President said. ""Nothing can ever break us,"" he added. ""Nothing can change who we are as Americans."" The ceremony was attended by dignitaries such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, former New York mayors Michael Bloomberg and Rudolph Giuliani and relatives of the more than 2,700 people who perished at the site. Before his speech, the President and first lady Michelle Obama viewed the museum with former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, along with others. Obama said the museum, which includes a mangled firetruck and a memorial wall with photos of the victims, provided a ""profound and moving experience."" Speakers recounted stories of random acts of kindness and courage that marked the fateful day, of firefighters who died climbing up stairs to save lives, of 24-year-old Welles Crowther -- who emerged from the smoke wearing a red bandana and calmly led survivors to the stairs in one of the towers. ""They didn't know his name,"" Obama said. ""They didn't know where he came from but they knew their lives had been saved by the man in the red bandana."" Crowther led survivors to safety during the chaos of the terrorist attack, before going back up the stairs to save others and losing his life. One of his red bandanas is on display in the museum. ""All those who come here will have a chance to know the sacrifice of a young man, who like so many, gave his life so others might live,"" Obama said. Crowther's mother, Alison, said the memorial was a symbol of ""how people helped each other that day"" and she hoped it would inspire others ""to do the same in ways both big and small."" She stood alongside Ling Young, one of the people her son rescued. ""It was very hard for me to come here ... but I wanted to do so, so I could say thank you to his parents,"" Young said. The museum will open to the public May 21. Also memorialized inside are the victims of the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center. The museum and memorial plaza, which opened in 2011, were built with $700 million in donations and tax dollars following construction problems and disputes over how best to remember the thousands of lives lost that day. The site, which has risen up from the ashes of suffering and tragedy, is expected to stand as a symbol of resilience, organizers said. It holds some 12,500 objects, 1,995 oral histories and 580 hours of film and video. 9/11 museum: Tragedy turns the mundane into memorial .","NEW: Obama: ""No act of terror can match the strength or the character of our country""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Dorko was injured Monday when a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle in Baghdad, Pentagon sources said. U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Dorko has been evacuated to Germany, Pentagon sources said. Dorko is believed to be the highest-ranking U.S. military officer injured in the war. He suffered shrapnel wounds and has been evacuated to Germany, the sources said. Dorko took command of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Gulf Region Division in Baghdad on October 10, according to the Corps of Engineers Web site. Also on Monday, the Iraqi army freed seven tribal sheikhs abducted Sunday in eastern Baghdad, Baghdad commander Gen. Abboud Qanbar told al-Iraqia state television. Qanbar said eight sheikhs had been abducted, but one was killed Sunday while resisting. Earlier, a Diyala tribal leader who is a member of the reconciliation committee in the province said that 11 sheikhs had been kidnapped, eight had been released and three more remained in captivity. The freed sheikhs were Shiite, from Anbakiya tribe, the tribal leader said. The tribal leader said the body of a Sunni sheikh, who was from the al-Azza tribe, was later found near where the kidnapping took place. He said the three remaining sheikhs were Sunni. An Interior Ministry official had originally told CNN that 10 tribal sheikhs -- seven Sunni and three Shiite -- had been kidnapped . Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammed al-Askari told CNN that four kidnappers were killed in the raid, which took place in Baghdad's Rusafa district on the Tigris River. Earlier Monday, the U.S. military blamed the kidnappings on former Mehdi Army militia brigade commander Arkan Hasnawi. The military said Hasnawi ""has joined forces with Iranian-supported special groups that are rejecting [Mehdi Army leader] Muqtada al-Sadr's direction to embrace fellow Iraqis."" Al-Sadr, an Iraqi Shiite cleric who controls the Mehdi Army, has called on the militia to obey a cease-fire following deadly firefights in August with rival Shiite militias. Iran has denied that Iranian agents are helping train and equip militants in Iraq. The sheiks were kidnapped while returning home to Baquba after meetings in Baghdad with Iraqi government officials, an Interior Minister official said. The meetings concerned the reconciliation process in the nation. Cycling suicide bomber kills 28 . In Baquba on Monday, a suicide bomber riding a bicycle killed at least 28 Iraqi police at an Iraqi police base, the U.S. military said. The blast also wounded 17 police officers and three civilians, the military said. Iraqi police had reported 24 deaths earlier, describing them as police and police recruits. Local health officials put the death toll at 27, with a woman and child among the wounded. Baquba, the capital of Diyala province, is 32 miles (51 kilometers) northeast of Baghdad. Akram Salman, 22, a Sunni from Baquba's central Tahrir area told The Associated Press that he was among about 60 recruits when the attack happened. Al Qaeda in Iraq ""has threatened us before and prevented us from joining the police,"" Salman told the AP. ""They slaughtered many policemen, burned their houses, killed their families and blew up their headquarters. Now, when the people have defeated al Qaeda and cooperated with the government, al Qaeda staged this operation to show their presence and to give a message that they are still in control."" Col. David W. Sutherland, commander of U.S.-led coalition forces in Diyala province, said, ""This attack is typical of al Qaeda's barbaric and hateful ways, targeting Iraqi security forces who have been working to secure Baquba and enable progress."" North of Baquba, Iraqi police on Monday killed a man attempting to enter a police station and detonate a suicide vest in Hibhib, the U.S. military said. After police killed the man, the vest detonated outside the station, but no one was wounded and no damage was reported, the military said. Also Monday, a deadly bombing struck about four miles west of Baiji, an Iraqi oil center about 90 miles (145 kilometers) north of Baghdad. The device, placed in a parked car,  killed seven civilians and wounded another 15 people, local police said. In the capital Monday, a bomb in a parked car wounded at least five Iraqi civilians at a bus stop and taxi stand, an Interior Ministry official said. The attack took place in southwestern Baghdad's predominantly Shiite al-Baya'a district, the official said. Karbala province returns to Iraqi control . In an apparent sign of progress among coalition forces to secure areas south of Baghdad, the U.S. Army handed over responsibility for security of Karbala province to the Iraqi military in a ceremony Monday. Recent clashes between Shiite factions had delayed the Karbala handover, but the area is now considered to be more peaceful than many other sections of the war-torn country. During the ceremony at a soccer stadium in the provincial capital, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and other dignitaries listened to speeches and watched a parade that ended with a cheerleading-style performance and mock paramilitary drill by Iraq soldiers.  Watch al-Maliki and Iraqi forces at the ceremony » . Al-Maliki challenged Iraqi commanders to work on bolstering security forces so they could assume responsibility in more provinces. ""We should all take responsibility for building military capability,"" the prime minister said. He added, ""Allow me to say that we are late; we are late in building our security forces, and that is for reasons I do not want to talk about here."" The U.S. military said it will maintain a presence in the province to support the Iraqi military. ""Step by step, Iraqis are assuming control for the security in their provinces, and Karbala today is leading the way,"" said Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch, commander of the U.S. troops in the province. ""We are only a phone call away."" Karbala, a Shiite province south of Baghdad, will be the eighth of 18 Iraqi provinces to be handed over to the Iraqi government by coalition forces. The other provinces returned to Iraqi control are Najaf, Muthanna, Thiqar, Maysan, Duhuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya. Iraqi security forces are set to assume security responsibility in mid-December for the southern province of Basra, al-Maliki said.  Other developments .

"(CNN) -- Author R.L. Stine has returned to the evil street that made him famous in the 1990s, and fans are looking forward to the new ways he'll terrorize Shadyside High School teenagers on ""Fear Street."" ""Party Games,"" out on September 30, is the first of six new ""Fear Street"" books that Stine is releasing. The premise: When Shadyside High School senior Brendan Fear has a birthday party at his parent's summer house on Fear Island, things go from bad to worse. Stine, 70, is the author of more than 300 novels for children and teens, including the much-loved ""Goosebumps"" and ""Fear Street"" series. The latter was a major hit, selling 80 million copies and building a fan base that for years has been asking him to revive the spooky series. ""The whole thing happened because of Twitter,"" Stine said. ""It's a great way to keep in touch with my original readers, and 'Fear Street' was mentioned more than anything else. That's what they read when they were kids. And I suppose we're all nostalgic for what we read back then."" R.L. Stine aims to give adults 'Goosebumps' The new ""Fear Street"" arrives at a time many consider to be a renaissance of young adult horror. It disappeared as a dominant genre in the early 2000s with the rise of fantasy novels and series such as ""Harry Potter"" and ""Eragon."" Popular shows such as ""The Walking Dead"" and ""American Horror Story"" helped revive interest in horror literature, said Catherine Scully, young adult editor for the Horror Writers Association. Like today's TV shows, today's teen horror novels are darker and scarier than the ""Fear Street"" of the 1990s, reflecting the way popular culture has changed. Along with Stine, a new class of authors is attempting to redefine young adult horror for the ""Saw"" generation, which can easily find graphic depictions of violence on TV and in movies and video games. By weaving in diverse elements -- such as historic gothic and psychological thrillers -- and making both protagonists and villains more three-dimensional, this new wave of authors is hoping to appeal to readers looking for something more than gore and torture porn. Unlike horror depicted on television and the big screen, in horror literature for young adults, subtlety is key, rather than shock value, author and horror expert Jonathan Maberry said. ""Modern teen horror goes more inside the personal experience rather than the body count,"" he said. ""The more subtle you go and leave for the reader to interpret, they can participate and it's even scarier."" A brief history of young adult literature . Where it began, where it's going. The definition of teen horror can be difficult to pinpoint, especially as new authors broaden the range of topics contained within the genre. In the broadest sense, it embodies the disturbing, imaginative manifestations of fear and dread, life-or-death situations, thrilling surprises and a loss of control, authors and literary observers say. Horror is defined by what scares you, ""and that's very personal and different for each person,"" said Scully, who reviews young adult horror in HWA's 'Scary Out There' blog. Horror novels by Stine, Christopher Pike and Lois Duncan emerged as a salve to the 1970s and 1980s' ""problem novels"" that dealt with divorce, drugs and alcohol abuse. In the early 2000s, authors began began weaving elements of horror into fantasy, such as the ""Harry Potter"" series. Horror was the umbrella genre that gave birth to popular subgenres such as paranormal and dystopian, Scully said. As the genre evolved, it began attracting more readers with its diversity of subgenres and topics. Themes of empowerment and hope emerged, showcasing teens defeating evil in the face of their greatest fears -- and surviving to the end of the book, Scully said. Readers sound off: Books that changed YOUR lives . ""I look at YA horror as being the swords and shields we give our teens to fight with these problems that we have limited ways of coping with,"" Scully said. ""Teen horror stories are actually empowering them against these horrific things in their life. To have their own stories and their own ways of fighting back, I think we give them a voice."" Cat Winters, Kendare Blake, April Genevieve Tucholke and Kami Garcia are some of the authors folding in suspense and elements of psychological terror into horror novels. ""Horror combines what readers love by merging the scary creatures from 'Twilight' and gritty, horrifying elements of dystopian (literature),"" gothic horror author Winters said. ""Horror can be a genre of its own but finds its way into almost every other genre."" Kenneth Oppel, author of a young Victor Frankenstein series, believes that part of the appeal of modern young adult horror is the shift away from crazed serial killers to demons within ourselves. Case in point: zombies, monsters of our own creation. Zombies connect well with the teen experience, standing as a metaphor for misunderstanding, loss or massive life changes and how characters handle the consequences, Maberry said. Isaac Marion, author of ""Warm Bodies,"" which was adapted for the big screen in February 2013, didn't write his book for young adults. But they connected with the message: figuring out who you are and who you want to be, even if you're a zombie, he said. His book is told from the perspective of a zombie who feels lost until he meets (and doesn't want to eat) a living person. ""It always seemed strange to me that there was no curiosity about what's going on behind the scenes of this creature,"" Marion said. Young adult books from page to screen . New twists to old favorites . For years, fans have been asking Stine to revive ""Fear Street"" in online fan forums and over social media. But publishers weren't interested, claiming the idea he left behind in 1995 was outdated in the new world of young adult fiction dominated by dystopian worlds and paranormal events. Stine took to Twitter, thanking his fans for their interest while letting them know that the idea was discouraged. Then, associate editor Kat Brzozowski of Thomas Dunne Books, a division of St. Martin's Press, reached out to him. The ""Fear Street"" series married supernatural horror with real-life horror of teenagers' deepest fears and insecurities. That's why they were so popular with young readers, Brzozowski said, including herself. She thought it was fitting that the grandfather of teen horror revisit his most popular series for old fans and a new generation. Young adult books that changed our lives . While the Stine ""recipe"" remains the same -- following one character's perspective closely -- Stine says the new ""Fear Street"" books will be longer, more adult and more violent, reflecting how young adult fiction has changed since the 1990s. ""For me, it's thinking of new scares, plot twists and cliffhanger chapter endings I haven't done before, moving into the modern world,"" Stine said. ""It will be a roller coaster ride of fearful surprises."" Follow Ashley Strickland on Twitter .","R.L. Stine is reviving his most popular series, ""Fear Street""

"(CNN) -- The image of the empty factory has haunted American presidential campaigns for decades, but President Barack Obama tried to flip the picture Thursday night. ""I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers, goods that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America,"" Obama said as he accepted the Democratic nomination for a second term. ""After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years."" That may sound surprising in an era where unemployment remains stuck above 8% long after the official end of the 2007-2009 recession, so CNN took a closer look. The facts: . American manufacturing jobs peaked in the late 1970s, according to figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figures bounced up and down through the 1980s and 1990s before starting to drop steadily in 1998. The sector employed 15.6 million in January 2002, according to BLS statistics, down from about 19.5 million in 1979. They declined steadily through the next 10 years, falling to just under 11.5 million in January 2010. But then the numbers turned around, rising to 11.9 million at the beginning of 2012 and just under 12 million as of July. But while the turn has been positive, the numbers of workers being hired each month are well below the figures posted a decade ago. New hires averaged about 400,000 a month in 2001, compared with about 250,000 in 2011. And as with other statistics cited during the three-day Democratic convention, it's not quite the whole picture. Manufacturing sector employment is still down by about 500,000 since Obama took office and by more than 3.7 million since the start of the recession in December 2007. Conclusion: . Obama's statement is technically accurate, and he and other speakers took great pains to acknowledge the still-struggling recovery. But while the return to growth in manufacturing is indeed a promising turn of events, employment in the sector is still at a net loss during Obama's tenure. Fact Check: The $2,000 question .

"(CNN) -- A new poll shows that two-thirds of Americans surveyed think the U.S. should lift its travel ban on Cuba, and three-quarters think the U.S. should end its five-decade estrangement with the country. Fidel Castro led Cuba's communist revolution in 1959 and recently handed over power to his brother Raul. According to the CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted April 3 to 5, 64 percent of the 1,023 Americans surveyed by telephone thought the U.S. government should allow citizens to travel to Cuba. And 71 percent of those polled said that the U.S. should reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba, while 27 percent opposed such a move. Both questions had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The Obama administration has signaled that new rules on family travel and remittances to Cuba may be announced before President Obama goes to the Summit of the Americas on April 17. A group of senators and other supporters unveiled a bill March 31 to lift the 47-year-old travel ban to Cuba. ""I think that we finally reached a new watermark here on this issue,"" said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, one of the bill's sponsors. Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, another sponsor of the bill, issued a draft report in February that said it was time to reconsider the economic sanctions. Lugar is the ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Interactive: Learn more about Cuba » . ""Republicans as well as Democrats favor reestablishing diplomatic relations with Cuba,"" CNN polling director Keating Holland said. ""On the issue of lifting travel restrictions, Republicans are evenly divided, while independents and Democrats support the change."" A delegation from the Congressional Black Caucus traveled to Cuba earlier this week to find out if Cuba was interested in resuming relations with the U.S., said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, a member of the delegation. ""We have to remember that every country in Latin America, 15 countries, have normal relations with Cuba,"" Lee said. ""We're the country which is isolated.""  Watch Lee discuss her visit to Cuba » . Lee said that Cuba has no preconditions on resuming relations. The trip prompted a pair of Republican congressmen to rip the Black Caucus members for ignoring Cuba's ""myriad gross human rights abuses,"" saying the trip to the island nation ignored the plight of political prisoners under the Castro regime. Reps. Chris Smith of New Jersey and Frank Wolf of Virginia also urged the Obama administration to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all ""prisoners of conscience,"" shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech, and holds ""free and fair"" elections. Cuban-American members of Congress, regardless of party affiliation, have voiced outrage over the easing of relations. Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez, who was born in Cuba, doesn't want to see changes to the embargo. ""Having tourists on Cuban beaches is not going to achieve democratic change in Cuba,"" Martinez has said. New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat and Cuban-American, said in a recent speech that the Cuban government is ""pure and simple a brutal dictatorship. ... The average Cuban lives on an income of less than a dollar a day."" Obama has said he is in favor of changing the relationship with Cuba. The $410 billion budget Obama signed in March makes it easier for Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba and to send money to family members on the island. It could also allow the sale of agricultural and pharmaceutical products to Cuba. Three provisions attached to the omnibus spending bill loosened restrictions enacted by former President Bush after he came to office in 2001. U.S. citizens are allowed to visit Cuba, but must apply for special licenses to do so. Though it is illegal, some citizens travel to a third country like Mexico or Canada and then into Cuba. Fidel Castro led the 1959 revolution that overthrew Cuba's Batista dictatorship. The United States broke diplomatic ties with the nation in 1961. The next year, the U.S. government instituted a trade embargo. Both policies remain in effect.  Interactive: A look at the Fidel Castro's life » .

"(CNN) -- Even while imprisoned for a rape he didn't commit, Tim Cole never stopped acting like a big brother. ""He would send us letters, telling us what classes to take, telling us to look out for a subscription to Money magazine he was sending us,"" brother Cory Session remembers. Cole was a student at Texas Tech when he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for the 1985 rape of 20-year-old Michele Mallin. In 2009, DNA would exonerate Cole, but not until a decade after he died in prison, at age 39, from heart complications related to his asthma. To those who loved him, Texas can never right the false conviction, but the Lubbock City Council wants to make sure Cole and his case are not forgotten. The city unveiled a statue of the Fort Worth native across the street from the Texas Tech campus on Wednesday afternoon and dedicated the area where the bronze likeness will stand as the Tim Cole Memorial Park. Behind bars, Cole refused to lose faith, telling his sister Karen Kennard -- the only African-American enrolled at Texas Tech's law school at the time -- not to give up pursuing her law degree. ""I still believe in the justice system, even if the justice system doesn't believe in me,"" he once wrote in a letter. Kennard finished her degree and went on to become the city attorney for Austin, Texas. His brotherly attitude extended beyond his kin as well. His family wouldn't learn about it until later, but Cole used the money he earned from his GI Bill to make thousands of dollars in charitable donations from behind bars. ""He knew he couldn't help himself, but he could help other people,"" Session said. Cole always maintained his innocence, even after he was offered parole in exchange for admitting to the rape. He never confessed, and in 2007, Texas inmate Jerry Johnson -- who didn't realize Cole had died eight years before -- wrote to Cole, confessing the rape and offering to submit to DNA testing to clear Cole's name. ""Tim had the integrity to say, 'I won't confess to something I didn't do,'"" former Lubbock City Councilman Todd Klein said. ""He refused to take his freedom on the cheap."" That legacy is just one of the reasons Cole will be memorialized at one of Lubbock's busiest intersections. Klein was instrumental in seeing that the sculpture was erected. He felt it was important, he said, to ""remind us of this teachable moment"" in the city's history. ""The government has enormous power to take one's life or liberty,"" Klein said. ""When we make a mistake we should admit to it. We should make amends where we can."" The bronze statue, standing at least 13 feet tall, depicts Cole's torso facing the area where the crime occurred. Cole's gaze will be fixed on the vicinity of Texas Tech's law school, where future prosecutors, defense attorneys and judges will be reminded that humans are fallible and that fact must remain at the top of their minds as they pursue their law careers, Klein said. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, state Attorney General Greg Abbott and state Sen. Wendy Davis, as well as friends and family of Cole, were among the attendees at Wednesday's dedication. Perry pardoned Cole in 2010. Two years later, on the anniversary of Cole's exoneration, the state constructed a historical marker that was placed at his gravesite. Perry spoke at Wednesday's dedication, saying, ""The story of Tim Cole is a story of inspiration and grace."" Mallin, the rape victim who picked Cole out of a lineup that led his wrongful conviction, was also expected to be in attendance. After realizing her mistake, she helped to get Cole's name cleared and has since developed a relationship with Cole's family. Session recalled how when his mother was still alive, she told Mallin, ""You're a victim, just like my son was."" Davis told the story of her first meeting with Ruby Cole Session. It was during her first week in the Texas Legislature in 2009. ""She was a person of diminutive stature but a giant in every other way,"" Davis remembered, ""She pressed into my chest a photograph of her son, Tim Cole. She put a face on this issue . . . urging me in making sure that his life and his death meant something for others."" Ruby Session died last year, making Wednesday's statue dedication bittersweet. Though she had the opportunity to sue the state in the wake of her son's exoneration, Session said his mother only wanted people to remember her son. ""He left here with his head bowed and his arms and legs in shackles,"" Session said, ""Today he returns standing tall, uncompromised. But not unsung."" CNN's Ed Lavandera and Devon M.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of veterans in South Florida may have been exposed to hepatitis and HIV because of contaminated equipment after getting colonoscopies at the Miami Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, officials announced Monday. In a news release, Rep. Kendrick B. Meek, D-Florida, says such mistakes undermine the VA's effectiveness. Two Florida lawmakers are asking for an inspector general's inquiry. ""The VA is a model of the type of health care we provide our veterans, and when mistakes like this occur, it undermines the efficacy of the entire system,"" said Rep. Kendrick B. Meek, D-Florida, in a news release. Meek, along with Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, is requesting an official inquiry by the inspector general of the VA. In a letter to retired Gen. Eric Shinseki, the secretary of Veterans Affairs, Nelson said he is also concerned about possible contaminated equipment at facilities in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, and Augusta, Georgia. ""I am requesting that the VA Office of Inspector General begin an investigation into the potential problems of contamination; whether any patient has contracted an infection from unsterilized equipment; and, most importantly, how we can prevent such problems from happening again,"" Nelson wrote. ""Finally, I urge the VA to commit to providing ongoing medical care in cases where it is responsible for exposing someone to a disease."" On Monday, the VA sent letters to 3,260 people who may have had colonoscopies between May 2004 and March 12, 2009. Hospital officials said a review of safety procedures found that tubing used in endoscope procedures was rinsed but not disinfected. In the first 24 hours after the letters were released, the Miami VA got more than 2,600 calls and checked out more than 350 patients. Nearly 600 more are scheduled for examinations over the next two weeks, officials at the facility said.  Learn more about what happened » . Officials say the risk of infection is minimal.

In December 2008, an investigation found that clinic workers were not following manufacturer's directions and switched out parts they weren't supposed to switch out, according to investigators. About 6,000 people who underwent colonoscopies at the clinic were notified and offered free testing for infections.

"(CNN) -- From a country which brought the world brands like Sony and Toyota, there's another name that's crept quietly to global prominence. Hello Kitty, the moon-faced cat with a bow in her hair and no mouth. Shintaro Tsuji, CEO of Sanrio, famous for its Hello Kitty brand, speaks in The Boardroom. She's one of 450 characters developed by Japan's Sanrio Group, but she's by far most popular -- the embodiment of what's known in Japan as Kawaii, or the culture of cute. Her image adorns some 50,000 objects, from cute, of course, to downright crazy. But there's nothing cute about the numbers. Hello Kitty is responsible for more than half of Sanrio's billion dollar annual turnover. Her creator and founder of Sanrio is the effervescent 79-year-old Shintaro Tsuji. He told The Boardroom's Andrew Stevens what he thinks is the marketing secret behind a cultural icon. Tsuji: Selling something which people want to buy is one of the ways of doing business. But I thought, goods that I want are also something other people want. So we wanted to make goods which people want to send to somebody else as a gift. The idea is that goods are for social communication purposes and that has been accepted worldwide. In addition, to give Hello Kitty goods as a present is very thoughtful. Our three concepts of friendship, cuteness and thoughtfulness have been reaching out to people. It conveys the importance of being friendly. Such gestures are necessary for the Japanese nation. You care about other people by sending some gifts. Those concepts have been accepted worldwide. Stevens: My first question to you is Sanrio has developed something like 450 characters. Why it is Hello Kitty has stood out so much more than the others? What is the secret of its success? Tsuji: At first we were using characters which were created by outsiders, such as cartoonists or artists, but in this case we had to pay the royalty. So we decided to create our own characters. We hired many artists and asked them to create various characters. According to our own research, the most popular animal character was a dog then a white cat and the third one was a bear. Snoopy already existed as a dog character -- that's why we went for the second most popular character. We asked the artists to design a character based on a white cat. Stevens: Let me just ask you a question about your life, growing up. Reading your autobiography, you lost your mother when you were 13 years old. You went to live with your auntie. And you describe your life; your childhood, has been a quite lonely. How do you think that has shaped you in your business life? Tsuji: I felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything; to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life. Then I asked myself how can you make friends -- in what way people can make a friend with those people. That is not just to avoid behaving, which makes people uncomfortable. But do something, which makes people happy. In this way people can make friends. For example, when people are ill, you can say something to them, or when people did something for you, you say thank you to them. For those kinds of occasions, you send a small present rather than an expensive gift. It is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way. This idea has formed as a business. As a result, Hello Kitty was created. Hello Kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends. I am pleased with this phenomenon. Stevens: What, in your business career, is the most important lesson you think you've learnt? Tsuji: A good company means that, first of all, its sale increases each year and secondly it makes profits each year. This is what people call a quality company. But this is not my main concern. Obviously, a company shouldn't lose money. A company cannot contribute to a society easily. But for me, it is important to establish a company, which has a good reputation. Stevens: Much easier said than done, how do you remain true to your original ideas, though, because there are so many pressures from shareholders among other people to make those profits? Tsuji: The company shareholders actually say ""Make more profits or dividends."" But what I always say to them at the general assembly is that the shareholder should be someone who truly values my company and is proud of having my company's share. According to newspapers, there are companies which make a profit by polluting the environment or breaking laws. But this is not acceptable by our standard. I bet the company staffs want to have an increase in the wages. But I want my staffs to be proud of themselves, in particular, when their children ask them where they are working. In my view, that is very important. Stevens: What advice would you give to someone starting out their own company in 21st century? Tsuji: It is not only about making profits or establishing a huge corporation. A bigger country doesn't mean a better country. Having a larger military capacity doesn't mean a better thing. It will be ideal to establish a company which is a value to the world. It's not just about the money. So I would say ""How about creating companies which people appreciate?""

"(CNN) -- Chester Nez, the former Marine and last of the original 29 Navajo code talkers, passed away June 4 at age 93. When an elder dies in Indian country -- especially someone as revered and decorated as Nez, the World War II veteran -- we, Native Americans, feel it, all of us, regardless of tribe or nation. We are also reminded that, not long ago, in the 19th and 20th centuries, Native American culture, including our languages, was considered a threat to U.S. national security. Then, the government worked in collusion with Christian institutions to stamp out Native American languages, including Navajo. ""A great general has said that the only good Indian is a dead one,"" Capt. Richard Pratt famously read from a paper at an 1892 convention. ""In a sense, I agree with the sentiment, but only in this: that all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him, and save the man."" Pratt was the founder of the Indian boarding schools, institutions charged with turning the ""red Indian"" into the ""noble savage."" Native Americans: We're not your mascots . Chester Nez attended one of these schools as a child, and was punished when he spoke Navajo. One can't help but think that, had it not been for the resilience of the Navajo people and their resistance to these early oppressive American policies, it's quite possible that World War II could have ended differently. Without the use of the Navajo language that was once discouraged by American policy, the U.S. military could have lost a distinct advantage over its enemy. Nez's death is a reminder that America's strength lies in its diversity. Native Americans, who have not always been included in the American story, should be remembered and honored for their contributions. Before the arrival of the Europeans, there were between 300 and 500 unique languages spoken throughout what is now the United States and Canada. Today, there are fewer than 200, and that number will continue to decrease if North American indigenous language revitalization efforts aren't considered paramount to the continuity of Native American communities by the United States. Opinion: NFL may throw flag on N-word, but what about the 'R-word'? Recently, a neighbor and I were discussing Native American languages. He was curious why more Native American elders ""don't just pass on the language to the next generation."" I told him that many of said elders still suffer from the trauma they experienced in the Christian boarding school system, and remembered what Ruby Left Hand Bull told me recently. ""They'd pierce your tongue if you spoke your language!"" my elder recalled. ""Or they'd make you stand in front of the classroom and they'd tell you to stick your tongue out and then they'd whip it with a wooden ruler, just for speaking our language."" Ruby knew our Lakota language growing up, she said, and very well. But she has lost it, she said. She understands it, but it's all but left her, courtesy of the boarding schools. I told my neighbor, who said he was a third-generation Italian-American, that his people's language could die in New York, but there is no threat that it will become an extinct language any time soon. ""There are more Italians speaking Italian every day right across the Atlantic,"" I said. ""You could board a plane or hop a ship today and travel to your home country and hear your people's language reverberating off Italian walls. We, Native Americans, don't share in that luxury. This is it. This is our home country. Our languages are invariably on the brink of extinction, especially since we are 1% of the population. So when a Native American language dies, it's forever gone."" Our elders tell us that when a language dies, so, too, does the culture. But all is not lost. There are various campaigns to revitalize Native American languages. The state of Colorado, for example, passed a law stating that Native Americans who speak their language can teach it to students for credit at secondary schools under the category ""World Languages."" Maybe one day all Native Americans will, again, be fluent speakers of their language -- just like Chester Nez, the warrior. Indeed, the world would be a richer place for it. My hope is that when President Barack Obama visits with our Native American leaders this month at Standing Rock, North Dakota, he will be reminded of the significant contributions of Native American peoples like Chester Nez.

"(CNN) -- This is not the first oil boom to deliver windfall revenue to the world's leading oil exporter, Saudi Arabia. Saudi Prince Turki Al-Faisal tells MME about the Kingdom's plans to prioritize education and health. It's seen boom time before -- in the 1970s -- but this time it's determined to do things right. This week, MME spoke with Prince Turki bin Faisal al Saud, son of late King Faisal and a nephew of Saudi Arabia's current ruler, King Abdullah. Back in the 1970s, Prince Turki became Director-General of Saudi Arabia's foreign intelligence service, the General Intelligence Directorat, a post he held for nearly 25 years. More recently he's served as Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, and, until last February, as Saudi Ambassador to the U.S. Prince Turki is one of the founders of the King Faisal Foundation -- one of the world's largest philanthropic foundations -- and is the chairman of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh. John Defterios spoke with Prince Turki and asked him about the Kingdom's latest economic boom. (JD): I think you almost have to go back to post World War Two, the rebuilding of Germany and Japan in a per capita sense to match the scale of what's going on in Saudi Arabia. Would you put it in that context? (PT): Absolutely. The Kingdom went through many phases of development since its inception -- from 1932 to our present times -- but this is the most extensive expansion of development projects that we've had, ever. People remember the days of the 1970s and 80s when price of oil went up and the Kingdom went through a development phase at that time that was very extensive, very much throughout the Kingdom. But from 2000 until now it's more than several times that expansion. And it's in every phase -- education, health, roads, housing -- everything is simply booming in this country. (JD): How do you avoid the mistakes of the 1970s when there was a lot of capital going out but not a grand vision of what Saudi Arabia should look like? (PT): I beg to differ: there was a grand vision. We had five-year development plans since 1970, but people learn from their experience and, of course, whatever mistakes were done in the 70s and 80s we are overcoming them. We also have a much better educated population now then we did then. We are less dependent, if you like, on inexperience then we were in those times. There are people now in charge of doing things, whether in the private sector or in government, that not only have better education, but they've also had 30 years experience in development projects. (JD): There's quite a monumental task here because you have 50 percent of the population below 20 and the 2008 budget has 28 billion dollars set aside for primary and secondary schools. Can the next generation participate in this evolution of the economy? (PT): Well, as the custodian of the two holy mosques has said many times, our future is in the hands of our young people. So we have to provide them with the skills and know-how that will make this country go forward in the future, hence the emphasis on education and healthcare -- education, education, education. It is not just a matter of hardware that we are providing in education but the software as well. For example, the Ministry of Education in this country has undertaken a very unprecedented and first time effort to evaluate its teaching staff by hiring experts who can advise them on the quality of teachers. And they bought teams from Europe and from America and I think even from Japan and other Asian countries that have surpassed us in education to come and evaluate our software. (JD): If you put it into context, King Abdullah is a man in a hurry in a sense. He has only been in office now for just over three years and he has the accelerator down pushing very aggressively. What happens after him? Is there the same spirit to follow this through? (PT): Well, just look at who's going to follow him. He himself has been in the government from early on and participated in all of the development phases of the kingdom since the 60s so he has forty years of experience in development. The Crown Prince Sultan, for example, was in that same development phase as King Abdullah and all of the senior Princes in the Royal Family were part and parcel of this development phase since the 1960s, so it is going to continue. And the ambitions that King Abdullah, through his efforts and his words, has instilled in the people of Saudi Arabia is driving the people towards looking forward, to more development and more accomplishment and more achievement. (JD): If you look at the bigger puzzle that he's putting together here the new cities are emerging in areas that do not have major cities around them. Is this to avoid the resistance from conservative sectors of society that may resist the moves by this King? (PT): You know I hear that question many times, as if there is a box where conservatives live and create problems for reformers who live in another box and perhaps people in between live in a third box. The Kingdom is like any other society. Within one family you will have somebody who has a more traditional point of view, and another one with a more modern point of view. It is part and parcel of the growing up process of any society. So building these cities in the areas where they have been chosen to be built is to bring development to these areas, not to avoid any specific objection from any society. And who is going to come to these cities once they are built? It is the whole fabric of the Kingdom; the conservatives and the modernizers and the liberals and other groups of people that are part and parcel of the Kingdom. And more importantly I think, from somebody who is outside government now looking on these developments, is the fact that all of these developments are concentrated on job opportunities for the young. We have a very young population. In five years time, in ten years time, all of these people are going to come on stream looking for jobs, looking for opportunities and wanting to have a family and children and so on. So you have to provide for that now, you cannot wait five or ten years, hence the King's hurried pace in putting these things on the ground. (JD): Is part of the strategy to import some of this change as you develop such large centers for commerce and education? Naturally, you import change at the same time, and that's healthy for this society? (PT): Well, I think if you heard my speech today that I gave at the [Jeddah Economic] Forum. I described Saudi Arabia as a crossroads for trade and commerce, historically. Going back to pre-Islamic days the Kingdom was always a passage point for goods and people coming from Asia to Europe to Africa and vice versa. With that situation being as it is, naturally change comes from outside, but also the Kingdom is very careful that its basic traditions and beliefs and values are improved rather than discarded by this change. If we have habits or practices that are not helpful we look forward to giving those up. If there are habits and practices that we can learn from others, then we will gladly espouse them. But our basic tenets and beliefs hopefully we will safeguard because they are the things that identify us as human beings. (JD): Do you feel comfortable sitting here today that the wealth from the petroleum resources that are blessed here in this country are being spent in the best fashion possible. If you look back 10, 15 years and say that was the right strategy? (PT): Look at what's happening here in the Kingdom: Universities, schools, hospitals, roads, construction boom, social development, political development, everything. It's like a beehive of activity. Hopefully in the final analysis, all these bees that are coming together will make us a lot of honey. It's very easy to sit back and be critical when so much is going on in the development factor. But it is more difficult for that critical outlook to be positively critical. Distinguish between what is negative and what is positive. All countries commit mistakes; all peoples have different views from each other. I think what has been important about the Kingdom is that the people have come around to embrace change in the Kingdom. And it is a change that is driven vertically by the leadership, but also horizontally by the vast population of the Kingdom. (JD): In fifteen years time do you think we are going to look back with the oil resources that this country has been blessed with and say ""we spent it wisely, it was the best road map we could have followed''? (PT): I believe so. I believe so because of the effort that the King has put in providing the skills and know-how to the young people. I don't think I will be around fifteen years from now, but if I am, I am looking forward, as I said earlier, that my children and my grandchildren will make of their world a much better world that I am leaving to them. This is the hope and aspiration that all of us have. E-mail to a friend .","MME speaks with Saudi Prince Turki al-Faisal at the Jeddah Economic Forum .

"(CNN) -- The recent controversy over arms sales to Russia reminds me of an interesting exchange during a hustings I took part in during the 2009 European Election campaign. We were in the Friends Meeting House in Gloucester and, being a Quaker, I felt very at home. A question came up about the arms trade and I fully expected to be ridiculed for being an absurd idealist. I said that some products should not be part of a market system and that arms were one of those. To my astonishment, all but one of the candidates agreed. The candidate who disagreed, a Tory, at least had the decency to look sheepish about defending this trade in the weapons of death. The prime ministers of the UK and France have not demonstrated even this level of decency in recent days as they have sought to defend the sale of military equipment to Russia. This first came to my attention in the European Parliament debate on Ukraine when a French member of our group challenged his compatriot for removing from our motion a call on the French government to ban the export of Mistral helicopter carriers and end the training of 400 Russian sailors at St. Nazaire. This questionable deal has become considerably more embarrassing since the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Yet despite French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius' earlier comments that if relations deteriorated he would ban the deal, the culture of shamelessness amongst arms traders and their political friends remains unchallenged and it is expected to proceed. The unseemly trading of accusations of hypocrisy across the English Channel does nothing to build the confidence of the victims of the world's conflicts that our countries are concerned for their plight. Export licenses for UK arms exports to Russia increased in the last 12 months at the very time that our prime minister and Foreign Secretary were mouthing meaningless platitudes about getting tough on Russian President Vladimir Putin. So, while money talks, the children suffering in the world's conflicts zones are condemned to silence. Which brings me to Gaza. By international consensus Israel is not a regime that is guilty of abusing human rights and so is an excellent market for arms exports: the UK agreed licenses worth over Â£10 million just last year, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade. In 2009 Foreign Secretary David Miliband admitted that Israeli equipment being used in Gaza probably contained UK-supplied components and the same is almost certainly true of the current atrocities. During another debate in Strasbourg last week, where our agenda was dominated by foreign policy I had to watch while the Green motions calling for ""a comprehensive UN arms embargo to all parties in the region in order to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and human rights"" was expunged by the Grand Coalition demonstrating its commitment to business before morality. The Campaign Against Arms Trade recently called for an end to what it labeled ""arms control by embarrassment,"" with governments waiting for catastrophes to occur rather than issuing ethically motivated bans on regimes with a history of abusing human rights. Although it is Ukraine and Gaza that are the current flash-points the main export markets for British arms are the wealthy oil states of the Middle East including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and UAE where citizens put their lives at risk for merely asserting their basic human rights, and their safety is threatened with arms made in the civilized countries of Western Europe. Since becoming an MEP I have received many letters from lobbyists for different industries. The most disturbing by far was from a French arms company inviting me to the Farnborough Air Show, recently opened by David Cameron. As well as their enthusiasm to demonstrate the effectiveness of their weaponry they also supplied me with statistics about their ""economic contribution"" in terms of annual turnover and healthy profits. I found this sickening because for every child that has died in Gaza and each of the 80 children on flight MH17 there was a weapon with a maker's serial mark and a country of origin. Even for those who would not join me in calling for an international ban on the sale of arms surely there is a need not to treat this as an industry like any other.

"(CNN) -- Marcel Hirscher may have come away from Sochi without a Winter Olympics gold medal, but the Austrian has confirmed his reputation as the most consistent men's skier on the World Cup circuit. The 25-year-old clinched his third successive overall title on Saturday at the season-ending meeting in Switzerland, finishing fourth in the giant slalom. It was enough to put him 131 points clear of closest rival Aksel Svindal Lund, who did not complete his first run. However, Hirscher was overhauled in the giant slalom standings by Olympic champion Ted Ligety, who came from 50 points back to win the discipline for the fifth season, this time on a countback of most wins after they finished level. ""I need some time to process everything that happened today, it was a crazy race,"" said Hirscher, who was denied a double success when Germany's Felix Neureuther clinched third place on the final run by just 0.01 seconds. ""I'm really happy about the overall and am not really thinking about the GS cup at this point. The overall was my big goal this season and I couldn't be happier that I was able to defend it. ""I have to thank my team, I might have not been the easiest to deal with sometimes during the season but they have supported me all along."" Hirscher, whose only medal at Sochi was silver in the slalom, has the chance to win the World Cup title in that event on Sunday -- he trails Neureuther by five points. Lund, who won the super-G and downhill titles, will not compete on Sunday in Lenzerheide. ""I am not as good now as I was earlier this winter and it's something to look at and make sure it doesn't happen next year. With the two speed titles I had a good season that could have been a great season,"" said the Norwegian, who left Sochi early after failing to win a medal, citing allergy problems. Meanwhile, Olympic women's slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin capped her fine season by winning the World Cup globe as well on Saturday, retaining her title in the discipline. The American, who turned 19 on Thursday, claimed her fifth victory this season by a stunning 1.44 seconds to become the youngest woman to win it twice and the first from outside Europe. It put her sixth in the overall standings, where the title was sewn up by Anna Fenninger on Thursday when the Austrian finished second in the super-G. ""I guess my secret is not letting people tell me I can't do it,"" Shiffrin said. ""Everybody thinks that this is impossible; you can't win a race by 1.4 anymore. You can't win the Olympics at 18. People say you can't a lot and I never listen to them."" Fenninger, who won gold in super-G at Sochi and silver in giant slalom, will seek to add another World Cup globe in the latter on Sunday. The 24-year-old is 14 points behind GS leader Jessica Lindell-Vikarby of Sweden.","Austrian skier Marcel Hirscher wins men's overall World Cup title for third year in a row .

"(CNN) -- Growing up in rural North Dakota, about 13 miles from the Canadian border and a 90-minute drive from the nearest McDonald's, Jessica Metcalfe relied on magazines for her pop culture fix. The young Turtle Mountain Chippewa never saw anyone in the pages of Seventeen who looked like her. But as an adult, she's working to change that, promoting the work of Native American fashion designers and artists. She began with the 2009 launch of Beyond Buckskin, a blog that highlights Native designers and discusses their place in media and pop culture. Even Metcalfe was surprised by its initial success -- by the size of its audience, the positive feedback, the readers asking, ""Where can I buy that?"" The blog expanded to include an online boutique last year, placing Metcalfe at the center of a growing movement to reclaim what fashion labels ""Native American."" She's surrounded by a group of passionate Native designers, artists, stylists, photographers and bloggers who have already proven that by raising their voices they can hold companies accountable. Instead of just reacting to controversies, Metcalfe and her cohorts want to promote authentic examples of modern Native fashion. Their work reflects the diversity of North America's indigenous communities, from the southeastern United States to Canada's Pacific Northwest, but their message is clear: True Native fashion is more than what's for sale at Urban Outfitters or Forever 21. Related: Native Americans fight cultural caricatures . When blogger Adrienne Keene of Native Appropriations outed Paul Frank last year for holding a powwow-themed party, the company not only apologized but invited Keene and Metcalfe to speak at an upcoming industry panel on cultural appropriation. The company is also working with Metcalfe to develop collections featuring four Native designers. Whenever a celebrity dons a feather and long braids for a photo shoot, or a fashion brand releases a gaudy collection of ""totem pole print"" tracksuits, bloggers like Metcalfe and Keene are slammed with questions about why they're offensive. Metcalfe says they should be showing better examples -- tasteful, appropriate use of Native iconography, and talented Native designers. It's the work of Taos designer Patricia Michaels, the first Native American to appear on ""Project Runway;"" the art of Virgil Ortiz, a Cochiti Pueblo artist and designer who collaborated with Donna Karan; the sexy couture gowns of Bethany Yellowtail and other designers who appeared in the first Beyond Buckskin Lookbook launched earlier this month to spotlight Native-made fashion from couture to street wear. ""Creativity is our tradition and there's a lot of talent in Indian Country waiting to be exposed,"" Metcalfe said. Part of the work is advancing mainstream America's perception of Native fashion, going beyond headdresses, fringed jackets and, yes, buckskin. On a practical level, it's about finding places to market and sell Native-made goods, Metcalfe said. The clothing and jewelry isn't only intended for Natives. It's meant to appeal to wide audiences, even if people don't know the significance of a pattern or design. ""These are not your stereotypical Native American designs. They're very contemporary, which is the point: to present new visions of what Native American fashion means,"" said Shelby Tisdale, the vice president of curatorial and exhibitions at Los Angeles' Autry National Center, a Native American history museum. ""They incorporate designs that have a lot of meaning to them, but to the average viewer they might just look like a dragonfly or zigzag lines, and that's OK."" Metcalfe was a guest curator for a show about Native couture at the Museum of Indian Arts & Culture in Santa Fe, New Mexico, while Tisdale was the museum's director. Metcalfe was completing her dissertation about modern Native American fashion. ""She's done a fabulous job of researching Native fashion's roots, but now she's taking it into the 21st century,"" Tisdale said. ""She's moved it into the digital age, which not might seem like a big deal, but it's new and forward thinking for Indian Country."" The work occurs beyond Metcalfe's website. They're using fashion shows, pop-up boutiques and speaking engagements to spread their message. In March, Metcalfe was in Las Vegas, Santa Fe and Portland for events promoting Native fashion. Keene joined her for a talk this week, aptly named ""More Than Just Trend,"" at Reed College -- one of many stops they make on college campuses. Related: Atlanta Braves reject ""screaming Indian"" logo . Earlier this year, Metcalfe staged a three-day photo shoot of the latest looks in Native fashion, from couture to street wear, with fashion photographer Anthony Thosh Collins and L.A.-based designer Bethany Yellowtail. The result was the Beyond Buckskin Lookbook, which Metcalfe says is the first compilation of modern Native fashion produced exclusively by Natives. They launched the book in March at the Reservation Economic Summit in Las Vegas, an annual gathering of tribal leaders, state and local elected officials and top CEOs from Indian Country. ""The lookbook is a brilliant indigenous response to the rip-offs being marketed in mainstream media,"" said Valerie Taliman, a citizen of the Navajo Nation and West Coast editor of Indian Country Today Media Network, the largest Native-operated media organization in the country. ""Here, you have a collection of 17 Native artists with all Native models, photographers, graphics artists and business management -- the whole package on their intellectual and cultural terms."" So, instead of jewelry that's all turquoise and silver, metalsmith Kristen Dorsey creates pieces she says honors the aesthetic traditions of the Chickasaw people. She works with copper, using the same relief sculpture techniques as her ancestors. Her signature ""serpent cuffs"" resemble reptile scales, referring to a deity from southeastern Native American spirituality. The cuffs are adorned with black freshwater pearls harvested from the Mississippi River watershed, a nod to where her tribe lived before the Trail of Tears. Each cuff starts at $700. ""If you have a family or tribal connection it becomes very personal,"" Dorsey said. ""It's more than making jewelry; it becomes working for a culture that you want to pass on to future generations."" Then there's Jamie Okuma, who contributed two skirts and a jacket to the lookbook. She began working with beads and sewing as a child on the La Jolla Luiseno Reservation in California, and at 22, became the youngest artist to earn best in show at New Mexico's Santa Fe Market, the largest crafts fair in Indian Country. She makes elaborately beaded high heels, colorful jackets and dresses that evoke the patterns of the LuiseÃ±o and Shoshone-Bannock. ""Clothing is wearable art and I want to use my skills to create something beautiful that reflects the cultural heritage of my tribe,"" Okuma said. Okuma said anyone who wants to interpret Native patterns and motifs should be allowed to do so, but they should do it in a respectful way. ""As long as they understand the importance of the symbols or patterns being utilized and they do so in a tasteful way, why not?"" Okuma said. Still, on major store shelves, Native fashion is still most likely to be ""Navajo-inspired"" prints, feathered headdresses or fake turquoise jewelry. The lookbook represents authentic, modern Native imagery, designer and co-creator Bethany Yellowtail said. ""It's disheartening to see Native American fashion as cheap knockoffs,"" Yellowtail said. ""To change that, we have to be the voice for what Native American fashion is, instead of just complaining about it."" Growing up on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, Yellowtail's aunties taught her how to bead and make shawls in the tradition of her people, the Crow and Cheyenne who share the vast tribal territory. Thanks to a high school teacher who encouraged Yellowtail and helped her find a design school, she moved to California, where she broke into a career as a pattern maker. Five years after arriving in Los Angeles, she now divides her creative efforts between a full-time job designing for mass market retail brands and her own line, which is inspired by her love for Native culture and high-end couture, she said. Yellowtail wants to inspire other Natives to follow their passion and show the rest of the world that Native Americans are a thriving, modern people that have plenty to contribute, especially in the fashion world. ""When I was in high school I never imagined that I could be a mover and shaker in the fashion industry as a Native woman,"" she said. ""But now that I'm a part of the industry, there's this window of opportunity for me to be a voice for our communities.""

"(CNN) -- Brazilian legend Pele believes his country will rise above the problems which are blighting its preparations for football's global showpiece and put on a ""fantastic"" World Cup. Demonstrations -- some violent -- have been taking place all over Brazil since last summer's Confederations Cup, raising concerns about security at the upcoming tournament. They were originally organized to protest against increases in travel fares, but have since gone on to include demonstrations against staging the World Cup, corruption in government and a lack of social spending. But Pele, who played in three winning Brazilian World Cup sides, is confident that once the competition -- which starts on June 12 -- begins these issues will become of secondary importance. ""We have had political problems,"" he told CNN. ""But the World Cup is a big party and it will be fantastic."" Despite his status as a national hero, the 73-year-old Pele came under fire for his reported criticism of protests which flared up at last year's Confederations Cup and have continued on a sporadic basis ever since. It also apparently put him at odds with the current idol of the Brazilian fans, Barcelona's Neymar, who said he was ""inspired"" by the mass mobilization, which has focused on poor quality public services while billions of dollars are being spent on the World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio. Pele was at pains to clarify his position. ""I agree with him (Neymar) -- we accept of course we want the best for our country in terms of schools and hospitals -- but the players have nothing to do with this or political corruption,"" he said. ""So it's wrong to boo the players like happened in the Confederations Cup, I repeat again they have nothing to do with corruption and the other problems. ""We need to separate these things because the players always show off the best side of Brazil, let's support them -- because this is a good moment for us."" Politics aside, Pele is hoping Neymar, who starred for his old club Santos before his big money move to Barcelona last summer, will benefit from playing in European club football to help Brazil a record sixth World Cup triumph. "" A lot of Brazilians were annoyed when Santos sold him to Barcelona,"" he said. ""But for Neymar it was fantastic as he gets more experience at the highest level and this will help the national team."" Pele played a starring role in Brazil's triumphs in the finals of the 1958 and 1970 World Cups and is hoping the current team can take their own place in footballing history. But he is wary about tipping them as winners - ""football is a box of surprises,"" he said-- pointing to Argentina, Italy, Spain and Germany as their most dangerous challengers. ""But Brazilian football is still the best and most beautiful in the world,"" he added.","Pele confident Brazil will host a successful World Cup later this year .

"(CNN) -- A North Carolina woman who stirred national headlines when she accused three Duke University student-athletes of rape is now herself accused of murder, a county law enforcement official said Monday. Crystal Mangum, 32, was charged Monday with murder, five days after her boyfriend succumbed to stabbing-related injuries at a Durham, North Carolina, hospital, according to Candy Clark, a spokeswoman for the Durham County District Attorney's Office. She also is now facing two felony charges of larceny. Prosecutors reassessed the charges against Mangum after the death of Reginald Daye at Duke University Hospital on Wednesday. Police say she stabbed the 46-year-old man in the torso during an argument early on April 3 at the apartment the couple shared in Durham. Later that day, Mangum was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, police said. She was placed in the Durham County Jail without bond, where she remained Monday. Mangum's next court appearance on the murder charge has not been scheduled, but the district attorney's office said it will occur no earlier than May 2. In March 2006, Mangum claimed she was sexually assaulted by three players on the Duke lacrosse team -- annually one of the best collegiate squads in the nation -- while performing as a stripper at a team party. North Carolina's attorney general later found no credible evidence that the attacks occurred and the charges were dropped. The scandal, however, forced the cancellation of the men's lacrosse season that year and the resignation of team coach Mike Pressler. It also led to widespread criticism of then-Durham County District Attorney Mike Nifong, who was eventually disbarred for his handling of the case. In February 2010, Mangum found herself on the other side of the law when she was charged with attempted murder after a fight with her then-boyfriend. She also was accused of arson, identity theft and resisting arrest, among other charges. CNN affiliate WTVD-TV reported that this arrest happened after she had set fire to a pile of the boyfriend's clothes while her children were at home. In a June 2010 interview with the station, Mangum said her boyfriend had attacked her, and she said that her involvement in the Duke lacrosse case had influenced police handling of the case. ""I do feel that I am being unjustly treated because of preconceived notions about my character in the media,"" Mangum said then. In December, a jury found Mangum guilty of child abuse in the case but could not agree on a first-degree felony arson charge, which could have resulted in a seven-year sentence, WTVD reported. InSession's Jessica Thill contributed to this report.","Crystal Mangum faces a murder and two larceny charges, the district attorney's office says .

"(CNN) -- Two bananas thrown on a football pitch, separated by 26 years. One thrown at John Barnes in 1988 in an English soccer match and another at Dani Alves in 2014 during a Spanish league game. Throwing fruit to racially taunt players in their place of work. Barnes kicked it away during the Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton, Barcelona star Alves picked it up and ate it in Sunday's match against Villarreal. Does it show how ineffective sport's ongoing fight against racism has been, or as one leading ex-player argues, does the Brazilian's quick thinking demonstrates just how far football has come in 26 years. ""In the 1980s, players weren't taking a stance,"" former Tottenham Hotspur player and current trustee of anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out, Garth Crooks, told CNN. ""They're doing it now. ""Barnes kicks it out of the way, Alves picks it up and eats it. In a show of defiance, it's his way of saying how stupid this is. This is a banana. That is all it signifies. You eat these things. ""There's a real message in there to the idiots, if they can see it. To the intelligent and educated, they will think we shouldn't have to endure that type of behavior in our football club. There's no place for it here."" Barcelona full-back Alves, who posted a clip of the incident on Instagram, is not the first player to ignore the taunts . Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch in 2013 after being abused by opposition fans during an AC Milan game in Italy, while other leading players like Manchester City's Yaya Toure, Samuel Eto'o of Chelsea and AC Milan's Mario Balotelli have all taken their own stances against racist abuse. Social media reaction . But it was Alves' response that struck a chord on social media, with the Brazilian's Barca teammate Neymar's vociferous in support of his club and international colleague. ""They're all prepared to say, stop you better do something about this or I walk,"" added Crooks. ""It's challenging football to do something about a problem that it has found difficult to do something about in the past. ""It will focus the supporters' minds [by players making a stance] and make them ask questions of themselves."" These days anti-racism campaign groups -- such as Kick It Out and Show Racism the Red Card -- are around to pressurize the football authorities when players like Alves are abused. And such has been the progress in the fight against racist abuse that, according to one of the legends of the game, what happened to Alves at the El Madrigal Stadium remains an isolated incident. ""I think if you mention that, it is ridiculous, as you have one case, and all over the world they play soccer, and you have one case,"" Brazil legend Pele told CNN. ""This is nothing. You have a lot of other problems, a lot of criminals. But in football, you have one crazy guy who says bad things."" Some might express surprise at Pele's comments -- given that both Liverpool's Suarez and Chelsea's John Terry have been found guilty by England's Football Association of racially abusing an opponent in recent high profile cases in England. ""I think Pele is right to say it is an isolated incident, but I think he is wrong to make that isolated incident any less important than it is,"" countered Crooks. ""It's embarrassed not just an international player, but a top Spanish club [Villarreal] and the entire Spanish Football Federation. ""It's all around the world, we're all taking about it. Top players are eating bananas and taking the mickey out of, not just the incident, but of Villarreal and the Spanish federation [Neymar's campaign]. They're mocking them, it's embarrassing."" Although Villarreal moved swiftly to hand a life ban to the fan responsible for throwing the banana at Alves, the Royal Spanish Football Federation has yet to make a decision on the case. The NBA this week, in contrast, gave Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling a life ban over racist remarks he made just days earlier. In the past neither world governing body FIFA or Europe's regulator UEFA have shown a willingness to act so decisively in dealing with racist abuse. Given this is not the first time that Alves has been racially abused, the Brazilian argued Sunday's incident shone an unflattering spotlight on Spanish society. ""There is racism against foreigners. They sell the country as being first world but in certain things they are very backward,"" Alves told Brazil's Radio Globo. ""If I could, I would put a photo of the fan on the internet so that he would be shamed."" Alves' suggestion that Spain is ""backward"" touches on the nub of the problem, according to Crooks. ""Football clubs are being left with the responsibility of educating their fans, and quite frankly that should have started years ago at school and in people's forms of employment,"" he said. ""How dare football fans, however isolated, come to someone's place of employment, whether it be entertainment or otherwise, and want to abuse other people's heroes."" To Pele, though, such abuse is only to be expected, given that some people in this world are always going to be less educated than others. ""I think it should be like that, as of course you have different people all over the world,"" he said. ""You must respect the people that don't have the intelligence, or the people who want to make confusion, or people who want to create problems. That, I think, is normal."" Not, however, in Crooks' eyes. ""Pele accepted the situation [of racial abuse] as a player, as I did. He didn't have to play, he chose to play. He accepted the terms and conditions of his employment,"" he said. ""But there are players today who are not, and I think it's really important that we all understand that.""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- In the wake of a series of court scandals, an influential Communist Party legal commission issued new guidelines this week asking for fairer due process in China's much maligned court system. The guidelines, released by the Commission for Politics and Laws, call for interrogations to be recorded to prevent torture, defendants to have access to their attorneys, and judges, prosecutors and police to have a ""lifetime responsibility"" for their roles on each case. ""China has been full of scandals about wrongful convictions of innocent people,"" says Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""I think this is a response by the government and party that knows its citizens hold its judiciary in pretty low regard."" On Tuesday, a man who served 17 years of a life sentence for murdering his wife was freed after a Higher People's Court in Anhui ruled that the ""facts about the alleged homicide were unclear and the evidence inadequate,"" state news agency Xinhua reported. This and many similar cases have draw outrage on social media in China. ""Court cases in the past often deviate from regulations and were influenced by external causes, even though there has been clear regulations to guarantee defendants' right,"" says Professor Zhang Qianfan of Peking University. Zhang, a noted champion of legal reform, says courts don't always follow regulations and the key test of reform will be implementation. Many of the guidelines are not new. China's legislative body unveiled a new Criminal Procedure Act in 2012 that aimed to give defendants more rights, but was criticized for increasing police power. Rights groups regularly accuse Chinese security organs of torture and forced confessions in criminal cases. A landmark study (Criminal Justice in China: An Empirical Inquiry) completed in 2011 found that 95% of those accused in China confess to their crimes. The announcement of legal reforms appears to be part of a broader effort by President Xi Jinping's government. During a decade in power, China's previous president Hu Jintao put the brakes on legal reform seen in the years after the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Several prominent legal minds in China were ostracized or sidelined. But for a ruling party whose chief aim is holding onto power, popular anger at the legal system may have reached a threshold. Many Chinese, who see a legal system beset with corruption and frequently influenced by the powerful, will often turn to petitioning and protest. ""There is clearly hope at the moment for momentum in legal reform,"" says Bequelin. ""The leadership should understand that it's in everyone's best interest that the judiciary not only has a functional role, but is trusted by the people."" But for the ruling party, there are lines in the sand. ""If you recognize the rule of law as the fundamental guiding principle and the constitution as the abiding rule in China, then what does that mean for party control?"" says Carl Minzer, a China expert at Fordham Law School. Minzer believes there is little chance the party will loosen its grip over the courts through fundamental reforms. ""It would be a slippery slope towards greater and greater change that they may not be comfortable with,"" he says. Party members, numbering more than 80 million, are essentially above the law. If suspected of crimes, they are dealt with the party disciplinary committees first before going through criminal procedures, if at all, experts say. ""There is a big discrepancy between the way China works on paper and how it works in practice,"" says Minzer. Left out of the new guidelines altogether are the way the party deals with perceived political threats. Bequelin says that in sensitive cases where the party feels threatened, torture, ill treatment and extracted confessions are the norm. He doesn't expect that to change. ""China has the toolbox to deal with people properly, but every single political case that I have worked on in a decade has been marked by extensive violations of procedure.""","Commission for Politics and Laws calls for reform of China's court system .

"(CNN) -- Whether it's topping the podium at the Olympics and World Cup events or finding a welcome diversion away from the pressure cooker atmosphere of international competition, the U.S. women's ski team is certainly hitting the high notes. With the likes of teenage sensation Mikaela Shiffrin, super reliable Julia Mancuso and a fit-again Lindsey Vonn in its ranks, plus a strong supporting cast, the prospects for the season ahead look more than promising. Their ultimate focus is the world championships on the home snow of Colorado next February and the training has been intense -- but away from the piste the U.S. team room is more than often than not reverberating to the sound of music. Gathered around the most accomplished musician, the guitar-strumming downhill and super-G specialist Laurenne Ross, a host of popular standards are belted out with gusto and and more often than not in tune. Ross, who can also play the violin and piano, made the podium in downhill at the World Cup event in Garmisch last year and took 11th in the Sochi Games in the discipline. An outside bet for a medal at the 2015 world championships, Ross believes that her other passion boosts her sporting performance. ""I feel something with music that I feel on my skis and it puts me in the zone,"" she told CNN's Alpine Edge. Mancuso, a four-time Olympic medalist, the most by a U.S woman skier, is happy to be in the chorus in the musical sense but believes that as a team bonding exercise all feel the benefit of a different rhythm. ""It's been the same group of girls for a lot of time and it's a lot of fun,"" she said. Mancuso's bronze in Sochi in the Super Combined Slalom was added to Shiffrin's gold in the slalom and both were firmly in the media spotlight in the aftermath of the Winter Games, with a string of invites to celebrity events. The 30-year-old Mancuso, who has been on the World Cup circuit since she was just 15, is delighted to see the achievements of the team raise the profile of alpine skiing in the United States and take it into the mainstream. ""To see our sport at the pinnacle of sport in America is really cool because it's been such a European dominated sport,"" she added. Mancuso will be looking to add to her five world championship medals by adding an elusive gold when the action gets underway in Beaver Creek in February 2015. With the precocious Shiffrin starting the 2014-15 season with a fine World Cup win in giant slalom in Austria and Vonn on the comeback trail after knee surgery, the trio will, in the words of the John Denver song, be aiming for a ""Rocky Mountain High"" at Beaver Creek. Had he still been around --the musician died in 1997 -- Denver, a skiing fanatic who made his home in nearby Aspen, would doubtless been among the cheerleaders for the United States team. Denver may also have had a soft spot for Tina Maze, another skiing star with musical talent, who has enjoyed chart success in her native Slovenia with her song ""My Way is My Decision."" The two-time Olympic gold medalist even referenced Denver on Facebook when appearing at a World Cup event in Colorado in 2012, saying many of his songs were translated into Slovenian and remained popular standards in her country. Of course there will be one piece of music that all the contenders for global glory will be hoping to hear in Colorado, their national anthems to signify the top place on the podium. But as U.S. team member Stacey Cook told CNN all the intense rivalry can be put aside by making music together. ""It's nice to just sit down for 20 minutes to remember we are friends, not just competitors,"" she said. With such a strong team ethic in the U.S. ranks it may be a safe bet to assume the sound of the Star-Spangled Banner will be ringing around Beaver Creek to delight home followers.","U.S. women's ski team has strong prospects for season ahead .

"(CNN) -- He may be on the verge of signing for Barcelona, but it looks like Luis Suarez won't be returning to football action anytime soon after FIFA upheld his ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup in Brazil. The world governing body suspended the Uruguayan bad boy for nine international games and ruled him out of any football activity for four months after the incident in late June. Unless Suarez wins an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Thursday's ruling means he's sure to miss the start of the European football season. An appeal to Swiss-based CAS has yet to be confirmed. ""The FIFA Appeal Committee has decided to reject the appeals lodged by both the Uruguayan player Luis Suarez and the Uruguayan FA, and to confirm the decision rendered by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee on 25 June 2014 in its entirety,"" FIFA said in a statement on its website. ""The terms of the decision taken by the FIFA Appeal Committee were communicated to the player and the Uruguayan FA today."" When Suarez bit Chiellini on June 24 as Uruguay eliminated 2006 world champion Italy, it marked the third time he'd taken a chunk out of an opponent. The Liverpool striker was banned domestically for 10 games in April 2013 when he bit Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic in an English Premier League match, and he was handed a seven-game punishment while with Dutch club Ajax for biting PSV's Otman Bakkal in November 2010. Despite his indiscretions -- Suarez was also hit with an eight-game ban in December 2011 for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra -- the 27-year-old is expected to complete his move to Spain in the coming days. According to reports, Liverpool wants a transfer fee of Â£75 million ($128 million) for the reigning Premier League player of the season, who scored 31 goals for the club in 2013-14. If the sides agree on that figure, it would make Suarez the third most expensive player in football history after Real Madrid duo Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo. The Catalan giant is desperate to overturn its 2013-2014 fortunes, having not won a trophy and watching arch-rival Real Madrid claim the European Champions League title while Atletico Madrid took its La Liga crown. Barcelona was given a transfer ban by FIFA in April for allegedly breaking rules over the signing of minors, but this has been suspended pending an appeal. According to former England striker Gary Lineker -- now a television host with the BBC -- Barcelona insisted on Suarez apologizing before any possible transfer. Suarez duly apologized to Chiellini and the ""entire football family."" Liverpool, meanwhile, second in the Premier League last term, has been busy preparing for Suarez's probable departure, bringing in England internationals Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana from Southampton and Germany under-21 midfielder Emre Can from Bayer Leverkusen.","FIFA rejects appeal made by Uruguay striker Luis Suarez after he bit an opponent .

"(CNN) -- Whether it's breaking records on the piste, or making hit records in the studio, Tina Maze is determined to do things her way. The 29-year-old, who broke ranks with her national skiing federation to set up her own team, last weekend had the satisfaction of breaking the iconic all-time World Cup points record of the legendary Hermann Maier as she shrugged off pre-race death threats. The Slovenian has celebrated her numerous victories by turning cartwheels and, even more daringly, once famously unzipped her ski suit to reveal her under clothing to photographers after some rivals had wrongly accused her of gaining an aerodynamic advantage by placing padding in her sports bra. But not content with just grabbing the sporting headlines, Maze is also hitting the high notes in a fledgling career as a pop star -- inspired by influences such as Alicia Keys, Jessie J and, of course, Lady Gaga. A leading Slovenian music producer persuaded Maze to record a number he had written. Given her maverick reputation and single-minded approach, the title could not have been more apt:-- ""My Way is My Decision"" -- and it proved an instant hit, quickly reaching No. 1 in the Slovenian charts. The accompanying video -- which sees Maze moving in time to the catchy up tempo song -- has had over a million hits on YouTube. At one point, Maze dons a skiing helmet and uses a ski as a mock guitar, but fooling aside it is clear she has more than a modicum of musical talent. ""It was a new challenge -- I love music,"" she told CNN's Alpine Edge show. ""When I was a kid I played the piano for six years and all my family are musicians."" Having focused relentlessly on her skiing career since her teenage years, Maze is relieved to find an outside distraction in a completely different field. ""I was always looking for something different. Skiing is always so huge, you need so many talents to be fast and be good at this sport,"" she said. ""You need some talent and sensibility which you get with music."" Maze's skiing rivals were already aware of her talents on and off the slopes, and she often entertains her rivals with her piano skills when they stay at exclusive five-star hotels on the tour. When a concert was laid on at the end of the world championships in Schladming in Austria last month, she was quick to grab the microphone and belt out a few numbers. Maze had plenty to celebrate, having won a gold in the super-G and two silvers in the super-combined and giant slalom. Many predicted she would achieve the almost unprecedented feat of winning medals in all five of alpine skiing's disciplines, but tiredness and muscle soreness saw her finish fifth and seventh in the slalom and downhill respectively. But her incredible consistency across all the events has served Maze spectacularly well during the World Cup season, and she clinched the Crystal Globe of overall women's champion with nine events still remaining with victory in the super-G at Meribel a week after the championships at Schladming. It left her in touching distance of the all-time points record of the ""Herminator"" Maier and this was duly achieved with her ninth victory of the season in Saturday's downhill at Garmisch Partenkirchen. It took her past the magic 2,000 points mark of Maier and completed World Cup wins in all five of skiing's disciplines. With echoes of her hit pop video, she celebrated her win this time by using her ski as a guitar, and had time to throw in her trademark cartwheel. But afterwards, Maze revealed that she had received an email death threat, and there was a strong German police presence at Sunday's super-G, where she finished fourth. Typically, she shrugged off the threats. ""It shouldn't be part of the game but life is not perfect. It's not nice for me, it's not nice for my team. They want to ruin your day, ruin the record,"" she told gathered reporters. Maze has had to play second fiddle to the likes of American superstar Lindsey Vonn, the previous holder of the women's points record of 1980, but no longer. ""I've been improving for the past four or five seasons. You didn't see me much before, but I was improving and this season it all fits together,"" she said. Since 2008, Maze has been guided by her Italian coach and boyfriend, Andrea Massi -- going it alone with their team ""aMaze."" It has paid off in spectacular style. ""Winning the overall is a dream I've had since being a young skier. It's everyone's dream."" Vonn's shocking crash in the super-G at the world championships -- she was airlifted off the piste after sustaining a serious knee injury -- tempered Maze's subsequent triumph, and the Slovenian's look of horror and concern for her rival was only too evident. ""I'm really afraid of crashes,"" she admitted. ""I always concentrate 100% to make sure I do not make any mistakes such as happened to Lindsey. ""She was pushing the limits, she always does and that's why she's a great fighter."" Vonn faces a race against time to be fit in time for the Winter Olympics in Sochi next year, where Maze is determined to add to the two silvers she won at the 2010 Games in Vancouver as she carries the hopes of her small nation. ""It's my next major goal, to win a gold that's my goal,"" she said. And don't rule out a return to the top of the music charts (""I'm really proud of that"") by a young woman with talent and a zest for life -- a real crowd-pleaser in every sense.","Tina Maze has rewritten skiing's record books this season .

"(CNN) -- When this season's World Cup alpine ski champions stepped up to the podium to receive their prizes, they were following in some famous footsteps. The Dalai Lama, designer Karl Lagerfeld, Oprah Winfrey and boxing star Wladimir Klitschko have all been there. No, not the FIS winners' pantheon. Not yet at least (although Vanessa Mae's appearance at February's Sochi Winter Olympics should offer some encouragement to wannabe ski-celebs). Each has been the recipient of a piece of fine crystal designed and manufactured by JOSKA Kristall, a German glassblowing specialist. The Bavaria-based company is renowned as the maker of awards presented to many a famous face -- also including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mikhail Gorbachev and Claudia Schiffer -- but it is perhaps best known for the iconic FIS World Cup globes that are dished out to the kings and queens of the snow. Some 64 World Cup trophies are awarded yearly to the discipline and overall winners at the various FIS ski, snowboard, Nordic, ski-jump and cross-country World Cup finals events. Recipients in 2014 have included alpine skiers Anna Fenninger and Marcel Hirscher, who posed for the cameras with the freshest batch after picking up the overall titles for the ladies' and men's events respectively this month. Yet behind these triumphant images of sporting glory lies a tale of intricate craftsmanship that is as painstaking in its quest for perfection as the preparations of any winter athlete. A glass apart . Founded in 1960, JOSKA began as a glass-cutting enterprise before later adding a blowing factory, specialist engraving facility and hand-painting operations. It first manufactured the crystal sphere trophies in 1987, with the first FIS globe handed over in 1989. The process has since become part of winter sports tradition. Where football has its 18 carat gold World Cup trophy and ice hockey the silver and nickel Stanley Cup, winter sports have the crystal globe. ""Every season we have 33 of the small cups (for the winners of individual events), 17 of the big cups (for the overall winners), 17 for the nations cups and 177 medals of glass,"" JOSKA's operations manager Alouis Adam told CNN's Alpine Edge series. ""I think of the last 25 years we have made over 2,000 different small and big cups."" Adam says the production of a World Cup trophy spans two days and a number of complex stages. Each is primarily forged using a 1,200-degree Celsius mass of molten glass which is then painstakingly shaped by JOSKA's glassblowers. These skilled technicians inflate the hot glass to the required shape via a blowpipe, sweating profusely as they go. After a 24-hour cooling off period, the trophy is brought to a glasscutter who uses diamond disks to carve an intricate snow crystal design into the trophies. The FIS logos, the relevant discipline and sponsor names are then engraved into the glass. Once finished, the selected globes are packed up into specially designed shipping cases and transported from JOSKA headquarters to the relevant World Cup venue. Of the hundreds of globes made each year, only the finest are used -- JOSKA selects the 33 best trophies out of a total of 60 smaller globes produced annually. An emotional send-off . Having worked at the JOSKA for nigh on 42 years, Adam has seen hundreds of athletes pick up his company's prized trophies. He attended this month's World Cup finals and was as effusive as ever on witnessing the world's best skiers, snowboarders and cross-country athletes' joy at receiving the fruits of his company's labors. ""That's a beautiful feeling. I (have) watched all the World Cup finals the last 25 years and we are very proud when the winners have our product,"" he said. ""This goes out around the world and we are very proud -- the winner looks at the trophy and says it's a wonderful trophy."" JOSKA also manufactures trophies for cycling's Tour de France as well as the German and Polish football federations. But while fond of these items, Adam believes there is something unique about the World Cup globes. ""(This is an) absolutely special design which displays a globe for the best in skiing,"" he said. Those winter sportsmen and women fortunate enough to have their hands on the prized crystal will be sure to agree. See also: Double world cup joy for Austria .

"(CNN) -- The family of a U.S. citizen who was detained last week in North Korea said Monday they are ""anxious for his return,"" according to a written statement. The family of Jeffrey Fowle, 56, said: ""Jeffrey loves to travel and loves the adventure of experiencing different cultures and seeing new places."" Fowle has been married for 14 years and has three children, the statement said. According to CNN affiliate WDTN, he was detained for leaving a Bible where he was staying. ""Mrs. Fowle and the children miss Jeffrey very much and are anxious for his return home,"" the family said. They confirmed Fowle, who is from Miamisburg, Ohio, was part of a tour group that went to North Korea. On Friday, the secretive state, without going into detail, said through a state-run news agency that Fowle had been detained for breaking a law. The U.S. State Department said it was ""aware of reports that a third U.S. citizen was detained in North Korea."" But it declined to provide any further information, saying it couldn't share details about specific cases without written consent from an individual. Other Americans held . North Korea said in late April it was holding a different American man, who it said came to the country seeking asylum. He tore his tourist visa and shouted that ""he would seek asylum"" and ""came to the DPRK (North Korea) after choosing it as a shelter,"" state-run news agency KCNA said. KCNA identified that man as Miller Matthew Todd, who it says was taken into custody on April 10. American sources identified him as Matthew Todd Miller. The U.S. State Department said at the time that it was aware of the report and had been in touch with Sweden, which represents American interests in North Korea, about the matter. It declined to disclose any further information. North Korea is also holding Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary who was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in 2013 by a court that said he had carried out acts aimed at bringing down the regime of leader Kim Jong Un. Although North Korea contains a number of state-controlled churches, the totalitarian regime forbids independent religious activities, viewing them as potential threats to its authority.","Two other Americans have been detained in North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Events in Iraq and Syria have alarmed U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. Extremists from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria control vast swaths of Iraq and Syria. Its members may be mingling with Yemeni bomb makers who have a track record of getting devices on Western planes. And thousands of Europeans have gone to Syria ready to give up their lives. Holder has voiced ""extreme concern"" that the volatile mix could spread to Western shores. ""It's more frightening than anything I think I've seen as attorney general,"" he told ABC News. Here are five reasons why the fight in Syria and Iraq could spill over to the West. 1. ISIS has the manpower, money and know-how to hit the West, if it decides to . The nightmare scenario is that ISIS leaders or other terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria launch attacks in the West. They are well-positioned to unleash such carnage if they choose. Many of at least 2,000 European militants who have traveled to Syria joined ISIS. That has given groups the opportunity to train them and send them back home to launch attacks. A number have crossed into Iraq. These European fighters also could pose a threat to the United States because many Europeans do not need a visa to enter the U.S. About 100 Americans also have traveled to fight in Syria -- one carried out a suicide bombing in May. So far, though, ISIS and its fierce rival, the Syrian al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, have not seen attacking the West as anything near a priority. Their focus instead has been on fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and expanding their zone of operations in the region. The political turmoil brought about by the Arab Spring has made the ultimate dream of global jihadists -- the adoption of their kind of Islamic rule across the Arab world -- seem tantalizingly close. Attacking the West, which for al Qaeda leaders was always a means to this end, has become something of a sideshow. ISIS -- a group previously known as al Qaeda in Iraq -- has never prioritized targeting Western soil, instead preferring to focus on fighting ""infidels"" at home. In the decade since the Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi created the group, it has not been directly behind any plot on Western soil. By contrast, in the decade after the September 11 terrorist attacks, al Qaeda operatives in Pakistani tribal areas provided wave after wave of Western recruits training on how to make bombs out of chemicals and components readily available in home improvement and beauty supply stores in the West. To date, only one suspected ISIS recruit who has returned to Europe is alleged to have built such a device. In February, French police arrested a man they identified as Ibrahim B., a 23-year-old French-Algerian, and retrieved three soda cans filled with nearly a kilogram (about 2 pounds) of the high explosive TATP from his Cannes apartment. French police suspect that in the 18 months he fought in Syria, he learned how to make TATP, an unstable and difficult-to-transport high explosive used to build detonators in multiple al Qaeda plots against the West. It is not clear if ISIS signed off on his alleged plot. While some Western recruits are taught how to make improvised explosive devices in Syria, there is little indication yet that the group has created a training program tailored to attacking the West. The worry is that that could change. After a decade of insurgency in Iraq, no other group has more expertise in making improvised explosive devices. If the United States launches strikes to weaken ISIS, the group could strike back at the West, financing attacks with the tens of millions of dollars in its cash reserves. Last month, its supporters launched a Twitter campaign -- #CalamityWillBefallUS -- warning of such attacks. But, if ISIS is able to consolidate its territorial gains, it could set up training camps to rival any run by al Qaeda in Afghanistan before 9/11. It's a Catch-22 that worries U.S. officials. ""There's going to be a diaspora out of Syria at some point, and we are determined not to let lines be drawn from Syria today to a future 9/11,"" FBI Director James Comey warned in May. 2. Expert Yemeni bomb makers may be mingling with like-minded Westerners in Syria . U.S. officials worry about Yemeni bomb makers who are skilled in making explosive devices that are difficult to detect at airport security. The fear is that they are sharing their knowledge with terrorist groups in Syria with significant numbers of Western passport holders in their ranks. Holder called it a potentially ""deadly combination."" Ibrahim al Asiri, the ingenious chief bomb maker for al Qaeda in the Arabia Peninsula, a Yemeni al Qaeda affiliate, is thought to have trained a cadre of apprentices. Early this year, U.S. officials became worried that some may have traveled to Syria. Hundreds of Yemenis have traveled to fight there, and officials worry that AQAP and Jabhat al-Nusra are building ties. With ISIS dominating headlines and winning the battle for new recruits, it is possible that al Qaeda affiliates may try to restore their relevance by planning a spectacular attack. Al Asiri built the ""underwear"" device that a recruit partially detonated on a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day in 2009. Since then, he has built increasingly sophisticated devices and has experimented with new designs for a shoe bomb. But AQAP has recruited relatively few Westerners into its ranks, limiting -- at least until now -- its bomb makers' ability to target Western aviation. But there is concern that al Asiri's knowledge is spreading more widely. This month, the U.S. State Department said a Norwegian convert, Anders Dale, had received extensive instruction in explosives after joining AQAP in Yemen. It was not made clear whether this training was provided personally by al Asiri. Nor was it said where the Norwegian is now thought to be. 3. Western fighters who leave Syria could lash out back home . What most keeps European counterterrorism officials awake at night is the potential threat from hundreds of extremists who have returned home after fighting with terrorist groups in Syria. While little evidence has emerged so far that ISIS or Jabhat al-Nusra has directed them to launch attacks, their urban warfare skills would make them especially dangerous. The first terrorist attack on Western soil linked to Syria probably followed this trajectory. In May, Mehdi Nemmouche, a French-Algerian, allegedly gunned down four people at a Jewish museum in Brussels, Belgium, after spending a year in Syria. When he was arrested, police discovered a Kalashnikov in his possession wrapped in a flag with ISIS insignia. After the attack, an ISIS fighter said on social media that he had joined the group, but ISIS itself did not claim responsibility, suggesting to investigators that he planned the attack himself. ""The threat of attacks has never been greater -- not at the time of 9/11, not after the war in Iraq -- never,"" a European counterterrorism official told CNN last month. He envisaged a flood of small-scale but effective and chilling attacks similar to the Brussels shooting. European counterterrorism officials are worried the gains made by ISIS in Iraq will lead to a surge of travel to the region. In identifying who has traveled, they are often playing catch-up. ""In most cases, we know within two weeks a guy has gone to Syria. But 10 to 15 percent of the time, it can be several months before we figure it out. Inevitably, there will be some we have no idea about,"" one official told CNN. But even those they know about are difficult to track. Nemmouche was on a watch list when he returned to Europe. European officials tell CNN it is impossible to conduct 24-hour surveillance on all but a small fraction of people who have returned from Syria because of the prohibitive expense. 4. Would-be jihadists could become radicalized 'lone wolves' The Boston Marathon bombings illustrated the danger posed by extremists learning bomb-making skills over the Internet without having to travel to jihadist encampments overseas. European officials say anger about events in Syria and Iraq and excitement about the gains made by ISIS have spiked radicalization to unprecedented levels across the continent. Though the animus is not directed as squarely against the West as it was during the Iraq war, ISIS's viscerally anti-Western ideology is attracting a growing following in extremist circles in Europe. Officials worry that anger ""trigger events"" such as future U.S. strikes in Iraq or the arrests of fighters returning from Syria could result in lone-wolf attacks. Anger about events in Gaza could be another. 5. Foreign fighters who go home could build terror networks of their own . Around 7,000 foreign fighters have traveled to fight in Syria, many from the Arab world. This could see ""blowback"" across the region as fighters return to their home countries and build up jihadist terrorist groups. Like in Afghanistan two decades ago, fighters are building personal relationships in this melting pot that will form the basis of the transnational terrorist networks of the future. For example, a battalion of hardened jihadists from eastern Libya is fighting alongside ISIS in Syria while Egyptian ISIS recruits have returned to the Sinai, bolstering militant groups there. Now that al Qaeda has largely switched its operations from the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region to the Arab world, officials fear that its various affiliates in the region will increasingly coordinate and pool resources, creating a significant long-term security threat on the doorstep of Europe.","U.S. attorney general: There's ""extreme concern"" that Mideast bloodshed could spread to West .

"(CNN) -- A Miami police officer in a marked squad car has been charged with reckless driving, accused of zigzagging through Florida Turnpike traffic at more than 120 miles an hour so that he could be on time for his off-duty job, the Florida Highway Patrol said Saturday. Officer Fausto Lopez, 35, of Miami was handcuffed at gunpoint earlier this month and charged with second-degree reckless driving, a misdemeanor, according to the highway patrol's offense report. Lopez was eventually released, authorities said. In a pursuit videotaped on the trooper's in-car camera, Lopez led Florida highway patrol officer D.J. Watts on a seven-minute, almost 12-mile chase in pre-dawn darkness on Tuesday, October 11, the report said. The state patrol officer was driving on the turnpike when the white marked Miami police car blew by at a high rate of speed and ""crossed over all lanes of traffic,"" the report said. The highway patrol officer couldn't even overtake the Miami police car ""due to the unit traveling extremely reckless, in and out of traffic at high rates of speed, in excess of 120 mph,"" according to the report. The Miami cop ignored the state patrol officer's siren and lights -- and even ""accelerated"" at times and continued changing lanes. At one point, the Miami officer slowed to 78 miles an hour, but sped up again, the highway patrol said. Finally, the Miami officer, wearing his uniform, pulled over his squad car at 6:35 a.m. in Hollywood. A state highway patrol video shows the state trooper pulling out her service handgun as she approached the Miami police car with the officer seated behind the wheel. The Miami police officer ""stated that he was en route to an off-duty work detail and that he had to be there by 7:00 a.m.,"" Watts wrote in her report. On the Florida Highway Patrol offense report, the document lists Fausto's occupation as ""police officer"" whose employer is ""City of Miami Police Departmen(t)"" and lists the style of automobile as ""police car,"" a white 2008 Crown Victoria. A Miami police spokesman couldn't be reached immediately for comment Saturday. But Miami Police Detective Willie Moreno told CNN affiliate WFOR in Miami that the department will determine whether to take any action against Lopez after a judge rules on his case. The Florida Turnpike is also designated as Florida State Route 91, and the turnpike's website nicknames the highway ""The Less Stressway.""

"(CNN) -- Want to ride an elevator into space? While the idea has been around for more than 100 years, a breakthrough in nanotechnology could mean we will be riding into space on a cable made of diamonds. Scientists at Penn State University in the US released a research paper last month that showed the way forward to producing ultra-thin ""diamond nanothreads"" that have a strength and stiffness greater than that of today's strongest nanotubes and polymers. John Badding, professor of chemistry at Penn State University, told CNN his team had made the breakthrough while examining the properties of benzene molecules and that it took 18 months of study to make sense of what the team had been seeing. ""It is as if an incredible jeweler has strung together the smallest possible diamonds into a long miniature necklace,"" Badding said. ""Because this thread is diamond at heart, we expect that it will prove to be extraordinarily stiff, extraordinarily strong, and extraordinarily useful."" Benzene breakthrough . The experiments involved putting benzene -- a liquid -- under compression to form a solid material. ""What we found was that because our experiment compressed the benzene much more slowly than had been done before, these new materials formed,"" he said. ""Everybody thought that the benzene molecules would link together in a way that was very disorganized, like a glassy amorphous material. ""Instead, what caught our attention was that our experiments told us there was order in the benzene and that was the shock,"" he said. That all this occurred at room temperature was a further shock to the research team. Under pressure . He said the scientists worked to test the hypothesis that when benzene molecules break under high pressure, their atoms want to grab onto something else but can't because the pressure removes the space between them. ""This benzene then becomes highly reactive so that, when we release the pressure very slowly, an orderly polymerization reaction happens that forms the diamond-core nanothread,"" he said. What results is a material that is the strongest and stiffest known to science, but is also very lightweight. ""One of our wildest dreams for the nanomaterials we are developing is that they could be used to make the super-strong, lightweight cables that would make possible the construction of a ""space elevator"" which so far has existed only as a science-fiction idea,"" Badding said. Next stop... outer space . The Japanese construction company Obayashi is already investigating the feasibility of a space elevator, envisioning a space station tethered to the equator by a 96,000km cable made of carbon nanotechnology. The space station would orbit the earth in a geostationary position with the cable held taut through the centrifugal force of the earth's rotation - in much the same a hammer thrower spins the hammer at the Olympics. Robotic cars with magnetic motors would take seven days to reach the space station, lifting cargoes and people into space at a fraction of the current cost. According to the International Space Elevator Consortium (ISEC), space payloads would cost in the order of just hundreds of dollars per kilogram rather than the current $20,000 a kilogram that rocket technology costs. The key is in the small scale . At the core of the project is the nanotechnology that would make cables from a material harder and stronger than any currently found on Earth. A 2.5-inch thick cable made from carbon nanotechnology could lift the equivalent of three International Space Stations per day into orbit, according to ISEC. ""The tensile strength is almost a hundred times stronger than steel cables so it's possible,"" Yoji Ishikawa, a research and development manager at Obayashi told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""Right now we can't make the cable long enough. We can only make 3-centimeter-long nanotubes, but we need much more ... we think by 2030 we'll be able to do it."" Goodbye, rocket man . A space elevator is not the only non-rocket technology being investigated as a means of getting man-made objects into space. In the past NASA has examined everything from high-velocity artillery to rail-launched maglev projects as a way of getting objects into space. Physicist Stanley Starr of NASA's Kennedy Space Center said for the time being, NASA's emphasis is on developing exploration technologies to be used once a craft is already in space. ""And there are many challenges in that area,"" Starr told CNN. Nevertheless, the space agency continues to look at systems -- some of them quite bizarre such as the Slingatron -- that could achieve orbit without the use of fuel-hungry rocket systems. ""The space elevator is an interesting concept but will require a breakthrough in materials or the addition of a totally new concept to make it work. I don't foresee space elevator working in my lifetime,"" Starr said. ""I briefly looked at the Slingatron concept and don't believe it is feasible."" When physics gets in the way . Certain problems of aerodynamics and physics, he said, persist despite technological advances. While some concepts that use high velocities -- such as super artillery -- can work, balancing the greater aerodynamic forces with problems of heating remain. ""For example if you directly launch a small satellite out of a cannon with enough velocity to reach orbit, the projectile will probably be destroyed by the heat and stress,"" he said. ""If not, most of your mass is devoted to the structure and not much to the working payload."" Even so, he said NASA has not abandoned the idea of a non-rocket launch. ""I believe NASA will eventually invest in advanced non-rocket launch technology, but I don't think it will be very soon,"" Starr said. ""I would like to NASA establish a group, preferably networked from a number of NASA centers, that is actively looking new launch technologies and making recommendations for new investigations.""

"(CNN) -- A gunman intended to assassinate a U.S. representative when he opened fire outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket Saturday, killing six and wounding 12 including the congresswoman, the local sheriff said hours after the shooting. U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was in critical condition late Saturday after surgery for a single gunshot wound to the head. The dead included a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl, authorities said. One suspect was in custody immediately after the shooting, and investigators were ""actively in pursuit"" of a second man whom they believed may be involved in the attempted assassination, Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Saturday night. Two people tackled the suspected shooter, stopping a spray of bullets from what federal and state law enforcement sources described as a 9mm Glock outfitted with a 30-round magazine. Dupnik said the suspect in custody is 22, but declined to name him. An Arizona law enforcement source and a federal law enforcement source, meanwhile, identified the suspect as Jared Lee Loughner. The suspect was being held in the Pima County jail, Dupnik said. He was expected to appear in court Sunday morning, . Dupnik said investigators are not convinced that the suspect came to the supermarket alone. He said investigators were looking for a man seen near the suspect. Authorities did not know whether the person they sought actually had any connection with Loughner, a law enforcement source told CNN. Authorities have a piece of evidence that indicates this second individual was in close proximity to the store, the source said, but declined to elaborate. Investigators were trying to interview witnesses to determine if there was a connection between the two men, the source said. That source also said authorities were seeking search warrants for a residence and for a vehicle in connection with the suspect in custody. The attack happened about 10 minutes after the start of a previously scheduled constituent meeting outside a Safeway grocery store. Although U.S. Capitol Police said there was no evidence of a broader threat involving federal officials, the agency said in a statement it had advised other members of Congress to take ""reasonable and prudent precautions regarding their personal safety and security."" The House Sergeant at Arms also said ""it is essential"" that lawmakers contact local police to register their home and office addresses. Tucson Police Chief Roberto Villasenor said his department had secured the homes and offices of some unnamed federal officials as a ""precautionary measure."" At a news conference, Dupnik said the shooter moved towards the crowd and began firing. It was unclear if he said anything or who was shot first, Dupnik said. An employee of a nearby business, Jason Pekau, said he heard 15 to 20 shots. Two people tackled the gunman, who still had ammunition remaining, Dupnik said. Police recovered a 9mm Glock Model 19 handgun believed used in the shooting, according to senior law enforcement sources. The weapon had a 30-round magazine, according to a federal law enforcement source briefed on the investigation. ""He probably would have shot other people had he not been tackled,"" Dupnik said. Five people, including Chief Judge John Roll of the U.S. District Court for Arizona and Gabe Zimmerman, a Giffords staffer, died at the scene. The sixth victim, a 9-year-old girl, was pronounced dead at a hospital. Giffords, 40, was shot once in the head at close range, authorities said. She underwent surgery at University Medical Center in Tucson and was listed in critical condition. Authorities said all of the victims have been identified, but declined to release additional names pending notification of relatives. President Barack Obama sent FBI Director Richard Mueller to help coordinate the joint investigation, which federal authorities stressed did not appear to have any connection to terrorism. Dupnik said the suspect has had contact with law enforcement in the past in which he made violent threats, but he declined to say against whom. ""All I can tell you is there's reason to believe this individual may have a mental issue,"" Dupnik said. Nate Gray, special agent in charge of the Arizona office of the FBI, said the investigation was proceeding as a joint local and federal effort. ""The FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's office are working together on every aspect of this joint investigation and we are utilizing all resources necessary to make sure those responsible are brought to justice,"" Gray said. Giffords' press secretary, C.J. Karamargin, said he was unaware of any recent threats against Giffords. Dupnik said two incidents occurred in 2010 involving Giffords, including one in which a gun fell out of a constituent's pocket during an angry town hall meeting and another in which windows at her campaign office were broken out. Authorities said they did not know the motive for the shooting -- the suspect was not talking and had invoked his right against self-incrimination, Dupnik said. Giffords staffer Mark Kimble told CNN affiliate KGUN that the congresswoman did not have any security with her Saturday morning, which was not unusual for her. ""She wants to be as accessible to the people who elected her as possible,"" Kimble said. Dr. Peter Rhee of the University Medical Center said that Giffords had been moved to intensive care from surgery and said he was ""very optimistic"" about her recovery. ""I'm about as optimistic as it can get in this situation,"" he said during a brief news conference at the hospital Saturday afternoon. He said the next 24 hours will be key for determining the extent of her recovery. Dupnik reiterated Rhee's prognosis Saturday evening. The staffer who died, Gabe Zimmerman, was in charge of community outreach in Giffords' Tucson office, Karamargin said. He was engaged to be married. Giffords, a Democrat, was first elected in 2006. She has served as chairwoman of the House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee and also holds seats on the House Science and Technology and Armed Services committees. She won her third term in a closely contested race against a Tea Party-sponsored candidate and was one of three Democratic legislators who reported vandalism at their offices following the March vote on health care reform. She is married to Navy Capt. Mark Kelly, a NASA astronaut who is scheduled to lead a space shuttle mission to the International Space Station. Roll was a 1991 Bush appointee to the federal bench. The chief judge for the U.S. District Court for Arizona, he was originally from Pennsylvania. Colleagues and admirers of Giffords and Roll reacted quickly to the shooting. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said the attack was committed by a ""wicked person who has no sense of justice or compassion."" ""Whoever did this, whatever their reason, they are a disgrace to Arizona, this country and the human race, and they deserve and will receive the contempt of all decent people and the strongest punishment of the law,"" he said. Obama called the attack an ""unspeakable tragedy."" ""We do not yet have all the answers,"" he said. What we do know is that such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society."" House Speaker John Boehner said he was ""horrified"" by the shooting. ""An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve,"" he said. ""Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society."" Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts issued a statement decrying the shootings and the loss of Roll, whom he called a ""wise jurist who selflessly served Arizona and the nation with great distinction."" ""Chief Judge Roll's death is a somber reminder of the rule of law and the sacrifices of those who work to secure it,"" Roberts said. Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, said an incident like this could have a chilling effect on the frequent weekend listening post sessions many members of Congress have with their constituents. ""It does give you pause,"" Pingree said. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Susan Candiotti, Jeanne Meserve, Dana Bash and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: Investigators are ""actively pursuing"" a second suspect in shooting .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton lit into members of Congress on Wednesday night in Chicago, questioning their resolve to legislate as opposed to their desire to play politics. ""The basic problem is we have lost leaders on both sides of the aisle, particularly at this point in history, on the other side of the aisle, who are more interested in governing than in posturing, more interested in problem solving than in partisanship,"" Clinton told an audience of business leaders at The Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday night. Clinton, the former senator from New York and Democrats' presidential favorite, said this became clear for her during the 16-day partial government shutdown in 2013, when President Barack Obama had to cancel his trip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia. At the time Clinton was secretary of state. ""I don't care what party you are, Democrats never did that to George W. Bush despite our deep differences with President Bush on taxes, on Iraq, on so many other things,"" Clinton said. ""We never did it."" Clinton waffles on Obamacare tax question . Clinton's remarks were more stepped up than in the past, questioning not only Congress' resolve, but their commitment to doing their jobs. ""You have to ask yourself, do these particular members of Congress really understand the world? Understand what it means for the United States to lead and to be perceived as a leader? Or do they just not care,"" Clinton posited. ""Do they just have a whole other agenda that enables them to say whatever they want to say and spout whatever rhetoric they want to spout?"" Clinton has been outspoken in her longing for political leaders who could negotiate and cut deals. Her stump speech regularly includes lines that decry partisan politics. ""It is deeply distressing to me that we have people running for Congress, both House and Senate, who proudly go around their districts and their states proclaiming that you should send them to Washington because they will never compromise,"" Clinton said, pulling a line from previous speeches. Sizing up a Clinton-Romney race . Clinton urged the 900 well-heeled business leaders and philanthropists in the room to make their disapproval known. ""That is why it is imperative that you have people in business and other positions of responsibility basically say... 'Get out there and do your job. Stay off the talk shows. Get back to the Congress. Legislate and solve America's problems.'"" She added later, in an apparent appeal to independents, this call: ""The only way to solve this is for the American people, the American voters... who constitute the great middle of the American political system, to just call a halt to it.""","Hillary Clinton, a former senator, questioned the current Congress' resolve to legislate.

"(CNN) -- I am a mother who watched her mother bury her only son. Mothers who do this wear an excruciatingly blank look of sorrow and disorientation. Their eyes grow dim and damp. They move slowly, laboring to adjust to a horrific new reality. Not only does the heart of a mother split open when a child dies, but time itself breaks in two, reordered into the time before his death and the time after. I know the empty eyes well. My mother had them for years after the death of my 17-year-old brother, Eddie. Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, and Valerie Bell, Sean Bell's mother, have appeared on in news interviews in recent days. They still have those eyes. Now Lesley McSpadden, Michael Brown's mother, has the gruesome, unnatural task of burying her baby boy, a devastating detail often lost amid the aggressive noise surrounding the trauma in Ferguson, Missouri. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . The mothers of Sean Bell, Oscar Grant, Trayvon Martin and now Michael Brown are in a particularly sad sorority. Not only do they have to negotiate life without their sons, but they must conduct the rough rituals of mourning under the incredible burden of the violence, systemic racism, hidden history and injustice that brought them to this place. There's a dignity that comes with losing sons as soldiers, and there's a sympathy that comes to mothers who lose them to illness or a tragic accident, as was the case of my brother. But these other mothers have none of that relief; their sons were healthy, surefooted and unarmed. Now these women are thrust into spotlights, tasked with asking for prayers and patience and peace in the street -- when their own peace won't come. We mothers who watch these wounded women go through this, pull our own young men closer and strategize how to keep them from this fate. It's an unfair burden. In fact, every time a high-profile killing of an unarmed black male by law enforcement hits the news, black parents again have ""the talk"" with their sons about what to do, and perhaps more critically, what not to do when encountering police. And every time it's infuriating to reach for this desperate yet fatally flawed strategy: a one-sided instruction to help save them in a two-sided, potentially deadly relationship. Yesterday, I had a conversation with a friend who is a Hollywood producer with two sons living in an affluent neighborhood in Los Angeles. She told me that the details of her ""talk"" may be different from mothers in low-income communities, but she's clear that wealth does not protect her sons from dangerous encounters with the police. Indeed, she told me that some high-income mothers are so acutely aware of the way police view black men in California, that a group of the mothers got together and invited a high-ranking police officer over for tea to introduce him to their sons. The intent? ""Officer, meet my son. He's not a thug, a thief or a threat. If you see him in a fancy car or walking down the street wearing sporty teen boy gear, please don't kill him, OK?"" It's a clever tactic (as pathetic as it is that there is a need for it) and a step in the right direction. Consider: Black mothers and fathers all over the country for generations have been telling their kids how to act around law enforcement, but who is instructing law enforcement about how to act when encountering our boys? It is painfully evident that much of law enforcement is ignorant of black youth culture. Police are armed with ready guns, misinformed stereotypes and irrational fear. They obviously have not engaged enough with our youth to know about them. Many police officers have no imagination to allow black teens the adolescent recklessness they instinctively give white youth. If no one institutes a plan to reform the culture of policing by educating police about the culture of black youth, this lopsided relationship will continue to produce tragedies such as what we're witnessing in Ferguson. The burden has far too long been shouldered by black parents and kids, requiring them to adjust to the injustice of excessive force, police brutality and ignorance. Police officers must become more responsible for knowing the community they're hired to protect and serve (even fast food workers are trained to know their customers). The residents of Ferguson and cities all over America have been grossly underserved and fatally misunderstood. We should not be asking outraged mothers, fathers, families and communities to stop hollering. We should be asking trained law enforcement to put down their guns and listen up.

"(CNN) -- Bode Miller became the oldest man to win an Olympic alpine skiing medal Sunday but the 36-year-old American could not prevent Norway's Kjetil Jansrud from taking a surprise gold in the super-G at Sochi. Miller led for much of the competition until later starters Jansrud and Andrew Weibrecht left him in a tie for the bronze medal with Canada's Jan Hudec. The 28-year-old Jansrud won bronze in the downhill last week so his triumph was not entirely unexpected while Miller's teammate Weibrecht had claimed the super-G bronze in Vancouver four years before enduring a period of poor results. Jansrud clocked a time if one minute 18.14 seconds in testing conditions made more difficult by warm temperatures -- which meant organizers brought forward the start by one hour. Dream triumph . ""It's a little bit of a cliche, but it's something you dream about since you're a kid. I'm one of those kids. Being here is an amazing feeling,"" he said. Weibrecht was just pleased to have found form at exactly the right time to come home 0.30 seconds adrift of the winner. ""It's been a pretty difficult four years. It's one of those things: you can only be beaten down so many times before you look at what you're doing. ""Today is a great affirmation of what I've been doing and what I've done. I can still compete at this level."" Miller, was winning his sixth Olympic medal after below-par showings in the downhill and super-combined events. ""I'm happy to not have made catastrophic mistakes,"" was his rather downbeat verdict. The same could not be said for his compatriot and super-G world champion Ted Ligety, who struggled to 14th place, while defending Olympic champion in the discipline, Aksel Lund Svindal, also never challenged for the medals. But at least Svindal's fellow Norwegian Jansrud maintained their country's proud tradition, having now won the last four Olympic super-G titles. Orange sweep . Later, Dutch dominance in speed skating continued apace in the women's 1500 meters event but hot favorite Ireen Wust had to give second best to compatriot Jorien Ter Moors in the battle for gold. Lotte Van Beek snatched the bronze medal in the final pairing as it was an all-Orange podium, while Marrit Leenstra was fourth. Dutch skaters have won 16 medals to date in the speed skating competitions with five gold, five silver and six bronze. Ter Moors is the first female to compete in both short track and speed skating at the Olympic Winter Games and admitted she was inexperienced. ""I'm not used to these kind of situations. In short track you immediately know if you have won. Now I had to wait and it was very nerve-racking. I never expected to win gold here, but I had a very good race,"" she said . Sweden has a similar stranglehold on the relay events in nordic skiing and its men's quartet repeated the triumph of the 2010 Games in Vancouver by romping to victory in the 4x10km event. Marcus Hellner anchored them to victory in one hour 28 minutes 42 seconds and in the process claimed his third gold of the Sochi Olympics. ""I'm very lucky to be the man that could do it. It's incredible,"" he said. Swedish relay triumph . The Swedes were chased home by hosts Russia, who were watched by President Vladimir Putin, while France took a surprise bronze. Sweden's women won their 4x10km relay event earlier in the Games. The Czech Republic enjoyed its first gold of the Games Sunday as Eva Samkova claimed the women's snowboard supercross title . She led in each round to win from Dominique Maltais of Canada, with Chloe Trespeuch of France taking the bronze. ""I couldn't imagine this -- it was very fortunate for me,"" said Samkova. The qualification rounds were marred by accidents to Norway's Helene Olafsen and American Jacqueline Hernandez, who were stretchered off the course after crashing heavily. Russia's Maria Komissarova, who sustained serious injuries in practice for the freestyle skiing competition, was flown to Munich to receive specialist treatment, her federation confirmed Sunday. She fractured her spine in the worst accident of the Games and was visited by President Putin in hospital Saturday night before her transfer to Germany. Russia scrape win . The day after their exciting clash in the men's ice hockey tournament Russia and the United States scored contrasting victories in their qualifying pool. Blog: Superpower showdown on ice . Doubtless buoyed by the shootout win over Russia, the U.S. slammed Slovenia 5-1.

"(EW.com) -- Optimus Prime is back in full force. Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction (A- Cinema Score) earned an estimated $100 million across the weekend, making it the top debut of the year. It's also a career high for star Mark Wahlberg, who leads a new cast in telling the story of what happened five years after Chicago was nearly destroyed in the last film. Paramount's $200 million film may not have charmed the critics, but audiences didn't seem to take that, or the daunting run time, into account this weekend. Moviegoers were predominately male, accounting for 64 percent of audiences. Also of note: IMAX screens made up $10.7 million of the weekend grosses. But, the domestic business isn't the only good news. Internationally, Transformers is doing, well, Transformer-sized business, too. T4 earned a staggering $201.3 million from 37 territories, or 10,152 locations — a 35 percent uplift over Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Early estimates put its China earnings in the $90 million range, which is the best opening ever for a foreign film there. The 150 IMAX screens also made up a huge part of the weekend earnings accounting for a record-breaking $10 million. It's also the biggest opening of all time in Hong Kong and Indonesia and the second biggest opening of all time in Russia. Sony's 22 Jump Street snagged the No. 2 spot and inched past the first movie's domestic total ($138.4 million) this weekend with $15.4 million from 3,426 locations, down 44 percent from last. Meanwhile, DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon 2 fell another 47 percent and brought in an estimated $13.1 million in weekend three. The $145 million animated pic now has a domestic total of $121.8 million. The first film had made $133.4 million by this point in 2010. It'll be interesting to see what changes in preparation for the June 2016 release of the third film. Sony and Screen Gems' Think Like a Man Too plummeted 64 percent in weekend two with $10.4 million. Star Kevin Hart is still beating the social media drum, retweeting dozens of fans who mention the movie, but the energy at the theaters seems to have cooled off. The first film opened higher in 2012 and fell only 48 percent in its second weekend, going on to gross $91.5 million after 12 weeks in theaters. Hart's About Last Night, heavily marketed as a Valentine's Day pic, fell a steep 71 percent at the same point in the cycle and capped out with $48.6 million. Rounding out the top five is Disney's Maleficent, which crossed the $200 million mark domestically this weekend. The gothic fantasy took in an estimated $8.2 million from 3,073 locations in its fifth weekend in theaters, bringing its domestic cume to a staggering $201.9 million and its global take to $585.6 million (it's playing in 54 territories and has yet to open in Japan). Not only is this a live-action career high for Angelina Jolie on all fronts, but Disney now has two of the top four 2014 global releases to date, including Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Cap 2 may have lost the title of the highest opener, but it just passed The Lego Movie to become the highest grossing domestic release of 2014. 1. Transformers: Age of Extinction—$100 million . 2. 22 Jump Street—$15.4 million (domestic total: $139.8 million) 3. How to Train Your Dragon 2—$13.1 million (domestic total: $121.8 million) 4. Think Like a Man Too—$10.4 million (domestic total: $48.2 million) 5. Maleficent—$8.23 million (domestic total: $201.9 million) In the speciality box office world, Begin Again, starring Keira Knightley as an aspiring musician in New York, took in an estimated $148K from five locations, while Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho's sci-fi actioner starring Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton, made $162K from eight locations. ""There's no stopping this train. With some of the best reviews of the year and incredibly strong word-of-mouth, we're looking forward to a robust holiday expansion,"" said RADiUS-TWC Co-President Tom Quinn in a statement. Finally, Dinesh D'Souza's America took in $39K from three locations. Distributor Lionsgate is rolling the pic out to roughly 1,000 theaters on Wednesday. And in landmarks, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 crossed the $200 million mark this weekend, as well. Next weekend is a genre grab bag: Sony and Screen Gems release the horror pic Deliver Us From Evil, Relativity debuts its E.T.-like Earth to Echo. Warner Bros.'

"(CNN) -- Screenwriter William Goldman has written some of the most famous lines in movie history. You know the ones. ""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die"" from ""The Princess Bride."" ""Is it safe?"" from ""Marathon Man."" ""Follow the money"" from ""All the President's Men."" ""Think ya used enough dynamite there, Butch?"" from ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" He's won two Oscars, two Edgars, a Hugo and a career achievement award from the National Board of Review. He obviously knows how to write. And he still has no idea why some of his dialogue manages to become part of the national vernacular. There are so many factors that go into creating a movie, he says, that it's all a writer can do to get his script right. ""When you're doing a movie you have no idea who the powers on the movie are going to be, and is there going to be a star who wants this line or doesn't like that line. You're at the mercy of everybody and you do the best you can,"" he says. ""But you never know."" (It's no wonder that another of Goldman's most famous lines is his summation of Hollywood: ""Nobody knows anything."") If you're a screenwriter, it's not exactly something you can plan. Maybe the actor gives a line a poor spin; maybe the director doesn't capture the moment; maybe the film editor changes the rhythm of the scene in the cutting room. It's been said that nobody plans to make a bad film, but with so many variables at play, even a good script isn't bulletproof. Great cast! Great director! Why did that movie flop? Fred Shapiro, editor of ""The Yale Book of Quotations"" and several other books in the field, points out that movie quotations can be a shorthand -- something that brings up powerful associations. ""Some movie quotes become popular because they evoke a great film, or a great scene, or a great actor,"" he says. ""Sometimes the words of the quote become proverbial -- something like 'The natives are restless' or 'If you build it they will come' or 'Win one for the Gipper!' They enter into the language."" He also notes that lines tend to get condensed or changed. For example, he was quick to point out that the correct quotation from ""Field of Dreams"" is ""If you build it, he will come."" They're also social glue. Repeat a line from popular comedies such as ""Airplane!"" or ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" and you can immediately establish bonds with similarly minded individuals. This summer Marvel fans have been fond of repeating, ""I am Groot."" The late Harold Ramis was a champ at composing such wisecracks, anti-establishment jokes that have been repeated by generations of viewers. During the Oscars, Pepsi even promoted its ""mini can"" with a commercial that featured only well-known movie quotations. Why that strategy? ""We want to take this to an emotional place,"" Seth Kaufman, PepsiCo's VP-marketing for colas, told Advertising Age. Shapiro makes a distinction between popular quotations and catchphrases. The latter is more of a trademark, he says -- Bugs Bunny's ""What's up, doc?"", for example -- and incessantly repeated. They're often even said in the voice of the performer. It's hard to say ""Make my day"" without evoking Clint Eastwood's clenched-jaw delivery. These days, thanks to repeated television showings, video streaming and the Internet, quotations attach themselves to our craniums more quickly than ever. Ironically, that means the person who wrote the immortal line is now more ignored than ever. Think about Goldman's classics: Who do you think of, the actor or the writer? ""Nobody cares about who the screenwriter is,"" Goldman says. ""That's one of the things you have to deal with if you write a screenplay. Nobody has the least knowledge of what's going to work, and everybody wants Tom Cruise.""","No one can plan or guess about which movie quotations will become much repeated .
Screenwriter William Goldman says the writer is mostly likely thinking about the story .
Quotes are a shorthand, evoking a whole movie -- and the memories of that film ."
"(CNN) -- Thinking about donning a kimono to dress like a geisha for Halloween, or a Mexican mariachi suit? Students from Ohio University have a message for you: ""We're a culture, not a costume."" With ethnic and racial stereotypes becoming increasingly popular Halloween costume themes, members of the school's Students Teaching About Racism in Society are launching a campaign to make revelers think twice before reducing a culture to a caricature, the group's president said. Posters from the campaign are expected to go up on the Athens, Ohio, campus Wednesday. Meanwhile, the images are making the rounds online, raising debate over whether it's ever OK for people to paint their faces black, impersonate a racial stereotype for fun, and where to drawn the line. It's a seasonal point of controversy, but even after widely publicized controversies such as the ""Ghetto Fab"" wig at Kohl's and Target's illegal alien jumpsuit, costumes of stereotypes abound. On Google's shopping section, several pages of ""Mexican costume ideas"" are available, from ""Mexican donkey costumes"" to sexy serapes and tequila shooter girls. The ad campaign from Ohio University show students holding photos of different racial and ethnic stereotypes in costume: an Hispanic guy with a picture of the Mexican donkey costume, an Asian girl with an image of a Geisha, a Muslim student with a photo of a white guy wearing a traditional ghutra and iqal over his head, bombs strapped to his chest. ""During Halloween, we see offensive costumes. We don't like it, we don't appreciate it. We wanted to do a campaign about it saying, 'Hey, think about this. It's offensive,'"" said senior Sarah Williams, president of STARS. ""The best way to get rid of stereotypes and racism is to have a discussion and raise awareness, which is what we want to do with this campaign,"" said Williams, who is black and plans on dressing as singer Janelle Monae for Halloween. The most obvious offense occurs when someone who's not black decides to go blackface, because of the historical context, she said. But the message applies to all races and stereotypes -- and not just during Halloween. The dean of students fully supported the campaign, calling it a ""clean, succinct"" way of delivering an important message. ""We've always tried to get a handle on what it means to be thoughtful and appropriate when it comes to talking to students about choosing costumes and making the best decisions for celebrating Halloween,"" Ryan Lombardi said. ""I think it's a clean way of raising awareness of how the costumes you choose might be offensive. In many cases, students aren't doing it maliciously, but they might not realize the consequences of their actions on others."" The campaign has gone viral, landing on blogs and other schools' online publications. So far, the response in the editorial sections has been positive. But in the comment sections, not everyone thinks it's a message that needs to be reinforced. ""Suddenly, I am overcome with the urge to dress up as the Frito Bandito this year,"" one comment on the Arizona Daily Wildcat's piece on the campaign said. ""Guys & girls -- Halloween is just bit of fun. Dead guys don't come back to life and eat people. There are no hot blonde lady cops in tiny uniforms that demand to 'frisk' you. Kimonos are OK even if 'Asians' don't wear them on a daily basis."" But others think it's a message that needs to be repeated. ""I think it's almost impossible to be ironic while being racist, so irony is lost,"" said Jelani Cobb, a professor of Africana studies at Rutgers University and the author of ""The Substance of Hope: Barack Obama and the Paradox of Progress."" ""To treat a character like Batman or Superman as a Halloween costume is one thing, but to treat an entire ethnicity as a costume is something else. It suggests that people conflate the actual broad diversity of a culture with caricatures and characters."" While Italian-Americans can be stereotyped as gangsters and Irish-Americans as hard drinkers, there are no pervasive stereotypes for whites on the same level that allow for them to be caricatured as a Halloween costume, Cobb said. ""The more we look at people as caricatures, the harder it is to operate as democracy,"" he said. ""What underlies this kind of costuming is the belief that these people aren't quite equal to what we are or aren't as American as we are, or that you as a person who's not a member of that group should be able to dictate how painful the stereotype should be.""","Ohio University students take stand against dressing up as racial stereotypes for Halloween .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- When the pepper spray came out, the students only had moments to react. Kason, a wiry 23-year-old engineering student, was at the front of around 2,000 young protesters on a highway when he was hit -- but what he remembers most is the way protesters cooperated with one another. ""Give umbrellas to the people in the front,"" he heard people yelling. ""The word spread like wildfire,"" recalls Kason, who declined to give his last name. Within moments, the crowd passed hundreds of umbrellas forward so that the most vulnerable protesters could shield themselves. High above on an overpass, onlookers opened their umbrellas and parachuted them down to waiting hands. ""The cooperation was incredible,"" he says. Hong Kong protesters passionate but gullible . That night, police fired 87 tear gas rounds into the crowds of unarmed students â€” including Kason, who says protesters stuck together even as explosive blasts of stinging smoke blanketed the streets. Luckily, he wasn't injured. ""We yelled to each other, 'Go slowly, and look after others,"" he says. ""We relied on each other to get out safely."" In a city whose people have often been accused of being self-centered and materialistic, a palpable spirit of mutual aid has captured Hong Kong's democracy movement. Shaken and outraged by the police's use of force Sunday, tens -- if not hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers have organized a movement that has stunned even activist leaders with its sophistication and size. Coordinating themselves via Facebook, Google spreadsheets, and group messaging apps, citizens have set up a system of first aid stations, supply lines, rest areas, and barricades that now spans five major occupation sites. And the umbrella, unarmed students' method of defense against pepper spray and tear gas, has turned into an iconic international symbol of peaceful resistance. Meanwhile, police have staged a dramatic withdrawal. leaving protests largely undisturbed. As a result, the civil disobedience movement has turned into what feels like a self-governed street utopia. Early each morning, demonstrators stroll up and down, handing out free buns and drinks to their bleary-eyed companions. As the day progresses, they clean up trash and sing songs. Newcomers arrive every hour. ""Before Sunday, people were numb, hopeless. But after the tear gas, we all came out to support each other,"" says Kason. Cindy Chu, a retired 60-year-old nurse, decided to help after she heard students were tear gassed. ""I was outraged at how casually the government could hurt young people."" Now, she uses her medical skills to care for protesters, some of them who suffer symptoms of heatstroke after consecutive days of sitting in the humid heat. ""Democracy means we don't just care about ourselves, but we care about everyone around us,"" she says. Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung: Raw emotion 'will get us nowhere' ""We're trying to understand each other"" A few blocks away, a 54-year-old democracy supporter surnamed Choi is volunteering at his church to provide a resting place, fully stocked with snacks, drinks, air conditioning, and TV for anyone in need â€” even those on the other side. ""The people who support the government might feel very hurt. We want to pray with them, we want to calm their hearts. ""Our religion tells us to love our enemy, and we want to respect them even though we have different opinions."" But even democracy supporters disagree with each other. What you need to know about the protests . While sitting on an occupied highway on-ramp, a small group of protesters, including Kason, debate whether protesters are getting too relaxed. One, a college student, worries police want protesters to ""soften and let their guard down"" in order to come in and forcibly evict everyone. Another, a middle-aged man, says he dislikes how some protesters are hosting barbecues and soccer games â€” accusing them of making the movement seem unserious. ""Besides, if tear gas hits the barbecue flame, it could be really dangerous,"" he says. Kason disagrees, believing the protest ought to be ""joyful."" But, he points out, these discussions are exactly the sort of thing Hong Kong desperately needs. ""I just met those guys, but I know them better now. We have different ideas, but we're finding a way to accept each other,"" he says. ""Democracy isn't just about voting for our next leader. It's about seeing the equality of others. ""We're trying to understand each other, and in that process, we're coming to understand ourselves.""","Hong Kong police fired 87 tear gas rounds at unarmed students, enraging the public .

"(CNN) -- A Miami man is in a swampy situation after he was caught trying to trade a live alligator for beer at a Florida convenience store. Fernando Caignet Aguilera, 64, was cited by officials December 10 after he trapped the 4-foot alligator at a nearby park and brought it to the Santa Ana Market, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino. Aguilera then walked up to the counter asking for a 12-pack of beer in exchange for the alligator. The clerk called Miami police instead. Pino told CNN that never in his 25-year career in law enforcement has he heard of a person capturing an alligator for the purpose of exchanging it for alcohol -- or anything, for that matter. Saying Aguilera apparently needed to ""quench his thirst buds,"" Pino called the incident an ""extremely unusual situation, and a sad situation for the alligator."" The alligator was unharmed and returned to the wild by wildlife officials, Pino said. Aguilera was not injured in the process of trapping and transporting the gator. He's been charged by wildlife officials with taking possession and selling an alligator, which is a second-degree misdemeanor. He faces up to six months in jail and a $500 fine. Pino was unsure if Aguilera requested a specific brand of beer.","Man traps small alligator in Florida park, tries to exchange it for beer .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Like many mothers, Yan breastfeeds her child. But she's also found a way of making it pay. After noticing she produces more than she needs, Yan -- who lives with her five-month-old baby in Shenyang, the capital of China's northern Liaoning Province -- decided to sell it. ""I don't want to waste my milk,"" she told CNN. ""I heard that others sell breast milk online, and I thought 'Why not sell mine?' I created a Web page and started my business."" A cursory search for ""breast milk"" on 58.com, a Chinese online shopping platform, reveals no shortage of mothers offering to sell their breast milk. From Shanghai to Guangzhou, nursing mothers are cashing in on this booming online trade. ""I just need to wait for calls,"" said Yan. ""I provide fresh and frozen breast milk. But you have to pick it up yourself."" According to Yan, the market price is around 5,000 RMB (US$814) for a month's supply. In contrast, a month's worth of conventional baby formula costs around 2,000 RMB (US$325) in China. After China's tainted milk powder scandal in 2008, many new mothers who were unable to produce enough breast milk for their infant resorted to buying formula overseas â€” most notably in Hong Kong. However, earlier this year Hong Kong introduced limits on the amount of milk powder travelers can take out of the territory, over concerns about shortages and a ""black market"" in formula sold at vastly inflated prices. The restrictions have encouraged new mothers to find other means of sourcing milk to feed their babies. ""If I don't have enough breast milk I would prefer to purchase human breast milk, because I don't trust our milk powder,"" explained Fang Lu, a newlywed who is planning to start a family. This week, the mistrust of milk powder extended to the biggest single supplier of dairy products to China. On Saturday, New Zealand company Fonterra announced that a strain of bacteria that causes botulism had been found in batches of an ingredient used to make baby formula, as well as sports drinks. China immediately halted imports of Fonterra-produced Whey Powder and Dairy Base powder, and increased inspections of New Zealand dairy products. Some mothers may be turning to others' breast milk as an ""safer"" alternative but health experts say it doesn't come without risks. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, babies fed unscreened milk from other mothers could be exposed to infectious diseases, including HIV, and illegal and prescription drugs. It adds that, if not stored properly human milk, ""like any type of any type of milk, becomes contaminated and unsafe to drink."" In May, China opened its first breast milk bank at the Guangzhou Maternity and Childcare Hospital and just last week another opened in Nanjing, Jiangsu province. However, like others around the world, they impose strict controls on who is able to donate, limiting the availability of supply. The trend of mothers' buying human milk online is not limited to China. A number of sites exist online to match buyers and sellers. Separately, an increasing number of women are turning to informal milk sharing sites that trust donors to properly store their milk and declare any lifestyle or health risks to prospective recipients. On those sites, the sale of breast milk is strictly prohibited. In China, trading human breast milk online occupies a legal gray area. While the Ministry of Health Law Supervisor Department has declared that human breast milk cannot be a commodity, no laws regulate or explicitly prohibit its sale. But while the practice may not be encountering legal obstacles, some people spoken to by CNN expressed discomfort with the growing popularity of the trade. Wangyan Liu, a doctor from Beijing, said he was concerned about breast milk sales, saying that poorly stored milk could make infants sick. ""If conditions of breast milk storage are not good, then it's more dangerous,"" he said. ""We need laws for the breast milk business."" But for Yan, the emergence of China's breast milk market is a positive development -- and not one that is solely motivated by profit. ""I think the business is totally fine. I have excess breast milk and I want to help others -- and earn some money,"" she said.","Some mothers in China have begun selling their excess breast milk online .
Fears about the safety of infant formula have prompted mothers to seek an alternative .

"(CNN) -- Thor is now a woman. On Tuesday, Marvel Comics announced the hammer-wielding superhero will be represented by a female, though the precise circumstances of the changeover are unknown. Presumably, all the details will be spilled in October, when the new storyline begins. ""This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR,"" writer Jason Aaron said in a press release that was widely retweeted. The Twitterverse generally approved.

""We now live in a world where Captain America is black, and Thor is a woman.

Marvel's ""Thor, the God of Thunder,"" dates back to 1962. The character was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, who borrowed from Norse mythology -- Thor is part of the Norse pantheon -- and comic-book tropes, as the character takes on a human guise until his powers are brought to the fore by clutching Mjolnir, his fabled hammer.","In new storyline, Thor will be represented by a woman .

"(CNN) -- Freeze! Step away from the stack of face masks and hazmat suits. ""What's more topical than Ebola?"" you're thinking. ""It's the perfect inspiration for a Halloween costume, right?!"" No. Just ... no. Using tragic current events as fodder for Halloween costumes is nothing new, but it's often a hackneyed and insensitive choice. ""Prom night toilet baby"" was a popular costume after a spate of girls gave birth to secret babies at school, and a bloodied duo strolled into a party dressed as Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman just last year. This year, for just $59.99 on one costume e-tailer, sexy Ebola containment suit can be yours. Knee-slappers, right? They might evoke a chuckle from the crasser among us, but do you really want to be the hero of the most obnoxious person at the party or, worse, the most-hated person on Twitter? Photos have already surfaced of a bro dressed as former Baltimore Raven Ray Rice and dragging around a lifeless doll meant to stand in for domestic violence victim Janay Rice. Janay Rice, a real person with actual feelings, weighed in on the tastelessness: ""@TMZ it's sad, that my suffering amuses others."" Don't be the guy wearing the cruel, uncreative costume. Dallas is reeling from the first Ebola cases transmitted on U.S. soil. Predictably, some local resident chose to decorate his front yard as a biohazard zone. It's unclear how the families of those who are fighting for their lives feel about the stunt, but you'd think fellow Dallas denizens would have a little tact. ""Money can't buy empathy or good taste (shaking my head),"" Sandra Mundie James wrote to CNN Dallas affiliate WFAA on Facebook. That about sums it up. So maybe shelve the brilliant ideas that involve dead celebrities, biohazards, missing plane passengers, terrorists and domestic abusers. Yep, it's been a rough year, but why memorialize it around a spider-filled punchbowl at the office party?","It's been tragedy-filled year since last Halloween: plane crashes, Ebola, domestic abuse .

"New York (CNN) -- A final report released Friday on the investigation of the mass shooting at Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School offered snippets of the life of the reclusive and tormented young man who carried out the second deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. More than anything, the voluminous report -- thousands of pages long -- from the Connecticut State Police closes the final chapter on a massacre that triggered a national debate over gun violence, school safety and mental health. In a heavily redacted page in the report, an unidentified witness told investigators 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza hated his mother, Nancy, and Sandy Hook Elementary School. She volunteered at the school from 1998 to 2012, including years when he attended it. ""Lanza apparently felt that his mother loved the students more than him,"" the report said. However, a prosecutor's report released last month concluded that Lanza acted alone and took the motive for the bloodbath to his grave. The previous report quoted a witness who said Lanza did not have an emotional connection to his mother but also cited others who told investigators that they thought the young man was close to his mother and only talked to her. Mostly, Friday's report offered slight glimpses into the Lanza household. Nancy Lanza discussed her son's ""disabilities"" with a friend the day before her son shot and killed her, 20 first-graders and six staff members at the Newtown school. Over lunch, Nancy Lanza told the friend she had traveled to New Hampshire for a brief trip as ""an experiment to allow Adam to stay at home alone for a few days."" She traveled to New Hampshire on December 11 and returned on December 13. During the lunch meeting, the friend told investigators, Nancy Lanza ""described a difficult life but gave him the impression that she was courageous and 'handling everything.' "" Adam Lanza, 20, killed the children and staff with a semi-automatic rife on December 14, 2012. Earlier, he killed his mother inside their home. He committed suicide with a handgun as police arrived at the school. One of the responding officers at the school found a group of students and a teacher hidden in a small bathroom blocked behind a bookshelf, Friday's report said. The teacher did not initially believe police had arrived. An officer slid his badge under the door. One of Lanza's former teachers told investigators that during what were supposed to be brief creative-writing assignments, the young man produced long, disturbing passages. ""Adam would write ten pages, obsessing over battles, destruction and war,"" the teacher said, according to the report. His work was ""so graphic that it could not be shared."" After the shooting, the items investigators removed from the Lanza home included a military-style uniform that was found in Adam Lanza's room. There were books with titles such as ""Look me in the eye: My life with Aspergers,"" ""Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Mind of an Autistic Savant,"" and the ""NRA Guide to the Basics of Pistol Shooting."" In text messages in Nancy Lanza's phone records, the mother expressed concern for her son while texting with friends. ""I REALLY wish I could but I have so much to do and want to spend a little extra time with Adam before I go,"" she wrote in one. ""Also, lots of cooking to do because I like to leave him with all his favorites."" In another, she writes, ""I was off to a rough start. Poor Adam bumped his head (really badly) and we were dealing with blood at 5:30 in the morning :) He is ok... It looked worse than it actually is."" Last month, the prosecutor's report on the case said Lanza ""had significant mental health issues that affected his ability to live a normal life and to interact with others."" ""What contribution this made to the shootings, if any, is unknown as those mental health professionals who saw him did not see anything that would have predicted his future behavior,"" the prosecutor's report added. In Friday's report, police quoted an unidentified man who said he had dated Nancy Lanza in 2011 and remained friends with her. The man said she told him ""she did not want to be in Connecticut the week of the shooting and was considering taking a trip to be sure she was out of town. This was thought to be some sort of foreshadowing of the incident,"" the report said. The London trip was canceled, he said, because of ""a couple of last minute problems on the home front,"" the report said. The unidentified man said he did not know what the problems were. The man said ""he knew Lanza to own weapons and that she invited him to go shooting because it was a good stress release."" He told investigators that he visited her house only once and never met Adam. He said Nancy Lanza had retired from work because of her son's Asperger's syndrome. She wanted to be with her son, the man said. Lanza had a strange relationship with his mother: They lived in the same house but communicated by e-mail, according to the prosecutor's report last month. He refused to touch doorknobs and changed clothes several times a day. He loathed holidays and birthdays. Lanza and his mother frequently went target shooting together. Friday's report said ""a stand alone metal gun safe was located in the closet"" in the Lanza home. ""The door of the safe was found open. The door and the lock did not appear damaged."" Adam Lanza's relationship with his father was equally strange. Peter Lanza told investigators that he would reach out to Adam via e-mail six to eight times a year, even though Adam stopped responding altogether sometime in 2010, the report said. ""Peter stated that when Adam was approximately 8-9 years old he told him that 'he loved being a kid,'"" said the report. ""Peter also stated that Adam enjoyed his time at the Sandy Hook Elementary School when he was a student there."" Peter Lanza said that when his son was 11 or 12 years old, his demeanor changed, and he became more stressed and frustrated. And the father said he did not have a lot of interaction with his son during the year preceding the shooting, with Peter Lanza feeling ""his ex-wife Nancy was a contributing factor to Adam distancing himself from him."" An unnamed man who said he spoke to Nancy Lanza in the days before the massacre told investigators that she was planning to sell her house and move to Washington state or North Carolina. In Washington, the report said, Adam was to attend a special school he wanted to go to. If they went to North Carolina, Adam was to work for a friend of Nancy Lanza who owned a computer technology business. The report is available at: www.ct.gov/StatePoliceNewtownReport. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter in Atlanta, Yon Pomrenze in New York, and the CNN New York bureau staff contributed to this report.","Gunman Adam Lanza killed himself and 27 others in December 2012 .

"(CNN) -- The Syrian regime says it's ready to accept support from the United States and others working under the U.N. umbrella to fight ""terrorists."" The comments, by Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem, were made Monday as ISIS fighters seized control of a strategically important air base in the country. The war-racked nation has been losing control of the northeastern region to ISIS militants. Moallem, however, warned against any unilateral action or strikes in Syrian territory without permission. ""Any effort to fight terrorism should be done in coordination with Syrian government,"" Moallem said. The U.S. military and intelligence communities are gathering intelligence on the locations of ISIS leadership and its troops in Syria, two U.S. officials told CNN on Friday. The information could be used in the coming days if President Barack Obama were to authorize airstrikes against the militants in Syria. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said on Monday, while speaking in general terms, that in order to conduct operations over Syria ""you certainly want to get as much of a view on the ground as you can. You want as much situational awareness as you can."" ""Satellites can provide you good visibility, but you always want closer eyes on target if you can,"" Kirby added. Obama has authorized reconnaissance flights over Syria, which could begin at any point, a U.S. official told CNN on Monday. When asked by CNN's Wolf Blitzer about how much coordination the United States would need to do with Syria to strike ISIS, Kirby said, ""Not getting into the hypothetical operations, there's no intention to coordinate with Syrian authorities."" Air base seizure . The Islamic extremist group, which has taken over large areas of Syria and Iraq, wrested the Al-Tabqa air base from the Syrian military on Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict. Syrian state television reported that the Syrian military had evacuated the air base in Raqqa province to regroup and was still carrying out strikes against ISIS fighters in the area. In Iraq, ISIS claimed responsibility on Sunday for three suicide car bombs that killed at least 20 people in the northern city of Kirkuk on Saturday. ISIS said in a statement posted Monday that the bombs were a response to secular Kurdish gangs that joined the war on ISIS and their involvement in the bombing and targeting of Sunni areas. The statement said that two of those who carried out the suicide attacks were German nationals, identified as Abu Yasser al-Almany and Abu Ibrahim al-Almany. When contacted by CNN, the German Foreign Ministry declined comment on the ISIS statement. ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State, is part of the complex web of groups fighting in the long-running Syrian conflict -- a war that the U.N. estimates has killed more than 191,000 people. The spread of ISIS . Rebels have been battling the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since March 2011, and the civil war has turned the country into a haven for jihadists. ISIS has thrived amid the chaos, gaining global notoriety for its brutal tactics, including the beheading of American journalist James Foley last week. After its break with al Qaeda this year, ISIS has grown in strength and reach. Its dramatic, murderous advance in northern and western Iraq this year provoked U.S. airstrikes aimed at helping Kurdish and Iraqi forces. U.S. and Kurdish officials say ISIS is now under pressure in Iraq. But the extremist group continues to win significant victories in Syria. Planes moved before base fell . Al-Tabqa air base is the last major military base in Raqqa province, which borders Turkey, to fall into ISIS' hands. The group now is now understood to have effective control over the entire province, aside from a few villages in the south. The warplanes from the base had already been taken to other locations before ISIS took control, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said ISIS fighters were seen carrying the heads of Syrian regime soldiers. Both sides were reported to have suffered heavy losses in the battle for the base. ISIS controls major cities in Iraq and Syria, as well as oil fields, main roads and border crossings. It also has under its control more military hardware than some national armies after seizing both Iraqi and Syrian military bases and armories. Senior U.S. defense officials said last week that they hadn't ruled out extending airstrikes against ISIS into Syria. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama authorizes reconaissance flights over Syria, U.S. official says .

"(CNN) -- The Mexicans will be abstaining, one German is more open-minded while the Bosnians will only have themselves for company. It's a debate as old as time -- should football stars keep it clean between the sheets to maximise athletic performance? U.S. national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann is taking a relaxed view on in-competition coitus during the 2014 World Cup. ""I think we are very casual in the way we approach things,"" Klinsmann, a World Cup winner in 1990 with Germany, told Fusion TV. ""Their families can come pretty much any time. They will be at the games, they can come by at the hotel, we will have barbecues together. ""Every nation is different. I've played in different countries where, you know, you didn't see your girlfriend or your wife for two months. ... Every team and every country handles that differently, based on their culture. ""So I respect the Mexican approach because it's more their culture at that moment. I think we have a group of guys together and an environment together that is very open, very casual. ""But once we go on the field for training and also for the games, we are very serious and down to business."" As Klinsmann suggested, the Mexicans will be adopting a more chaste approach, with ""El Tri"" coach Miguel Herrera warning his players to restrain from sexual activity during the month-long tournament. ""If a player can't go one month or 20 days without having sexual relations, then they are not prepared to be a professional player,"" Herrera told Mexican newspaper Reforma. ""All the players we have selected have a pretty good resume, they all have won great things, they have been champions, and they know what we want to achieve. ""So then we will not be looking for sex or having sex at the World Cup just to have it, we are going to go after what we came for, a competition that gives us the opportunity to rise above and do something really great. ... We talked about it because there was a buzz."" Music to the ears of Bosnia-Herzegovina's coach Safet Susic, who according to British newspaper the Daily Star, told his players ""there will be no sex in Brazil."" Yet Susic, who is leading Bosnia at its first major tournament, has allowed one small concession. ""They can find another solution, they can even masturbate if they want.

"(CNN) -- By definition, a model is an archetype, an example to emulate. Within those standards, Shaun Ross is a model of imperfection. The 22-year-old was born with albinism, a congenital disorder that results in the production of little to no pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. The condition affects an estimated 1 in 17,000 people in the United States, according to the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation, and puts people at risk for persecution in some parts of the world, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. During this New York Fashion Week, which runs until September 12, Ross appeared in presentations for brands Third NYC and Monsieur Belange. He previously walked the runway in Berlin and appeared in music videos for Katy Perry and BeyoncÃ©. His most anticipated project is an upcoming short film entitled ""Tropico"" with Lana Del Rey. Ross, who describes his look as ""euphoric,"" is one of a growing number of anti-cookie-cutter models. He said his smile ""isn't the prettiest,"" but illuminating; his face is ""very disoriented,"" but edgy. ""I challenge photographers,"" he said. Interactive: The look of NYFW . Ross said his condition doesn't confine or define him -- it has just always been there. The 6-foot-1 model came into the world the same way he did the modeling industry: in an unlikely fashion. Ross's mom gave birth to him on the highway on the way to the hospital. ""The nickname my parents always called me was Nissan,"" Ross said with a laugh. But growing up in the Bronx borough of New York, Ross said he was called everything from ""Casper"" to ""Powder"" to ""white bread."" In seventh grade, the teasing culminated when a boy stabbed him in the back six times with a pen. ""I was always the outcast, but a confident outcast,"" Ross said. ""I just had to accept it. I'm going to be me; either you're going to accept it or you're not."" Ross, in part, credits his confidence to his mother, who never dwelled on his differences. ""It's really weird to say, but I never thought about my skin being weird. I just knew that's what it was. I never asked myself why I didn't look like my parents,"" Ross said. ""My mother has showed me you have no fear. You let people judge you, but who gives a fâ€”k?"" To him, beauty is confidence. While the runways this week continue to be dominated by waif-like bodies, angular faces and symmetrical, round eyes, Ross arrived on the scene just as the modeling industry is abuzz about what it means to be beautiful. Fashion Week's first plus-sized designer . The New York Times recently declared it the season of the quirky model. ""It girl"" of the moment Cara Delevingne sports full, bushy brows and self-deprecating, goofy Instagrams to match. She also suffers from psoriasis, an autoimmune disease that often results in splotchy red patches on the skin. A recent flare-up served as an accessory to a red Versace gown during Milan Fashion Week in February 2013. ""It only happened during Fashion Week!"" Delevingne told W Magazine. ""Which is, of course, the worst time of the year for me to be covered in scabs. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, and I'm sensitive. Kate (Moss) saw me before the Louis Vuitton show at 3 a.m., when I was being painted by people to cover the scabs."" Meanwhile, Lindsey Wixson with her ""bee-stung lips"" and gap teeth glided down the runway for top designers Rebecca Minkoff and Zac Posen, among others, during New York Fashion Week. Ukrainian model Masha Tyelna's otherworldly eyes pierce the cameras, while Andrej Pejic continues to push limits with crossover between menswear and womenswear. Charlotte Free rocks pink hair, while Saskia de Brauw sports a short, grunge haircut -- and challenges the notion that models must be in their late teens by continuing to work at age 32. High fashion, minus the labels . Some argue there isn't enough racial diversity in modeling, such as model-turned-activist Bethann Hardison, who sent a memo to Fashion Week organizers on behalf of the Diversity Coalition, an advocacy group that champions diversity on the runway. ""Eyes are on an industry that season after season watches fashion design houses consistently use one or no models of color,"" Hardison wrote to the Council of Fashion Designers of America, as well as to the British Fashion Council and the governing fashion week bodies for Paris and Milan. ""No matter the intention, the result is racism,"" she continues; the memo went on to call out specific designers who featured zero or only a couple of black models during their last season. According to Noah Shelley and Angus Munro, two of the most influential casting directors during New York Fashion Week, one part of casting is a designer's aesthetic: Does it make sense to put a rock 'n' roll girl in a romantic gown? But the majority is based on instinct. ""When an 'it girl' arrives, to an untrained eye, you wouldn't give her a second glance,"" Munro told CNN after Opening Ceremony debuted its spring collection at Fashion Week, where models were juxtaposed with flashy sports cars and Justin Bieber and Rihanna watched from the front row. ""Models are supposed to be aspirational, unreal characters,"" Munro said. ""The fact that they are abnormally tall, perfectly proportioned and have amazing skin, it's because we're creating a picture. It entices someone to buy something."" Shelley said that when he and Munro make casting decisions, there are a limited number of diverse models. They have seen a growing number of Asian models, as that area of the world has become one of the fastest growing markets for luxury goods. ""All the shows essentially want the best of the best,"" Shelley said. In a statement, the British Fashion Council said the lack of ethnic models is also a multitiered problem, from who the agencies decide to sign to what designers request. ""The British Fashion Council does not organize model castings for London Fashion Week, although, as its governing body, strongly asserts that all participating designers should recognize that London is one of the most multicultural cities in the world and should consider reflecting this demographic at their shows and presentations,"" it said in its response to the Diversity Coalition's memo. This season, Munro and Shelley say that personality and quirk appeals because of the intensity of model turnover. During the era of the supermodel, the faces of Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell transcended the runway -- often into mainstream media -- for years. Now, a model's look can be in and out of vogue in a matter of a few seasons. A day in the life of a model . It can be a matter of a model having the right look at the right time, whether heroin chic, like Kate Moss in the 1990s, or the androgynous look spurred by Agyness Deyn in the mid-2000s. ""The world has to want what that girl offers at that exact time,"" Shelley said. But Shelley and Munro try not to cross the line from quirk into novelty. ""There's a fine line between an interesting event and a spectacle,"" Shelley said. ""It's a spectacle when it becomes more about people wanting to identify with the strange."" Ross, the model with albinism, is a tricky one to cast, Munro said. ""That guy is unbelievably good-looking in an unbelievably bizarre way. But many designers haven't thought that way,"" he said. Ross summed up his attitude with a hashtag he uses to his growing social media following, #InMySkinIWin, which he says promotes a level of comfort with yourself. He started it to raise albinism awareness, but has since expanded the meaning to just loving who you are. ""It's the DIY generation,"" Ross said. ""Kids are becoming muses because they understand that what it takes to be successful is to be desirable and confident.""

"(CNN) -- Facebook has weighed in on a practice by some businesses asking employees or job applicants for their passwords to the popular social-media site. In a nutshell? Facebook says don't do it unless you want to get sued. ""This practice undermines the privacy expectations and the security of both the user and the user's friends,"" Erin Egan, the site's chief privacy officer, wrote Friday on the site's Facebook and Privacy Page. ""It also potentially exposes the employer who seeks this access to unanticipated legal liability."" Egan said that Facebook has seen a ""distressing increase"" in reports of job candidates being asked for their passwords over the past few months. She notes the practice violates not just the user's privacy but also that of his or her Facebook friends. It also might violate employment laws, according to the post. ""(W)e don't think it's right the thing to do,"" she said. ""But it also may cause problems for the employers that they are not anticipating. For example, if an employer sees on Facebook that someone is a member of a protected group (e.g. over a certain age, etc.) that employer may open themselves up to claims of discrimination if they don't hire that person."" Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union spoke out against the practice. The group said they've gotten multiple reports of people either being asked for their passwords or required to ""friend"" managers when they were applying for jobs. Robert Collins of the Baltimore area testified before the Maryland Legislature in February that he was trying to reapply for his corrections officer job after taking a leave of absence when he was told he needed to hand over his password to prove he had no gang affiliations. ""I did not want to do it, but because I really needed my job and he implied that this was a condition of recertification, I reluctantly gave him the password,"" he told Maryland lawmakers, who are considering outlawing the practice. In her post, Egan said that Facebook will consider going to court if it hears of the practice continuing. ""Facebook takes your privacy seriously,"" she wrote. "" We'll take action to protect the privacy and security of our users, whether by engaging policymakers or, where appropriate, by initiating legal action, including by shutting down applications that abuse their privileges."" It is already against Facebook's terms of service to share a password. ""You will not share your password, (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account,"" the agreement reads.","Facebook threatens possible legal action over employers seeking passwords .

"New Dehli (CNN) -- The ALS Ice Bucket Challenge has morphed into a considerably warmer and drier alternative in India. Enter the ""Rice Bucket Challenge."" Indian journalist Manju Latha Kalanidhi, who works for the U.S.-based rice research website Oryza.com, says when she first heard about the ice bucket challenge, she got thinking. ""Why waste water?"" she asks. ""I felt like doing something more locally tangible. Rice is a staple here. We eat it every day, we can store it for months. Why not donate rice to someone who is hungry?"" And it rhymes with ice. So Kalanidhi started her own challenge: Donate a bucket of rice to someone in need, post a photo online, and challenge your friends to do the same. The original version, designed to raise funds to fight amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) â€” also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease and motor neurone disease (MND) -- is a global viral phenomenon. People take videos of themselves getting doused with a bucket full of ice, share it online, and challenge friends to do the same or donate money to the cause. It is in effect a modern virtual chain letter. Hundreds of celebrities -- from Oprah Winfrey to Roger Federer -- have participated and fueled interest, raising more than $70 million in donations for the ALS Association. In India, the ice bucket challenge has generated attention too -- Bollywood stars have mirrored their Hollywood counterparts -- but it now seems it will be eclipsed by what some are describing as an Indian challenge for Indian needs: fighting hunger. #RiceBucketChallenge is on its way to going viral in India -- it's on TV news, on Twitter, and it now has a Facebook page with thousands of likes. ""People from all over the world are responding,"" says Kalanidhi, listing off letters of appreciation from people in Sweden, England, and beyond. The explosion of interest in the rice challenge is an indicator of how powerful social media has become in India. According to eMarketer, the number of internet users in India is expected to be around 200 million in 2016, a nearly three-fold increase since 2011. Much of the growth comes from smartphone users: younger Indians who would be more likely to use social media.","#IceBucketChallenge morphs into #RiceBucketChallenge in India .

"(CNN) -- In recent years, so much has been going on in the world of commercial aviation that putting together a ""top 10 events"" forecast has been easy -- major new airplane programs have been announced, airline consolidation has taken place and disputes between China and Europe over carbon emissions have held major airplane orders hostage. Not in 2015. Looking at the year ahead, it's a challenge to muster a list of five events likely to grab the general public's attention, much less 10. The year 2015 is more about program execution. New airplanes from Airbus and Bombardier are scheduled to enter service (EIS) in 2015 and the Airbus A350 XWB, scheduled for delivery to its first customer December 22, will also see its EIS in January. Boeing's 787s are in a lull: more than 200 have been delivered and the next version, the 787-10, isn't scheduled for delivery until 2018. Embraer is between airplanes, so to speak. Its new, re-engined E-Jet E2 isn't scheduled for delivery until 2018 and the current generation E-Jet marches on. Yet even though they do lack the pizzazz of years past, there are still a handful of important events and milestones to look forward to in 2015. New airplanes to enter service . The Airbus A320neo, the New Engine Option, and the Bombardier CSeries, are supposed to enter service in 2015. Each is powered by the Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbo Fan (GTF), a 20-year research-and-development gamble that brings PW back into the arena as a major player in single-aisle airplane powerplants. ""Supposed to"" because new airplane programs from Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier have been replete with delays. So far, the flight-testing of the A320neo -- which had its first flight in September -- seems to be going flawlessly, but unknowns can emerge. The A320neo's EIS is scheduled for October. For CSeries, EIS of Bombardier's bet-the-company jump into the big leagues with its first ""mainline"" jet is an event that was originally supposed to happen in December 2013. Then the fourth quarter of 2014. The first flight of the airborne test program didn't happen until September 2013. The planned fourth quarter 2014 EIS may have been achieved had it not been for a major engine failure of PW's GTF during a ground test in May. The fault was traced to a poorly designed oil seal and not the game-changing engine architecture. The entire flight test fleet was grounded for three months while the cause and a fix were identified. Had CSeries been on time, it would have been two years ahead of the A320neo. Now, it'll be a toss up as to which airplane enters service first. According to the Canadian investment bank aerospace analyst at Desjardins, CSeries should have its EIS in October 2015. Bombardier will only say the second half of 2015, but MTU, a major supplier on the CSeries Pratt & Whitney engine, narrows this down to the fourth quarter. No matter. EIS for two airplanes in the same month or the same quarter, or even the same year, is a major industry event. For Airbus, the A350 XWB, the response to the Boeing 787 and the challenge to Boeing's flagship 777-300ER, was set to be delivered December 22 to launch customer Qatar Airways. The real flow of deliveries and service entry begins in January. Declining oil prices mean increased profits . The price per barrel of oil dropped dramatically in 2014. It'll probably continue to fall in 2015. Some believe the price could hit $40 a barrel. If so, it probably won't stay there for long before rebounding to $60-$80 and, maybe, back to $100. Don't expect any order cancellations or deferrals because of lower oil prices. The lower oil prices may give new, short-term life to some older airplanes like the Boeing 757, 767, 777 and 747-400; and Airbus A300-600R and early A330s. But that's about it. Don't look for lower airfares driven by cheaper oil, either. Airline management knows this is a time to reap profits that are elusive in a high-oil price environment. Air shows will be lackluster . As always, international air shows are huge industry and media events. This coming year, the Paris Air Show is in June and the Dubai Air Show is in November. Unlike the air shows of recent years, at which airplane program launches were announced, the Big Four airplane manufacturers -- Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier, Embraer -- have tapped out their new airplane launches. Paris and Dubai will focus more on commercial airplane orders than anything else, and even these are expected to be off compared with previous years. The peak of the order cycle has come and gone and for the moment, we're on the downside of the bell curve, especially with oil prices falling and reducing the urgency to place more orders. Besides, with Airbus and Boeing backlogs out to 2020, there are few slots available for which to place orders. ATR, the France-based turbo-prop manufacturer with more than 80% of the market, might announce a major upgrade of its venerable ATR-42/72 series with a new engine, new wing and other systems, but turbo-props command neither the market size nor the headlines of the big jets. An ATR New Engine Option (neo), while important to the airlines, won't capture the imagination of the air show or reporters. Asian aviation marches along ... slowly . COMAC's C919 (China), the challenger to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 families, is in development and so is the equivalent Irkut MC-21 (Russia), but neither will take to the skies in 2015. The AVIC/COMAC ARJ21 (China) is supposed to enter service in 2015 after a seven-year delay, and this time it actually might do so. But only a few have been sold outside of China and prospects that there will be more orders are dim. The airplane is largely a learning effort by the Chinese on how to develop an airliner, and the experience has been painful. The Mitsubishi MRJ90, Japan's first commercial airliner since the 1960s, is set to enter flight-testing in 2015. KC-46A flight-testing will draw geek attention . The real aerospace geek will watch for the flight-testing of the Boeing KC-46A aerial refueling tanker for the U.S. Air Force. The airplane, based on the commercial Boeing 767-200ER, is already late and approaching $1.5 billion over budget. Its first flight was supposed to be last fall; now it's planned for this spring. Or maybe before. Even Boeing and the Air Force aren't sure when the bird will fly. Boeing won the contract in a bitter, bitter fight with Airbus, which proposed its A330 MRTT (multi-role tanker transport). Although not without its own challenges, the MRTT is in service in Britain and Australia and has been ordered by several other global air forces. Scott Hamilton is managing director of Leeham Co., which provides consulting services to the aerospace industry.","The coming year won't yield as many big aviation stories as years past .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- A brief respite from the violence in Gaza appeared imminent Wednesday after both sides agreed to a U.N-requested temporary cease-fire. ""Factions of the resistance have agreed to accept the offer of the UN regarding a 'field calm' for 5 hours from 10 AM until 3 PM (local time) Thursday for humanitarian needs,"" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zhuri said in a text message. Israel had already accepted the proposal; however, the military warned it would not sit idle if attacked. ""Should the humanitarian window be exploited by Hamas or other terror organizations for the purpose of launching attacks against Israeli civilian or military targets the IDF will respond firmly and decisively,"" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. An effort to permanently stop the killing stalled Tuesday when Israel resumed airstrikes following a brief, one-sided cease-fire brokered by Egypt. While Israel paused for six hours, Hamas leaders rejected the deal and continued firing rockets. They said they had not been consulted, and complained the deal did not address their demands for greater freedom for Gaza's 1.8 million residents. ""The initiative is no longer acceptable, and there is no basis for the continuation of this initiative,"" Hamas spokesman Zhuri had told CNN. Children on beach killed . Anger is rising over civilian deaths -- including those of four children killed while playing on the beach. The boys, ages 9 to 11, died Wednesday when a shell from an Israeli gunship exploded near them at the Al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, according to Palestinian officials. An Israeli official said the shelling was another example of Hamas using civilians as human shields -- intimating that the boys had been left to play near a rocket launcher. ""What they are deliberately doing is seeking to kill as many Palestinians as possible in order to yell to the world to, 'Help us,' "" Israeli Cabinet member Naftali Bennett told CNN. ""This is cynical and this is cowardly."" A Hamas official, however, called the shelling by an Israeli gunship a ""massacre"" and a ""war crime"" and demanded U.N. action. ""Those children were not firing rockets, they were just playing,"" Hamas spokesman Zhuri told reporters. Israel's military said it was aware of the report and was investigating. The military, spokesman Brig. Gen. Moti Almoz said, never intentionally targets civilians. ""Based on preliminary results, the target of this strike was Hamas terrorist operatives. The reported civilian causalities from this strike are a tragic outcome,"" the IDF said in a statement. ""We're checking it out because we don't target civilians. We don't target children. There's obviously been a mistake,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" The incident inflamed already raw emotions over civilian deaths in Gaza, where at least 221 Palestinians have died and close to 1,600 have been injured since Israel began its anti-Hamas military operation July 7, according to Palestinian health officials. The one fatality on the Israeli side so far occurred Monday when a mortar shell hit a man at the Erez border crossing, Israeli Rescue Services said. Rejection of Egyptian efforts . Also Wednesday, Hamas declined to join talks in Cairo between Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Like Israel, Egypt considers Hamas a terror organization because of the group's roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt's military-led government banned after the country's 2013 coup. Hamas officials said they are not opposed to a cease-fire, but want to see a broad agreement that would, among other things, end restrictions on border crossings that they say are choking the life out of Gaza's 1.8 million residents. ""I think what they want is to see a cease-fire agreement that addresses the real problems that they face and the system of violence that is this siege, that is the occupation, so that it can be a genuine cease-fire agreement that brings an end to hostilities, not just from one side,"" Yousef Munayyer, executive director of the Palestine Center, a pro-Palestinian think tank, told CNN's ""New Day."" But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Hamas had brought the continued Israeli operation on itself after rejecting the Egyptian-brokered cease-fire. ""We held our fire for six hours and during that time, Hamas continued to barrage our cities with rockets,"" Netanyahu said. ""Hamas thus shut the door to a diplomatic solution, and it therefore bears sole the responsibility for the continuation of the violence."" Former Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Nabil Shaath said Hamas has legitimate complaints about how Israel has implemented past accords. ""Gaza is still fully under siege. And none of the agreements that have been signed before have been implemented,"" he told CNN's Blitzer. ""But we think this is something that can be discussed later. What we should do now is proceed to an immediate stop of the Israeli attack on Gaza and, therefore, an immediate cease-fire. And we are working very hard to make that happen as soon as possible."" 'We are in jail here' Both Palestinians and Israelis say they are living in fear. ""We are forced to live in this, and there is nothing for us to do,"" said Abu Musbah, a, 21-year-old member of Islamic Jihad, one of the groups that is firing rockets at Israel. ""The children are scared, but we struggle to continue our lives."" The Shuja'iya neighborhood of Gaza City, where Musbah lives, was like a ghost town Wednesday. Many people had fled during the night. At the Al-Shati camp, 65-year-old Abu Ashraf said, ""We are in jail here, big jail."" In the Israeli city of Ashkelon, less than 15 kilometers (less 10 miles) from the Gaza border, people live under the constant threat of rocket fire. ""It's a difficult situation,"" said Merav Danieli, a resident of the city. ""I know that Gaza has a difficult situation also. We feel for them, we feel for them. But you can't live in your own country and someone will bomb you all the time, it's not a normal situation."" Gaza crisis: Who's who in Hamas . People on both sides of the conflict ""deserve to live in peace and security, free from fear,"" President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday. He said the United States will continue to encourage diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire. 'Failure is not an option' The failed cease-fire took shape after a secret telephone call between Egypt's al-Sisi and Netanyahu coordinated by U.N. Middle East peace envoy Tony Blair, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported Wednesday, citing unnamed diplomatic sources. The Egyptian plan calls for all sides to cease hostilities in Gaza, the opening of border crossings and for high-level talks among those involved. The deal was ""prepared hastily"" without consulting all the parties involved, most notably Hamas, Haaretz reported, citing Western and Israeli diplomatic sources. The effort to find a new path to a cease-fire is a ""must for all of us,"" said Saeb Erakat, chief negotiator for the Palestinian Authority. ""Failure is not an option here,"" he said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the immediate need is to find a way to stop the violence. ""Our concern is to have a legitimate cease-fire and see if we can find a way to stop the conflict killing so we can get to the real issues that are underlying it,"" he said.

"Lancaster, Texas (CNN) -- Cleanup efforts began in Texas on Tuesday after tornadoes ripped through the Dallas-Fort Worth area, tossing tractor-trailers like toys, forcing airlines to cancel flights and causing widespread damage. In Lancaster, Texas, south of Dallas, roofs were stripped to bare plywood and houses were speared by flying two-by-fours. About 300 buildings were damaged, according to the city's mayor. A citywide curfew was put in place, and a shelter was opened. ""It was like 'The Wizard of Oz,' "" said Gwen Dabbs, who wasn't able to make it to an interior room before the storm blew her windows out. She huddled in a corner of her living room covered with blankets as the tornado passed. ""My body is sore from being in the corner. But I don't have not a cut, not a scratch, and I'm so thankful. Thank you, Lord,"" she said. CNN affiliate WFAA broadcast striking video of area damage, showing tractor-trailers being lifted and flipped like matchsticks. Ominous clouds filled the skies, making it as dark as night. ""The pictures that you're seeing and that I'm seeing are just horrific. We've got reports of a number of injuries, but no reports of fatalities at the present time,"" said Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. As many as 13 tornadoes might have touched down in north Texas on Tuesday, said Jesse Moore, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Dallas-Fort Worth. ""Somewhere between six and 13. I know that sounds like a big range, but until we actually go out and do the survey, the number is just approximate,"" he said. Teams are preparing to assess the damage on Wednesday. National Weather Service tests graphic warnings . The severe weather affected flights and aircraft at area airports. More than 110 aircraft at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport sustained various degrees of hail damage, the airport said. It reported airlines canceled 400 departures, and more than three dozen incoming flights were diverted to other airports because of the storm. Southwest Airlines, meanwhile, canceled more than 40 flights at Dallas Love Field, while American Airlines canceled all flights through Tuesday evening at Dallas-Fort Worth, one of the world's busiest airports. The announcement, made via Twitter, was likely to affect American flights in other parts of the country. In all, American and its American Eagle partner airline canceled 234 outbound flights, according to a statement from American. By Tuesday evening, more than 47,000 homes and businesses in north Texas were without power, said a spokeswoman for Oncor Electric Delivery. Jonathan Cook said he was in a bank in south Fort Worth when the storm rolled in and he decided to leave. He went to a nearby gas station, where he ran into a friend whose window had been blown out and a National Weather Service worker with a radio who told them tornadoes were touching down nearby. ""A girl said 'Look up.' And there were two funnel clouds that touched down about an eighth of a mile up from us, and debris was flying and we were trying to decide where to go. ""About that time, she said, 'Look behind us' -- and a third tornado formed behind us, but hadn't touched down,"" Cook said. ""And about three minutes after that, the sirens started sounding."" Among the most dramatic images of the day were from a freight truck depot on the south side of Dallas, where one twister flung semitrailers high in the air and hundreds of feet from their parking spots. The lot is owned by Wisconsin-based Schneider National Trucking Company. Company spokeswoman Janet Bonkowski said there were no injuries at the facility and no damage to the building, ""but significant damage to the equipment that was in our yard."" A tractor weighs 20,000 pounds. An empty trailer weighs 14,000 pounds, while a full one weighs about 46,000, the company said. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris estimated the tornadoes that moved through the Dallas-Forth Worth area were EF1 or EF2 twisters, at their strongest. ""This is fairly weak in terms of tornadoes, but we saw the awesome power of the twisters as they lifted the trailers several hundred feet in the air,"" he said. Damage was also reported in Kennedale and Arlington, Texas. The mayor of the latter city signed a disaster declaration to help cope with the destruction. ""It's extensive damage,"" said Tiara Richard, a spokeswoman for Arlington police. No major injuries have been reported so far, but affected areas were still being searched for people who may be trapped, she said. Tarrant County spokesman Mark Flake said about 40 homes in Arlington sustained moderate damage. The Cowboys football stadium emerged almost unscathed, according to its general manager. Watch videos of the twisters . In Kennedale, a large water main broke, and several people were injured, said city spokeswoman Amethyst Cirmo, though she could not immediately confirm how many. The city's police chief, however, said there were no reports of deaths or injuries thus far. A community center was opened to residents displaced by the storm. Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez said the area was hit by ""a series of tornadoes"" that inflicted heavy damage on some of the southern suburbs. ""Our officers are going to several locations right now,"" Valdez said. She said deputies were en route to some of the hardest hit areas to prevent looting, amid reports ""that some of that has already started."" ""We have our hands full. There are already a lot of situations where we have to go out and help,"" she said. But all told, damage from the storm could have been much worse, said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings. ""The big headline is that we dodged a big bullet,"" he said. ""We're saddened by the damage the system did, but we've got nobody that's dead and no significant injures. It really is a miracle."" CNN's Ed Lavandera, Matt Smith, Dana Ford, Chad Myers, Joe Sutton and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","NEW: Six to 13 tornadoes touched down in north Texas, the NWS says .

"(CNN) -- Spain's controversial, and highly restrictive, new abortion law is now before Parliament, with approval looming. If passed this would mean that abortions will be permitted in only two circumstances: rape, and risk of ""lasting harm"" to the mother's health. The move would effectively reverse the abortion law of 2010, which permitted abortion on request in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy, and up to 22 weeks where there was serious risk of fetal anomaly. Contrasting view: 'No unborn child is unworthy of legal protection' The widespread opposition, both within Spain and elsewhere in Europe, indicates that the Popular Party's interest in the abortion law is not underwritten by a wider public and political desire to restrict abortion access. Throughout most countries in the developed world, with notable exceptions such as the Republic of Ireland, women's need for abortion is recognized by law and provided for through services, which are often publicly funded. But the Spanish situation provides a shocking reminder of how quickly things can change in a country -- and the extreme consequences this can have for women. Back in 2004, a British newspaper wrongly accused British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) of referring women to Spain, when they were ""too late"" to have an abortion in Britain. The reality was that doctors in Spain were, at that time, legally able to provide abortions at later gestations than the 24-week ""time limit"" permitted by British law. In the extremely rare cases where women were desperate to access abortion late in pregnancy, they would sometimes find that only a Spanish clinic was able to help them. The Spanish law of 2010 restricted abortions in later gestations, but did establish abortion on request earlier in pregnancy. Yet barely five years on, Spanish women find themselves effectively deprived of any ability to access abortion at any gestation. Will this mean that their need for abortion goes away? Of course not. What it means is that Spanish women, like Irish women, will be forced to travel for care to Britain and other European countries. The Irish experience shows with heartbreaking clarity that when a nation makes abortion illegal, it does not prevent women's need for abortion, or their determination to access safe procedures. Outlawing abortion simply sends the issue overseas, increasing the financial and emotional cost to women and, of course, the gestation at which they are able to access a termination. Politicians in the 21st century must accept that abortion is a necessary back-up to contraception, and that it should be a woman's private and personal decision that she is able to make according to what she thinks is best for her and her family. It is a travesty that abortion is included in the criminal statute in so many countries -- including Britain. As a moral matter it should be for a woman to decide in line with her values; she should be allowed to take responsibility for life and choose what she thinks is best. As a medical matter, if should be regulated like any other medical procedure. This point was put very nicely by the London Times in December 2013, in a leading article challenging the new Spanish law. ""To bring the criminal law into an issue of women's health and conscientious reflection is an abuse of government power,"" argued this establishment newspaper. ""A constitutional society does not intrude into areas of personal judgment that most citizens consider fall within the authority of the family. Social engineering is the practice of autocratic governments."" Spain is heading towards a self-made mess. We know from the situation in the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland, what the consequences of its new law are likely to be. The lesson for other governments is that they should stay out of women's personal decisions. ""Nosotras Decidimos,"" proclaim the Spanish women's organizations protesting against their inhumane new law -- ""We Decide."" Throughout Europe, organizations such as BPAS will be standing behind them, and providing the services that these women need. But how much better it would be if they could access this care at home - as, until so recently, they could. Read more: 2009 -- Spanish Parliament approves abortion bill .

"(CNN) -- What's on tap for you and your partner this Valentine's Day? A romantic dinner, a box of chocolates, maybe a bouquet of roses? While all those gestures are thoughtful, the results of a new survey led by sex and relationships researcher Kristen Mark and the experts at Good in Bed suggest that most couples have something a little more intimate in mind. In fact, nearly 85% of men and women report that sex is an important part of Valentine's Day, and 50% say that they'll be disappointed if they don't get lucky on the 14th. ""Valentine's Day is second only to New Year's Eve in the most celebrated holidays worldwide,"" explains Mark. ""Yet only a small amount of scientific literature has been dedicated to the attitudes, perceptions and participation in Valentine's Day celebrations."" To learn more about the way both couples and single people feel about the holiday, Mark and her colleagues polled more than 2,000 men and women between age 18 and 70, 66% of whom were in long-term committed relationships. ""The results,"" says Mark, ""give us insight into specific plans and expectations around this holiday."" The overwhelming majority of men and women are expecting sex. Here's how to make intimacy the centerpiece of your relationship this Valentine's Day. Start outside the bedroom. Our survey found that 65% of respondents plan on being affectionate on February 14 -- and affection doesn't always have to be sexual. Build anticipation before the big day (and night) by exchanging a few sexy texts or e-mails with your partner. Steal a kiss or two. You can also foster intimacy by giving him or her a really long hug: Research shows that hugging each other for at least 20 to 30 seconds can trigger the flow of oxytocin, the so-called feel-good ""cuddle hormone"". Make an effort. Great sex doesn't always just happen. Sometimes, it takes a little planning, especially if -- like many Americans -- you've been in a bit of a sex rut. Do some prep work by turning your bedroom into a love nest: Make the bed (with new, or at least clean, sheets), tidy up, light a candle or two, and queue up a sexy playlist on your iPod. If you do go out to dinner, don't overindulge, and hit the sack early so you're not too tired for intimacy. Think outside the chocolate box. While flowers, chocolate and lingerie still top the list in gifts, 30% of people plan on a more specifically sex-oriented gift on Valentine's Day, says Mark. These days, sensual presents and sex toys are as close as your local drugstore and can often be found right next to the condoms. If you're in the market for a higher-end present, consider a new vibrating toy that charges in your laptop's USB port. Or gift your partner an anthology of erotica, and read a few stories together. Get creative. According to the survey, 55% of both men and women are open to trying something new sexually, just because it's Valentine's Day. Take this opportunity to talk with your partner about stepping outside your comfort zones a bit. Maybe you want to experiment with role-playing, or watch an erotic movie together, or try a new position. Feeling shy? Take a tip from psychoanalyst Suzanne Iasenza, who suggests couples create a ""sexual menu"" that features a variety of sensual activities -- anything from watching the sunset together to giving each other erotic massages to acting out a fantasy. You can write up your menus independently and then share them on the big night. Redefine intimacy. Valentine's Day should be about celebrating love, but you don't have to be in a romantic relationship to enjoy it. Resist the urge to be impulsive, like 40% of survey participants who say they would hook up with someone sexually just because of the holiday. ""I advise some of my clients feeling anxious about the holiday to get together with people they love, like close friends or family members, with whom they have formed positive and supportive relationships,"" advises psychotherapist Allison M. Lloyds. That could mean dinner with friends, visiting your parents, or, if you're a single mom or dad, celebrating with your kids. Valentine's Day is a great opportunity to get closer to the one you love. Use it to jumpstart your relationship, but remember: You don't need a reason to celebrate love and intimacy every day of the year.","A majority of survey respondents say they expect sex on Valentine's Day .

"(CNN) -- Almost ten years ago to the day, the world watched aghast as scenes of carnage unfolded across the countries of the Indian Ocean. The 2004 tsunami was one of the most devastating natural disasters in living memory and the donor response -- a huge outpouring of governmental and private support -- a heartening riposte to what was a hugely traumatizing event. It has provided an ideal case study for disaster relief, and an Oxfam report, published today, examines the lessons that have been learned, as well as areas that the humanitarian relief sector still needs to improve upon. Widespread disaster . The tsunami, which hit communities as far afield as Thailand, Indonesia, Somalia and Madagascar, was sparked by a massive, 9.1 magnitude earthquake which struck off the western coast of Northern Sumatra, Indonesia. The immediate impact was devastation. A staggering five million people needed humanitarian assistance in the first few days following the incident. The hardest-hit countries -- Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand -- were among the poorest, and the disaster only compounded the developmental and societal issues those nations were already facing. Unprecedented donations . Oxfam says the response to the humanitarian catastrophe was the ""largest-ever privately funded response,"" with private donations making up 40% of all money raised -- an impressive $5.4 billion, which came close to matching government donations of $6.4 billion. A further $2 billion of disaster relief funding came in the form of loans and grants. Oxfam itself raised $294m for the tsunami relief effort, with over 90% of its funds coming from private donors. Jane Cocking, Oxfam's Humanitarian Director told CNN it was largely the ""absolutely horrific"" scale of the tragedy that brought out peoples' generosity. ""People automatically empathized, they came out of the blue and just wanted to help."" ""All the things that come together to ensure that people do connect were all there -- it was a natural disaster (as opposed to a man-made humanitarian crisis), it was enormous, completely unexpected,"" she said. Multinational assistance . Oxfam sent aid to seven of the worst-affected countries and continued to provide assistance well after the initial relief effort. The scale and effectiveness of the relief operation meant many of the countries were able to return to some semblance of normality a few short months after the disaster had such a widespread impact. In the wake of the disaster, badly-hit regions opted to ""build back better,"" creating solid infrastructure better able to withstand earthquakes and tsunamis, and investing more in emergency education and evacuation procedures. But the speed and level of funding for the disaster was unprecedented, and in itself almost overwhelming; like other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), Oxfam soon halted fundraising for the disaster, urging the public to donate to other, less-well publicized emergencies by mid-January 2005. Lessons learned . The charity says that one of the key lessons learned from the tsunami and its aftermath is that humanitarian funding needs to become more equitable. Pooled funds, Cocking says, allow agencies like Oxfam to use donations for humanitarian crises which are equally important, but perhaps not as high impact. ""There is simply not enough money going into the humanitarian system,"" Cocking says. ""Having donations spread out enables impartiality -- people in South Sudan have as much right to aid as a person in the tsunami. For us to be able to allocate our funds impartiality allows us to deliver our funds in a more equitable way."" The tsunami was one of the first disasters to be extensively captured on camera, and the extent of media coverage makes a sizable difference to the public -- and governments -- opening their wallets, Oxfam says. Windows into the disaster areas . Indeed, how the media has changed in its representation of natural disasters in the decade between 2004 and 2014 largely comes down to the growth of social media and access to camera-equipped mobile devices, Cocking says. ""The expansion of the number of people who have access to mobile technology focuses it on experience of the individual. In the 1990s [humanitarian crisis survivors] depended on organizations like Oxfam to get the word out, but not so much any more. Now it is much more personal."" Oxfam's report also highlights the importance of coordination; in 2004, the lack of a unified plan meant that efforts were scattergun, and often involved NGO workers operating outside of their main areas of expertise. Oxfam notes that ""close to 200 international NGOs (were) operating in (Indonesia's) Aceh province alone."" Inequalities exacerbated . The charity says that, in the aftermath of the tsunami, it learned a great deal about inequalities exacerbated by the onset of natural disasters. Women, it concludes, are more likely to die in such circumstances, a state of affairs compounded by poverty. Recruiting more female relief workers, especially at the coordination level, providing safe shelter and toilet facilities for women, and ""prioritizing livelihood activities for women as well as men,"" can reduce this disparity, the report recommends. Having experienced the full brunt of a disaster of this magnitude, the affected countries have been urged to ""build back better,"" enhancing their own preparedness to lessen the impact of future events. While the idea of a repeat of a natural disaster of this magnitude is unsettling, it is heartening to know that the lessons of 2004 have been digested and those aid-givers better equipped as a result.","2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the most devastating events of recent times .

"(CNN) -- With my last CNN.com column, I managed to start a small kerfuffle among conservatives. I wrote about how pathetic it is that historically, most Oscar-winning directors and producers have been white men — and how this reflects implicit bias more broadly in Hollywood and our society in general. Some people on Twitter criticized my argument. Among other things, they accused me of playing the race card -- echoing a very contorted line of conservative idea that liberals who call out racism in society are actually the racists. And so I responded with a question: . This was a question to conservatives about how they would otherwise explain the lack of black Oscar-winning and nominated directors and producers, if they don't attribute it to racism. However, conservatives interpreted the question as though I was blaming them for implicit racial bias in Hollywood. For the record, I was not. What I was doing was accusing our dominant cultural institution in America of at the very least failing to challenge the implicit biases of society in general and at worst replicating them. In my original essay, I wrote: . ""Does Hollywood exclude women and people of color in powerful director and producer roles more than other facets of American business and society? Probably not, but who cares? That doesn't make the critique any less worth leveling."" Which brings us to kerfuffle number two. Saturday evening, while watching the Disney animated film ""Frozen"" with my 5-year-old daughter, I tweeted: . Yet again, I got rapped for it. Reactions ranged from ""children do not need to be indoctrinated into your pro-dyke anti-natural family propaganda"" to ""Kids movies should be off limits to far left ideology."" Some even accused me of being a pedophile. Lovely Internet. And my tweet was reposted and condemned on several conservative websites, from Twitchy to Breitbart's Big Hollywood and more. That's the context. And so, since conservatives are jonesing for a conversation about this, let's have at it! Culture with a capital-C is political. The rise of Mackelmore or Jay Z is as much about talent as a calculation on the part of the record industry to factor in race. Women's necklines and hemlines are conscious decisions about gender and sexuality made by the fashion industry. And yes, Disney movies are political, too -- from the decision that all the female characters should have one-inch waistlines to the idea that princes are heroes and princesses need saving to the fact that all Disney princesses were white until Mulan, Jasmine and Tiana came along. Choices about what families are portrayed or excluded in Disney movies, and children's movies in particular, are political. Laws prohibiting interracial marriage were struck down by the Supreme Court in 1967, but as far as I know, there has still not been a biracial or multiracial family at the center of a Disney film (though at least Sofia the First is potentially a teeny-weeny step in the right direction). Despite the fact that one in four children in the United States today is being raised by a single parent, single moms in Disney movies are mostly portrayed as evil (think ""Cinderella"" and ""Snow White""). At least single fathers get better treatment (""Pinocchio"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""). While it appears that there is a gay family depicted in Disney's latest film, ""Frozen,"" and there are six other reasons why ""Frozen"" may be the most forward-looking Disney film yet, the film still continues a long and unbroken chain of hetero-normative children's movies. HLN: Meet Disney's first same-sex couple! Look, I'd be happy if we could get a brave, independent, non-offensively-skinny, non-obsessively-boy-crazy princess who isn't then Photoshopped for sex appeal. That would be nice for my daughter to see. But of course I want to see children's films go a step further and actively reflect the full, positive diversity of families in America today -- including gay families like mine. After all, we're talking about Hollywood -- land of the gays and those who love them! Is this really too much to ask? Gay rights are sweeping the globe, supported morally and politically by an overwhelming majority of Americans. The fact is mass culture is incredibly, frustratingly reactionary. It can seem that Miley Cyrus is twerking far before any of us are ready to see it, but the fact is that's just the corporate-backed culture industry picking up on underground trends in mass culture and amplifying them. Conversations about race and gender and sexuality in mainstream film often lag behind society as well. There are times when film can propel society in the right direction, whether it's ""In the Heat of the Night"" or ""Tootsie"" or ""Philadelphia"" or any other number of groundbreaking films. We don't think of children's films as a space for social progress and yet that's exactly where our society's norms and ideals are most embedded -- how the next generation learns right and wrong and good and evil and inclusion and exclusion can start when people are young. Hollywood can do a better job of making inclusive kids' movies that reflect the wonderful diversity of 21st century America. So yes, it's high time that we have a Disney movie in which a princess marries a princess. And a prince marries a prince. And a plumber marries a schoolteacher — for crying out loud, why must everyone be royal and rich?!

"(CNN) -- Gosh, you guys really hate selfie. And we see the hate runs so deep you don't mean just the images, you mean the word itself. Each year, the overseers of the overwrought phrase usage at Lake Superior State University in Michigan ask the public to send in nominations of words or terms that drive them crazy. Their Department of Words to Be Banished from the Queen's English for Misuse, Overuse and General Uselessness gets thousands of submissions and then it narrows the list to 13. Because that's what we need at the end of the year, a top 10+ list of something! A quick and totally unscientific search of CNN.com in 2013 reveals three dozen references to selfie, which includes stories about President Obama's selfie controversy, selfies taken at funerals, selfie tips and the fact that some organization called the Oxford Dictionaries had the nerve to name selfie the global word of the year. And selfie only just became an honest-to-goodness real word. We may not be able to keep people from posting them online, but we can try to get them to use another word. ""A self-snapped picture need not have a name all its own beyond 'photograph.' It may only be a matter of time before photos of one's self and a friend will become 'dualies,'"" wrote nominators Lawrence of Coventry, Connecticut, and Ryan of North Andover, Massachusetts. Another critic said the term is full of self-importance. ""Myselfie disparages the word because it's too selfie-serving,"" wrote Lisa of New York City. ""But enough about me, how about yourselfie?"" But the battle between the Lake Superior State folks and the Oxford crew doesn't end there. The award-winning ""twerk"" also gets the thumbs down from the 39th edition of the banishment list. What is twerking? I'm not sure I can accurately capture it in words, so watch this, but quickly. Lisa from New York City comes back strong again. ""I twitch when I hear twerk, for to twerk proves one is a jerk -- or is at least twitching like a jerk. Twerking has brought us to a new low in our lexicon,"" she wrote. Some of the phrases were a bit surprising to some of us, but if you insist, I guess it's time to retire Mister Mom and T-bone, the verb, as in one car T-boned the other. ""While the accident's layout does, indeed, resemble its namesake cut of beef, we'd prefer to dispense with the collateral imagery and enjoy a great steak,"" the barons of overused phrases wrote. As for Mr. Mom, well, that movie came out 30 years ago (kids, it's hilarious), and the idea of a man staying home while a wife works is not so novel any more. ""I am a stay-at-home dad/parent. And if you call me 'Mr. Mom,' I will punch you in the throat,"" said Zachary of East Providence, Rhode Island. We agree, the guy in the movie was a bit clueless about how to care for the little ones and the house. We went over to the Twittersphere to see the reaction to the call for the end of ""Twittersphere."" Apparently many people missed the memo on that (I can use that -- missed the memo hasn't made the complete list yet). Another Internet word to make the 2013 list was the written out or spoken hashtag. The symbol # is fine, apparently. Or maybe not. Read the previous ""banished"" words list . ""Typed on sites that use them, that's one thing. When verbally spoken, hashtag-itgetsoldquickly. So, hashtag-knockitoff,"" typed Kuahmel of Gardena, California. But Jen from Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, thinks: ""It's #obnoxious #ridiculous #annoying and I wish it would disappear."" We concur, Jen. #soundslikeagoodidea #notgoingtohappenanytimesoon . Sports fans contributed two words -- ""adversity"" and ""fan base."" Facebook user Tim Wilcox had an even better idea, getting rid of ""Nation"" after every team's nickname to describe their fans base. And adversity? In a sporting event? It means ""a state, condition, or instance of serious or continued difficulty or adverse fortune,"" according to Merriam-Webster. ""Facing adversity is working 50 hours a week and still struggling to feed your kids. Facing third and fifteen without your best receiver with tens of millions in the bank, is not,"" Kyle of White Lake, Michigan, wrote. Another phrase that likely got its start in sports but leaked into other usage and needs to go is ""_______ on steroids"". For instance, it's like a fast food restaurant on steroids. Wow, it must be, um, great. There were a few huge crises on the planet in 2013 but it's still here. So the use of ""-ageddon"" and ""-pocalypse"" got old quickly. We say there will be no Snowmageddon 2014. And we pray there is no a global shortage of pork products as the world must avoid using Baconpocalypse, or worse, Aporkcalypse. The list also included two terms associated with politics, or at least with Washington. Intellectually/Morally Bankrupt was one. Cal of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, wondered: ""Are there intellectual creditors?"" And the other was Obamacare, which appears in the media approximately every 3.2 seconds. However, that is easier to fit in a headline or ticker than ""Affordable Care Act."" Just sayin' (Also not banned -- yet). Which words would you be happy to never, ever hear again? Let us know in the comments.","Selfies are loathed by many social media users, and the word is, too .

"(CNN) -- U.S. women's soccer star Hope Solo entered a not-guilty plea in court Monday after police say she assaulted two relatives at a home near Seattle. Solo, national team goalkeeper and a two-time Olympic gold-medal winner, was released on the conditions she avoid contact with her half-sister and a 17-year-old nephew, and that she not drink alcohol. A pretrial hearing was set for the morning of August 11. Solo, dressed in a white shirt and black pants, said little, telling the judge ""I do"" when asked if she understood the domestic violence assault charges filed against her. She faces two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault. Police have said Solo, 32, assaulted her relatives early Saturday. Officers responded to a 911 call in which a male reported that a woman would not stop ""hitting people"" or leave the house, the statement said. At the home, officers heard a disturbance. Inside, Solo appeared ""intoxicated and upset,"" police said. Police said Solo's nephew and sister had visible injuries. After interviewing witnesses, police determined that Solo was the ""primary aggressor and had instigated the assault,"" the statement said. Police documents . According to a police affidavit, when police arrived, they saw that Solo's nephew's nose and left jawbone area were red, and that his shirt was ripped from the underarm down to the bottom. The left cheekbone of Solo's half-sister was swollen and turning purple, the document says. The nephew said that Solo insulted his weight and called him crazy, and an exchange of vulgarities led to Solo charging her nephew and getting in a fight with him, the affidavit states. When the half-sister walked in, Solo attacked her, according to the document. The nephew took a wooden broom that he ""broke over (Solo's) head"" in an attempt to stop the assault, the affidavit states. According to the document, when Solo didn't stop hitting her half-sister, the nephew grabbed a broken BB gun in an attempt to get Solo to leave the house. She left, but then jumped the fence and re-entered the house, where she attacked her half-sister again, according to the affidavit. The document says that Solo denied she assaulted anyone. She told police that she called her nephew ""fat and unathletic,"" and he responded by hitting her with a broom. Solo refused to let police examine her for injuries, the document states. The nephew told police that both women had been drinking wine before the altercation. Court apperance . Her attorney said she didn't commit a crime. ""Our investigation reveals that Hope was assaulted and injured during this unfortunate incident,"" Todd Maybrown wrote in an e-mail. ""We look forward to the opportunity to present the true facts in court and to having this matter behind Hope very soon."" In court, Maybrown said Solo -- who is married to former NFLer Jerramy Stevens and who was referred to in court as Hope Stevens -- was hit over the head with a broom handle during the incident. Solo's club team in the National Women's Soccer League, the Seattle Reign, acknowledged the incident over the weekend. ""We are aware of the situation with Hope and are now gathering information,"" the team tweeted. The Reign have a home match on Saturday. Just nine days ago she had a shutout for the women's national team against France. It was her 71st match without giving up a goal, tying her with Brianna Scurry for the most clean sheets ever for the United States. No stranger to controversy . Solo also played on World Cup teams in 2007 and 2011, and appeared on ABC's ""Dancing with the Stars."" A world-class goalkeeper, she is no stranger to controversy. In 2012, Solo sent out a harsh tweet criticizing Olympic soccer commentator Brandi Chastain for her negative commentary during the 2012 London games. During the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup, Solo openly criticized U.S. women's soccer coach Greg Ryan after she was benched and the U.S. lost its next match by four goals. In an interview with CNN two years ago, Solo spoke about her public image. ""I have a bad rap,"" she said. ""People look at me as selfish, outspoken. But I know who I am."" A warning and an elimination . The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in 2012 publicly warned Solo after she tested positive for a banned diuretic -- a substance she claimed she didn't know was in premenstrual medication prescribed by her physician. The agency accepted Solo's explanation and she competed in the 2012 Olympics. ""I don't expect any of the media to be positive,"" Solo told CNN in 2012. ""But I know that I'm doing wonderful things for the sport of soccer, and I know I'm doing amazing things for female athletes. So I can take it."" Solo was eliminated from ""Dancing with the Stars"" in 2011 following a run on the show marred by frequent disputes with pro partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy and the judging panel. Later that year, she appeared nude on one of four covers of ESPN's ""The Body Issue."" A native of Richland, Washington, Solo in 2005 became starting goalkeeper for the U.S. national team, tallying seven shutouts in nine matches. In 2009, she was named U.S. Soccer's female athlete of the year. CNN's John Newsome contributed to this report.","Hope Solo enters not-guilty plea in Washington court Monday, released without bail .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Chris Farley was a corpulent ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran like John Belushi. He died of a drug overdose like John Belushi (at the same age, no less). Saturday Night Live alum Chris Farley backstage at the 1997 Academy Awards in Hollywood, California. And now, with ""The Chris Farley Show,"" he gets his own biographical treatment just like -- you guessed it -- John Belushi. The ""oral history"" form of presentation -- essentially a string of anecdotes from friends and family -- is popular in the ""Saturday Night Live"" canon. (See Bob Woodward's 1984 Belushi bio, ""Wired,"" and 2002's ""Live From New York."") It's no wonder: Everyone involved -- Chris Rock, Tim Meadows, David Spade, Rob Lowe, and Tom Arnold -- are terrific storytellers. In exacting detail, Tanner Colby and Farley's brother Tom dutifully trace the comedian's life from his wealthy upbringing in Madison, Wisconsin, to his improv days in Chicago at the ImprovOlympic and Second City theaters to his five semi-distinguished years on ""Saturday Night Live"" and beyond. As with any good oral history, ""The Chris Farley Show"" moves briskly and the reporting is deep. (The most notable omission from the celeb-packed tome is SNL peer Adam Sandler.) Farley's own physicality is a good metaphor for the book: The meal is overstuffed with gossip and dish, whether it's Spade lamenting a fallout with Farley over a girl (it was never truly repaired) or Rock scolding Farley's famed Chippendales sketch with Patrick Swayze. ""There's no comic twist to it,"" explains Rock. ""It's just f---ing mean. A more mentally together Chris Farley wouldn't have done it."" Farley doesn't come off as particularly likable -- hookers, drug addiction, and his deepest insecurities are on full display. Still, he ultimately emerges as more than just a sweaty beast who gave good pratfall. Here's a guy who lived to please his 600-pound alcoholic father (wonder where those demons came from?). Beneath the unhealthy physique was an almost graceful athlete. He was a deeply religious man who attended Catholic mass twice a week. But for all of the candor, Farley makes a little too much of its subject's talent. The second-coming-of-Belushi proclamations flow endlessly; at one point, Farley is even compared to Johnny Carson. His first film, 1995's ""Tommy Boy,"" is dubbed a ""minor classic."" Perhaps. If the other Oscar nominees are ""Black Sheep"" and ""Beverly Hills Ninja."" It's actually Chevy Chase who, while blasting Farley over his narcotics addiction, puts his legacy in proper perspective: ""Look, you're not John Belushi. And when you overdose or kill yourself, you will not have the same acclaim that John did. You don't have the record of accomplishment that he had."" Very true.

"London (CNN) -- ""All I can remember is being held down and the pain. I think it will haunt me forever,"" the young girl told counselors. ""I try to avoid talking about what happened to me because I think people will judge me, but I'm scared that if I don't tell, it will happen to other girls."" What happened to the girl is genital mutilation. She's one of more than two dozen girls to get counseling this year through Britain's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and new figures out Monday suggest what happened to her is part of a much bigger problem in England and Wales. The charity's helpline for female genital mutilation concerns has fielded nearly 300 calls already this year, and referred an average of nearly one case a day to police or children's services, the group said Monday. The society's figures come on the same day that a major new report suggests there are more than twice as many women affected by or at extreme risk of female genital mutilation as previously thought in England and Wales. The report estimates that 137,000 women are affected or at risk of FGM, as the practice is called. The study is based on a new examination of 2011 United Kingdom census data, an effort to determine how many women and girls have moved to the country from places where the practice of mutilation is common. The last major report on the problem in England and Wales, in 2007, estimated that there were 66,000 women affected in the country and 24,000 at risk. It was based on the 2001 census. There are 29 countries where FGM is practiced, mostly in Africa, according to the report from City University London and the campaign group Equality Now. The report estimates that there are an additional 60,000 girls up to 14 years old whose mothers suffered FGM. And though the report doesn't say so, those girls must be considered to be at risk of it themselves. The British government is trying to fight the problem. It has issued guidelines ordering hospitals and schools to be on the lookout for signs of FGM, such as girls being taken out of school early for summer vacation for extended trips to Africa. Three out of 10 callers to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children helpline were worried about children being taken to Nigeria, and about 16% expressed fears for girls being taken to Somalia. Half the calls to the helpline were from professionals, including teachers and health care workers, the charity said. The charity did not name the girl it cited as it released its figures. The Department of Health has ordered hospitals to report signs of genital mutilation, but the first statistics aren't due until September. And in March, the Crown Prosecution Service launched its first effort to get convictions for FGM -- of a doctor and a person who encouraged the practice. They're due to go on trial on January 13, 2015. Female genital mutilation has been specifically outlawed in England and Wales since 1985. UNICEF estimates that at least 125 million women and girls around the world have been subjected to FGM, the ""partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons."" As many as 30 million girls under the age of 15 may still be at risk, UNICEF says, although the practice appears to be declining. Mutilations are normally performed by people with no formal medical training, without anesthetics, using crude instruments such as knives, scissors or razor blades, the City University study says. Experts tie it to specific ethnic groups rather than religion or country and say there's a variety of justifications, including diminishing or controlling female sexual desire. 2013 Report: Millions of girls still at risk of female genital mutilation .

"(CNN) -- Jim Heston, an American guesthouse operator in Cambodia, has lived a life in denim and has the photos to prove it. There were the dungarees he wore as a little boy, the dark bell-bottoms he had on for a hike up Japan's Mount Fuji, and the Levis straight-leg 501 jeans he's stayed with for the past 36 years. At 54, Heston doesn't get embarrassed anymore, ""but if I had to share any of these blue jean moments a few years back, I would have been a little more reluctant,"" he says. In particular, there was the snapshot of him on a Hawaii beach in a Daishiki and jeans his mother extended with red fabric because he was growing faster than his pants were wearing out. May 20, 1873, is considered the birthday of blue jeans. Readers shared their favorite and most cringe-inducing moments in denim (hello, acid wash) to mark the occasion. ""They're the most unique piece of clothing everyone owns because they keep changing as you wear them,"" said Angelika Corrente, who runs Denimhead, global trend forecaster WGSN's denim division. A few facts about denim: . 1. Jacob Davis, a tailor in Reno, Nevada, came up with the idea of riveted pants in response to a customer whose pockets kept ripping. He feared someone might steal his idea and recruited Levi Strauss, owner of dry goods wholesaler Levi Strauss & Co., as a business partner. They obtained a patent on May 20, 1873. 2. Denim jeans -- or trousers, waist overalls or dungarees -- started out as work-wear for hard labor in mines, factories and fields. By the 1980s, as high fashion brands began to introduce the concept of designer jeans, the shape and fit began to slim down. 3. Consumers in the United States buy approximately 450 million pairs of jeans every year. 4. On average, U.S. consumers have seven pairs of jeans in their wardrobe, according to Cotton Incorporated. 5. Environmental awareness has pushed denim laundries to improve techniques for bleaching and coating jeans to give them different looks, Corrente said. Where lots of water, aggressive washing and sandpaper was once the norm for creating that worn vintage look, lasers and and ozone gas cameras are now being used to minimize water waste and chemical runoff. 6. This year's trends are marked by a hybrid appreciation for fads of other eras. You're as likely to see someone rocking the heavy raw denim popular among '60s bikers and rebellious youth, an '80s-inspired high-waisted, flower print, or the acid-washed, ripped-up grunge look of the '90s.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- In a case that's captured international attention, Nadia Suleman, the mother of six children, gave birth to octuplets in Bellflower, California. Dr. Karen Maples says the mother of the octuplets is pleased with the babies' progress. Dr. Karen Maples, the leader of a team of doctors who delivered the babies, appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Monday night to discuss last week's delivery and give an update on the 33-year-old mother. Maples is chief of service, obstetrics and gynecology, at Kaiser Permanente's Bellflower Medical Center. Larry King: When this case came in, what did you make of it? Dr. Karen Maples: Well, I started taking care of the mother when I admitted her at 23 weeks' gestation. She had already been seen in our prenatal clinic, and she came to our Kaiser Bellflower when she was in her first trimester. She was well on her way in her pregnancy at 23 weeks. And I hospitalized her at that point. King: How well did she do carrying? Maples: She was an amazing patient. She did whatever it took to keep the babies in as long as possible. And she held on in the pregnancy until she was 30½ weeks of gestation. King: Did you wonder why someone with six kids -- three sets of twins -- would have eight more children? Maples: Actually, she has six kids with one set of twins. But at that point in time, my focus was on taking care of the patient and dealing with the seven babies that we thought were onboard at that time. King: So you aren't questioning why she did this ... ? Maples: No. King: What's the biggest problem you face in multiple births? Maples: The biggest risk is premature labor -- delivery early. And with that comes a risk of babies having immature lungs, a risk of complications with their intestines unable to grow. So that was the major risk. We wanted to try to prolong the pregnancy as long as possible. King: Kaiser Permanente was not the source of the in vitro [fertilization], right? Maples: No, we are not. The patient was already pregnant when she started receiving care at Kaiser. We -- it's not a Kaiser-covered benefit, in vitro fertilization. So she sought that treatment elsewhere. King: Why did you think seven and be surprised by eight? Maples: We did ultrasounds. And actually she had several ultrasounds through the pregnancy. But certainly as this pregnancy progressed, it was very difficult. When you're doing an ultrasound, you're looking at a three-dimensional space, and you're getting images with a two-dimensional screen. So it's difficult sometimes to see all of the spines and the skulls and the bones that are on the arms and legs. And we felt, at that point, we had seven. King: What did they weigh? Maples: The babies, when they were delivered, weighed between 1 pound, 8 ounces and 3 pounds and 4 ounces. King: How are they doing? Maples: They are doing remarkably well. We are so pleased with the team from the neonatology staff. They are currently all breathing on their own. They are eating donated breast milk, and they're also getting intravenous nutritional supplementation. The risk for a brain -- bleeding inside the brain -- has decreased now that they're a week old. So they're doing, actually, better than expected, with 31-week singleton babies. We're very pleased. King: Would you say they're all going to live? Maples: At this point, in time, we are really optimistic and hopeful. The most critical time was between three and seven days. And currently, right now, they're doing quite well. King: How long will they have to stay in the hospital? Maples: It's variable, you know, because each -- now they're individual, the patients, at this point, in the neonatal intensive care unit. It can be seven weeks. It could be as long as 12 weeks. But, you know, the neonatologist, [Mandhir] Gupta, and his team, will make the decision for discharge of the babies. King: How is the mother doing? Maples: She's doing quite well, recovering from the Caesarean section. It was a planned delivery one week ago. And she is doing well -- walking -- now able to walk about on her own, you know, is doing -- making, you know, great progress. King: What's her -- what's her attitude? Maples: She is very happy. She's very pleased with the progress of the babies and she's very optimistic for -- of the babies in the long term. King: Does she know the uproar this has caused?  Watch a report on the mother's future » . Maples: We have spoken to her about it. But she does have her family to support. And so she's helping -- getting help that way. King: But she does know that like everybody in the world is talking about this? Maples: That's true. Yes. King: Did she need special care in pregnancy? Maples: She was under our high-risk pregnancy service. The most care that she got was at 23 weeks, and we hospitalized for her. It was very important that we keep her at bed rest and try to reduce the risk of preterm delivery. And she -- we were able to do that. King: A couple of other things. Do we know that the eight embryos were implanted or did some split? Maples: At this point, I can't tell you anything about the in vitro fertilization. She's asked that we keep that private. King: How many boys? how many girls? Maples: There are six boys and two girls.","Mom did whatever it took to prolong the babies' gestation, Dr. Karen Maples says .

"(CNN) -- TLC's ""Toddlers and Tiaras"" has been mired in controversy since it debuted in 2009, and much of the distaste for the series stemmed from concerns about whether we were feeding the stage mothers' desire for attention, or about the insensitivity in taping and televising children in the middle of a meltdown or temper tantrum. But whether you think child beauty pageants are just a chance for little girls to play dress-up, or a training ground for superficial, self-centered princesses in the making, everyone should agree that sexualizing a 3-year-old little girl is wrong. In what was likely a misguided effort to gin up publicity and ratings for the show, TLC released footage of a 3-year-old contestant dressed as the prostitute played by Julia Roberts in the 1990 film ""Pretty Woman."" This stupidity came just one week after TLC -- still known to many as The Learning Channel -- was forced to pull its Facebook page because of the deluge of negative comments over an episode that featured a little girl dressed up to look like Dolly Parton, complete with padded bust and buttocks. Instead of creating ratings-friendly buzz, TLC engendered outrage among millions of parents and grandparents, who are tired of seeing children exploited for ratings and robbed of their innocence by a greedy entertainment industry that will stop at nothing to make a buck. Like Roberts' film character just before she hits the streets, the toddler is shown strutting back and forth on stage wearing thigh-high PVC boots, a blond bobbed wig, and a white tank top connected to a tight blue skirt at the midriff by a large silver hoop. Common sense is all too often a casualty of the media culture we live in. Parents assume the sexual content and innuendo in the programming they are watching will go over their child's head, or think it's cute to dress their child in sexy clothes or encourage her to imitate Beyonce's dance moves so they can post it on YouTube. In reality, they are teaching their children what kind of behavior will help them get noticed. For years we've seen adult sexuality being inappropriately and aggressively foisted on innocent young children, but kids today are being sexualized at younger and younger ages. A decade ago, parents worried about their teen daughters coming home from the mall with hip-riders. Now parents have to combat marketing forces that are telling their third-graders they need to have a padded push-up bikini top, or their second-graders that they need to have shoes that promote fitness, but are the same shoes sold to adults to tone and shape buttocks and thighs. Where does it all stop? What have we come to when toddlers, not yet able to read, let alone make decisions for themselves, are getting schooled in dressing and acting sexy for adults? Everyone in society suffers when children are sexualized, but those hurt worst are the children themselves. In February 2007, the American Psychological Association released a report on the sexualization of girls that found that girls' exposure to hypersexualized media content can negatively impacts their cognitive and emotional development; is strongly associated with eating disorders, low self-esteem and depression; leads to fewer girls pursuing careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics; and causes diminished sexual health. But it's not just our daughters who are being affected by these images. Boys and adult men are also learning to value women only for their sex appeal, which the report says can lead to increased incidents of sexual harassment and sexual violence, and increased demand for child pornography. TLC's official ""no comment"" response to a question from CNN about the outrage is ridiculous. Executives are not only complicit in the act of sexualizing toddlers, they are unwilling to own up to their role in encouraging this kind of behavior. The product that TLC, a mainstream cable television network, is selling is sexed-up toddlers. They should be ashamed, and parents across the country should renew their commitment to teach their children that they are valued for who they are, not for how sexy they look. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Henson.","Melissa Henson: TLC's ""Toddlers and Tiaras"" promotes sexualization of toddlers, girls .

"(CNN) -- The number of China's so-called ""baby hatches"" -- places where mothers can leave newborn babies anonymously -- is set to increase as the government tries to protect more of the country's abandoned infants. The hatches, which were first introduced in Shijiazhuang, the capital of China's northeastern Hebei province in 2011, consist of a temperature-controlled room equipped with a baby's cradle and an incubator. Once dropped off anonymously, an alarm is sounded and a welfare worker attends to the child minutes later. There are currently 25 baby hatches in 10 provinces across China, and the China Center for Children's Welfare and Adoption (CCCWA) told state media agency Xinhua that more will be set up, in a further 18 regions. A Mr. Zhou from the Beijing Civil Affairs Department told CNN that they plan to open a baby hatch within the year and the project is one of the department's top priorities. Children are often given up due to disability or severe illness -- largely to parents without the necessary means to provide for their offspring -- and historically, due to the sex of the child in a country where boys are traditionally favored and strict one-child policies have put pressure on families to produce male heirs. While statistics point to a largely even split between boys and girls, almost all the infants given up at baby hatches suffer from disabilities or severe illness. Proponents of the system say that the ""baby safety islands"", as they are officially known in China, significantly reduce the mortality rates of abandoned babies, providing a safe, warm environment with immediate care and improving on the wretched conditions that infants are often left in. According to the code of conduct released by Ministry of Civil Affairs, the facilities should issue an announcement to look for the baby's parents. The baby will be adopted into a child welfare institution -- a state orphanage -- if it is not claimed by parents or legal guardians after the announcement has expired. The baby hatch system is not without its detractors, however. Some in the country criticize the policy, saying that it could encourage parents to give up unwanted infants. The practice is also used in various countries around the world, including in Europe. In countries like Germany ""babyklappe"" are also considered controversial -- and inhabiting a legal gray area thanks to new laws that protect children's rights to know their mother's identity -- but have been used relatively infrequently. Since opening in late January, a baby hatch in the southern city of Guangzhou has received almost 80 infants, according to a Xinhua report cited in the party-funded English-language People's Daily. A China National Radio report said a baby hatch in Nanjing was ""crowded with visitors."" The owner of a nearby convenience store told CNR that she saw parents drop babies off at the facility every day. Li Bo, head of the CCCWA, says that there is no evidence to show that baby hatches lead to an increase in child abandonment, and that the service should be viewed as a practical move. ""Laws emphasize prevention, while baby hatches focus on rescue after the laws are broken,"" he said. The original baby hatch in Shijiazhuang reported a comparable number of infants abandoned in 2009-10 to that recorded since the service was established in June 2011. ""I don't think the baby hatches would encourage people to abandon their babies,"" population expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Fuxian Yi said.""Nanjing is an individual case. The story has been exaggerated. Its impact is waiting to be seen, it's too soon to judge."" The efficacy of the baby hatches aside, the number of abandoned infants in China does, for some critics, point to deficiencies in China's welfare system, especially for children born with illnesses or disabilities. A comprehensive system that goes far beyond the immediate care offered by baby hatches should be a priority, according to Tong Lihua, who runs a Beijing legal aid and study center for adolescents. ""We need a comprehensive system to better protect them,"" he is quoted as saying. CCCWA's Li says a medical insurance system, reinforcing other support mechanisms, should be implemented. Recent moves to relax China's strict one-child policy may also positively affect abandonment numbers in the country. The program is attracting debate on Chinese social media as well. ""It's good for the babies, but the most important issue now is where would they go when they grow up,"" said one Sina Weibo user. ""Is it a sign to legal[ize] abandoning babies?"" asked another. CNN's Dayu Zhang contributed to this report .","China's ""baby hatches"" provide a safe environment for people to anonymously abandon infants .

"(CNN) -- When she was America's top diplomat, Hillary Clinton acknowledged that negotiating with the Taliban for Bowe Bergdahl's release ""would be hard to swallow for many Americans,"" according to a copy of her upcoming book, ""Hard Choices,"" which was obtained by CBS News. In other foreign policy matters, Clinton writes how she pushed for arming Syrian rebels and also highlights her differences with President Barack Obama on the high-stakes issue. She also said that she regretted her 2002 vote in support of U.S. military action in Iraq. Also in her book, set to hit bookshelves on Tuesday, Clinton dishes on the 2008 campaign against Obama, her feelings about Sarah Palin, and her role in planning her daughter's 2010 wedding. Clinton was skeptical of Bergdahl release . On Bergdahl, the former secretary of state writes that the Taliban's ""top concern seemed to be the fate of its fighters being held at Guantanamo Bay and other prisons."" ""In every discussion about prisoners, we demanded the release of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who had been captured in 2009. There would not be any agreement about prisoners without the sergeant coming home,"" she writes, according to the excerpts. ""I acknowledged, as I had many times before, that opening the door to negotiations with the Taliban would be hard to swallow for many Americans after so many years of war,"" she added. Former officials told CNN earlier this week that Clinton was skeptical of early plans to trade Taliban prisoners, which the Obama administration ultimately did to win Bergdahl's release last week. A measured defense of release . On Monday, Clinton was asked whether she would have approved the same deal for five Taliban commanders who had been held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She did not directly answer the question and offered a measured defense of the Obama administration. ""We do have a tradition and I ascribe to it,"" Clinton said. ""We try not to leave any of our soldiers on the field. We try to make sure, insofar as possible, you know, we bring them home."" Republicans have been blasting the Obama administration for the prisoner exchange, saying the President set a dangerous precedent by negotiating with terrorists. Clinton left the State Department at the start of last year and is weighing another bid for the White House. 'I still got it wrong' on Iraq . On the Iraq War, Clinton writes she wish she hadn't voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq in 2002. ""As the war dragged on, with every letter I sent to a family in New York who had lost a son or daughter, a father or mother, my mistake become (sic) more painful,"" she writes, according to excerpts posted online by CBS. ""I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had. And I wasn't alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong. Plain and simple,"" she said. It's not the first time she's expressed regret, but it's some of the strongest language she's used on the issue. Clinton's vote became a key topic in her marathon 2008 battle with Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination. The issue, more than the economy, dominated the early parts of the campaign, with Obama criticizing Clinton over the vote. Clinton at first refused to term it a mistake, but later said during the campaign that she would not have voted the same way. Obama, who was a major opponent of the war, never had to vote on whether to authorize military action against Saddam Hussein, as he was not elected to the Senate until 2004. Clinton rarely talks about her vote on Iraq and in the last few months, as she has crisscrossed the country speaking to a wide array of audiences, she has not been asked about it. Conflict in Syria . In the book, Clinton describes the bloody three-year long civil war in Syria as ""a wicked problem."" Clinton goes on to say that's ""a term used by planning experts to describe particularly complex challenges that confound standard solutions and approaches. Wicked problems rarely have a right answer; in fact, part of what makes them wicked is that every option appears worse than the next. Increasingly that's how Syria appeared."" On whether to arm the Syrian rebels, a contentious issue, Clinton writes that ""I returned to Washington reasonably confident that if we decided to begin arming and training moderate Syrian rebels, we could put in place effective coordination with our regional partners."" Clinton says there was no good policy action for the United States, and she highlights were she and Obama disagreed on the conflict. ""[T]he risks of both action and inaction were high. Both choices would bring unintended consequences. The President's inclination was to stay the present course and not take the significant further step of arming rebels. ""No one likes to lose a debate, including me. But this was the President's call and I respected his deliberations and decision. From the beginning of our partnership, he had promised me that would always get a fair hearing. And I always did. In this case, my position didn't prevail,"" Clinton writes. Although as Clinton backed Obama's Syria policy as secretary of state - including negotiating with the international community on the civil war and criticizing countries like Russia and China, which stood in the way of toppling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Clinton's writings now show the level with which she split with Obama on arming the rebels. When asked about Syria at events during her time on the paid speaking circuit, Clinton has used identically language to describe the conflict. At an April event in Boston, Clinton told an audience of women leaders that the conflict was a ""wicked problem"" that ""really requires a broad base of knowledge."" ""It doesn't mean you're not incensed, heartsick, angry,"" Clinton told the audience at Simmons College. ""But then you need to stop and say 'well, what can we do about it? How can we intervene in a way that helps, not hurts?'"" Obama, Sarah Palin, and Chelsea . Clinton also takes readers into her private meeting with Obama prior to the 2008 Democratic convention, which gave the former rivals an opportunity ""to clear the air,"" Clinton writes. ""We stared at each other like two teenagers on an awkward first date, taking a few sips of Chardonnay,"" she writes of the meeting. ""One silver lining of defeat was that I came out of the experience realizing I no longer cared so much about what the critics said about me,"" she said. Clinton also dishes on the Obama campaign's reaction to then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's selection as Sen. John McCain's running mate, and why she declined to follow the Obama campaign's playbook on slamming the pick. While the campaign issued a ""dismissive statement"" and urged Clinton to do the same, the then-senator from New York writes that she declined. ""I wouldn't. I was not going to attack Palin just for being a woman appealing for support from other women,"" Clinton writes. ""I didn't think it made political sense, and it didn't feel right. So I said no."" Hitting a lighter note, Clinton's memoir also discusses the ""urgent business"" she had to address during her tenure as secretary of state - her daughter's wedding. Flying back from Vietnam in the summer of 2010, Clinton had to shift her attention from rising tensions in the South China Sea to ""one of the most important events of my life."" ""This time it wasn't a high-level summit or a diplomatic crisis. It was my daughter's wedding, a day I had been looking forward to for thirty years,"" Clinton writes. ""I felt lucky that my day job had prepared me for the elaborate diplomacy required to help plan a big wedding."" Clinton writes that she was happy to help in any way she could and her responsibilities ranged from ""reviewing photographs of flower arrangements"" and heading home for tastings and dress selections. As for the former president? ""Bill was as emotional as I was, maybe even more so, and I was just glad he made it down the aisle in one piece,"" Clinton writes. As Chelsea Clinton and her father danced to ""The Way You Look Tonight,"" Hillary Clinton's head swirled with thoughts. ""It was one of the happiest and proudest moments of my life,"" Clinton writes. ""Our family had been through a lot together, good times and hard times, and now here we were, celebrating the best of times.""

"(CNN) -- Gwyneth Paltrow and BeyoncÃ© can now claim to be the most beautiful BFFs in the world. On Wednesday, People magazine named Paltrow the World's Most Beautiful Woman for 2013, a year after Paltrow's pal BeyoncÃ© held the title. ""I honestly thought someone was playing a joke on me,"" Paltrow told People about her reaction when she first heard she landed the top spot. ""I had to reread the e-mail three times. I was like, 'This can't be true, I've developed dyslexia -- I'm not reading this right.' It's a very iconic cover in American culture, so it's just amazing."" For the ""Iron Man 3"" actress, her beauty is most evident when she's just being herself. ""Around the house, I'm in jeans and a T-shirt. I don't really wear makeup,"" Paltrow told the magazine, adding that that's how her two kids, Apple and Moses, are used to seeing her. The star's husband, Coldplay's Chris Martin, even teases her about it. ""If I've gotten fully dressed up, he'll be like, 'Oh, wow! You're Gwyneth Paltrow!' Because he's used to seeing me in like baggy shorts and frizzy hair,"" she said. But at 40, Paltrow said her definition of what it means to be beautiful has changed. ""I feel my most beautiful when I am truly myself. Meaning, when I accept exactly where I am in time and space, and I'm not judging myself in any way, and I feel that I have the peace that comes with loving yourself and all of your flaws,"" she told People.

The actress credits the Tracy Anderson Method for helping her ""look younger and feel strong,"" but she's more focused on helping her daughter Apple, 8, build a healthy body image. ""When we're home sometimes, she'll put on mascara. And sometimes I'll let her wear something out to dinner -- but just a little dab,"" Paltrow told People. ""Also having a father who adores you the way that he adores her is very good for your body image. The more we can love her and let her be who she is, the more confident she'll feel.""

"Madrid (CNN) -- Years on the run as a suspected member of the feared ""Pink Panthers"" gang of international jewel thieves have ended for a Serbian man who's been arrested in a Madrid suburb, Spanish police said Wednesday. Police say Borko Ilincic, 33, took part in a bold robbery of a jewelry store in Dubai in 2007, when thieves drove two cars inside a shopping mall by the store. Spanish police said that robbery netted 3 million euros ($4 million) in jewels, but the international police agency Interpol says ""the gang made away with jewelry worth an estimated 11 million ($15 million)."" Spanish police say Ilincic is a suspected member of the Pink Panthers gang. Interpol, which had him on its wanted list, says the Pink Panthers are ""behind armed robberies targeting high-end jewelry stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the United States."" Police in Britain named the gang the ""Pink Panthers"" after the famed movie in which a thief steals the so-called Pink Panther jewel and hides it in a face cream jar to elude detection. In London, a diamond ring stolen in a May 2003 store robbery was hidden in a jar of face cream, and the gang's nickname was born, an Interpol spokeswoman said by phone from the group's headquarters in France. Ilincic is facing a life sentence in the United Arab Emirates for the 2007 jewel heist. Spanish police have been on the trail of Pink Panther suspects, and they zeroed in on Ilincic in the town of Alcala de Henares near Madrid. He was arrested Tuesday while driving a rented car after leaving a hotel, police said. Interpol says the Pink Panthers are a ""loosely-aligned network of criminals believed to have carried out robberies in excess of 300 million euros ($448 million) since 1999. Hundreds of suspects are linked to more than 340 robberies in 35 countries."" ""The Pink Panthers' methods are daring and quick. ... Many gang members are known to originate from the former Yugoslavia, but they work across countries and continents,"" Interpol says on its website. Spanish police released video of the 2007 robbery at the Dubai shopping mall that showed a frightened store employee hiding behind a door while a hooded man, in another room, smashed glass windows to steal jewels. Afterward, the thieves ran to their cars parked inside the shopping mall and sped away. The police footage also shows scenes of the arrest this week in Madrid. A Spanish police spokesman said Madrid officers don't know if the hooded man in the robbery video is Ilincic.","Borko Ilincic, a 33-year-old Serbian man, has been arrested in a Madrid suburb .

"Oakland, California (CNN) -- ""What is it like to bury both of my kids?"" Dinyal New's voice trails off, unable to continue. She sits in the same pew of her church, listening to the same pastor on the same subject -- the loss of a child. Her two boys, Lee and Lamar, were shot to death, 19 days apart, young victims of Oakland, California's relentless street violence. With a population of nearly 400,000, Oakland has long been known as a Bay Area pocket of urban violence. Its proximity to drug corridors and high poverty are fertile breeding grounds for gang violence. Nearby San Francisco and Silicon Valley are routinely named ""Most Innovative Cities in America,"" yet Oakland makes it on very different lists with one of the highest gang homicide rates and robbery levels in the country. Last year, Oakland police touted a 28% drop in murders, the biggest reduction in homicides since 2004. After two years of rising death tolls, Oakland's police chief credited the drop in homicides -- from 131 in 2012 to 90 in 2013 -- to the city's violence reduction strategy which targets the most violent gangs. But because of Oakland's size, its reduced homicide rate still makes it one of the most dangerous cities in the country, with a murder every four days. After riots, California city gets new police chief . New's youngest son, Lee Weathersby III, died on January 1, Oakland's first murder of 2014. A gunman approached the 13-year-old on New Year's Eve as he walked home from the Boys and Girls Club, and shot him 28 times. Teachers, family members and others who knew him best say Lee wasn't in a gang. The eighth grader loved to play drums in band. Neighbors said Lee was a good boy. He stayed at home playing video games or hung out at the Boys and Girls Club, while his single mother worked as a social worker. It's unclear why Lee was targeted. Surveillance video turned over to Oakland police shows him walking down the street, his youth apparent in his gait. He was walking home from the bus stop. Usually he called his mom to pick him up, but his cell phone battery had died. On the video, his mother says you can see a gunman approach, carrying a semi-automatic rifle. Minority kids impacted by zero-tolerance laws . Dinyal New was at home, watching local news of the aftermath of another shooting in her neighborhood. The report showed video of a gurney being loaded into an ambulance, with the on-screen graphic, ""Teen shot."" She'd seen it hundreds of times -- just another kid shot in Oakland. Hours later, she rushed to the hospital with her oldest son Lamar where she was called to identify Lee's body. She looked up at a television in the waiting room and saw the local news report again. This time it hit her: it was Lee in that news report, his body being loaded into the ambulance. ""Thirteen years old. Just a baby, just a baby."" Another son gunned down . Lamar Broussard had started straightening out his life after occasional run-ins with the law, including a stint in juvenile detention. The 19-year-old had been taking classes at the local community college. He was close to his younger brother, Lee -- so close that the two still slept together in the same bed. After Lee's death, Dinyal New worried about Lamar. Her youngest son, who was never in trouble, had clearly been a target. Was it a message to Lamar? Fearing for her older son's safety, New asked Lamar to leave Oakland. But with the bravado of youth, Lamar convinced his mother he was safe. After losing Lee, New wanted to get back into a routine, back to her career as a case worker for the homeless, but says she was exhausted by her grief. Then, three days after Lee's funeral, on January 19, she asked Lamar to run an errand for her, to pay her cell phone bill. He was two blocks from home when friends started calling her phone. There had been gunfire in the neighborhood, they told her. New ran towards the corner, and spotted the yellow police tape. ""I see my son's car shot up. And I just broke down crying."" She couldn't approach the car. She could see from 20 yards away what had happened. ""The suspect stood on top of the car and just shot into the car. Just shot into the car."" She called Lamar repeatedly from her cell phone. ""He never answered. He never answered."" There was no logic in it, she says, because she already knew in her heart that Lamar was gone. In 19 days, Dinyal New went from a mother of two, to a mother of none. Oakland police will not say whether the murders of Dinyal's sons are gang-related, but because they are brothers, police say their deaths ""are possibly related."" New's horror may be extraordinary, but losing a child to gun violence is a common experience in Oakland, says Naomi Harry. ""This city is full of mourning mothers,"" she says. Harry's son was shot on a city bus, coming home from school. He survived. Alicia Waters' son Jamal Waters was not so lucky. He was shot and killed on Oakland's streets six years ago. His murder is still unsolved. Burying your child defies the natural order, says Waters. But she says it's normal in Oakland. ""It's beyond sickening to me,"" says Waters. ""No parent should ever, ever have to bury their kids. Especially like this. This is crazy. I can no longer see mothers bury their kids anymore. I just can't."" Waters drops her head, the tears still fresh six years after she buried her son. Trying to make a difference . Todd Walker thinks of himself as the mop-up man to Oakland's violence. He often picks up the bodies of young African-American men lost to gun violence, after the coroner's work is complete. He plugs the bullet holes with plastic screws so the fluid doesn't stain the white satin of the casket, so mothers can see their sons one last time. Walker estimates he's put a few hundred children, or ""babies"" as he calls them, into caskets. He picked up both Lee and Lamar's bodies on his gurney. ""I'm tired of it,"" says Walker, 52. ""I'm the one who sees them firsthand at the coroner's office. I'm the one who's got to identify them right off the top. The mother's calling you: How does their kid look? Sometimes ... the kid's been shot up so bad they can't even identify them. It's real sad."" Walker held Dinyal New's hand as she picked out her second casket this month. He's done this hundreds of times -- but still finds himself at a loss for words. ""Ain't too much you can say to her. It's horrible."" A life-long East Bay resident, Walker also coaches Pop Warner football for the neighborhood boys. When he started picking up the bodies of the very boys he coached, Walker pledged to try and make a difference. He began inviting children and their parents into the MWJ Mortuary funeral home and walked them through the embalming process. During these tours, in which he hopes to show young people the sober reality of life on the streets, Walker opens up the empty caskets and closes the lid on the children. ""That's how it ends,"" he tells the visitors. His program, which he now calls Restoring Inner City Peace, or R.I.P., has proven so popular that teachers now invite him to schools. For classroom visits, which can be for children as young as kindergarten, Walker brings body bags and zips the children inside. His message is always the same: There is nothing romantic about guns and street life -- only finality and darkness. ""Gun violence is a regular, everyday thing. There's shooting everyday. All these kids do not have an education, but they have a gun. And there's something wrong with that picture. ... To me, the city is failing these kids,"" he says. Walker says that even the horror of Dinyal New's story will fade after Lamar is buried. ""A month or two from now, it'll be over with,"" he says. ""We'll be talking about something different. That's how it goes, year after year."" Still, New is trying to make Lamar's service special. She's decorating the program in his favorite colors, green and white. She's asked their god-sister to read at the service. ""I need to bury him right. I need to do a good job,"" she says. New can make it through today. The family and the neighborhood will fill the church. She'll have plenty of support for Lamar's funeral. But tomorrow? She'll be alone.","Dinyal New buried her only two children last month .

"(CNN) -- A major international environmental group has pulled out of the process to guarantee that diamonds do not come from conflict zones, saying the Kimberley Process had refused ""to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds, violence and tyranny."" So why are so-called ""conflict diamonds"" so controversial? What are conflict diamonds? Conflict or ""blood"" diamonds are illegally traded to fund conflict in war-torn areas, particularly in central and western Africa, according to the World Diamond council, which represents the commercial diamond trade. The United Nations defines conflict diamonds as ""...diamonds that originate from areas controlled by forces or factions opposed to legitimate and internationally recognized governments, and are used to fund military action in opposition to those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the Security Council."" They are generally in ""rough"" form, meaning they have recently been extracted and not yet cut. At the height of the civil war in Sierra Leone, it is estimated that conflict diamonds represented approximately four percent of the world's diamond production. Who suffers? Apart from the innocent people caught up in the conflicts that the trade fuels, thousands of men, women and children in countries such as Sierra Leone are used as slaves to extract diamonds. They are often forced to use primitive, back-breaking methods such as digging into mud or gravel along river banks with their bare hands. The collected material is then separated using hand-held sieves. What is the Kimberley Process? The Kimberley Process started when Southern African diamond-producing states met in Kimberley, South Africa, in May 2000, to discuss ways to stop the trade in conflict diamonds and ensure that diamond purchases were not funding violence. The result was an agreement by the United Nations, European Union, the governments of 74 countries, the World Diamond Council -- representing the industry -- and a number of interest groups such as Global Witness. They established the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS), whereby members are required to certify that all rough diamond exports are produced through legitimate mining and sales activities and are ""conflict-free."" Each shipment carries a certificate that details where the diamonds came from, how they were mined, where they were cut and polished, the parties involved, and their ultimate destination. The idea is that members of the Kimberley Process cannot trade with non-members. Is it working? According to Amy Barry of Global Witness, the Kimberley Process has yet to demonstrate itself capable of stopping the trade because of a lack of political will among member states. ""Zimbabwe, for example, is a test case for the KP,"" she told CNN in 2010, alleging that Robert Mugabe's regime has benefited from the sale of blood diamonds despite it being a member of the Kimberley Process. She said the huge Marange diamond fields of eastern Zimbabwe are operated by military-run syndicates who beat or kill miners who don't mine for them or pay bribes. The extreme violence perpetrated by the military even included the mass murder of hundreds of miners by helicopter gunships, she added. But with just one or two member states able to veto any punitive action against abuses or infringements of the KP scheme, no decisive action has been taken against Zimbabwe. ""This consensus decision-making means tough decisions don't get made,"" said Barry. ""Certain countries are putting economic and political interests in front of defending the fundamental principles of the scheme."" Is the ""conflict trade"" limited to diamonds? No. According to Global Witness, rebel fighters and army units have hijacked the trade in mineral ores, used in the production of mobile phones and computers, from eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while subjecting the local population to massacres, rape, extortion, and forced labor. The ""conflict minerals"" are then laundered into the global supply chain by export houses, before being transformed into refined metals by large international smelting firms. Global Witness says the operations of some of the world's leading consumer brands are now being scrutinized for evidence of links to this rogue trade.","Group pulls out of process to guarantee diamonds do not come from conflict zones .

"(CNN) -- Made in Africa is not something you hear about very often. But Tal Dehtiar is trying to change that with his business, Oliberte, which he says is the first international company to market casual shoes made entirely in Africa. A Native-born Canadian, Dehtiar is one of a growing number of social entrepreneurs who want to do good while doing well. He launched his company two years ago, with an aim to make -- and sell -- shoes for the fashionista with a conscience. ""For that man or woman between 25 to 45 that says 'I want to look good, I want quality, but I want to stand for something as well,'"" Dehtiar said. Standing for something is Dehtiar's stock-in-trade but it hasn't always endeared him to the business community. Last year he appeared, for the second time, on Canadian TV show ""Dragon's Den,"" on which entrepreneurs attempt to win funding for their business ideas from the show's panel of investors. Dehtiar was trying to woo investors to help with marketing costs for his fledgling company. For a second time, he failed to clinch the deal. Kevin O'Leary, one of the panel of investors, told Dehtiar on the show: ""Last year when I met you, I thought you were going to zero ... I thought you were road pizza. Just a charity guy, didn't know how to run a business. ""Here you are, with half a mil in sales. That's great, but I'm out of sync with you on a huge issue. You're in a country where your costs are 130% more than where you could be in China. And you won't, for some reason that I don't understand, raise your prices to match your quality."" But Dehtiar remains clear about his goal: to sell affordable high quality shoes from a continent he says has major manufacturing potential. ""When I want people to think of Africa, related to manufacturing footwear, I don't want them looking at it as another low cost producer -- 'Oh it's the next China' -- cheap labor,"" he said. ""If you want to do that, stay in China or stay wherever's low cost. If you want quality footwear, if you want to pay people right, if you want to treat them with respect, use good product, then come to Africa,"" he added. Dehtiar didn't secure any investors for his company on TV, but in real life his vision is starting to attract attention. At the ""PROJECT"" trade show in New York City, buyers from popular stores like Urban Outfitters and high-end boutiques showed interest in selling Oliberte's wares. ""A lot of times, consumers don't know where anything comes from or how it's affecting anybody,"" said Xenia Viray, a buyer for the Upper West Side boutique store Tani. ""More importantly, the shoes just look really good."" Industry expert Andrew Pollard said: ""What he's doing is he's forging new ground. Where most people in the industry would never even know that Africa is a viable place to manufacture, he's showing that it is."" As the company grows, Dehtiar hopes he's helping shore up a much-underdeveloped middle class. Currently Oliberte employs around six workers in Ethiopia, which is famous for its leather. And this year he hopes to train and work with up to 50 workers in Liberia, a hot spot for rubber. Oliberte cannot dictate how much the local African factories pay their workers. Instead, Dehtiar says he can, and does, work with them to do the right thing. ""We make sure they pay at minimum the minimum wage with the understanding that as we grow as a company, they're committed to improving their conditions, whether it's through (initiatives such as) health insurance programs ... now all the factories provide maternity leave programs to all the women,"" he said. And it seems Dehtiar is not the only one convinced that providing decent jobs and making high-quality footwear can go hand in hand. When New York City shoe store owner David Zaken heard about Oliberte, he immediately put in an order. ""In the United States, 87% of all footwear are made in China, and when I saw them at the trade show and it's made in Ethiopia, I thought wow! What a noble, what a great thing to do and I jumped on it and supported it right away,"" Zaken said. Oliberte is growing. The company has gone from selling 200 pairs of shoes in 2009 to a projected 18,000 this year. But whether it can sustain the growth, keep the price point low and continue to employ workers at higher wages than its Chinese counterparts will, ultimately, be the test.","Oliberte says it's the first international company to market casual shoes made in Africa .

"(CNN) -- Feminism's gotten a bad rap lately. For many, even just the word itself conjures up images of radical ideology. Pop music star Taylor Swift and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, to cite two famous examples, asserted that they're pro-equality, but won't identify as feminists. Explaining her position in February of this year, Mayer noted that she didn't have the ""militant drive"" or ""chip on her shoulder"" that comes with feminism. I'm not particularly militant, nor do I have a chip on my shoulder (I hope), but I get my share of weird reactions nonetheless. See, not only am I feminist, I'm a male feminist. People aren't always sure what to do with that. ""You're a man. Isn't that a contradiction?"" ""Wait, are men allowed to be feminists?"" ""Are you even a man at all?"" As far as I know, men are absolutely allowed to be feminists. And when I declare that I'm a feminist, I should explain what that word means to me. My feminism is a simple belief in equality. I'm a feminist because I believe that men and women are and should be equal, but we're not treated equally right now. We see it in a distorted conception of female beauty, we see it in dehumanizing portrayals of women in film and on television, and we see it when the response to rape all too often isn't support, but consists of loud cries of ""she was asking for it!"" and ""her skirt was really short!"" The basic sexism undergirding our world is so pervasive that I (and others) have grown up with it and see it at every stage of our lives. From the much-discussed pay gap to constant street harassment to denying of basic rights to women and girls, we see it everywhere. I'll never forget the meeting I was in a few years ago because the visitors to our office never made eye contact with my female manager. I'll wager that they thought, perhaps unconsciously, that because I was a man, I was the boss. As an incredibly junior staffer, that was a wildly inaccurate assumption. Some counter that men and women used to be unequal, but we're passed that. A few even foolishly assert that this increasing focus on equalizing the playing field has spelled the ""end of men."" And there's no doubt that we've made progress: in area after area, in country after country, we can point to some concrete signs that with advocacy and hard work, we're slowly getting closer to gender equality. But for many women, this progress doesn't mean that sexism's gone, it just means that it's different. As E.J. Graff, writing for ""The American Prospect,"" describes, for a lot of folks, sexism isn't a ""deadly cancer [anymore]; rather, it's a steady low-grade fever that wears you down by degrees."" It's the hostile work environment that makes you feel unwelcome, it's the strange sports metaphors that don't resonate with everyone equally, it's the deferral to men as ""authoritative"" while women must still walk the line to avoid both being viewed as ""passive"" while not crossing over into ""bossy"" territory. And even though sexism doesn't always cry out at the shrill pitch it once did, even though attacks on women can be increasingly subtle, men still have a crucial role to play. Not only do we help create the inequality, gender norms, and messages that hurt and objectify women, but critically, we suffer from its barbs as well. In a world that blames victims of rape, not rapists, our societies fundamentally don't value the humanity of half of us. In a world that pays women far less than men for the same work (or denies women the opportunity to work at all), we ignore the possible contributions of countless leaders and entrepreneurs. Hell, in a world that valorizes men who sleep around while shaming and seeking to control female sexual power, relationships of all kinds are stunted by false, inhuman understandings of who and what men and women are. Sexism doesn't just hurt women, it breaks our very humanity. And ultimately, that's why I'm a feminist. Because women deserve to be treated as equal human beings, and it hurts every single one of us when that's not the case. And until we get a more equal world, I'll claim that title of ""feminist"" proudly and shout it from the rooftops. I'll try not to get a chip on my shoulder, though. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Brougher.","Male feminist John Brougher says feminism conjures images of radical ideology .

"(CNN) -- WikiLeaks has published a secret U.S. diplomatic cable listing places the United States considers vital to its national security, prompting criticism that the website is inviting terrorist attacks on American interests. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the disclosure ""gives a group like al Qaeda a targeting list."" The sites are included in a lengthy cable the State Department sent in February 2009 to its posts around the world, asking American diplomats to identify installations overseas ""whose loss could critically impact the public health, economic security, and/or national and homeland security of the United States."" The diplomats identified dozens of places on every continent, including mines, manufacturing complexes, ports and research establishments. CNN is not publishing specific details from the list, which refers to pipelines and undersea telecommunications cables as well as the location of minerals or chemicals critical to U.S. industry. The list also mentions dams close to the U.S. border and a telecommunications hub whose destruction might seriously disrupt global communications. Diplomats also identified sites of strategic importance for supplying U.S. forces and interests abroad, such as in the Strait of Hormuz, the Persian Gulf and the Panama Canal. The cable is classified secret and not for review by non-U.S. personnel. The United States and Great Britain condemned the disclosure. ""There are strong and valid reasons for classifying vital information, including the identification of critical infrastructure that is important to not only our society and economy, but those of other countries,"" Crowley said Monday. ""Without discussing any particular cable, the release of this kind of information gives a group like al Qaeda a targeting list,"" he said. ""This is why we have condemned WikiLeaks for what it has done."" Later, on the microblogging site Twitter, Crowley said WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange -- now facing extradition to Sweden in connection with a rape investigation -- ""threatens to put others at risk to save his own hide."" British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement that the publication is ""damaging to national security in the United States, Britain and elsewhere."" And Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee in Britain, said the list was ""a gift to any terrorist (group) trying to work out what are the ways in which it can damage the United States."" ""It is grossly improper and irresponsible"" for Assange and his website to publish that information, he said. WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information, published the list of sensitive sites as part of a larger disclosure of what it says are 250,000 U.S. State Department documents that were never meant for public view. The site began publishing the first of those quarter-million documents last week. Since then, the site has been hit with denial-of-service attacks, which seek to make a website unavailable. It also has been kicked off servers in the United States and France, and it lost a major revenue source on Friday, when U.S.-based PayPal cut off its account. On Sunday, WikiLeaks appealed to supporters worldwide to mirror its website, saying the site ""is under heavy attack. In order to make it impossible to ever fully remove WikiLeaks from the Internet, we need your help."" In a message sent on Twitter on Monday, WikiLeaks said it had several hundred mirror sites -- websites at other online addresses that have the same content as WikiLeaks. Assange, 39, is wanted by Swedish authorities on allegations of sex crimes, including rape. He has denied the allegations, but his whereabouts have been undisclosed since WikiLeaks began publishing the documents last week. Investigators have focused much of their effort on finding Assange in Britain, where U.S. investigative activity is being conducted by the Defense Department, a senior law enforcement official said Friday.","NEW: State Department blasts WikiLeaks for publishing list .

"(CNN) -- Penn State University President Rodney Erickson tried to distance the school from the sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the campus as he spoke to angry alumni Thursday night. ""It grieves me very much when I hear people say 'the Penn State scandal.' This is not Penn State. This is the (Jerry) Sandusky scandal,"" Erickson said. The town hall meeting in a hotel in suburban Philadelphia comes the same day Penn State revealed it is paying long-time coach Joe Paterno as if he retired at the end of the season, even though the university relieved him of his coaching duties on November 9. During the meeting, most of the questions revolved around the firing of Paterno. Crowds booed Erickson several times. In a statement earlier Thursday, the chairman and vice chairman of the board of trustees said Paterno was removed as head football coach because he ""could not be expected to continue to effectively perform his duties"" amid sexual abuse allegations involving Sandusky, a former defensive coordinator. ""Coach Paterno remains employed by the university as a tenured faculty member,"" said the statement by board Chairman Steve Garban and Vice Chairman John Surma. ""The details of his retirement are being worked out and will be made public when they are finalized. Generally speaking, the university intends to honor the terms of his employment contract and is treating him financially as if he had retired at the end of the 2011 football season."" Some university students, former players for the Nittany Lions and others were angered by the removal of Paterno, the 85-year-old coaching great who guided the team for 46 years and recorded the most wins in college football history. After Paterno's dismissal was announced in November, student protesters overturned a news van and vandalized streets around the campus before police dispersed them. Penn State was rocked by accusations that Sandusky had sexually abused young boys over 14 years and that school officials failed to take the complaints to police. University trustees dismissed Paterno and school President Graham Spanier after a grand jury report accused Sandusky of more than 50 counts of sexually abusing boys. Sandusky has pleaded not guilty to the charges. A Penn State graduate assistant, Mike McQueary, told the grand jury late last year that he had seen Sandusky ""with a boy in the shower and that it was severe sexual acts going on and that it was wrong and over the line."" He said he had gone to Paterno with what he saw. Paterno said he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report, but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss. After first saying he had done ""what I was supposed to do,"" Paterno said that ""with the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more."" It was years before law enforcement learned about the allegation. Then-Athletic Director Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president who oversaw campus police, now face charges of perjury and failing to report child sexual abuse. Journalist Sara Ganim contributed to this report .","'This is not Penn State. This is the Sandusky scandal,"" university president says .

"(CNN) -- Three hostages were rescued from the headquarters of the Discovery Channel in Silver Spring, Maryland, Wednesday afternoon after police shot and killed the man who was holding them, officials said. The hostages were unharmed, said Police Chief J. Thomas Manger of the Montgomery County Police Department. The suspect, identified by a law enforcement official as James Lee, earlier was in communication with authorities. A number of devices in backpacks that Lee held have to be rendered safe, Manger added. Manger said hostage negotiators negotiated for almost four hours by phone with Lee while police officers watched and listened to Lee on the building's surveillance system. ""At times during the negotiations, he was calm, but I wouldn't call him lucid. The conversation was indicative to me he was dealing with some mental issues,"" he said. iReport: Are you there? Send us news, videos . Manger said the three hostages were lying on the ground, but were not otherwise constrained. He said Lee mainly dealt with the hostage negotiators and did not communicate with the hostages. ""He stayed on point with his issues with Discovery,"" Manger said. At one point, one of the hostages moved, drawing Lee's attention, Manger said. Lee pulled his gun and aimed it at the hostages, and it was at that point that a sniper inside the building took the shot that killed Lee, he said. Another police official, Capt. Paul Starks, said the decision to shoot the gunman was made after authorities heard a gunshot or explosion go off in the area. As the police moved in, the hostages were running out, he said. Police believe, at least initially, that Lee was acting alone, Starks said. During the negotiations, Lee exhibited a ""range of emotions,"" Manger said. At times he was agitated and at times he was calm, but he never strayed far from his grievance against Discovery, he said. According to a police spokesman, the suspect entered the building's main entrance ""wearing what appeared to be metallic canister devices on his front and back. He also pulled a handgun out and was waving a handgun."" According to Manger, Lee may have fired a shot when he entered the building. The three hostages held inside were a security guard and two other males, he said. iReports: On the scene | More photos . Discovery Channel spokesman David Leavy said company officials were familiar with Lee, who had protested at the network in 2008, but the company ""did not take his threats or demands seriously."" During the standoff, fewer than 10 Discovery Channel employees remained in the building ""for a while, to assist law enforcement on navigating the building and the infrastructure and then we were all evacuated about an hour, 90 minutes into it,"" Leavy said. He added, ""Our hope and expectation is that tomorrow morning we will be open for business and we will be making great TV again."" Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Kevin Frazier said that before employees return to the building, authorities would search it for possible bombs. Lee was linked to a manifesto that was posted on the internet, a source close to the investigation told CNN. The angry manifesto repeatedly refers to humans as ""filth"" and demands that the Discovery Channel ""stop encouraging the birth of any more parasitic human infants."" ""Civilization must be exposed for the filth it is,"" the 1,149-word statement says. Starks said during the situation that Lee was making some demands, and that the suspect had ""concerns"" with Discovery Communications. A person at One Discovery Place, the channel's headquarters, called police about 1 p.m. to report a man with a gun and possible explosives, said Angela Cruz, a police spokeswoman. The area was evacuated, she said. A day care center inside One Discovery Place was emptied, and the children were moved temporarily to a nearby McDonald's restaurant, authorities said. Witnesses said some of the children were in cribs on wheels, and that people pushed the cribs out of the building to safety. iReport: Photos of cribs being moved . Most of the 1,900 employees of the building were evacuated, but ""a few"" apparently remained on the upper floors, Manger said during the standoff. Lori Rorke told CNN that she was on the second floor when she and her co-workers heard about the man. ""When we first heard the news, we heard that the gunman was mobile and we were told to go into locked offices,"" she said. ""We were really panicking, then trying to keep it under control."" But, she said, fellow workers carrying BlackBerry devices seemed to know what to do, and led her out of the building via a route that avoided the lobby. Street view of Discovery Channel headquarters . Lee was linked to the online screed, which said in part, ""Humans are the most destructive, filthy, pollutive creatures around and are wrecking what's left of the planet with their false morals and breeding culture."" The writer blasted immigration, farming, weapons of mass destruction, automotive pollution, ""and the whole blasted human economy."" He demanded that the Discovery Channel broadcast daily prime-time shows devoted to ""solutions to save the planet,"" perhaps in a game-show format, insisting, ""Make it interesting so people watch and apply solutions!!!!"" Many of the writer's comments were directed at ""the media,"" saying, ""You can reach enough people. It's your responsibility because you reach so many minds!!!"" Who is James Lee? ""The world needs TV shows that DEVELOP solutions to the problems that humans are causing, not stupify the people into destroying the world. Not encouraging them to breed more environmentally harmful humans,"" the manifesto says. ""These are the demands and sayings of Lee,"" the manifesto concludes. Aaron Morrissey, the editor-in-chief of the web publication DCist, said he came across James Lee's anti-Discovery Channel manifesto in 2008, when Lee was planning to hold a protest against the channel. Discovery programming and the hostage incident . The 2008 protest, he said, ""was not that well attended."" A month or so later, Lee was arrested near the building on littering and disorderly conduct charges, Morrissey said. The littering charge stemmed from Lee's throwing money into the air, he said. According to court records, a man with the same name and age as Lee was found guilty in 2008 of disorderly conduct. James Lee was acquitted of littering in the same case, according to Montgomery County, Maryland, Circuit Court records, said Eric Nee, a senior assistant state's attorney. Lee's two-year supervised probation ended August 18, records show. Because of the 2008 incident, a judge had warned Lee that year not to come within 500 feet of Discovery Communications, according to Maryland's Gazette newspaper.

"(CNN) -- Comedian Tracy Morgan is suing Walmart over a deadly limo bus crash on the New Jersey Turnpike that left him critically injured. The complaint was filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. Morgan, 45, suffered broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken leg in the crash in the early morning hours of June 7. His friend and fellow comedian James McNair was killed and others were injured. Morgan has been released from a rehabilitation center and will ""continue his recovery at home with an aggressive outpatient program,"" his representative, Lewis Kay, said Saturday. ""He asked me to pass along his sincerest gratitude to everyone who has helped him get to this point,"" Kay said. ""He would also appreciate some privacy during this crucial point in his recovery."" The Walmart truck that rear-ended Morgan's limo was traveling 20 mph over the speed limit and its driver was almost at his drive time limit, according to a preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board. According to the complaint filed by lawyers acting for Morgan and three others, the truck driven by Walmart employee Kevin Roper collided with the rear end of Morgan's vehicle. ""The defendants' negligence was a substantial contributing factor in causing plaintiffs' injuries,"" the complaint states. In a statement, Walmart said the crash had been a ""terrible tragedy"" and that it wished full recoveries to Morgan and two others injured with him, comedian Ardley Fuqua and Morgan's personal assistant Jeffrey Millea. The fourth plaintiff in the lawsuit is Millea's wife, Krista. ""Our thoughts continue to go out to them, their families and friends, as well as to the families and friends of everyone involved, including Mr. McNair who lost his life,"" the Walmart statement said. ""We are deeply sorry that one of our trucks was involved. As we've said, we're cooperating fully in the ongoing investigation. We know it will take some time to resolve all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident, but we're committed to doing the right thing for all involved."" Roper, from Jonesboro, Georgia, pleaded not guilty last month to criminal charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by auto. Kay said that Morgan didn't have any comment on the lawsuit. He referred all other questions to Morgan's lawyer, Benedict Morelli.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry issued a warning to women caught driving and anyone engaging in demonstrations Saturday, as activists have called on the country to defy a Saudi de facto ban on women driving. Without outlining how laws would be applied and what punishment might be doled out to offenders, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Mansour Al-Turki said, ""All violations will be dealt with -- whether demonstrations or women driving."" ""Not just on the 26th. Before and after,"" added Al-Turki. ""At all times."" Opinion: Give Saudi women the right to drive . Meanwhile, several Saudi women supporting the October 26th Women's Driving Campaign say they received threatening calls Thursday from men claiming to represent the Interior Ministry, according to women's rights activists who requested anonymity. The callers warned the women not to drive before, on or after Saturday, the activists said. Some of the activists expressed doubt that the callers were actually from the Interior Ministry. Originally, Al-Turki denied any calls were made, but he later contacted CNN to clarify his comments. He said the phone calls were a public relations move the ministry undertook to help some people understand a written statement made Wednesday. Saudi Arabia had released a statement that said, ""Laws will be fully enforced that day."" The statement, which was issued on Saudi Arabia's official news agency, also said, ""The laws of the Kingdom prohibit activities disturbing the public peace and opening venues to sedition."" Al-Turki told CNN that some women were contacted by the Interior Ministry and were asked to not drive. ""There was absolutely no threat to the women contacted. The communication was made to make sure the women understood the statement,"" he told CNN. ""It seemed some people did not understand the statement, and they expressed this publicly in one way or another."" Several supporters of the driving campaign said they didn't believe the government was aiming that statement at female drivers, but at those who might stage protests in a nation where they're outlawed. Saudi Arabia has tight controls on all gatherings. Al-Turki made it clear the statement applies to both parties. Activist Manal Al-Sharif, who now lives in the United Arab Emirates after being jailed for a week after posting a video of herself driving in 2011, took it as a positive sign that the government has stated its position on women driving. ""They kept telling the world that the women's driving issue was one for Saudi society to decide upon,"" she said. ""Society is now showing it is supportive of the idea of women driving. The government's reaction makes it very clear this is not a societal decision. This is a political decision."" She further characterized the government statement as ""clarity."" ""We've been in the dark for a long time. Now we're in the light and we know what we're facing,"" she said. Saudi blogger and opinion writer Tamador Alyami, a supporter of the campaign who recently posted a video showing her driving in the city of Jedda, noted that a Twitter account supporting Saudi political prisoners recently ""tweeted a message saying you have to take advantage of this day, that it's an opportunity to go out there and demonstrate and ask for the rights of the political prisoners."" No traffic law specifically prohibits women from driving in Saudi Arabia, but religious edicts there are often interpreted to mean women are not allowed to operate a vehicle. Saudi cleric warns driving could damage women's ovaries . In late September, an online movement was launched urging Saudi women to get behind the wheel. The October 26th Women's Driving Campaign quickly gained momentum, with its online petition having so far garnered more than 16,000 signatures. In addition, numerous Saudi women have already taken to the streets -- filming themselves driving in various cities, and then uploading those videos to YouTube. The language of the Interior Ministry's statement ""shows that it wasn't really about the 26th of October movement,"" Alyami said. ""They've known about this campaign for a few months and there's been no attempt to stop (it). If they've let it go this far, that should reassure us."" Indeed, many women who have been out driving report having been spotted by traffic police who haven't stopped them. Alyami said she drove her car again on Wednesday to her parents' house and passed two traffic policemen. ""One of the traffic policemen saw me and didn't stop me. I was scared, but when he just drove by and went away, I felt so happy, so reassured and more determined than ever to go out on the 26th."" Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch each issued a statement calling for an end to the ban. ""It's past time to address the country's systemic discrimination; driving could open roads to reform,"" said Rothna Begum, a researcher with Human Rights Watch. Saudi blogger detained, but she's hopeful about campaign to allow women to drive .","Interior Ministry says calls weren't meant as threats .

"Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming (CNN) -- It's hard not to stand in complete awe of everything the Earth has to offer when you're in the middle of Yellowstone National Park. Its most famous geyser, Old Faithful, shoots up into the sky as crowds tilt their heads just to see how high it really can go. The saturated blues and greens of geothermal pools appear to be otherworldly. Towering mountains wrap themselves around the park, providing shelter for wild animals to roam. But below the beauty of Yellowstone, is a volcano powerful enough devastate most of the United States and change the entire world. ""Yellowstone and other volcanoes around the world are called supervolcanoes and the reason is they're like a super sized drink. It means it's just big,"" says Hank Hessler, a geologist at Yellowstone in the U.S. state of Wyoming. Supervolcano describes a geological phenomenon never witnessed by man. Supervolcanoes are off the charts big when comparing them to a normal volcanic eruption. On May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens in the northwest corner of the United States erupted. It killed 57 people and expelled one cubic kilometer of ash. The first Yellowstone supervolcanic eruption 2.1 million years ago was at least 25,000 times larger than the Mount St. Helens eruption. Two other Yellowstone super eruptions 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago, though smaller than the first one, would still dwarf any normal volcanic eruption. You can monitor Yellowstone activity . Few would expect the tranquil national park would actually be sitting on the mouth of a sleeping giant. The physical characteristic of a supervolcano isn't a typical cone-shaped mountainous peak. Instead, supervolcanoes have what are called calderas. These are vast sunken areas that are formed after previous super eruptions as the ground was blown out and fell back to rest. Geophysicist Bob Smith first called Yellowstone a ""living breathing caldera"" in 1979. He now heads the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory at the University of Utah. ""Yellowstone has been very important. It's my laboratory,"" says Smith. He sees Yellowstone as more than a supervolcano, in fact he doesn't even like that term. ""I prefer to use the term hotspot because it reflects a zone of concentrated and active volcanism."" Hawaii and Iceland are other examples of hot spots, but Yellowstone is the only hot spot located underneath land rather than sea which has made it easier for Smith to study. His team has setup a series of different sensors around the park so that they can keep a close eye on its vital signs. They measure ground movement and record the frequent earthquakes that occur in the area. The sensors have also helped Smith's team figure out what they were dealing with. As little as eight kilometers below the surface is a shallow reservoir of solid rock and magma. And below the reservoir is an enormous 57,000-cubic-kilometer plume of very hot rock, the fuel behind every bubbling pool and geyser in Yellowstone. With all of this heat just sitting, waiting beneath Yellowstone, what exactly would it look like if it were all to blow? Smith and other scientists all have scenarios and every one is bleak. In Smith's book, ""Windows into the Earth,"" he says, ""Devastation would be complete and incomprehensible."" Before the super eruption, large earthquakes would likely swarm the surrounding areas until the huge blast that would erase Yellowstone completely off the map. After the initial eruption, clouds of gas and rock would burn everything in its path with temperatures reaching to hundreds of degrees Celsius. Ashfall would cover the western United States and also enter the jet stream with the potential to cripple air transportation and threaten the world's food supply. There are some estimates that 87,000 people would die immediately. You can imagine that with this kind of catastrophe on the line, the question Smith gets asked the most is, ""When is going to blow next?"" The three Yellowstone super eruptions have occurred about 800,000 years apart, so people have started to speculate that another one is due. Also, in 2004 Smith noticed that the ground had started to rise then lowered again in 2010. It was like the supervolcano was breathing. However, Smith says there is absolutely no need to panic. ""We create scenarios. We know roughly what to expect of the patterns of time and space of the earthquakes ground information. Again, acquired from other experiences around the world. We use that to interpret our own data in terms of what the potential threat or risk might be,"" says Smith. For him, the more immediate threat is earthquakes and smaller eruptions since the probability of one of those instances occurring is much higher. Whether that may be comforting or not, millions of visitors will still make their way each year to the geological wonderland that is Yellowstone National Park. Physicist Michio Kaku on supervolcano: 'All you can do is run'","Underneath the natural beauty of Yellowstone National Park is a geological time bomb .

"(CNN) -- The election of Uhuru Kenyatta is a storybook ending for the son of Kenya's first president. But despite his popularity at home, he is facing charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court over the 2007 post-election violence in Kenya, putting the West in a dilemma in its fight for human rights in the continent. Kenyatta, 51, narrowly eked out a win, and will become the youngest president of East Africa's largest economy. His challenger, Raila Odinga, has said the vote is flawed, but lost a challenge brought in the Supreme Court. Analysts say Kenyatta's victory signals a growing discontent against Western intervention in the continent. Loud message . In his victory speech, Kenyatta noted the sentiment. ""Today, we celebrate the triumph of democracy; the triumph of peace; the triumph of nationhood,"" he said. ""Despite the misgivings of many in the world, we demonstrated a level of political maturity that surpassed expectations."" Africans have accused the International Criminal Court, based in The Hague, in the Netherlands, of targeting the continent's leaders. ""Kenya sent a loud message to the ICC ... don't interfere,"" said Ayo Johnson, director of ViewPoint Africa. ""And it does not matter if you brand our leaders as criminals."" Grooming for power? In retrospect, it appears Kenyatta's path from childhood may have been preparing him for his new role. His earliest memories revolve around the state house -- the nation's equivalent of the White House -- where he scampered down hallways when his father, Jomo Kenyatta, was serving as the nation's first post-independence president. Born in 1961, two years before Kenya officially got independence from Britain, his parents named him ""Uhuru"" -- Swahili for freedom -- in anticipation of the nation's liberation from colonial rule. At a young age, he brushed shoulders with some of the nation's prominent figures. His online photo album includes receiving a history award from Mwai Kibaki at a young age, the man he is replacing as president. Kenyatta attended high school in the capital of Nairobi, where he was a winger in a rugby team. Two years after his father died in 1978, Kenyatta joined Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he studied economics and political science. He returned home after graduation and launched a horticulture business, which he later sold, and focused on the extensive family businesses his father left behind. His family's empire includes hundreds of thousands of acres of land, often a cause of resentment amid the grinding poverty in the nation. Politics and mentors . Kenyatta dipped into politics as a fierce supporter of the Kenyan African National Union, which ruled the nation from Independence until 2002. After his father's death, Daniel Arap Moi took over the leadership of the party and the nation. He took the younger Kenyatta under his wing, mentored him and secured him a position in his government. When Moi decided not to run for re-election in 2002, he designated Kenyatta as his candidate of choice. Kenyatta lost to current incumbent president, Kibaki, partly because of his ties to Moi, who was resented for overstaying his welcome as president. Despite Kenyatta's loss at the polls, he became known for more than his father's last name. When Kibaki sought to change the constitution to strengthen the president's powers, Kenyatta teamed up with then-opposition leader Odinga to rally against the change. In 2005, voters shot down Kibaki's constitution draft, handing the two rivals a victory. However, the two parted ways before the last election in 2007. Kenyatta, who was not running for office then, threw his weight behind Kibaki, who was up against Odinga. He later served in various positions in Kibaki's government, including finance minister and his latest role, deputy prime minister. After the 2007 election . The last election stoked deep ethnic rivalries. When Kibaki was declared the winner, Odinga alleged the vote was rigged, sending supporters battling on the streets. The International Criminal Court has indicted Kenyatta for allegedly funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks at the time. He has denied the charges, and vowed to cooperate with the court to clear his name. His running mate William Ruto and two others are also indicted. Kenya reneged on a deal to try the perpetrators in local courts, forcing the courts to step in. A Western quandary . Before the 2013 election, Johnnie Carson, the top American envoy to Africa, warned that ""choices have consequences,"" widely interpreted as a threat to Kenyans not to vote for him. Carson's predecessor, Jendayi Frazer, slammed his stance against Kenyatta, describing it as ""reckless and irresponsible."" ""Kenyatta knows that he needs the United States, and the United States knows it needs Kenya,"" Frazer said. ""While it (relations) might be awkward, there won't be a significant change in our policy stances toward Kenya or theirs toward us."" In a statement after the election, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry applauded the vote -- but did not mention Kenyatta. ""We ... will continue to be a strong friend and ally of the Kenyan people,"" he said. Kenyatta has said the indictment will not affect his ability to do his job and urged the international community to respect the will of Kenyans. Analysts say the ICC indictment may have rallied citizens to Kenyatta's side in defiance of the West. A majority of the court's investigations are focused on African nations. ""Many Africans have lost faith in ICC and view it as targeting African leaders and failing to discharge its justice among non-African leaders,"" Johnson said. Kenyatta's trial is scheduled for July, while his running mate's is in May. Kenya will become the second African nation after Sudan to have a sitting president facing charges at the International Criminal Court.","Uhuru Kenyatta is one of the wealthiest men in the nation .

"(CNN) -- Robert Redford says bigotry, fear of change and a determination to personally destroy President Barack Obama have paralyzed the U.S. government. Women and young people are the answer to fixing the gridlock that has partially shut down Washington, the actor told CNN on Tuesday. ""Give them the reins,"" Redford said. ""I think they can do better than we have."" Redford, 77, sat down with CNN's Nischelle Turner to talk about his new film, ""All Is Lost,"" which he agreed could serve as an analogy to the shutdown crisis. In the movie, Redford plays a lone sailor struggling to stay alive after his sailboat is crippled by a collision with a container ship. ""At a certain point, I think, when things really get awful, when things get really bad and all seems to be lost -- there's no hope, there's no possibility -- then a lot of people quit,"" Redford said about his character. ""They say, 'What's the point?' and they quit. And others keep going for no other reason than that."" Opinion: Men dither while women lead . Redford: 'Why are these people behaving so stupidly?' The conversation then turned to the drama playing out in Washington, where a standoff between Obama and Republicans in Congress has forced the federal government into a partial shutdown and threatened a default on the U.S. debt. ""It's so divided now with the people that are so narrow and so limited that they would take us back into the past,"" Redford said. ""And I was trying to figure out, why are these people behaving so stupidly? Why are they behaving so horribly that it's crippling our whole country? ""And I think it has to do with fear. I think it's a group of people that are so afraid of change, and they're so narrow-minded that some people -- when they see change coming -- get so threatened by change, they get angry and they get terrorized, and then they get vicious. I think that's who these people are. They're so afraid of change that they're behaving miserably."" Obama is ""a compassionate man who can't function"" in this political environment, Redford said. It ""is so decrepit, it is so paralyzed, and the worst of it is it is paralyzed by intention,"" he said. ""There is a body of congressional people that wants to paralyze the system. I think what sits underneath it, unfortunately, is there's probably some racism involved, which is really awful."" Obama's opponents reject whatever he might propose ""because their determination was to destroy this person,"" Redford said. ""They wanted, if it meant destroying the government, anything to keep him from succeeding. ""I think just the idea of giving credit to this President, giving him credit for anything, is abhorrent to them, so they'll go against it. Never mind that it's the better good of the people, never mind that they're supposed to be in office representing the interest of the public. They're representing their own self-interests, which is very narrow and in some cases bigoted."" America's problem: We're too dumb . Redford: All is not lost . But, unlike his latest film title, all is not lost, Redford said. He said ""something new"" is starting to happen that offers hope. ""Susan Collins, who is a Republican, is saying: 'Enough of this. This is not the job I signed up for. I've got to do something,' "" said Redford, referring to the U.S. senator from Maine. ""So she's bringing a bipartisan group together of women. I think the future should belong more to women and young people."" Women must save the country ""because a lot of men that were in control were behaving stupidly,"" Redford said. ""I mean, sometimes you say: 'Can we actually be this dumbed down, or am I actually hearing what I'm hearing from some of these people? Are they really, is that really happening?' It's sad."" Does this mean Redford is already throwing his support behind Hillary Clinton in a 2016 White House bid? ""No, I wouldn't single out one woman over another,"" he said. ""I think it's time to give more women a chance."" ""All Is Lost,"" which is almost a silent movie, with its sparse dialogue, hits U.S. theaters next week.

"Washington (CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and former President Ronald Reagan were, in the words of one close aide, ""political soulmates."" Reagan, who was elected a year after Thatcher assumed office in 1979, found in her a fresh, conservative voice who he could align with on many international issues. And in nearly a decade of working together, she found in him a personal friend and an equal on the global stage. He offered her stronger support than any previous American president in dealing with terrorism in Northern Ireland, said biographer Geoffrey Smith, author of ""Reagan and Thatcher."" She was also one of the first leaders who spotted the potential for a new kind of leader in Mikhail Gorbachev and convinced Reagan that he could be trusted. ""I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business together,"" she said in December 1984, three months before he was chosen to lead the Soviet Union. ""Thatcher was a politician who had a strong voice,"" Gorbachev said in a statement that noted their relationship evolved gradually. ""At the end, we were able to reach an understanding, and it was a contribution to the change in atmosphere between our country and the West and to the end of the Cold War."" Reagan left a similar impression on Thatcher. U.S. political figures react to Lady Thatcher's death . ""She certainly liked Reagan a lot from the moment he won office and he felt the same,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. ""They had a deep respect, admiration and a friendship."" Thatcher said at his 2004 funeral that ""we have lost a great president, a great American and a great man. And I have lost a dear friend."" Thatcher, called the ""Iron Lady"" for her personal and political toughness and the only woman to become British prime minister, died Monday at 87. ""It was closer ideologically and warmer personally than any relationship between any other British prime minister and any other American president,"" Smith said of Reagan and Thatcher's friendship. Together, they came to epitomize what has been called the golden age of conservatism â€” an age where their policies changed the world map. ""They both thought that they were leading political revolutions at the same time in countries that were fundamentally liberal,"" Zelizer said. Each believed in the strength of free markets, disdained communism and saw themselves and their countries as part of a transatlantic alliance, Zelizer said. During her time at the helm of the British government, she emphasized moral absolutism, nationalism, and the rights of the individual versus those of the stateâ€”famously saying in 1987: ""There is no such thing as society."" Fast facts on the Iron Lady . ""Both took strong attacks against different types of regulations,"" Zelizer said. ""Reagan worked on telecommunications, the environment and business. Thatcher took stands with health care. Both were tough with unions and believed unions posed a danger to people."" Thatcher and Reagan met years before either came to power, Smith said. They spent hours discussing their shared vision. Eventually, their relationship evolved to the point where they felt comfortable speaking for the other. ""Thatcher would say, speaking for both of them, 'Ron and I think,'"" Smith said. Reagan initially urged British restraint in the days leading up to 1982 Falklands War with Argentina. ""The best chance for peace was before complete Argentine humiliation,"" Reagan said in a memo released 30 years later. Thatcher was reportedly relieved when Reagan ultimately backed her. The British victory in the Falklands became a mainstay of her legacy. Thatcher's most memorable quotes . The two had other differences, however. Thatcher was troubled over the soaring U.S. budget deficit, but was unable to get Reagan to share her concerns, said former Thatcher press secretary, Martin Ingham. ""It went against her grain that such a huge debt was being piled up,"" he said. Reagan struggled to convince Thatcher to agree to allow the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya to be launched from British bases. She was similarly troubled by the 1983 American invasion of Grenada. ""Mrs. Thatcher was heard to expostulate, not once, but many times 'How could (Reagan) do it without telling the Queen, i.e. without telling me so that I could inform the head of the commonwealth,'"" Ingham said. She gave the president a friendly ""ear-bashing"" over that and his attempt to make a nuclear disarmament deal with Gorbachev at Rejkyavik, Iceland, in 1986. On the day of Reagan's funeral, Thatcher sat behind the former president's son, Ronald Prescott Reagan, looking sadly on as he comforted his mother, Nancy. ""Ronnie and I knew her as a dear and trusted friend,"" Mrs. Reagan said on Monday in a statement. ""I will miss her."" Thatcher: Hero or villain?

"(CNN) -- It's cocoa season across the southern half of the Ivory Coast. The pods are ripe for picking, some turning from green to yellow, like bananas. Except these trees are unlike anything I've seen before; a quirk of evolution, they would look at home in C.S. Lewis' Narnia or Tolkien's Middle-earth: their precious cargo grows not from the branches, but straight out of the tree trunk. It's October, a critical time of year for the poorest rural communities who sell cocoa beans -- and for chocolate lovers too, since this small equatorial country in West Africa produces more than one third of the world's cocoa. Across the Ivory Coast, cocoa is grown on family plantations, each typically only a few hectares. The small parcels of land are handed down through the generations, each son struggling to make ends meet, just like his father before him. Jean inherited two hectares of land when his father died seven years ago. He was just 11 years old at the time. Still only 18, he has acquired the appearance of a man resigned to a hard life, looking like he barely has two beans to rub together. But beans are the one thing he does have -- a sack full of them, tied precariously to the back of his rusty bicycle. With global demand for cocoa easily outstripping supply, Jean's beans are increasingly valuable to the big-name chocolate companies, but taking into account inflation, their monetary value has fallen in recent decades. ""It's tough,"" Jean tells us. ""I am brave, but I need help too,"" he says, admitting that he struggles to make ends meet. Jean is right at the bottom of a multi-layered global supply chain which sees cocoa transformed from bean to bar, and as such, the fundamental cocoa-nomics are firmly against him. Traders, processors, exporters and manufacturers all demand their margin, and for everyone to make a profit, the system dictates that Jean -- who has little or no bargaining power -- receives the bare minimum for his bag of beans. In a country where cocoa directly supports about 3.5 million people, the annual GDP per capita is not much above $1,000. Read more: Cocoa-nomics explained - infographic . Cocoa pods are prized open using machetes -- the basic tool of the bush. It's low tech, hazardous and labor-intensive. And unfortunately, in this part of the world, many little hands make work that is not light. The issue of child labor has blighted the chocolate industry for decades; and despite coming to global attention over the past 10 years, it's a problem that won't go away. Systemic and deeply ingrained in the culture, its roots are found in the grinding poverty afflicting rural communities: farmers who can't afford to pay adult workers use children instead. The tiny village of Zibouyaokro has put on a big welcome for chocolate's ""royalty"": A team from Nestlé, the world's largest food company, is paying a visit to one of the 23 schools funded by the company's sustainability program. Stopping child labor and increasing access to education is seen as the best long-term approach to bring prosperity to these villages. José Lopez, Nestlé's head of global operations, says the firm aims to ""improv[e] the living standards of those communities that produce cocoa and in doing so, we will create a sustainable source of supply for an industry that is growing and will continue to grow."" Cocoa industry critics have long argued that companies like Nestlé have failed in their responsibility to improve the lives of the farmers who grow their cocoa. Antonie Fountain of the Voice Network suggests that companies are at last grappling with the issues -- even if driven by self-interest. ""When you hear a company talks about sustainability, what they're actually talking about is the sustainability of them being able to continue to buy cocoa in the future,"" he says. But he admits that some progress has been made. ""The impression I have is that the current steps being taken are actually more significant than what we have seen in the past"". François Ekra owns a seven-hectare plantation in the town of Gagnoa. He is also president of his local farming co-operative, which produces about 1,200 tonnes of cocoa beans a year. François paints a worrying picture for the future of the chocolate industry: The price of cocoa fixed by the government is too low; the trees are old and diseased; co-operatives like his can't get finance to invest for the future. ""We put in too much effort for how much we're compensated,"" he tells CNN. ""So little by little, if rubber is better paid we'll drop cocoa because [we] cocoa farmers work for nothing."" He knows farmers who are turning their backs on cocoa altogether: Where cocoa trees once stood, rubber plantations are now springing up -- they are more lucrative and productive all year round. And as in many African nations, rural communities are moving away from their roots, seeking a better life by joining the mass influx to the capital Abidjan. Ultimately a famer's beans are bought by traders or middlemen working for the industrial processors and exporters. American food giant Cargill buys 20% of all cocoa beans grown in the Ivory Coast, exporting them raw or grinding them into cocoa liquor, butter or powder -- products which are then sold on to manufacturers to make chocolate. It is at this stage of the process where the cocoa bean gets its added value, but of course by now the farmers have already dropped out of the chain, so they don't get a share. In villages like Kouadio-Yaokro, the stark poverty on display is a bleak reminder of the disassociation between the chocolate bar we consume and the farmers who grow cocoa. Two hundred locals gathered to tell us about their lives, so dependent on the revenue of cocoa. Nobody from a chocolate company had ever come here. And perhaps most extraordinary of all, not one villager had ever tasted chocolate. Most didn't even know what it was, until we showed them. A village elder was chosen to take a bite of a KitKat (one of the most popular chocolate bars in the world; its manufacturer Nestle says 150 are eaten every second). His face contorted at the sweetness -- and perhaps at the realisation that this is what his life's toil is all about. Cocoa-nomics explained: Unwrapping the cocoa industry .

"(CNN) -- Democrats will soon return to the airwaves in Kentucky to back Alison Lundergan Grimes, according to a source at the Democratic Senatorial Congressional Committee. The decision comes as Democrats insist polls show their candidate, Lundergan Grimes, can still win in her race against Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. As of last week, the DSCC had not purchased airtime for Lundergan Grimes at all through the end of the campaign. That news got out the morning after she was roundly criticized for awkwardly refusing to answer questions about whether she voted for President Barack Obama. But polling suggests Lundergan Grimes is still competitive. A Courier-Journal/Survey USA poll of voters from Oct. 15-19 found McConnell up by just one point. The DSCC source said their polling suggests undecided voters are moving toward Grimes, though there's little public data to back that up. Even last week when they conceded they had no plans to air TV ads for Grimes, national Democrats still promised to spend money on the ground to get out the vote. The reality is that the back and forth about money for TV ads is more symbolic of how national Democrats view Lundergan Grimes' chances -- and perhaps differences with locals over how to run the campaign -- than it is practical . Kentucky is flush with cash from both the campaigns and outside groups and sources in both parties concede at this point neither candidate will win or lose for lack of money. Politico first reported the DSCC's decision to return to Kentucky.","The DSCC will return to the airwaves to support Alison Lundergan Grimes .

"(CNN) -- When I was 9, my mom gave us the devastating news: ""Your dad has cancer."" I remember that day like it was yesterday. My brothers and I were gathered at the kitchen table as she broke the news to us. That was a defining moment; my life and focus were forever changed. My dad's diagnosis of a rare, aggressive form of prostate cancer made me quickly realize how little awareness there was for his disease. Within 10 months, my dad, Michael Vinecki, was gone. I couldn't imagine just sitting around being sad. I knew I had to do something. So with the help of my mom, I formed a nonprofit called Team Winter. I set out on a mission to raise global awareness for the cancer that stole my dad. I vowed to help prevent other families from going through what my family went through and continues to go through. I can't remember a time when I wasn't competitive. At 5 years old, I was already winning triathlons and running races and competing against adults. I spent my winters tearing up the ski slopes and dreaming of being an Olympic skier. At age 9, I completed my first Olympic-distance triathlon in less than four hours -- a distance many said I was too young for. It would be the last race where my dad would ever meet me at the finish line. Movember: Why I'm growing the 'stache . His death fueled my passion and determination in a way very few athletes might experience. Since losing my dad, I have become not only a two-time IronKids triathlon national champion but also an ambassador to the sport of triathlon.I love inspiring youth across America to live an active, positive and healthy lifestyle and to race not only for themselves but for a cause. While speaking at a 2009 Prostate Cancer Foundation event, I made a promise to more than 100 of the best prostate cancer researchers of the world: ""I will make certain that, in my lifetime, I will get a blue ribbon out there to match every pink ribbon!"" I have helped raise close to $400,000 to fund prostate cancer research and have athletes around the world racing for my cause. Why can't doctors agree on PSA testing? Now I have a new goal: to race one marathon on every continent. I have already completed the Eugene Marathon in Oregon in 3:45:04 and placed third overall female at the Amazing Maasai in Kenya. Many have told me I'm too young to run these distances, to wait until I'm older. My dad waited until he was 40 years old to do the things he wanted to do and never got to do them. I'm more than capable now to do the things I do, so why put them off until tomorrow? Tomorrow is never a given, as I have learned the hard way. I hope to encourage others to do the same and not let age be a barrier. In 2013, I'm tackling Antarctica, the Inca Trail Marathon (labeled the ""toughest marathon in the world""), Mongolia and New Zealand and will finish on the original course of Pheidippides in Athens in November. Ironman champ: Your mind matters more . My goal is to be the youngest person in the world to complete a marathon on every continent before I turn 15, to honor not only my dad but the one in six men affected by prostate cancer. I plan on showing my dad all these amazing places he never got to see. He is with me wherever I go, and you can bet he is by my side every step of the way as I conquer every continent, 26.2 miles at a time. As for skiing, in June, I became the newest and youngest member of Fly Elite, the Olympic development team for aerial skiing. I train in Park City at the Utah Olympic Park and am a hopeful for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. But this training and vision comes at a great cost. I now live year-round with a host family and must live apart from my three brothers and my mom. I spend up to eight hours a day training, on top of my daily school schedule. I will continue to cross train as a triathlete and will be exploring the Xterra series in 2013 with sights set on the World Championships in Maui this fall. Six people who'll inspire you this year . I believe cross-training is the key to reducing injuries and burnout and has been one of the keys to my success as an athlete.Despite all my athletic endeavors, I haven't forgotten about the most important thing, my education. I'm currently a freshman at the online high school EPGY (Educational Program for Gifted Youth), run by Stanford University. My journey is not one I chose; it was a path laid before me. I feel my dad was meant to die so that Team Winter could be born and I could help change the face of prostate cancer awareness. I hope I'm able to show others that if a 9-year-old girl from a rural town in northern Michigan can have an impact on the world, anyone can do the same. I challenge people to not only dream but to dream big! My dream: to be a winter and summer Olympian. Never give in!

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of students in Colorado walked out of classes this week in response to recent attempts by the conservative-leaning Jefferson County board of education to change the school curriculum. One of the board's most controversial initiatives is to avoid historical instances of civil disobedience while promoting ""patriotism, respect for authority and free enterprise."" Imagine for a moment: What if the board succeeds? What if we step into a time machine and travel to such a future? In such a world, not only have those pesky moments of civil disobedience been put in their proper place, but also their dangerous effects have finally started turning around. For example, the late 1800s look a lot different in Colorado's textbook in the future. Take that troublemaker Susan B. Anthony, who spent 50 years of her life fighting for women's right to vote. While current textbooks applaud her courage in the face of a trial, conviction and $100 fine for illegally casting a ballot in the 1872 presidential election, the Colorado textbook of the future might well ensure that her story is blotted out. And even though there's no repealing women's right to vote, future generations of girls at least know never to protest against continuing forms of gender inequality, such as being paid less for doing the same job as a man. To fight for equal pay would be unpatriotic, disrespectful, and contemptuous of CEOs, who -- let's face it -- ultimately know what's best for us. The progressive movement of the early 20th century would likely look different in Colorado's textbook of the future. While current textbooks detail the illegal labor strikes that eventually led to things like a 40-hour work week and workplace safety laws, future textbooks may make no mention of it. In the future, students would understand that it's unpatriotic to question an employer for any reason. Asking for things like cost-of-living raises just makes companies want to leave the U.S. and go someplace where they can hire people who will work for even less money. The lesson: If you want a job at all, better keep your mouth shut and watch your wages decline. Finally, in the Colorado textbooks of the future, the civil rights movement could be recast in the proper light. For example, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King could be depicted as disobedient rabble-rousers rather than brave fighters for equality. How dare Rosa Parks -- a black woman -- sit in the front of the bus? In Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955, that was illegal, not to mention disrespectful and unpatriotic. And how dare the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. lead peaceful marches for equality without a permit? That was also illegal in many Southern cities, and he rightfully went to jail for the crime. Thus, Colorado students of the future would know that fighting for equality among the races is dangerous and might get you into trouble. Best to just accept the status quo despite stubborn discrepancies between the races in categories like student achievement, household income, and incarceration. No, I don't really have a time machine, and no one can predict the future. But we can and should look at the past with a critical eye. Our history is filled with seemingly powerless people banding together, following their conscience, and making a positive change, despite the anger of rich and powerful people, who like things to stay just the way they are. As we face a future of widening inequality, resurgent discrimination, and decreasing wages, we would do well to follow the example of the Colorado students who are peacefully disobeying authorities and fighting for a truthful account of history in their textbooks.","Colorado school district wants to revise curriculum to avoid history of civil disobedience .

"(CNN) -- Boston Marathon bombing victims were collateral damage in a strike meant as payback for U.S. wars in Muslim lands, the surviving suspect wrote in a message scribbled on the boat where he was found hiding, a law enforcement source told CNN Thursday. In the message, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev also proclaimed that an attack on one Muslim is an attack on all, and said he would not miss older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- who died after a firefight with police three days after the bombing -- because he would soon be joining him, according to the source. The writing on the inside of the boat dovetails with what Dzhokhar, 19, told investigators questioning him in a Boston hospital room shortly after his capture, the source said. Friendly fire led to officer's shooting during Boston manhunt . CNN has previously cited U.S. officials in reporting that Dzhokhar said U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq were motivating factors behind the April 15 attack, which killed three people and wounded 275. According to authorities, the Tsarnaev brothers fashioned explosive devices from pressure cookers and other materials and detonated them near the finish line of the race. Three days later, authorities released their images to the public as suspects in the case. Investigators believe they then killed MIT police Officer Sean Collier and hijacked a car before battling authorities in a wild firefight on a Watertown, Massachusetts, street. Nearly 24 hours later, police found Dzhokhar hiding in the boat after the owner called police to report someone was inside of it. The final hours that paralyzed Boston . Dzhokhar -- who suffered gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hands -- is being held a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Devens, Massachusetts. He has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction and could face the death penalty if convicted. Tamerlan was secretly buried in a rural Virginia cemetery this month following protests from Massachusetts residents and officials against burying him in that state. Authorities have said they believe the brothers acted alone, but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. Of particular interest has been Tamerlan's 2012 trip to the semi-autonomous Russian republic of Dagestan, home to numerous Islamic militant groups that have warred against Moscow's rule. Source: Russia withheld details about Tsarnaev . Russian authorities asked U.S. officials to investigate Tamerlan before the trip, saying they believed he was becoming increasingly involved with radical Islam. The FBI investigated, but found no evidence of extremist activity, FBI Director Robert Mueller reiterated Thursday during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. Mueller said Russian authorities told the FBI that Tamerlan and his mother appeared to be ""very religious"" and that Tamerlan seemed ""intent on returning and perhaps participating in jihad, in Russia."" The FBI conducted a thorough investigation and found ""no ties to terrorism,"" Mueller said. U.S. officials learned after the bombings that Russian officials had intercepted a 2011 phone call between the suspect's mother, living in Dagestan, and one of her sons, in which they reportedly had a vague conversation about jihad, a law enforcement official told CNN earlier. Some lawmakers, particularly Republicans, have been critical of how law enforcement, intelligence agencies and the administration of President Barack Obama handled the Russian tip. While Tamerlan and his mother were added to a terror database following the FBI investigation, Tamerlan was allowed to make his Russian trip in 2012, returning six months later.

"Hailey, Idaho (CNN) -- No one here knew exactly where he was or what he was going through, but this tiny city in Idaho never forgot about Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Yellow balloons and American flags line the sidewalks of Hailey, population 8,000. Residents planted one tree for each of the five years Bergdahl was held captive in Afghanistan. Now, uncertainty has given way to elation as the Army sergeant has been released from his captors -- in exchange for freeing five Taliban members held at Guantanamo Bay. ""There were times where we wondered, but (parents) Jani and Bob Bergdahl never once gave up faith that their son was coming home to them,"" family friend Stefanie O'Neill said. Bergdahl's parents said the battle is far from over. ""The recovery and reintegration of Bowe Bergdahl is a work in progress,"" Bob Bergdahl told reporters Sunday, one day after his son was freed. ""It isn't over for us. In many ways, it's just beginning for Jani and I, and our family. There's a long process here."" So what's next for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and the Obama administration, which has come under criticism from some lawmakers for the secretive nature of the swap? WHAT'S NEXT FOR BERGDAHL . Recovery in Germany . Bergdahl is recovering at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, a U.S. Defense official said Sunday. He is also expected to be debriefed at Landstuhl. ""He had lost ... a good bit of weight,"" National Security Adviser Susan Rice told CNN's ""State of the Union With Candy Crowley."" Believing that his health was deteriorating, the United States acted quickly to save Bergdahl's life. U.S. special operations forces recovered Bergdahl without incident Saturday at a pickup point in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan. American officials said the government of Qatar brokered the deal. Some fellow soldiers: Bergdahl a deserter . ""We were very concerned that time was not ... something we could play with -- that we needed to act when we had the opportunity,"" Rice said. Bergdahl's condition on Monday was stable, and he was ""receiving treatment for conditions that require hospitalization,"" a U.S. defense official told CNN. People at Landstuhl were trying to build Bergdahl's trust in them, as he hasn't been able to trust anyone around him for five years, the official said. A senior Defense official said Bergdahl was having trouble speaking English, but the reasons for that were not clear, given the trauma he's been through. Doctors in Germany are evaluating his health and whether he's ready to be transported, said Arwen Consaul, a spokeswoman for U.S. Army South. Once doctors give the OK, a receiving team will travel to Germany to facilitate his transport to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The recovery team has been training for the trip for years, practicing Bergdahl's return trip 10 times with drills eventually involving hundreds of personnel, including stand-ins for the soldier and his family, she said. From Lackland, Bergdahl will head to the San Antonio Military Medical Center, where a room is ready for him and a support team is standing by, Consaul said. Speaking to CNN, White House spokesman Jay Carney declined to discuss Bergdahl's condition, saying he should be allowed to recover privately. ""His process of repatriation has begun, and reintegration into society,"" Carney said. ""I'm sure it will not be an easy one, but we're overjoyed on behalf of his parents and his friends and family that he's returning home."" Transitioning to normal life . The first meeting between Bergdahl and his parents may only last minutes, Consaul said, depending on what psychologists recommend. Once in the United States, she said, Bergdahl's daily routine will focus on four key areas: medical care, psychological support, debriefings and family support. ""This is to help a person who has had no control of their own life for years now regain that control step by step,"" she said. There's no set time limit for how long the reintegration process will take, she said, because the case for each returnee is different. Bergdahl was believed to be held by operatives from the Haqqani network, which is affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda. An Afghan Taliban commander not authorized to speak to the media confirmed to CNN that Bergdahl was captured by insurgents with links to the Haqqani network in Pakistan. Over the years, the captive was transferred back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Taliban commander said. David Rhode, a former New York Times journalist who was held captive by the Taliban for seven months, said Bergdahl faces a long road ahead. ""Psychologically, there will be a long debrief,"" said Rhode, who was taken in Afghanistan and held in Pakistan until he managed to escape. ""They're actually going to want intelligence (about) who held him."" But there's a chance Bergdahl might not know much about Taliban commanders. ""I was kept with very young guards, most of the time, and I didn't really meet very senior commanders that often,"" Rhode said. Army human resources officials will determine where Bergdahl goes after he completes the reintegration process in San Antonio, Consaul said. He'll receive follow up care and have access to a psychiatrist for the rest of his life. Bergdahl, who's still on active duty in the Army, could return to his unit in Alaska or be reassigned, she said. Facing criticism . One question that remains unanswered is how Bergdahl disappeared in the first place. Several veterans and soldiers call him a deserter who walked off his base on June 30, 2009. At least six soldiers were killed in subsequent searches for him. ""Bowe Bergdahl deserted during a time of war and his fellow Americans lost their lives searching for him,"" said former Sgt. Matt Vierkant, a member of Bergdahl's platoon. Vierkant said Bergdahl needs to not only acknowledge his actions publicly but face a military trial for desertion under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. When asked Sunday whether Bergdahl had left his post without permission or deserted, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel didn't answer directly. ""Our first priority is assuring his well-being and his health and getting him reunited with his family,"" Hagel said. ""Other circumstances that may develop and questions, those will be dealt with later."" A senior Defense official said Bergdahl will not likely face any punishment. ""Five years is enough,"" he told CNN on condition of anonymity. Carney said questions about the circumstances of Bergdahl's disappearance didn't play into efforts to retrieve him. ""Here's what matters. He was a prisoner in an armed conflict, a member of the military, and in that situation the United States does not leave its men and women behind,"" Carney told CNN. WHAT'S NEXT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION . Defending the swap . Some lawmakers are openly wondering whether Bergdahl's release sets a dangerous precedent for future kidnappings of Americans. ""The methodology in what we used is very troublesome,"" said Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee. ""We have a changing footprint in Afghanistan, which would put our soldiers at risk for this notion that if I can get one, I can get five Taliban released."" Rice defended the Obama administration's efforts. ""If we got into a situation where we said, 'Because of who has captured an American soldier on the battlefield, we will leave that person behind,' we would be in a whole new era for the safety of our personnel and for the nature of our commitment to our men and women in uniform,"" she said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""Because it was the Taliban that had him did not mean that we had any less of an obligation to bring him back."" Briefing lawmakers . Some members of Congress are trying to understand why they didn't know what was happening. Rep. Buck McKeon, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he still hasn't been briefed by administration officials on the detainee swap. The California Republican said he plans to hold hearings about the Bergdahl exchange, he told CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash on Sunday. ""We're getting our information -- other than a very brief notification -- we're getting most of our information now from the media,"" he said in an exclusive interview on ""Newsroom."" McKeon said the Defense Department notified his staff on Saturday, after the exchange took place. But he pointed to a law that requires the administration to notify Congress 30 days before detainees are released from the facilities at Guantanamo Bay. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill Monday that lawmakers on her committee should have been given a heads-up about the prisoner swap. ""We had participated in a number of briefings some time ago, and there (were) considerable concerns,"" the California Democrat said. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman the House Intelligence Committee, said he planned to look into whether Obama broke the law by not notifying Congress 30 days in advance. ""I think it certainly merits further review, and that's what I'm going to do to make that determination,"" the Michigan Republican told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""It certainly doesn't smell right to me."" Tony Blinken, Obama's deputy national security adviser, told CNN Monday that administration officials didn't notify Congress in advance because they faced an ""urgent situation"" with deep concerns about Bergdahl's health. ""We had information that it was deteriorating. We had an opportunity that was very fast-moving to close this deal, to bring him back. And based on the law, we had the flexibility to do that. ... We had an urgent matter, and we had an opportunity, and we seized it,"" he said. After consulting with the Justice Department to make sure the move was legal, he said, the administration decided to go ahead with the prisoner swap to avoid the risk of the Taliban changing its mind or the information leaking out. ""In the days ahead, there will be full briefings of the relevant committees in Congress, and indeed, of every member who wants it,"" Blinken said.

"(CNN) -- A TV show can be wildly popular online, inspiring binge-watching marathons and feverish Twitter chatter, but it's still the number of people turning in via a regular television set that are counted most by networks. In a sign of our increasingly connected age, the Nielsen Company will finally add streaming viewers to its influential ratings of who's watching what on TV. The new ratings will collect data on people who watch their sitcoms, dramas and crime procedurals on computer, tablet and smartphone screens. Nielsen first announced it was testing programs to track streaming viewers in April. In mid-November, it will release a software development kit that clients can use to figure out who's tuning in online. Nielsen ratings are used to figure out how many people are watching a show and the demographics of the overall audience. Networks use those numbers to determine how much to charge for ads and even to help make scheduling decisions, such as canceling shows that pull in dismal numbers. Television sets are still the primary way people watch TV, but online viewers are growing fast. They stream shows to non-TV screens, such as computers, tablets and smartphones. Their viewing habits are different, too: They consume entire seasons in single sittings and catch up on ""Daily Show"" clips during commutes. The streaming and mobile audiences tend to skew younger, a coveted age group for advertisers. Nielsen typically tracks demographics such as age, location, gender, race and income. To gather that type of detailed information about online viewers, the company says it will match demographic information with data providers such as Facebook that already collect that information about Internet users. Not all online views will count as part of the main Nielsen TV ratings. Shows that don't include the same ads online as on TV will be counted as part of separate Nielsen Digital Ratings. Shows streamed directly by networks through their own sites and apps typically include the same set of ads, and those viewers are counted towards the traditional Nielsen totals. This is the latest attempt by Nielsen to catch up with current digital-media technology. Earlier this month, the company announced it was launching Twitter TV ratings, tracking the number of people tweeting about a show and how many people were reading those tweets. Nielsen ratings are typically collected in several old-fashioned ways. For example, it still has households record their viewing habits in handwritten diaries, documenting any show they watch for more than five minutes.","Nielsen, which measures TV ratings, will begin tracking online-viewing habits .

"(CNN) -- At five months pregnant, Jennifer Cramblett and her same-sex partner, Amanda Zinkon, learned that Cramblett had been inseminated with the wrong sperm, and that the donor was of a different race. Two years later, Cramblett and Zinkon are moms to a mixed race African-American girl named Payton, whom they love ""unconditionally."" But even that bond hasn't been enough to protect them from the emotional and social challenges they admittedly, were not prepared for. ""There are things I don't feel I have the background to even know. It is things we have to go out and research and talk to people and figure out how to do as simple as a daily chore of doing your hair,"" Cramblett told CNN. Last week, Cramblett sued Midwest Sperm Bank with the goal to force them to change the policies that led to the mix-up and to obtain the funds her family needs to receive ongoing counseling and relocate to a more diverse community. The mix-up . Cramblett said her ""shock"" came when she called Midwest Sperm Bank in April 2012 to secure more vials for a second pregnancy. ""When I called to order that sperm and the vials, I asked them for (donor) 380 and they came back on the line and said I do believe we have sent you donor number 330, are you sure that's not what you asked for?"" said Cramblett. ""They came back on the line and then had asked me if I had requested an African-American donor. At that point, I said no, 380 was blond-haired, blue-eyed, resembling my partner, Amanda. They said we believe 330 is an African-American donor. We can no longer talk to you anymore,"" said Cramblett. The mix-up stemmed from Midwest Sperm Bank's record-keeping procedures, according to a complaint filed in Circuit Court in Cook County, Illinois, where the company's main office is located. The sperm bank's records are kept manually, ink-on-paper, not electronically, according to the lawsuit. ""To the person who sent Jennifer vials of sperm in September, 2011, the number '380' looked like '330',"" the complaint stated. CNN called Midwest Sperm Bank. A woman who answered the phone and refused to identify herself said, ""sorry, we have absolutely no comment."" CNN also reached out to the sperm bank's attorney, Marc Groedel, and received no response. Attorney Scott Bakal, listed on the complaint, hung up the phone with a quick ""goodbye."" ""The basis of the lawsuit and why we are doing what we are doing is so that somebody is held accountable. This isn't going to happen to anybody else,"" said Cramblett. Utah university investigates suspected sperm switch . Lack of racial diversity in their town . With the birth of Payton, Cramblett and Zinkon were confronted with raising their mixed race child in Uniontown, Ohio, a rural community south of Akron that, according to the last census, is 98% white. Cramblett suffers from ""stress and anxiety"" just thinking of Payton having to attend and all-white school and being ""stigmatized or unrecognized."" ""I want my child to be raised around people that maybe look like her, and unfortunately, we are not going to get all of those assets there in Uniontown, Ohio,"" she said. ""We want her to grow up in a community where she feels accepted, feels like it's normal to be who she is."" But in spite of their strong wish to relocate, Cramblett and Zinkon don't have the financial means to do so, Cramblett's attorney Timothy Misny told CNN. ""Uniontown is a wonderful town, wonderful people, but there are no biracial children and no mixed marriages. We need to relocate Jennifer and her family to a town that offers that type of diverse culture,"" Misny said. And since the sperm bank is responsible for the mix-up, the bank should be held financially accountable, said Misny. ""We are asking they change policy so it never happens again,"" Misny said. The lawsuit also seeks ""compensation to receive the kind of counseling they will need going forward, and also to relocate to an area that is more demographically in tune with their family,"" he said. ""At times she (Cramblett) feels that she is underwater. She loves her child to death. But what she needs is assistance in handling it properly,"" Misny said.

Cramblett received a refund from the bank for the insemination vials she purchased, but the bank kept the payment for the insemination procedure.

""She's going to know what she is and where she came from and how all this happened. She's going to know that we love her unconditionally. Everybody around her loves her.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York company offering tours of Bronx neighborhoods has shut down after officials objected to its advertising that claimed to give visitors ""a ride through a real New York City 'ghetto',"" according to a statement from Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz Jr. The tour's controversial description states that when thinking of the Bronx, people envision when the borough ""was notorious for drugs, gangs, crime and murders."" It promises to take visitors on a three-hour journey into ""this diverse and mysterious borough called the Bronx."" The website for the tour company, Real Bronx Tours, was no longer accessible on Thursday, but an advertisement for the tour is still viewable on NewYorkPass.com, a site intended for purchasing tourism tickets. According to an open letter on Monday from Diaz and New York City Council Member Melissa Mark-Viverito, the tour strongly misrepresents the borough. The letter, addressed to Real Bronx Tours company owner Michael Myers, urges the company to stop profiting off of a tour that paints the borough ""as a haven for poverty and crime, while mocking everything from our landmarks to the less fortunate members of our community who are availing themselves of food assistance programs."" ""Using the Bronx to sell a so-called 'ghetto' experience to tourists is completely unacceptable and the highest insult to the communities we represent,"" the letter read. In a second statement from Diaz on Tuesday, he announced that in response, the tour company had decided to end its ""inaccurate and disrespectful tours."" ""I am relieved that this company has listened to the overwhelming complaints of community members, as well as public officials, who were outraged and sickened,"" the statement read. Representatives of Real Bronx Tours did not return CNN's calls seeking comment. Diaz now is also asking the company to apologize to the residents of the Bronx ""for their terrible portrayal of our communities."" Mark-Viverito told CNN it is a great victory for the community and that in the future, tours should instead highlight the beauty in the Bronx. The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New York City and currently has a reported 1.4 million residents. Chris Heywood, senior vice president of communications for NYC & Company, which calls itself the official guide to New York, said Thursday that Real Bronx Tours is completely outside the realm of anything they would ever promote. ""We condemn what they were promoting."" In an effort to highlight the vibrancy of the borough, Heywood said the company has launched a new global communications effort called Neighborhood x Neighborhood, which recently showcased the South Bronx. The program focused on many of the Bronx's most famous attractions, including Yankee Stadium and the Grand Concourse. CNN's Maria Santana and Katia Hetter contributed to this report.","Tour firm billed trip through the Bronx as ""a ride through a real New York City 'ghetto'

"New York (CNN) -- A fast-food worker whose run-in with two unruly customers was captured on cell phone video last month will not be indicted on assault charges, prosecutors said Saturday. A grand jury voted against indicting Rayon McIntosh, who was seen allegedly swinging a metal object against two patrons at a McDonald's restaurant in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. He had been charged with felony assault, according to Joan Vollero, spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office. The grand jury reviewed evidence and testimony over 11 days, said Vollero. The incident occurred at the restaurant on West 3rd Street in the early morning of October 12, and seemed to begin when the cashier questioned a $50 bill the women gave him, according to the video. The two women responded by hurling obscenities at McIntosh. One of them then appeared to reach over the counter and slap his face, the video showed. From there, one woman was seen climbing over the counter, sending the cashier running toward the kitchen area. The other woman is then seen walking around to join her friend. The cashier reappears with what police described as a metal object and repeatedly takes swings at the women. Restaurant patrons can be heard screaming for him to stop, while other employees are seen trying to intervene. The video, one minute and 10 seconds long, shows the cashier taking swings at the women as many as 10 times as they lie behind the counter. ""Stop! Stop!"" one woman screams. ""Stop it! Call the cops!"" The two women suffered lacerations to their head and face and were taken to a hospital, police said. One of the women suffered a fractured skull and a broken arm, according to a complaint filed by the DA's office. Authorities identified the women as Denise Darbeau and Rachael Edwards, who authorities say each face pending charges of menacing, criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct. ""This was clearly a legally and morally unjustified attack on my clients,"" said Harold Baker, an attorney for the women in denouncing the grand jury decision. ""Inappropriate behavior in the United States of America is not supposed to be met with deadly force."" Calls to McIntosh's attorney were not returned.

"Washington (CNN) -- Q. What does NASA's ""Green Ninja,"" calm wives and military weapons in Afghanistan have in common? A. They all made Republican Sen. Tom Coburn's annual book of government waste. The Oklahoma Republican, a devout believer in small government, said the federal government wasted $28 billion in 2013 on ""questionable and lower-priority"" programs. Coburn, who supports deep cuts to the federal budget, said government waste could still be found despite outrage over the automatic budget cuts that went into effect last year. ""While (President Barack Obama) and his Cabinet issued dire warnings about the cataclysmic impacts of sequestration, taxpayers were not alerted to all of the waste being spared from the budget axe,"" Coburn wrote in his report titled ""Wastebook 2013."" Agencies that received the money don't consider it wasted, however. The 177-page report that Coburn has been compiling for five years highlighted programs from the departments of Defense to Agriculture, from NASA to the National Institutes of Health. ""The nearly $30 billion in questionable and lower-priority spending in . ""Wastebook 2013"" is a small fraction of the more than $200 billion we throw away every year through fraud, waste, duplication and mismanagement,"" he said. Coburn's examples of waste: . Weapons destruction -- $7 billion . Weapons destruction: Coburn said the Pentagon junking weapons and vehicles used in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. ""The military has decided to simply destroy more than $7 billion worth of equipment rather than sell it or ship it back home,"" Coburn said. For instance, Coburn said ""thousands"" of heavily armored vehicles -- MRAPs --used to protect troops from roadside bombs ""will simply be shredded."" Budget compromise clears Senate procedural hurdle . Military response: The military defended the decision, saying it will keep about 11,000 but that a large number of them are no longer necessary with new military priorities. The remaining vehicles will be offered to law enforcement and other agencies. The cost is too great to ship the rest back and refurbish them to sit unused -- about $400,000 per vehicle, the Pentagon said. Fort Hood shooter paycheck -- $52,952 . Coburn said Maj. Nadal Hasan, convicted of killing 13 people in a mass shooting at Fort Hood Army base in Texas in 2009 collected more than $278,000 in military benefits since the massacre. A military jury rendered a guilty verdict last summer, but he continued to be compensated until then. Army's response: The Army defended the payments, noting that they stopped once Hasan was convicted per military law. ""He is innocent until proven guilty,"" Army spokesman Troy Rolan, said. ""It's the same concept it is in the military as it is for civilians."" Study: Wives should calm down -- $325,525 . Coburn points to a National Institutes of Health study that cost more than $300,000 to find that the ""happiest"" marriages ""were the ones in which the wives were able to calm down quickly"" during conflict, the researcher in the report found. ""Men who want a happy marriage are probably wise to avoid telling their wives the government's advice to resolving marital conflicts is for her to calm down,"" Coburn's report said. NIH's defense: ""Understanding how couples maintain emotional satisfaction, especially in the face of everyday conflicts and challenges, can shed light on the qualities that define successful social relationships and point to interventions to support marital health in the long term."" The study did in fact find that ""women's ability to manage emotional conflict may be an important signal to both partners of the health of a marriage."" The NIH said the research grant was part of a multifaceted study by the National Institute on Aging that looked at ""emotional function in aging."" Budget deal: Who wins, who loses? NASA's little green man -- $390,000 . Coburn knocks NASA on two fronts: for its ""Green Ninja"" character to teach children about global warming and for scaling back its manned space flight program. NASA ""seems to have shifted its focus from making contact with little green men to teaching children about fictional green ninjas,"" Coburn wrote. He said the Green Ninja is supposed to be the equivalent of ""Smokey the Bear"" and is a multimedia tool for teachers to educate children about global warming. ""While this project may be fun and even educational, NASA would have a much bigger impact inspiring young people to seek out careers in science and technology by focusing its resources on its primary missions,"" Coburn wrote. NASA's response: The agency has not yet responded to requests for comment. Here's Coburn's full list of government waste .","GOP Sen. Tom Coburn released his annual report on government waste .
