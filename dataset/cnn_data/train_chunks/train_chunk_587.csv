"By . David Martosko In Washington . PUBLISHED: . 12:20 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:24 EST, 29 April 2013 . Rep. Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat from Illinois, said she wants to raise the income tax rates paid by America's top earners to between 45 and 49 per cent, largely to justify more government spending. 'We need increased revenue,' she said in a statement, 'to eliminate the sequester, fund investments in education, public safety, and infrastructure and provide support for Americans striving to reach the middle class.' U.s. Democratic Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky wants top earners to pay more - a lot more - to the government at tax time, and justifies it with calls for revenue that would enable more spending . Billionaire Warren Buffett has said he would welcome a requirement to pay more in income tax. Obama has called for a 30 per cent 'Buffett Rule' tax plan. Schakowsky's would put rates far higher . Schakowsky said her Fairness in Taxation Act, introduced in the House of Representatives on Thursday, would put more money in the hands of the poor and the middle class. 'Our country faces an inequality crisis,' she insisted. America's top marginal tax rate sits at 39.6 per cent, a rate that's paid on income earned over $400,000 for single filers and above $450,000 for married earners who file tax returns jointly with their spouses. Schakowsky would add five new tax brackets, starting with a 45 per cent rate for income between $1 million and $10 million, and ending with 49 per cent for earnings after a taxpayer's first $1 billion in any tax year. That stratospheric top rate would only affect a handful of Americans, mostly those in the financial sector and many successful business entrepreneurs. Conservative push-back: Sen. Tom Coburn (L) isn't impressed with Jan Schakowsky's plan to hike tax rates for business leaders and entrepreneurs who earn more than $1 million, but the IRS would reap a windfall . While a Republican House majority makes it extremely unlikely that Schakowsky's bill would receive serious consideration - much less a vote - Senate Republicans also slammed the idea. 'Instead of raising rates on anyone we should lower rates for everyone by getting rid of special interest subsidies in the tax code, said John Hart, Communications Director for Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican. Hart also pointed out Schakowsky's legislation doesn't balance a tax increase on the rich with tax cuts for lower-income earners. Those Americans, he said, are already frozen out of the behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts mounted by large corporations, effectively freezing them out of any chance to see their taxes lowered. 'Tax earmarks for Hollywood movie producers, politically-connected ""green"" energy companies, and professional sports leagues are effective tax rate increases for lower income Americans who can't afford to hire lobbyists,' Hart told MailOnline. 'True tax reform will create shared prosperity rather than shared misery.' Grover Norquist, the anti-tax crusader . whose Americans For Tax Reform pressures lawmakers from both major . parties to pledge that they won't vote for tax increases while in . office, was angered by the idea of a new tax increase from the left side . of the aisle. Grover Norquist, a conservative tax activist and president of Americans for Tax Reform (R), has raised eyebrows with his endorsement of immigration reform laws but has remained steadfast on his signature issue: preventing tax increases . 'Congresswoman Schakowsky's collection of tax hikes - just four months after Obama's income and social security tax hikes - reminds us that Democrats' answer to all questions is ""raise taxes,""' Norquist told MailOnline. 'And after that, ""raise taxes, again."" This never ends.' A senior Republican aide told MailOnline that the Democrats' 'incessant drumbeat to hike taxes' would ultimately 'kill off millions of jobs in this country, and that's really their biggest sin.' 'For all the Dems' talk about compassion,' he added, 'I just don't see it.' The aide spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak about pending legislation. Daniel Patrick Head, the press secretary for Wyoming Republican Sen Mike Enzi, also vented about Schakowsky's tax-increase plan. 'It's easy to say people should pay more in taxes when you aren’t the one that is paying them,' Head told MailOnline. 'The fiscal cliff plan provided hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases earlier this year. Senator Enzi would like to see a focus on encouraging growth through simplifying the tax code, broadening the base, and lowering the rates instead of always trying to raise people’s taxes.' 'The government has to stop its borrowing and spending,' he added.' President Barack Obama has similarly called for higher tax rates on upper-income earners, insisting that they 'pay their fair share.' He has also called for continued year-on-year increases in federal government spending . In January President Obama's administration allowed a payroll tax holiday to expire, restoring older rates for Social Security and Medicare withholding and costing taxpayers an additional 2 per cent of their income up to $110,100. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment about whether the president supports Schakowsky's plan to expand the tax base even more. Republicans in the House continue to project a united front on their leaders' goal of reforming the U.S. tax code. 'The (GOP) conference will unite around tax reform,' House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy told The Washington Post on Saturday. 'The window is now.' Dave Camp, a Republican who chairs the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, added that conservatives want to scrap the entire tax code and start from scratch, with the goal of keeping just two income tax rates in place - with a 25 per cent ceiling. 'We're not going to take the current code and see what comes out,' Camp told the Post. 'We're going to take a blank piece of paper and see what goes back in.' Co-sponsors of Schakowsky's bill include Reps. John Conyers of Michigan, Donna Edwards of Maryland, Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, Barbara Lee of California, Betty McCollum of Minnesota and John Yarmuth of Kentucky. All are Democrats with liberal voting records.","Win a $1 million lotto jackpot? You would pay $450,000 to the IRS .

"By . Matt Blake . PUBLISHED: . 18:06 EST, 29 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:06 EST, 29 April 2013 . With more than 70 bombs raining on his neighbourhood, on the outskirts of Damascus, every day, decorator Jamal Mittar knew it was only a matter of time before one would strike his home. When that day came, he just hoped neither he nor his wife, son or daughter would be in, unlike so many of his Syrian friends and neighbours slain in their beds or at their kitchen tables. Luckily, nobody was in when the rocket fell. But with no home, no work and little food to go round, Jamal made the impossible decision to take his family far away, fleeing the routine horrors of Syria's bloodthirsty civil war. Bare necessities: A group of Syrian children are collecting water from a tap stand in Zaatari camp . 'Every day they choose a certain area to drop a rocket to kill everyone,' he says. 'My house has completely vanished. 'We were living in the ruins but then it was destroyed by a bomb. At first there were rockets near the building so it was half destroyed. There was continuous bombing. Everyone is getting slain.' Jamal's is one of countless stories of fear and desperation that has propelled terrified Syrians into refugee camps across the border, further deepening the humanitarian crisis, which aid agency Oxfam says is at its worst point since the conflict erupted two years ago. 'The world risks failing the people of Syria at a time when they most need our help. Responding to this crisis is now our number one priority,' said Oxfam’s chief executive, Mark Goldring, who is currently visiting refugees on the Syria/Jordan border. Humanitarian crisis: Syrian refugees arrive at a cramped Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, their belongings strews around them . Help: Jamal Mattar's father, who is in his eighties is receiving medical treatment after he suffered a heart attack just after crossing the border into Jordan . Swelling numbers: Some of the 1.3million Syrians living in refugee camps gather to collect water that has just been delivered by truck . He added: 'We hear each day that the situation in Syria is desperate for so many but providing an appropriate humanitarian response is extremely difficult – and deeply frustrating. Restrictions on access mean far too many vulnerable people are not getting the help they have a right to.' Jamal's wife and daughter are two of these people. They never returned after the bomb dropped because they had been held at a new military checkpoint a mile away. Jamal waited for them in the ruins of his home with his son and elderly parents before he was forced to leave without them for the safety of what family he had left. He drove along the back roads to get as close to the border as possible before walking an hour and a half to cross into Jordan. His father, in his eighties, had a heart attack after crossing and was on his way to hospital for treatment. They finally arrived at Zaatari Camp where he waits patiently, in the desperate hope that his wife will one day find him so the family can be reunited. There are currently 1.3million Syrians living in abject conditions in the many refugee camps across the border. Struggle: A reception tent in Zaatari where they get one meal, blankets and spend their first night, but with increased numbers of arrivals mean facilities are stretched to the limit . Make do and mend: A fence dividing one part of Zaatari refugee camp from another is used as a washing line . And with nearly seven million people in need of humanitarian help inside Syria, Oxfam is calling on the UN Security Council to help improve access by using its influence to urge the Syrian Government and opposition groups to help ensure aid reaches those most in need. This could mean allowing aid to cross lines of control and cross-border from neighbouring countries, such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. In a new briefing paper released today, called 'Overtaken By Need', Oxfam says that three months after $1.5bn was pledged for the UN’s six-month appeal, only a little over half of the money has been received, much of it from Gulf countries. Meanwhile, refugee numbers have doubled in the first three months of the year and Oxfam warns that similar or even higher levels of funding will be required for the response in the future as the humanitarian catastrophe worsens. 'The aid effort on the borders has been slow to get off the ground and now needs to be scaled up significantly,' added Goldring. Crucial aid: Cement is laid for bathroom blocks in Zaatari camp to provide toilets, showers and laundry areas for 20,610 people in part of the camp but, it is not enough . Helping hands: Oxfam is installing 334 permanent toilets, 288 showers, 72 laundry areas and 72 ablution areas - all housed within 48 hygiene blocks . 'A massive increase in humanitarian assistance is required but we fear that instead of being stepped up, the reverse is more likely to happen and aid levels could soon decline.' In Jordan’s Za’atari refugee camp, increased numbers of arrivals mean facilities are stretched to the limit. Oxfam has installed toilets, showers and laundry areas to help 20,610 people in part of the camp but the organisation hopes to do more. There are concerns that failure to respond fully to the humanitarian emergency could have serious consequences on stability across the wider region. Countries that have provided help for Syrian refugees, such as Jordan and Lebanon, are already feeling the economic and social strains of hosting such large numbers and need much greater international assistance, the aid agency said. There have already been riots over poor living conditions and shortages of aid given in refugee camps in Jordan and Turkey. 'When refugees arrive in Jordan and Lebanon they are traumatized and fearful for the future. As the needs of Syrians and refugees increase, so must the response', said Goldring. 'The future will be very bleak for people affected by this crisis unless they get more support.'","The world is at risk of failing Syria and its people, warns aid agency Oxfam .

A group of scientists clad in spacesuits trudge across the bleak red terrain, occasionally pausing to take rock samples or map the landscape. After their mission is complete, they will return to their cramped habitation module, where they live a spartan existence with limited water, electricity, food and oxygen, a vast distance from home. But these amazing pictures are not from the latest sci-fi thriller set on Mars, but were taken in the deserts of Utah, in the Western United States. The 'astronauts' are a group of volunteers who are helping to discover ways to investigate the feasibility of a human exploration of Mars and use the Utah desert's Mars-like terrain to simulate working conditions on the red planet. Scroll down for video . Utah, the final frontier: Volunteers venture out from the Mars Desert Research Station, which aims to simulate the conditions that will be endured by humans should they ever reach the red planet . To boldly go: Members of Crew 125 EuroMoonMars B mission venture out in their simulated spacesuits to collect geologic samples for study at the MDRS earlier this month . The project is called the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS), a simulated off-world habitat that serves as a test site for field operations in preparation for future human missions to Mars. All outdoor exploration is done wearing simulated spacesuits and carrying air supply packs and crews live together in a small communication base with carefully rationed essentials - everything needed to survive must be produced, fixed and replaced on-site. The site, near the town of Hanksville, was chosen because the terrain is similar to the surface of Mars. It is operated by The Mars Society, a non-profit organisation that advocates space travel, during the cooler winter months by rotating volunteer crews of six scientists (geologists, biologists, engineers and more) running simulations of how it would be to live on Mars and working together to develop field tactics and study the terrain. Alien terrain: Csilla Orgel, a geologist and volunteer from Hungary. She has a life-long love of space exploration and is a board member of the Hungarian Astronautical Society . Explorer: Hans van Ot Woud, a mapping researcher and the health and safety officer of the mission, surveys the terrain from a ledge .

Alone in the cosmos: Volker Maiwald, executive officer and habitat engineer, takes pictures of the surface of 'Mars' Members of Crew 125 EuroMoonMars B mission collect geologic samples from a cliff face. Utah was chosen because it is believed to be geologically and visually similar to Mars . The MDRS aims to investigate the feasibility of a human exploration of Mars and uses the Utah desert's Mars-like terrain to simulate working conditions there . Each crew spends between two weeks and a month living in a habitat unit, performing the kind of work astronauts will be expected to carry out on Mars, such as collecting rock samples from the surface and examining them back in the habitat, conducting life science experiments and studying the local geology and geomorphology. A statement on the MDRS website says: 'Mars is the great challenge of our time. 'A world with a surface area the size of the combined continents of the Earth, the Red Planet contains all the elements needed to support life. As such it is the Rosetta Stone for revealing whether the phenomenon of life is something unique to the Earth, or prevalent in the universe. Red dusk: The weary spacefarers trudge back to the habitat after a day of collecting geologic samples . Homeward bound: Csilla Orgel makes her way back to the MDRS, where she lives in cramped conditions with five other astronauts .

For safety reasons, there is always one crew member in the habitat in case anything goes wrong on the 'planet's surface' Starscape: A view of the night sky above the Mars Desert Research Station . To be as authentic as possible, everything needed to survive must be produced, fixed and replaced on site, as it would on a real expedition to Mars . 'The exploration of Mars may also tell us whether life as we find it on Earth is the model for life elsewhere, or whether we are just a small part of a much vaster and more varied tapestry. 'Moreover, as the nearest planet with all the required resources for technological civilisation, Mars will be the decisive trial that will determine whether humanity can expand from its globe of origin to enjoy the open frontiers and unlimited prospects available to multi-planet spacefaring species. 'Offering profound enlightenment to our science, inspiration and purpose to our youth, and a potentially unbounded future for our posterity, the challenge of Mars is one that we must embrace.' The crew wait in an airlock in their simulated spacesuits before venturing out to explore the 'Martian' surface . Much of the research is to examine what is required of space suits on a manned mission to Mars . Another core component is to learn about the psychological stresses that may be endured by explorers as they deal with a lack of privacy and long periods of solitude .

The Utah site is one of two operated by the Mars Society as part of its Mars Analog Research Station (MARS) project. The other site is located in the Canadian Arctic, with two more planned for the Australian outback and Iceland. These locations were chosen because some environmental conditions, geologic features or biological attributes may be similar to those thought to be encountered on Mars. The MDRS website adds: 'In addition to providing scientific insight into our neighboring world, such analog environments offer unprecedented opportunities to carry out Mars analog field research in a variety of key scientific and engineering disciplines that will help prepare humans for the exploration of that planet. Such research is vitally necessary. Wall-E? Engineer Matt Cross works on a rover, which will be used to explore the surface of Utah, similar to the way a robot could be used by human explorers .

'For example, it is one thing to walk around a factory test area in a new spacesuit prototype and show that a wearer can pick up a wrench - it is entirely another to subject that same suit to two months of real field work. 'Similarly, psychological studies of human factors issues, including isolation and habitat architecture are also only useful if the crew being studied is attempting to do real work.' Mission commander Melissa Battler, who led a crew of six at the Utah site from February 23 to March 9, said: 'Humans, we are explorers… there are a lot of obstacles but we can overcome those obstacles.'

Susan Lunn, 43, from Wallasey, was handed a six-month conditional discharge for possessing cannabis, which she uses to help with her MS . A former police PCSO suffering from multiple sclerosis has vowed to continue smoking cannabis even if it means going to jail. Susan Lunn, 43, was been handed a six-month conditional discharge for possessing the illegal drug. She said she uses cannabis every day as medical relief from her condition, which sees her battle muscle spasms, headaches, bladder problems and tremors on a daily basis. Now Ms Lunn has been told she will face a 'much worse punishment' if she is caught possessing the Class B drug in the next six months. But the former Humberside Police special constable has said she will carry on smoking cannabis regardless of the law. The mother-of-one, who was diagnosed with MS 17 years ago, said: 'I'm not going to stop doing it. 'If I gave up cannabis, the results would be absolutely devastating. I smoke it every day and it has helped me to live a relatively normal life. 'It calms me down, relaxes my muscles, stops my shakes and helps keep my mild epilepsy under control.' Ms Lunn, who is on daily medication including injections for her condition, branded her sentence 'completely unjust'. She said: 'I have given so much to the community through my work as a special constable and I feel let down by the justice system. 'It's as if I am being prosecuted for being ill.' The former community support officer from Hull, East Yorkshire, was arrested on December 22 after her neighbours smelt the drug and alerted the police. It was the third time in nine months that police had raided her home, and she had already received a warning and a caution. Ms Lunn says she uses cannabis every day to give her relief from the headaches, spasms and tremors caused by her condition . Representing her at Hull Magistrates' Court, Geoffrey Ellis, said: 'Every so often, a case comes along that really shouldn't be in the court - and this is one of those cases. 'This lady's condition causes her immense suffering and cannabis is one of the only treatments that actually helps. 'This is criminalising somebody who is using the drug as medical relief.' Mr Ellis also pointed out that cannabis-based substances are available through the NHS elsewhere. He said: 'This lady's doctors are aware she is using the drug to self-medicate and they have not warned her against it. 'The NHS won't prescribe it in this . area as it is very expensive and they are reluctant to spend that amount . of money on this type of drug.' Ms Lunn, who was smoking £20-worth of cannabis a day to help her condition when she was arrested in December last year, was joined in court by nine campaigners for cannabis legalisation reform. Ms Lunn says she will continue to use cannabis, pictured right, to help her symptoms even if she's risking jail . One of the campaigners, Carl Wagner, 54, said: 'Sue shouldn't have been prosecuted in the first place. Everyone should have the right to use cannabis for medical purposes, especially people with severe, life-changing conditions like multiple sclerosis. 'She should have received an absolute discharge and I think it's a disgrace that she didn't.' 'I don't understand how it can be in the public interest to arrest someone like Sue who needs cannabis to function properly.' Sentencing Ms Lunn, magistrates' chairman Anita Hall said: ""We have sympathy with the situation you are in. However, you have broken the law. 'If you are found in possession of cannabis in the next six months, you will find yourself back here and the punishment will be much worse.' Following angry cries from the public gallery, Ms Hall added: 'We have been as understanding as we can within the law. It could have been far worse, believe me.' Susan, who claims disability benefits, was also ordered to pay prosecution costs of £85 and a victims' surcharge of £15 at the hearing last week.","Susan Lunn, 43, from Hull, was given six-month conditional discharge .

Passengers on a busy Tube line face more than 18 months of periodic part-closures - because acidic water is eating away at the tunnel walls. London Underground's Jubilee line will shut for over a month during the next two years because acidic water is eating into the cast iron linings of the tunnel walls. The work includes six-day closures between Finchley Road and Waterloo . stations during Christmas this year and next, as well as over the Easter . period in 2014. Services will be halted in both directions between Finchley Road and Waterloo for major repairs which will cost £40¿million . The acidic water is similar in strength to vinegar and comes from water seeping in from surrounding soil. Services will be halted in both directions between Finchley Road and Waterloo for major repairs which will cost £40 million, the Evening Standard reported. The work covers a number of weekends and bank holiday periods from June this year to the end of 2014, with the possibility of some additional closures in 2015 in order to complete the maintenance. Engineers are concerned about the state of more than 90 yards of the southbound tunnel between Baker Street and Bond Street. Sections of the tunnel will have to be replaced as part of the extensive work. The acidic water is similar in strength to vinegar and comes from water seeping in from surrounding soil . London Underground’s Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines’ programme director Stuart Harvey said today: 'All railways require a programme of maintenance and we will soon be carrying out work on the tunnel lining on a section of the Jubilee line. 'This is part of ongoing maintenance and, due to the nature of the work, some closures during weekends will unfortunately be required between Finchley Road and Waterloo.' He went on: 'We will be doing as much of the work as possible overnight; however, in some cases we need to carry on beyond normal overnight engineering hours and normal weekend services will not be able to operate. 'I apologise to customers for the disruption. We’ll be keeping the impact to a minimum by spreading the work out and including some later-starting services on Sunday mornings to minimise the overall number of closures.' The Jubilee line is the Underground's newest line, but serves stations which originally opened over 100 years ago. Inaugurated on 1 May 1979, the Jubilee line linked up the most recent sections of new tunnelling to open in central London - the four km (2.5 miles) of twin tunnels between Baker Street and Charing Cross - with the former Bakerloo line branch between Baker Street and Stanmore. The northern end of the line between Wembley Park and Stanmore was opened in 1932 as a branch of the then Metropolitan Railway.","Acidic water with strength of vinegar eating away at tunnel walls .

Giant caverns have been excavated under New York as work continues on the monumental Second Avenue Subway project. The stunning images released by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority show the scale of the task as concrete is mined and blasted up to 27 meters below ground. The giant underground caves will one day be the city's 86th Street Station - one of the three being built in the $4.45billion project. Construction workers have carved out huge caverns below New York as they make room for the Second Avenue Subway's future 86th Street Station . Large diggers appear tiny in the enormous caves that have been dug as part of the project, which has been in the pipeline for decades . Construction workers are excavating between 15 and 27 meters underground and work continues for up to 24 hours a day . Once complete, the Second Avenue Subway project will . include a two-track line along Second Avenue from 125th Street to the . Financial District in Lower Manhattan. Over two miles of tunnels are being built across the city as planners aim to reduce connection on New York's transport network. The 86th Street Station is being mined, which is an added challenge because of the number of high-value properties at street level. Construction work continues up to 24 hours a day, with the majority of New Yorkers unaware of the mammoth feat carrying on underground. Phase 1 of the project is scheduled for completion in December 2016. It will include the new 86th Street Station and new stations on 96th and 72nd Streets and new entrances to the existing Lexington Avenue station. Construction workers have bored tunnels underground that will eventually stretch from 92nd Street to 63rd Street . Phase one of the Second Avenue Subway is due for completion in December 2016 and include a connection to the existing 63rd Street subway . Architects and construction workers are also building new ADA-accessible stations at 96th Street, 86th Street and 72nd Street . The $4.45billion subway will reduce overcrowding and delays on the Lexington Avenue line and aims to improve travel for city and suburban commuters . The first of four construction phases sees the excavation of the tunnels from 105th Street to 63th Street and Third Avenue, with new stations along Second Avenue . The final design for Phase One of the . project began in April 2006 and the construction contract was first . awarded in March the following year . Planners predict an extra 200,000 people will be transported on the system when it is finished. Authorities say travel times and conditions for city and suburban commuters will be improved by the new lines. Travel from the Upper East Side is expected to be ten minutes faster and divert 23,500 riders a day from the overcrowded Lexington Avenue Line. The monumental construction project will expand New York transport system, which is already the nation's biggest mass transit system carrying 5million passengers a day . Construction methods across the project vary because of different conditions and range from tunnel boring machinery to mined drill and blast . The final design for Phase One of the project began in April 2006 and the construction contract was first awarded in March the following year . Work on the stations and new subway is going on between 15 and 27 meters below the bustling roads of Manhattan . New Yorkers are mostly unaware of the heavy duty work going on beneath their feet day and night . The expansion of the network was originally proposed in the 1920s but was shelved due to the Great Depression and World War II. Several stretches of tunnels with tracks were built in the 1970s but once more was put on hold because of a lack of funds. The existing tunnels are now being incorporated into the new ones. The New York transport system is already the biggest in the U.S., carrying 5million passengers a day.","Construction work on the $4.45billion Second Avenue Subway project has continues this month .

As the economy struggles to grow its way out of recession the charity event - which was one of the ultimate symbols of the age of excess - has been cancelled. Charity fundraiser: William and Kate attend the lavish Ark gala dinner in 2011 which raises millions annually for the Ark charity - but has come to be a symbol of excess .

A leading evolutionary researcher has claimed that sleeping around may have been the secret to the success of modern humans. Experts have long debated exactly how Homo sapiens became the 'last human species standing' among several human ancestors. Now it is claimed that interbreeding gave humans the advantage. BBC show Planet Of The Apeman recreates a Homo sapien hunting party: Experts have long-debated exactly how Homo sapien became the 'last human standing' among several human ancestors . Humans (Homo sapiens) are primates of the family Hominidae, and the only species of the genus Hom that still exist. Humans are characterised by having a large brain relative to body size, with a particularly well developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, making them capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection, problem solving and culture through social learning. Experts believe Homo sapiens originated in Africa, and fossils show it resembled modern humans about 200,000 years ago, and began to behave like them around 50,000 years ago. 'As recently as 40,000 years ago, Homo sapiens lived alongside several kindred forms, including the Neanderthals and tiny Homo floresiensism,' said Professor Robert Hammer of the Univeristy of Arizona, writing in Scientific American. 'For decades scientists have debated exactly how Homo sapiens originated and came to be the last human species standing,' he said. One of the key theories emerged from genetic studies in the 1980s, when it was claimed anatomically modern humans arose in Africa and spread out across the rest of the Old World, completely replacing the existing archaic groups. 'Exactly how this novel form became the last human species on the earth is mysterious,' said Professor Hammer. A 2011 study came to the same conclusion, and researchers claim that the first modern humans protected themselves against unfamiliar illnesses by interbreeding with Neanderthals. Although it was known that homo sapiens had bred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa, a study has concluded that in doing so they picked up genes which protected them and eventually helped them to populate the planet. 'Given the complexity of the African fossil record, which indicates . that a variety of transitional human groups, with a mosaic of archaic . and modern features, lived over an extensive geographic area from . Morocco to South Africa between roughly 200,000 and 35,000 years ago, I . favor a model that involves interspecies mating during the . archaic-to-modern transition,' Professor Hammer wrote. 'Sometimes called African Multiregional Evolution, this scenario . allows for the possibility that some of the traits that make us . anatomically modern were inherited from transitional forms before they . went extinct. 'To my mind, African Multiregional Evolution, in combination with . Bräuer's Hybridization model, best explains genetic and fossil data to . date.' However, Professor Hammer admits more research is needed to prove the theory. The researcher hit the headlines earlier this year when  a DNA test on an American hoping to trace his family tree came up with a stunning result - the roots of the human tree date back much further than previously thought. More that just good friends? A facial reconstruction of the hobbit human . Researchers were shocked when they analysed the DNA of Albert Perry, a recently deceased African-American from South Carolina. 'This lineage diverged from previously known Y chromosomes about 338,000 years ago, a time when anatomically modern humans had not yet evolved,' said Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona.'This pushes back the time the last common Y chromosome ancestor lived by almost 70 percent.' This time predates the age of the oldest known anatomically modern human fossils. The fossil record dates back about 200,000 years, said Hammer. Either interbreeding with Neanderthals or other populations led to the unusual genetic makeup, he said, or humans evolved far earlier than the extant fossil record suggests. The new divergent lineage - which was found when Mr Perry contacted Family Tree DNA, a company specializing in DNA analysis to trace family roots - branched from the Y chromosome tree before the first appearance of anatomically modern humans in the fossil record. A map of human migrations, with the North Pole at its centre: Africa, harboring the start of the migration, is at the top left and South America at the far right. Dashed lines are hypothetical migrations. Numbers represent thousand years before present. The blue line represents area covered in ice or tundra during the last great ice age. The letters are the mitochondrial DNA groups used to define genetic populations. Unlike the other human chromosomes, the majority of the Y chromosome does not exchange genetic material with other chromosomes, which makes it simpler to trace ancestral relationships among contemporary lineages. If two Y chromosomes carry the same mutation, it is because they share a common paternal ancestor at some point in the past. The more mutations that differ between two Y chromosomes the farther back in time the common ancestor lived. The results are published in the American Journal of Human Genetics. Originally, Mr Perry's DNA sample was submitted to the National Geographic Genographic Project.","Leading researcher says interbreeding was key to emergence of Homo sapiens as dominant species .

State legislators have passed a bill that requires the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles to draw up rules for driver-less vehicles. Assembly Bill No 511 paves the way for Google's automated Toyota Priuses and Audi TT to be operated legally in the Silver State. Scroll down for video . Driver-less: Google is one step closer to bringing its automated cars to the roads of Nevada. State legislators have passed a bill that requires its Department of Motor Vehicles to draw up rules for self-driving vehicles . The hybrid vehicles use laser range . finders and video cameras to detect traffic, and detailed maps to find . their way from point to point. 'Drivers' simply set their destination and the car calculates the route and drives itself there. The first amendment, which was passed last week, relates to an electric-vehicle bill providing for the licensing and testing of autonomous vehicles. The second amendment, which has yet to be passed, is for an exemption that would permit sending a text message while 'behind the wheel'. Google had hired Las Vegas-based lobbysit David Goldwater to promote its proposed legislation. In April, Mr Goldwater told lawmakers that the self-driving cars are safer than those driven by humans and are more fuel efficient. Google ran into controversy last year after it emerged staff had been testing the driver-less car on California's roads. The vehicles logged more than 140,000 miles around the state - almost all of them on auto-pilot. While staff were in the car, their hands were not on the steering wheel. Artificial intelligence: The cars have satellite equipment attached to the roof, which it uses to navigate detailed maps of its routes . The specially-adapted Toyota Priuses . drove from Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Northern California, . down the famously scenic Pacific Coast Highway to Santa Monica. They also drove across the Golden Gate . Bridge and down San Francisco's Lombard Street, one of the steepest and . curviest roads in the world. Seven cars, which have funnel-like . cylinders on the roof that acts as the vehicle's 'eye', have driven . 1,000miles at a time without any hands-on human input, Google said. Their researchers claim the artificial . intelligence technology could eventually halve the 1.2million lives . lost every year on roads around the world. The cars have a person in the driving . seat ready to step in if there is a problem and a software engineer sits . shotgun to take care of possible software hiccups. They keep to the speed limit because the maximum for every road is included in its database. So far, said Google, the trips have been almost accident free. The . only hitch came when another - human-driven - car rear-ended one of the . pilotless Priuses. 'Our goal is to help prevent traffic accidents, . free up people’s time and reduce carbon emissions by fundamentally . changing car use,' Sebastian Thrun, the researcher in charge of the . project, said in March. 'Our automated cars use video cameras, . radar sensors and a laser range finder to “see” other traffic, as well . as detailed maps which we collect using manually driven vehicles to . navigate the road ahead. Mr Thrun insisted the cars we're not a danger to other motorists. 'Safety . has been our first priority in this project. Our cars are never . unmanned. We always have a trained safety driver behind the wheel who . can take over as easily as one disengages cruise control. 'And we also have a trained software operator in the passenger seat to monitor the software. 'Any . test begins by sending out a driver in a conventionally driven car to . map the route and road conditions. By mapping features like lane markers . and traffic signs, the software in the car becomes familiar with the . environment and its characteristics in advance.

She said: 'I was able to sit with the Boston police and be in the presence of true heroes surrounded by truly heroic people who were, as a collect as a whole, were able to save so many lives.' Dr Stavas was running the race with her father, who is also a doctor, when she reached the end of the 26-mile route. Her father Joe, 58, a radiologist, said: 'She was like an Olympic runner - I couldn't keep up with her.'

The daughter of a doctor and nurse, Dr Stavas grew up in Nebraska and was always destined to go into medicine. She is now a pediatric resident treating children at the Boston Medical Centre and Boston Children's Hospital. But the medic was nearly forced to pull out of the marathon because she broke her left foot a couple of weeks before the race. Determined: Dr Natalie Stavas says she now hopes she can move on from the bombings after treating victims . Her determination however, spurred her on to take part because she was doing it for charity. Had she not been there, victims of the blasts would not have been given treatment so quickly. She said: 'Finally I'm starting to have a sense of peace and a sense of closure and an urgent need to be able to move beyond my grief and move towards the future. 'I hope I can help us move forward and be a stronger person and overcome what we have been through...and go back out there next year and cross the finish line of the Boston Marathon.'

Multi-millionaire hairstylist Vidal Sassoon cut his adopted son David out of his will entirely, The Mail on Sunday has learned. Sassoon, who rose from humble roots in London’s East End and whose distinctive cuts came to symbolise the Swinging Sixties on both sides of the Atlantic, apparently never healed a rift with his ‘mischievous’ American son before dying of leukaemia last May, aged 84. Sassoon was worth an estimated £100 million. His will, drawn up two months before his death, was released in the UK, and covers the £5.2 million share of estate in this country. His wealth in the United States has not yet been divided. Together: Vidal Sassoon and family in 1990. Disinherited David, left, Vidal Sassoon, centre, with daughters Eden and Catya . However, the stylist, who lived in Los Angeles with his fourth wife Rhonda, left no doubt as to his wishes regarding David, 41, who was adopted in 1975 aged three. The document states: ‘My son David Sassoon and his issue are hereby disinherited and shall take nothing under this will, and for the purposes of the will, shall be deemed to have predeceased me, leaving no surviving issue.’ The will also specifically disinherits his former wives Elaine Nations, Beverly Sassoon and Jeanette Sassoon, saying they shall ‘take nothing’. In his 2010 autobiography, Sassoon reflected on his life with David, and while it was clear he still held him in affection, it had not been an easy relationship. Close: The late Vidal Sassoon who died last May pictured with his family, including adopted son David in his arms . He described David as an ‘African-American / Asian boy’, which suggests he may have been one of the thousands of babies fathered by US servicemen during the Vietnam War. ‘He was a robust, bright little boy with twinkling eyes and an irresistible smile, and I’ll never forget him looking up at us and saying, “Are you going to be my new mom and dad?” ’ But from the start, things didn’t go smoothly, he recalled. ‘He was also quite mischievous. At a fashion party David stood by a window on the second floor and peed out, just missing [chat show host legend] Johnny Carson’s head. ‘Another time he set the bed alight while he was still in it. His brother Elan was very frightened that he could do something so dangerous and I overheard him giving his little brother some good advice: . “Next time, make sure you get out of it first!” ’ As David entered adolescence,  Sassoon received a call from a police officer friend who told him the 13-year-old had been jump-starting cars, driving them a short distance and then abandoning them. Swinging sixties: Vidal Sassoon built up his reputation from the 1960s onwards, as seen with him at work on a bob cut in 1960 . Sassoon said: ‘David spent a couple of years at a reform school near  Sundance, Utah. He came back to  Los Angeles but he still didn’t seem  to fit in.’ In the book, Sassoon admitted he had not seen his son for 18 months following a rift and later he said: ‘There’s a certain point in my character where if I feel a situation is hopeless –  walk away. Don’t torment yourself constantly. I walked away.’ Sassoon, who kept a house in Notting Hill, West London, had two other surviving children – Elan and Eden. A third child, Catya, died of a drug overdose in 2002.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said cyber attacks are happening on an industrial scale . Britain’s intelligence agencies are today launching a Facebook-style site to share information in a bid to combat a growing terrorist threat. UK networks are often attacked by other states, criminals and companies seeking secrets, costing billions of pounds. Now, experts from government communications body GCHQ, MI5, police and business will work together on a new partnership designed to defend industry and government against attack. Those using the Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CISP) will be given access to a web portal, described as a 'Facebook for cyber security threats', which will operate on social network lines. Analysts, based at a secret location in London, can then choose who they share information with in real time. Large screens will monitor attacks and provide details in real-time of who is being targeted. Then a  group of 12-15 analysts with security clearance will work mainly during office hours. The partnership will provide industry figures with a forum to analyse techniques of online attack,  and how authorities can best counter methods used by cyber terrorists, the Telegraph reports. In 2012, the head of MI5 Jonathan Evans said the scale of attacks was 'astonishing', the BBC reports. One major London listed company incurred losses of £800m as a result of cyber attack from a hostile state because of commercial disadvantage in contractual negotiations. UK networks are often attacked by other states, criminals and companies seeking secrets, costing billions of pounds . A government official told the BBC they had seen the volumes of attack increase and expected it to rise further still. The . plan revealed today has emerged out of a 2012 pilot scheme known as . Project Auburn, which saw 80 companies, including finance, defence, . energy, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals - encouraged to share . information. The pilot was then expanded to 160 firms, with more expected to join after today's announcement. Government officials say they continue . to be uncomfortable with an EU draft directive which would force business to disclose when they have been attacked. Companies previously have been nervous of revealing publicly when they have been attacked because of the potential impact on reputation and share price if they are seen as having lost valuable intellectual property or other information. Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said: 'We know cyber attacks are happening on an industrial scale and businesses are by far the biggest victims in terms of industrial espionage and intellectual property theft, with losses to the UK economy running into the billions of pounds annually.'This innovative partnership is breaking new ground through a truly collaborative partnership for sharing information on threats and to protect UK interests in cyberspace.' Howard Schmidt, former White House Cyber Security Adviser, added: 'In the US, we have seen the emphasis that President Obama has placed on cyber security and in particular steps to protect our critical infrastructure. 'Many senior leaders in private sector companies are supporting it and recognizing it is not only a security issue but a business imperative. 'The launch of the UK CISP is an important step in forging an ongoing partnership between industry and government, promoting information sharing by providing the ability to analyze and redistribute information in a timely, actionable and relevant manner.'","UK networks are often attacked by other states and those seeking secrets .

Seven days after the Boston Marathon bombings, the city plans to mark the traumatic week with mournful silence and a return to its bustling commute. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has asked residents to observe a moment of silence at 2.50pm local time today, the time the first of the two bombs exploded near the finish line. Bells will ring across the city and state after the minute-long tribute to the victims. Paying tribute: Two-year-old Wesley Brillant of Natick, Massachusetts, stands in front of a memorial to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings near the scene of the blasts on Boylston Street . Victims: A tribute to MIT police officer Sean Collier, who was shot dead by Boston bomb suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and MBTA officer Richard Donahue who was injured in an ensuing shoot-out . Many Boston residents are returning to the workplaces and schools for the first time since a dramatic week came to an even more dramatic end. Authorities on Friday had made the unprecedented request that residents stay at home during the manhunt for suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. He was discovered that evening hiding in a boat covered by a tarp in suburban Watertown. His older brother Tamerlan was earlier killed during a getaway attempt. 'It's surreal,' said Barbara Alton, as she walked her dog along Newbury Street. 'But I feel like things are starting to get back to normal.' In another sign of progress, city officials said they are beginning the process of reopening to the public the six-block site around the bombing that killed three people and wounded more than 180. The announcement came Sunday, a day when people could still watch investigators at the crime scene work in white jumpsuits. Probe: Investigators look for evidence on Boylston Street at the scene of the Boston Marathon bombings . Bringing a city together: Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has asked residents to observe a moment of silence at 2.50pm today, the time the first of the two bombs that exploded near the finish line . Tsarnaev remained hospitalised and unable to speak, with a gunshot wound to the throat. He was expected to be charged by federal authorities this week. The 19-year-old also is likely to face state charges in connection with the fatal shooting of MIT police officer Sean Collier in Cambridge, said Stephanie Guyotte, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex District Attorney's office. A private funeral was scheduled Monday for Krystle Campbell, a 29-year-old restaurant worker killed in the blasts. A memorial service will be held that night at Boston University for 23-year-old Lu Lingzi, a graduate student from China. City churches on Sunday paused to mourn the dead as the city's police commissioner said the two suspects had such a large cache of weapons that they were probably planning other attacks. After the two brothers engaged in a gun battle with police early Friday, authorities found many unexploded homemade bombs at the scene, along with more than 250 rounds of ammunition. Police Commissioner Ed Davis said the stockpile was 'as dangerous as it gets in urban policing.' 'We have reason to believe, based upon the evidence that was found at that scene - the explosions, the explosive ordnance that was unexploded and the firepower that they had - that they were going to attack other individuals. That's my belief at this point.' Davis told CBS's 'Face the Nation.' On 'Fox News Sunday,' he said . authorities cannot be positive there are not more explosives somewhere . that have not been found. But the people of Boston are safe, he . insisted. Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev are ethnic Chechens from southern Russia. The motive for the bombings remained unclear. Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, . said the surviving brother's throat wound raised questions about when he . will be able to talk again, if ever. The . wound 'doesn't mean he can't communicate, but right now I think he's in . a condition where we can't get any information from him at all,' Coats . told ABC's 'This Week.' It was not clear whether Tsarnaev was shot by police or inflicted the wound himself. In . the final standoff with police, shots were fired from the boat, but . investigators have not determined where the gunfire was aimed, Davis . said. Terror: The first of two explosions rocks the marathon, followed by the second 12 seconds later . Detonation: The moment the second of the two bombs goes off as hundreds of marathon runners pass by . In an interview with The Associated Press, the parents of Tamerlan Tsarnaev insisted Sunday that he came to Dagestan and Chechnya last year to visit relatives and had nothing to do with the militants operating in the volatile part of Russia. His father said he slept much of the time. A lawyer for Tamerlan Tsarnaev's wife told the AP Sunday night that federal authorities have asked to speak with her, and that he is discussing with them how to proceed. Attorney Amato DeLuca said Katherine Russell Tsarnaev did not suspect her husband of anything, and that there was no reason for her to have suspected him. He said she had been working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week, as a home health care aide. While she was at work, her husband cared for their toddler daughter, he said. The younger Tsarnaev could be charged any day. The most serious charge available to federal prosecutors would be the use of a weapon of mass destruction to kill people, which carries a possible death sentence. Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. Many Boston residents are returning to work and school for the first time since the dramatic hunt for the Tsarnaev brothers that ended with the death of the elder sibling Tamerlan (left) in a shoot-out and the capture of Dzhokhar, who remains critical in hospital . A week of fear: Dzhokar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Boston, after a massive hunt involving thousands of police and FBI and armoured vehicles . Across the rattled streets of Boston, churches opened their doors to remember the dead and ease the grief of the living. At the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, photographs of the three people killed in the attack and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer slain Thursday were displayed on the altar, each face illuminated by a glowing white pillar candle. 'I hope we can all heal and move forward,' said Kelly McKernan, who was crying as she left the service. 'And obviously, the Mass today was a first step for us in that direction.' A six-block segment of Boylston Street, where the bombs were detonated, remained closed Sunday. But Mayor Thomas Menino said Sunday that once the scene is released by the FBI, the city will follow a five-step process, including environmental testing and a safety assessment of buildings. The exact timetable was uncertain. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was tracing the suspects' weapons to try to determine how they were obtained. Neither of the brothers had permission to carry a gun. Cambridge Police Commissioner Robert Haas said it was unclear whether either of them ever applied for a gun permit, and the applications are not considered public records. But the younger brother would have been denied a permit based on his age alone. Only people 21 or older are allowed gun licenses in Massachusetts. Meanwhile, surgeons at a Cambridge hospital said the Boston transit police officer wounded in a shootout with the suspects had lost nearly all his blood, and his heart had stopped from a single gunshot wound that severed three major blood vessels in his right thigh. Richard Donohue, 33, was in critical but stable condition. He is sedated and on a breathing machine but opened his eyes, moved his hands and feet and squeezed his wife's hand Sunday.","City to pay respects at 2.50pm, the time of twin detonations at finish line .

His surfboard shatters and Nick Fury calls on the Marvel heroes to stop these immensly powerful 'Cosmic Bricks' falling into the wrong hands. As expected, each hero has their own superpowers. Spiderman can create webs to swing on, Hulk can use his strength to smash and throw objects (and also turn into Bruce Banner), while Iron Man can punch and use his blasters to fly and attack from the air. To break up the action, there are also some quick-time events. One particular highlight saw the Hulk having a 'punch-off' with a baddie - the player having to hammer the correct buttons to keep the flurry of blows going.

Scientists claim they have discovered how birds find their way across thousands of miles of land guided by the earth's magnetic field. It seems beneath the feathers they are equipped with an internal navigation system similar to the gadgets used by comic superhero Iron Man. Sensory neurons called hair cells are found inside the ears and they are responsible for detecting sound and gravity. Migrating: A flock of cranes fly 200 kilometres east of Budapest. Scientists are baffled how birds always fly to the same location and even the same nest . To the surprise of Austrian and Australian scientists each cell has a single iron ball, which is up to 2,000 times small than the width of a human hair, in the same place as every cell. The researchers believe that the iron responds much like a compass - known as magnetoreceptors - to help birds know whether they are flying north or south, the position of . the sun and visual maps to help them find their way. Hair cells are also involved in hearing . and balance in most animals, so the researchers believe the iron may . help the birds 'sense' the magnetic field, reports the Daily Telegraph. PhD student Mattias Lauwers, from the Institute of Molecular Pathology (IMP) in Vienna, said: 'It's very exciting. Research: The image shows cells from the inner ear of pigeons stained with a chemical that turns iron bright blue in colour. It highlights the balls of iron discovered by the Keays lab. Each one lies directly beneath the hairs and there is just one per cell . 'We find these iron balls in every bird, whether it's a pigeon or an ostrich, but not in humans.' But IMP group leader Dr . David Keays told the paper: 'We're a long way off . understanding how magnetic sensing works - we still don't know what . these mysterious iron balls are doing. Diagram: A hair cell which detects sound and gravity. Balls of iron are found directly beneath the hairs and may play a role in magnetic detection . 'Who knows? Perhaps they are the elusive magnetoreceptors. Only time will tell.' Dr Keays examined zebra finches, ducks, chickens, ostriches and budgerigars and . found iron spheres in hair cells in each of their inner ears. Each cell contained just iron . ball. But they could not find any iron granules in the hair cells of mammals like . mice, guinea pigs, humans and even fish. For decades experts have been puzzled . how birds migrate a mass movement along a 'flyway' between wintering and . breeding grounds, thousands of miles in formation, often returning to the same location and even the . same nest year after year. Arctic Terns fly 44,000 miles per year when they travel from their . breeding grounds to their feeding grounds in the Antarctic. Sooty Shearwaters fly up to 40,000 . miles each year from their home in the . Falkland Islands to the Arctic where they feed in the summer. British birds, including sparrows . and cuckoos migrate south for the winter, travelling hundreds of miles . over the Sahara desert. The latest study published in the online version of Current Biology, builds on previous work by the Keays lab at IMP and the University of Western Australia's Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis (CMCA). Last year the collaboration showed that iron-rich cells in the beak of pigeons - previously believed to be the magnetic sensors - were just blood cells. CMCA research associate Dr Jeremy Shaw, who has studied iron in a range of animals from molluscs to humans, said it was an astonishing finding. Superhero: Birds apparently have an internal navigation system similar to the gadgets used by Iron Man . Dr Shaw said: 'Despite decades of research, these conspicuous balls of iron had never been observed previously. 'Nature keeps surprising us with the various ways iron can be utilised by animals."" The scientists are now planning to investigate if the iron spheres react when moving through a magnetic field.","Beneath their feathers, birds have an internal guidance system similar to the gadgets used by comic superhero Iron Man .

The businessman was out of the country at the time of his daughter’s death.

Mrs De La Cruz left Alexandra in her cot looking at books and went downstairs to do some washing. She could hear the toddler talking to . herself through the baby monitor and assumed that, when everything went . quiet at 1.30pm, she had fallen asleep. Tragedy: The two-year-old daughter of shipping magnate Morten Hoegh, left, was found dead at the family home last October. The increase in the number of deaths involving . blind cords similar to this one has led to campaigners calling on them . to be banned . But when her daughter went to wake the toddler an hour later, she found her hanging lifeless in her cot and ‘panicked’. Melinda sobbed as she told the inquest: ‘I saw Alexandra standing up in the corner of her crib with the cord around her neck.’ Screaming, she carried Alexandra’s . limp body down the stairs and placed her in the arms of her distraught . mother Dana, who was having lunch with a friend, Catherine Mathiesen.

The two arrests on Monday morning stemmed from an investigation into 'cannibal cop' Gilberto Vale who was convicted on similar charges last month. Robert 'Chris' Asch, 61, is the former male librarian from New York's prestigious Stuyvesant High School who was arrested by the FBI in his Greenwich Village apartment Monday morning. Robert 'Chris' Asch, 61, is the former male librarian from New York's prestigious Stuyvesant High School who was arrested by the FBI in his Greenwich Village apartment Monday morning . Connected: FBI agents arrested the two men after investigating former New York police officer Gilberto Valle (pictured) who was found guilty last month of plotting to kidnap, cook and kill women . In a profile on the site imagefap, Asch shared his sick fantasies of torturing and raping a woman, and hoped to do so with a group of like-minded men. His alleged co-conspirator Richard Meltz, a 65-year-old who was the chief of police at a veterans hospital in Massachusetts, was also arrested on Sunday in Rockaway, New Jersey. The New York Times reports that Asch and Meltz were charged with kidnapping conspiracy. The FBI has not explained how Asch and Meltz are connected to Vale, but The New York Post reports that an undercover officer was used in investigating their plot. NBC New York reports that the FBI came into contact with Asch when he responded to an online ad where someone had posted that they wanted help kidnapping, raping and kill his wife, sister-in-law and the sister-in-law's children. The ad was posted in October and Asch met with undercover FBI agents to discuss a similar plot in recent months. At two of the meetings, he brought items that he reportedly thought would be useful including a taser, a black ski mask, handcuffs, a hammer, pliers and forceps. Past: Chris Asch was fired from his job as the librarian at Stuyvesant High School in New York (pictured) in 2009 after he allegedly touched four male students and whispered in one if their ears . The agents set it up so that Asch conducted surveillance on a woman- not knowing that she was also a member of the undercover operation. During one conversation with another meeting with agents, Asch reportedly said the female target 'had to die'. Asch was the one who brought Meltz into the operation, saying that he wanted to help with the kidnapping of the woman. 'This is a fairly high-risk operation,' Asch said in a recorded conversation with Meltz. 'Trying to snatch somebody off the street, home invasion, I think they're pretty high-risk. 'I mean, there are ways to dismember and dispose.' Few details about their plot have been revealed, but some of their intended victims were said to be infants. This is not the first time that Asch, who is openly gay, has been arrested. Asch's relationship with children has . previously come into question when he was arrested and suspended from . his job at Stuyvesant in 2009. Harrowing: Valle (pictured) allegedly discussed how to kill a woman by slowly cooking her over emails with co-conspirators, who may have now included Asch and Meltz . His dismissal came after he allegedly touched four male students at the high school and whispering in one of their ears. The charges were dropped. FBI agents were seen searching Asch's apartment at the St Germain building on Greenwich Avenue shortly after his arrest around 11am. A neighbor in his building said that other residents include a number of actors, some of whom have played serial killers in their careers.","Chris Asch, 61, and Richard Meltz, 65, were arrested for plotting to kidnap and eat women and children .

Opponents of gene patents include Dr James Watson, who won a Nobel Prize for his co-discovery of DNA's structure . A US Supreme Court hearing began today to rule on whether scientists and corporations can patent human genes. Opponents of the patents, including James Watson, the Nobel Prize-winning co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, argue that letting companies claim parts of genes will slow down or cripple lifesaving medical research. But supporters say that banning companies from profiting from their discoveries would stop them investing in genetic research. The US Patent and Trademark Office has granted patents for almost 30 years on at least 4,000 human genes to companies, universities and others that have discovered and decoded them. Patents now cover some 40 per cent of the human genome, according to a study led by Christopher Mason of Weill Cornell Medical College. If the Supreme Court rules that human DNA can be claimed as intellectual property, it would remain off limits to everyone else without the permission of the patent holder. The lawsuit, filed in 2009 by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Public Patent Foundation, challenges seven patents held by Myriad Genetics Inc on two human genes linked to breast and ovarian cancer. Myriad's BRCA analysis test looks for . mutations on the breast cancer predisposition gene, or BRCA. Women with a faulty gene have a three . to seven times greater risk of developing breast cancer and a higher . risk of ovarian cancer. Men can also carry a BRCA mutation, raising . their risk of prostate, pancreatic and other types of cancer. The mutations are most common in people of eastern European Jewish descent. Myriad sells the only BRCA gene test. The legal issues centre around whether the genes that Myriad patented, called BRCA1 and BRCA2, are natural phenomena. The US Supreme Court is to rule on whether scientists and corporations can patent human genes and stop other researchers from working on them without their permission . The American Civil Liberties Union says human DNA is a product of nature, and as such not patentable under the Patent Act, and in March 2010 a New York district court agreed. But the US Court of Appeals for the . Federal Circuit has twice ruled that genes can be patented and the case landed in the Supreme Court. Myriad argues that its patents are for genes that have been 'isolated', which makes them products of human ingenuity and, therefore, patentable. The American Medical Association, the American Society of Human Genetics, the March of Dimes and James Watson, among others, have filed briefs asking the court to invalidate Myriad's patents on BRCA1 and BRCA2. On the other side are Myriad and industry groups such as the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) and the Animal Health Institute. They say that if gene patenting is ruled invalid, companies - with no guarantee they could profit from their discoveries - would stop investing in genetics research, to the detriment not only of patients but the economy. The ACLU is arguing that isolating the DNA molecules doesn't stop them from being DNA molecules, which they say aren't patentable . 'The intellectual framework that comes out of the decision could have a significant impact on other patents - for antibiotics, vaccines, hormones, stem cells and diagnostics on infectious microbes that are found in nature,' Robert Cook-Deegan, director for genome ethics, law and policy at Duke University, said in a statement. 'This could affect agricultural biotechnology, environmental biotechnology, green-tech, the use of organisms to produce alternative fuels and other applications,' he said. 'What that means is that no other researcher or doctor can develop an additional test, therapy or conduct research on these genes,' said Karuna Jagger, executive director of Breast Cancer Action. The ACLU is arguing that isolating the DNA molecules doesn't stop them from being DNA molecules, which they say aren't patentable. 'Under this theory, Hans Dehmelt, who won the Nobel Prize for being the first to isolate a single electron from an atom, could have patented the electron itself,' said Christopher A.

It is often said that history is written by the victors. But now anyone with a web connection - and perhaps an axe to grind - can influence how they are remembered. For where once politicians were required to call on the power of their rhetoric to sway voters, now they have the power of the internet at their disposal - and it seems they aren't afraid to use it to their advantage. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has discovered almost 10,000 individual examples of people inside the ouses of Parliament directly editing Wikipedia articles. Sometimes the edits seem to be settling old scores - such as the edit by one user who added a reference to union leader Bob Crow's 'massive salary'. Other edited entries appear to be simple ego-stroking, such as the entry for Labour MP Fabian . Hamilton. His entry was edited from within one of the Houses to claim that he was subjected to ‘an unfair, . personally targeted campaign from his political opponents who used . exaggerated expenses claims and false information to attempt to . discredit a powerful incumbent who has served Leeds North East for many . years’. Meanwhile, some edits seem an attempt to reduce some of . the embarrassment caused by the expenses scandals, such as on the . Wikipedia entry for MP Clare Short. The paragraph that said 'Clare Short . admitted that she overclaimed £8,000 worth of expenses on her home and . like many other MPs claimed it was a mistake and blamed it on Commons . officials', was rewritten to read that she had ‘confirmed that in 2006 . the fees office had asked her to repay £8,000, because for three years . they had erroneously paid her full mortgage, rather than just the . interest’. Contacted by The Independent, Ms Short . said her staff were ‘angry and protective’ about inaccurate and negative . entires on her Wikipedia page and said it was quite possible that they . have been responsible for the changes. But, she said: ‘It certainly wasn’t me. I never look at it. I find it too irritating. 'The only change I know was made to my page was my grandchildren adding their names in.’ And finally, some edits seem to be simply frivolous, especially as they emanate from the building in charge of the country. Example include the edits from Parliament about the legal status of Pringles (are they crisp or cake?) or edits to the biographical data of Molly Weasley - a character from the Harry Potter series. House of Edits: Entries for MPs Clare Short and Joan Ryan were edited from within the Houses of Parliament . On a lighter, crunchier note, someone from one of the Houses took the time to update the Pringles page . The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, . which carried out the investigation on behalf of the Independent, found . that nearly one in six MPs have had their online Wikipedia entires . changed from within Parliament, and dozens of the alterations appear to . be attempts to erase embarrassing or disputed allegations made during . the 2009 expenses scandal. The bureau said all internet users inside the Houses of Parliament are routed through two previously identified IP addresses - unique numeric identifiers that act as a digital fingerprint. Wikipedia keeps a comprehensive log of every alteration ever made, with a record of which user or IP address was responsible. The bureau was then able to match Parliament's two IP addresses with the edits, and found almost 10,000 edits. According to the bureau, one of the most persistent and successful attempts to edit information was made to the page of Joan Ryan, who stepped down as a Labour MP in 2010. In 2009, the Daily Telegraph reported . that Ryan had claimed more than £4,500 for work on her home in her . Enfield constituency, before switching her designated second home to a . flat in south London. At least 10 attempts have been made from computers in Parliament to remove information about Ryan’s expenses claims and a further 20 efforts to delete the information, some from her constituency of Enfield, have also been recorded in Wikipedia’s logs. The sustained effort proved successful as there is now no mention of Ms Ryan’s Parliamentary expenses on her Wikipedia page. When contacted by the Bureau, she admitted to having altered information, but said: ‘I’ve altered it whenever there’s misleading or untruthful information been placed on it’. 'Enormous salary': Union leader Bob Crow's entry was edited . Some of the thousands of parliamentary edits found by the Bureau include: . In 2008, a user mentioned on the article of Andrew Marr that he . had taken out a superinjunction. Discussing standing legal injunctions . is a potential contempt of court . Seven changes to the ‘Laws about Incest’ page, helpfully listing the jurisdictions where it’s legal . One user reduced the minimum number of women forced into sexual . slavery by the Japanese during World War II from 60,000 to 10,000 . RMT secretary Bob Crow was the victim of an article edit which was changed to include a comment about his ‘massive salary’ An article on Chris Huhne’s register of interests was edited to note that they no longer include gold mining companies . In 2006, an editor of Huhne’s article removed a line about him . being one of a number of signatories to a letter declaring no confidence . in Charles Kennedy . Spelling errors were corrected in a passage discussing whether Pringles were legally recognised as crisps or cakes . One lobby-goer correctly observed that Former London May Ken Livingstone’s last name is indeed ‘Livingstone’ and not ‘T*atface’ One individual edited the entry on The Lord of the Rings to . describe it as ‘12 hours of utter tripe about some little bender running . around trying to find a ring with his equally benderish mates’ MP Michael Fabricant was included in a list of ‘Notable DJs'. Ryan insisted at the time that this did not constitute ‘flipping’ her second home since she had not made any claims for redecoration or refurbishment on her south London flat, which would have allowed her to claim the maximum to which she was entitled. Valuable web resource: Jimmy Wales co-founded Wikipedia . In another case six attempts were made over 2006 and 2007 to redact a passage detailing a comment given by the MP Philip Davies to the Sun newspaper for a 2006 article claiming that Muslims had been responsible for an act of vandalism. Mr Davies told the paper: ‘If there’s anyone who should f**k off it’s the Muslims who do this sort of thing’. Other users of the site promptly reinserted the passage each time. When approached by the Bureau, Mr Davies denied involvement. He said: ‘No, it certainly was not me who either removed it or asked anyone to do so,’ he said. ‘Anyone who knows anything about me knows that I do not care what people say about me - let alone care about what it might say about me on Wikipedia.’ Other disappearances include a passage detailing how Chris Kelly had emailed his fellow MPs to ask them to give his sister a job. Mr Kelly was unavailable for comment. Jon Davies, the chief executive of Wikimedia UK, the UK chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation that runs Wikipedia and its sister websites, stressed that the site was keen to see more users participating on the site. ‘We would welcome any MPs who want to become editors,’ he said. Many parliamentarians’ contributions to the site have been unwelcome, and users have been admonished dozens of times for vandalising the website. In July 2009, one administrator posted: ‘This is the last warning you will receive for your disruptive edits. The next time you disrupt Wikipedia, as you did to Eric Clapton, you will be blocked from editing.’ This investigation was carried out by the The Bureau of Investigative Journalism.","Bureau of Investigative Journalism finds 10,000 edits on Wikipedia are directly traceable to within the Houses of Parliament .

Gymnastics coach Bob Bellew walked free from court today after he admitted a string of sexual abuse charges, spanning 40 years, against girls he was tutoring . An internationally renowned gymnastics coach who sexually abused seven girls as young as six over a 40-year period has walked free from court. Bob Bellew, 66, has published books on gymnastics, taught at schools across the UK and was a former Community Coach of the Year. He also served on committees planning the 2012 Olympics and was chief coach of the Tower Hamlets Schools gym and dance display team. Bellew was also awarded the 'Order of the Smile', a UN-recognised citation for adults 'distinguished in their love, care and aid of children'. But he admitted a string of sexual abuse charges, spanning 40 years, against girls he was tutoring. He was today spared jail at Snaresbrook Crown Court by a judge who said he had demonstrated 'genuine remorse'. His outraged victims slammed the justice system in a statement after the pervert was handed a suspended sentence. They said: 'This sentence says you are allowed to go into a primary school and touch young girls and you will not be punished for it. 'This shows everything that is wrong with the British justice system. He has had to live with this for two or three years, but the victims have had it hanging over them their whole lives.' Bellew, who shook uncontrollably throughout the hearing, admitted touching three children while working at a south London primary school in the 1970s. He offered help to three of them with groin injuries, and after removing their clothes he groped them. He touched the daughter of a friend after offering her private tutoring, and another had her thigh stroked when she was invited to his home. He also admitted touching two teenagers in offences between 1998 and 2004, on the pretext of helping them perform a routine. Judge Joanna Korner handed Bellew a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and banned him from working with children. She said: 'These were not specimens of a course of conduct, but actually single offences which you engaged against these girls. 'It does seem to me that this is a case where the punishment has in effect already begun, in the effect this had on you, for the loss of your standing and the strain of waiting to find out what would happen. 'Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that this is one of the cases where punishment may be tempered with mercy.' After denying the claims for months, Bellew suddenly came clean, pleading guilty to eight of 17 charges just two weeks before he was due to stand trial. Bellew, from New Cross, south east London, admitted seven counts of indecent assault and one of sexual touching. A further nine charges were left to lie on the court file. Judge Joanna Korner handed Bellew a 15-month sentence, suspended for two years, at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) In a joint statement some of Bellew's victims who attended court said: 'You get six months in prison for taking your husband’s speeding points, but you’re allowed to touch a child under their clothes and you get a suspended sentence.' When asked if they believed his remorse was genuine they said: 'He stopped shaking soon enough when he realised he wasn't going to prison.' Describing the impact on the victims, prosecutor Rekha Kodikara said: 'One of the victims from the 1970s had excelled in sport, and it had become for her a place of sanctuary where she felt she could express herself. 'She said Mr Bellew destroyed that place by what he did. Since that incident, and over the years since she has felt unable to trust people in positions of authority. 'Accordingly, I have come to the conclusion that this is one of the cases where punishment may be tempered with mercy' - Judge Joanna Korner . 'The impact of that breach of trust has dogged her for years, she says she does not trust easily, does not let people into her circle, and it has seriously affected her marriage and her relationship with her children.' She described two sets of allegations, the first in the 1970s, and the second in the 1990s and early 2000s. She said: 'The offences would not have occurred but for the position of trust held by the defendant as a gymnastics coach, which gave him access to the victims who were young and therefore vulnerable.' Bellew  was due to stand trial in September after pleading not guilty to a number of offences in April last year. However, the second set of allegations came to light after the victims read news reports of the pending court case and contacted police. Bellew admitted eight of 17 charges against him, involving seven victims as young as six years old. In a probation report Bellew backed down from his admissions, denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims . However in a probation report he backed down from his admissions, denying the touching was sexual and passing the blame onto his victims. His lawyer Barry Kogan said: 'He has had great difficulty coming to terms with the shame of what he has done, and this is demonstrated by what he has told the probation officer, trying to deny his actions, pass them off as inappropriate not sexual, and blame the victims.' But he said his client's remorse was 'genuine', and asked the judge to ignore the comments in the report. Sentencing him, the judge said: 'You were one of the most highly regarded gym coaches in this country and much of your life has been spent doing good to others in particular young people. 'At the same time, for the seven young women, who at the time were primary school children who had come to you for coaching on the basis of your reputation and the work you had done, for them you were anything but a good influence. 'It is clear that the effect of what you did has followed at the very least three of your victims throught their adult lives.' Detective Constable Lewi Fenton, of the Metropolitan Police Service Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: 'I was shocked at the sentence and I don't think it will bring closure to the because I saw how upset they were. 'We must pay tribute to Bellew’s victims who had the courage to come forward. 'His abuse has affected them into their adult lives. 'Bellew taught at schools across the capital, and it is possible that he abused other victims who have not yet come forward. 'We would urge anyone who was assaulted by him to contact their local police station in the first instance. The MPS can be reached on 101.'","Bob Bellew admitted a string of sexual abuse charges spanning 40 years .

Two parishioners told the Los Angeles Times that a man in his teens or early 20s leaped from the pews and stabbed the choir's lead singer at after communion at St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church. 'While that was going on, people were just panicking. It was scary, you wouldn’t think something like that would happen in church,' said Reyes Stinson, 18. Another member of the congregation, Vanessa Lucero, 14, said she was sitting right behind the man, who 'was kind of twitchy, sketchy looking. He had a tattoo of an upside-down star on his wrist.' She said the man climbed over the pews, punched and then repeatedly stabbed the choir's lead singer. An off-duty police officer along with other parishioners at the church managed to subdued the attacker and held him down until police arrived.

Nobody at the church recognised the man and the police have confirmed he was not a parishioner at the church. Father John C. Daniel spoke to the Times: 'At this point, we’re just trying to deal with it, it sounds like everybody is going to be OK.' The choirs lead singer had several stab wounds on his arm and his jacket was also ripped. Archbishop of Santa Fe Michael Sheehan released a statement saying he was saddened by the attack. 'I pray for all who have been harmed, their families, the parishioners and that nothing like this will ever happen again,' Sheehan said. In a statement, Albuquerque police have confirmed the man is now in custody but have not yet released him name. They also have been unable to determine a motive for the attacks.","Four people were stabbed at a church in northwest Albuquerque .

Of obscure origin, it appears that most of them were put in place in the Fifties and Sixties, as the U.S.-USSR superpower arms race led to the unprecedented fears of mutual annihilation. Their existence has been highlighted by a recent newsletter by the U.S.-based Center for Land Use Interpretation, a group dedicated to researching 'human interaction with the Earth's surface'. The calibration sites follow a general form established by the U.S. Airforce and Nasa, the CLUI notes. Consisting of a concrete pad measuring 78ft by 53ft and coated in a heavy black and white paint, they are decorated with patterns consisting of parallel and perpendicular bars in 15 or so different sizes. This pattern, sometimes referred to as a 5:1 aspect Tri-bar Array, is similar to those used to determine the zoom resolution of microscopes, telescopes, cameras, and scanners. The targets function like an optician's eye chart, with the smallest group of bars discernable marking the limit of the resolution for the camera being tested, according to the CLUI.

This allows a single test flight to test aircraft surveillance instruments on all the targets without having to change course or loop back. According to the CLUI: 'There is some variation in the size and shape of the targets at Edwards, suggesting updates and modifications for specific programs. 'A number of the targets there also have aircraft hulks next to them, added to provide additional, realistic subjects for testing cameras.

The wife of Olympic rower James Cracknell has told of the moment she thought he was going to kill her. Beverley Turner says the gold medallist tried to strangle her during an argument in the months  following a cycling accident that nearly killed him. In a book they wrote together, the couple talk in haunting detail about their struggle to cope with the aggressive, disorientated stranger that Mr Cracknell became after suffering a brain injury in the accident two years ago. As they were: James Cracknell and Beverley Turner pictured in 2006 . Gruelling: James Cracknell was on a 2,500-mile cycle rife across the US when he was hit by a petrol tanker . In one chapter, his wife wrote: ‘It . has been another long, upsetting, difficult day that culminates in . Croyde [their nine-year-old son] crying himself to sleep after another . hurtful telling-off from James. ‘I lose it. I say I’ve had enough and . he needs to get better elsewhere because it is too much for us. I’m . angry and exhausted. Sick of being bullied, I try to push past James and . he flips. He grabs me round the neck and, with one powerful hand, holds . me down on the bed. He tightens his grip until I can’t breathe. Fears: Beverley said she genuinely thought her husband was going to kill her when he began grabbing her neck . Wedding bells: James and Beverley were married in the Forest of Dean in 2002 . ‘I’d like to say that I couldn’t . believe it was happening, but I could – there was a terrible . inevitability about it. We are alone, drowning in a sea of fear, stress . and confusion. ‘I try to take a breath. For a . moment, I genuinely think he might kill me. I pray that a flicker of . empathy will ignite, just for a moment, among the broken neurons . struggling to fire in his brain, behind his deadened eyes. ‘He lets go. I grab the phone and . lock myself in the bathroom. I call my sister, Cal, who lives round the . corner, in a panic. “Please come round.

A new father-of-two spent an hour and ten minutes officially dead before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. David Binks, 28, was brought back to life 70 minutes after a cardiac arrest at his home in Houghton-le-Spring, Sunderland . In a desperate bid to revive him, his quick-thinking partner Lynette Crozier immediately began CPR, which medics say saved his life. Paramedics and then hospital staff continued the resuscitation and shocked him 16 times before his heartbeat returned. Medical Marvel: David Brinks came back to life after being clinically dead for 70 minutes. Mr Brinks' family including partner Lynette and daughter Ella (pictured) were told to expect the worst . Despite his family being told to expect brain damage, David has astounded doctors, and is now back at home recovering. The dad-of-two has since been told that his case was similar to that of footballer Fabrice Muamba, who collapsed during the Spurs-Bolton match last year. Mum-of-one Lynette, 22, a former care worker, said: 'David was asleep next to me but I woke up and he was gasping for breath and wasn’t responding. 'I just started shaking him. I knew he had stopped breathing and his heart wasn’t beating and I just called for an ambulance. 'I started doing CPR and chest compressions until the ambulance got there. It was only for about three minutes but it felt like a lifetime. 'Our little girl was shouting for her daddy. I just thought that was it. I thought we’d lost him. Back on his feet: Mr Binks holds hands with his partner Lynette who said she thought she he had died . 'It wasn’t until he got to the hospital that we got him back.' Following the attack in March, David spent five days on a ventilator in the intensive care unit at Sunderland Royal Hospital before spending a further 11 days on a ward and two days at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. His family, including his two little girls Georgia, seven, and Ella, one, were told to brace themselves for the worst as it was extremely likely David would be left brain damaged. But the former groundsman amazed medics with his recovery. Lynette said: 'They said that if David was to wake up he would suffer brain damage but they didn’t know what the extent would be because he was out for long. 'I just couldn’t believe it when he woke up. He’s been so lucky.' Despite undergoing a series of tests it is not known what caused his heart to stop. David said: 'I just went to bed on the Saturday night and I can’t remember anything after that until I woke up in hospital. 'I didn’t believe everyone when they told me I’d had a heart attack. I just couldn’t believe it. I’ve been so lucky. 'When they carried out tests at the Freeman they couldn’t find anything wrong with me.' David’s mother Beverley, a florist, has praised the North East Ambulance service. She said: 'I can’t thank the three paramedics and Lynette enough – they saved my David and I owe everything to them. Mr Binks spent five days on a ventilator following the attack in March. He was kept in intensive care and treated in hospital for two weeks. His family have praised his medical team for their miracle work . Mr Binks said he was delighted to be reuinted with his one-year-old daughter Ella . 'The doctors have told me he was technically dead for one hour and ten minutes. 'I thank God his partner Lynette was there with him when it happened. '""If she wasn’t he probably would not have been with us now.' Paramedics Vicky Adamson, Gail Savage and Karen Millican were called to the scene.

It’s results like this that make our jobs so rewarding.' Head of the cardiac department, at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital Dr Ian Purcell  said starting CPR quickly is the key to survival. The cardiologist believes Lynette saved David’s life. He said: 'Had she not started CPR when she did he would probably have not been here today.' 'The partner, the paramedics and the hospital staff, involved here deserve a lot of credit.' Previously doctors believed after 20 minutes of resuscitation the chances of survival were very low but in the last year they have received information that suggests the survival rate increases after the 20-minute mark. Dr Purcell added: 'It does help that this man was young, fit and healthy. Other groups of people who do well in these situations are children. A lot of young children can survive this.'","28-year-old David Binks was technically dead for over an hour after cardiac arrest .

Amanda Knox was repeatedly subjected to sexual assaults from staff and inmates while in an Italian prison, she has claimed in a new memoir. The American student says that a doctor measured her private parts after she was arrested, while another medic wrongly told her she was HIV-positive. And one senior prison official allegedly harassed her on multiple occasions, asking if she would sleep with him and adding: 'What positions do you like most?' Miss Knox, 25, spent four years in prison after being accused of murdering her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher, while the pair were studying in Perugia. She was released in 2011 after an appeal against her conviction was upheld, and has now released an autobiography, entitled Waiting to Be Heard, in which she tells her side of the story. In the book, she claims that the sexual humiliation began as soon as she was arrested along with her boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, according to the Daily News. A doctor ordered her to strip and proceeded to examine her genitals with his hand as police looked on. 'He measured and photographed my intimate parts,' she writes. The pair fell under suspicion when Miss Kercher, 21, from Leeds, was found dead in the home she shared with Miss Knox - she was half-naked and had been stabbed multiple times in the neck, prompting speculation she was the victim of a sex game gone wrong. Cleared: The American student after a judge upheld her murder appeal in October 2011, allowing her to leave prison after four years in which she was subjected to a series of assaults . The American initially confessed to having witnessed the killing, which she blamed on Patrick Lumumba, manager of the bar in Perugia where she worked. But she now says that the confession was a result of her rough treatment by Italian officials - up to eight policemen would stand over her shouting 'You're lying!' as she was confined in a tiny room, and another officer twice hit her in the back of her head. After being convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 years in prison, Miss Knox says she found herself receiving unwanted attention from Raffaele Argiro, a top prison warden. He apparently demanded that she come to see him every evening, and grilled her about her sex life. She writes in the book: 'He'd say, ""I hear you like to have sex. How do you like to have sex? What positions do you like most? Would you like to have sex with me? No? I'm too old for you?""' Couple: Miss Knox with then-boyfirend Raffaele Sollecito soon after the murder of Meredith Kercher . Miss Knox even suggests that the guard made medical officials lie to her and tell her she was HIV-positive, as an excuse to have more sexually explicit conversations with her. After the examination in which she was diagnosed, Mr Argiro allegedly said to her: 'Don't worry. I'd still have sex with you right now. Promise me you'll have sex with me.' He has since retired, and denies any wrongdoing. Miss Knox was also harassed by fellow prisoners - a bisexual roommate kissed her on the lips and tried to convince her to have an affair. She writes in the book that she even considered suicide as she waited to hear the result of her appeal. Experience: Miss Knox's new book, right, recounts her trial on suspicion of killing Meredith Kercher, left . The American insists in her memoir that she always got on with Miss Kercher, saying: 'We developed a comfortable familiarity in a short time. 'I treated Meredith as my confidante. Meredith treated me with respect and a sense of humour.' She also takes the chance to refute the story that she turned cartwheels in the police station after she was arrested - instead, she claims, she was asked by a guard how flexible she was after she mentioned that she enjoyed yoga. After she was released in October 2011, Miss Knox returned to her native Seattle and has now entered into a new relationship. Last month her acquittal was overturned, meaning the case will be retried in Italy, but the 25-year-old is very unlikely to be extradited to stand trial in person. Her memoir will be released in the U.S. on March 30, but will not be published in the UK because of fears it could fall foul of strict British libel laws.","American student reveals assaults started as soon as she was arrested .

Telescope, which will have a 138-foot (42-meter)-long mirror. To build the world's largest telescope at the summit of Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano won approval from the state Board of Land and Natural Resources on Friday. The decision clears the way for the group managing the Thirty Meter Telescope project to negotiate a sublease for land with the University of Hawaii. Some Native Hawaiian groups had petitioned against the project, arguing it would defile the mountain's sacred summit. Native Hawaiian tradition holds that high altitudes are sacred and are a gateway to heaven. In the past, only high chiefs and priests were allowed at Mauna Kea's summit. The mountain is home to one confirmed burial site and perhaps four more. Environmentalists also petitioned to stop the telescope on the grounds it would harm habitat for the rare wekiu bug. The board approved the project anyway, but imposed two dozen conditions including a requirement that employees be trained in culture and natural resources.

'Leo tried to hook his body around me. He literally straddled me and said 'Stay down.

A Boeing 787 operated by Ethiopian Airlines flew from Ethiopia to Kenya's capital today in the first commercial flight since air safety authorities grounded the Dreamliners in January. The jet flew from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa to Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport after Boeing's redesigned battery system was approved by safety experts. Incidents with smouldering batteries on two different flights led to the fleet being put on hold. US Federal Aviation Administration said Boeing's new system sharply reduces the risk of fire. Ethiopian Airlines' 787 Dreamliner takes-off on its first journey since global fleet was grounded in January . A fire erupted in a battery aboard a Japan Airlines 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport in January. The fleet was grounded after a second incident nine days later led to an emergency landing in Japan . Thumbs up: Passengers breathe a sight of relief as they disembark a Dreamliner jet. They are the first passengers to fly on Boeing 787in months . Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing for Boeing commercial airplanes (pictured) was amongst the passengers, to see that everything ran smoothly . An Ethiopian Airlines manager sits in the cockpit of their 787 Dreamliner after it arrived at the Nairobi airport . Richard J. Horigan, a Boeing engineer, told reporters in Nairobi this week that all potential causes of battery fire have been eliminated with the new system. But he noted that the root cause of smouldering batteries experienced by the two different 787s may never be known because the evidence was destroyed by heat. There are a total of 50 Dreamliners in service around the world. The 787 is Boeing's newest and most technologically advanced plane. It is the world's first airliner made . mostly from lightweight composite materials. It also relies on . electronic systems rather than hydraulic or mechanical systems to a . greater degree than any other airliner. Boeing is the first airliner to . make extensive use of lithium ion batteries, which are lighter, recharge . faster and can hold more energy than other types of batteries. Boeing has billed the plane to its customers as 20 percent more fuel . efficient than other midsized airliners. Once the FAA approves the fix on individual planes, airlines can start flying them again. United Airlines, the only US airline with the planes, moved one of its six 787s to a Boeing facility in San Antonio, Texas, on Tuesday so it can get the battery fixed. There are 50 Dreamliners in service around the world. Once the FAA approves the fix on individual planes, airlines can start flying them again . Ethiopian Airlines became the world's first carrier to resume flying Boeing Co's 787 Dreamliner passenger jets today. Airline executives greeted passengers on board . The US Federal Aviation Administration has approved Boeing's redesigned battery system, which the company says sharply reduces the risk of fire . Neither of the battery incidents involved a United jet. Boeing said Wednesday that deliveries of the 787 should resume in early May. The plane's grounding on Jan. 16, an enormous black eye for Boeing, marked the first time since 1979 that FAA had ordered every plane of a particular type to stay out of the air for safety reasons. UBS analyst David Strauss estimated last month that the 787 will cost Boeing $6 billion this year. Besides the battery problems, the plane already costs more to build than it brings in from customers. Boeing had delivered 50 planes to eight airlines in seven countries when a fire erupted in a battery aboard a Japan Airlines 787 parked at Boston's Logan International Airport on Jan. 7. The FAA and other authorities grounded the entire fleet after a second incident nine days later led to an emergency landing by an All Nippon Airways 787 in Japan. Boring 787 is said to be the world's finest airliner. It is made from lightweight composite materials . Boeing said new batteries and kits with the parts for the new battery systems are ready to be shipped immediately. The 787s will get the fix in approximately the order they were delivered, Boeing said. 'The Boeing team is ready to help get our customers' 787s back in the air where they belong,' said Ray Conner, who runs Boeing Co.'s commercial airplane division. United Airlines already has domestic 787 flights scheduled for May 31. Spokeswoman Christen David said no other schedule changes have been made yet. Its launch of Denver-to-Tokyo Narita flights is still planned for June 10, but that will depend on installing the battery fix by then, she said. 'We are mapping out a return-to-service plan, and we look forward to getting our 787s back in the air,' she said by e-mail.","Two-hour flight from Ethiopia to Kenyan capital, Nairobi marks return of jet .

They did not say what role they played in approving the design of the building but it was clear that the arrests amounted to a widening crackdown. Protesters targeted Primark's London flagship store today to demand compensation for workers killed in Bangladesh. The high street giant occupied a floor of the building and workers were suppliers to the brand. A petition has now been launched calling for Primark and other retail brands which used the building to compensate the families of workers killed or injured. Speaking outside Primark's Oxford Street store in central London, Murray Worthy, from campaign group War on Want, said: 'We're here to send a clear message to Primark that the 300 deaths in the Bangladesh building collapse were not an accident - they were entirely preventable deaths. 'If Primark had taken its responsibility to those workers seriously, no one need have died this week.' Mr Worthy said there were reports of garment factory workers being told to return to work despite cracks being found in the building on Tuesday. The campaign group are calling for a full inquiry into the collapse. Campaigners also want Primark, with Matalan and Mango which used the building, to sign an agreement to end the 'appallingly unsafe factory conditions' in the country. Mr Worthy said: 'Unfortunately we see things like this all too often. Just three months ago there was an enormous fire killing over 100 people so this isn't a one off. 'This is part of a pattern and it's a pattern that Primark needs to address.'","The survivor was found alive despite having spent four days in the rubble .

The Boston Marathon bombing suspect is being held in a small cell with a steel door at a federal medical detention center about 40 miles outside the city, a federal official said Saturday. Federal Medical Center Devens spokesman John Collauti described the conditions under which 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was being held in the Ayer facility after being moved there from a hospital Friday. Tsarnaev was injured during a police chase in which his brother, also a suspect in the bombing, was fatally wounded. Collauti said in a telephone interview that Tsarnaev is in secure housing where authorities can monitor him. His cell has a solid steel door with an observation window and a slot for passing food and medication. Collauti wouldn't discuss specific details related to Tsarnaev, but said that typically medical workers making rounds each shift monitor the inmates. He said guards also keep an eye on some cells with video cameras. Also, inmates in the more restrictive section do not have access to TVs or radios, but can read books and other materials, he said. 'Really this type of facility is fully capable of handling him and it's not that much of an inconvenience because it's more or less business as usual,' Collauti said.

New digs: Tsarnaev's cell has a solid steel door with an observation window and a slot for passing food and medication . Tsarnaev left Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center where he was controversially treated just yards from the wards containing many of his victims. His new home is part of the minimum security facility on the decommissioned Fort Devens U.S. Army base. It treats federal prisoners and detainees who require specialized long-term medical or mental health care. It has been referred to in the past as 'agreeable' and 'fairly pleasant'. It is designated as an administrative facility, which means it has inmates from different security classifications, from white-collar criminals to mobsters and sex offenders. The medical center currently houses 1,000 inmates with 124 in a minimum-security satellite prison camp. It costs around $157 for each inmate per day. According to its website, these minimum security prison camps, have dormitory housing, a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio, and limited or no perimeter fencing. They are usually work-and-program oriented and inmates help serve the labor needs of the larger institution or base. Scroll down for video .

The . medical center inmates are often allowed to leave the facility to see . outside specialists and for tests and medical procedures not available . in the medical center. The . Federal Bureau of Prisons is focused on preventing rehabilitation by . encouraging inmates to participate in a range of programs that have been . proven to reduce repeat offending. The level of security which Tsarnaev . will be held under depends on his changing circumstances - because he . is a pretrial inmate - and he has no set protocol at this time. Tsarnaev . will have access to medical and dental care, and the prison's handbook . states that inmates have the right to a healthy, nutritious diet, as . well as information about staying healthy while behind bars. Tsarnaev admitted to his role in the attacks to the FBI this week - but apparently clammed up when finally read his Miranda rights. The minimum security facility, on the . decommissioned Fort Devens U.S. Army base, treats federal prisoners and . detainees who require specialized long-term medical or mental health . care. It is designated as an administrative . facility, which means it has inmates from different security . classifications, from white-collar criminals to mobsters and sex . offenders. The medical center currently houses 1,000 inmates with 130 in a minimum-security satellite prison camp. According to its website, these . minimum security prison camps have dormitory housing, a relatively low . staff-to-inmate ratio and limited or no perimeter fencing. The prison has regular onsite specialists in cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, surgery, neurology and pulmonology. Current and former inmates are: John Franzese, 96, former Underboss of the Colombo crime family in New York City. He is currently serving an eight-year sentence for racketeering conspiracy in 2011. He is also suspected in numerous Mafia-related murders. Daniel Van Pelt, 48, a member of the New Jersey State Assembly from 2008-2009. He is currently serving a 41-month sentence for bribery. He was arrested in 2010 for accepting $10,000 to provide environmental permits for a development project. Sabri Benkahla, 38, member of the Virginia jihad network. He is currently serving a ten-year sentence for perjury and obstruction of justice after he was convicted of lying to FBI agents and a grand jury about a training camp run by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani terrorist organization with ties to al-Qaeda. William Masso, former NYPD officer. He is currently serving a 57-month sentence after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in 2012 for leading a gun trafficking ring comprised of active and retired police officers. He had been communicating with . law enforcement officials by writing on a pad after suffering an injury . to his throat during the frenzied manhunt for him which renders him . unable to talk. However, . the moment he was read his rights on Monday - which as a citizen of the . United States entitle him to the constitutional right to remain silent . and seek a lawyer - he stopped communicating. Indeed, . it has been claimed that federal agents were surprised when a . magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office . entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, four officials . and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him. This apparent confusion came after the White House decided against treating Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant. It is unclear as to whether this will . matter in court as the FBI says Tsarnaev has already confessed to a witness. A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said: 'Before being advised of his rights, . the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, . Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the . attack'. The debate over whether suspected . terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a sticking point. Many Republicans believe they hinder intelligence gathering. The Department of Justice has said . investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other . threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. Investigators have found . pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and are analyzing . them, officials said. One official described the detonator as 'close-controlled,' meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.

The Sly Fox Brewing Company has come up with the novel idea of a 360 degree lid. Drinkers peel off the top of the can and enjoy the contents as if drinking from a regular cup. The technology has been developed by Crown Holdings, Inc. The company say the entire lid of the can is removable and 'essentially eliminates the need for separate glassware.' Instead . of cracking open a small hole on the top of the can, the 360 Lid allows . the top to be completely removed, creating an aluminum beer cup. It functions like that of a soup can, with a peel-back lid, exposing a 1.75-inch opening. Sly Fox Brewing Company will become the first brewery in North America to utilize the innovative 360 Lid. 'This . technology allows the full flavor and aroma of the beer to hit the . drinker's senses and makes the can an even more appealing package for . outdoor activities and situations where you want to be able to move around and sip your beer easily,' said Sly Fox Brewing Company head brewer Brian O'Reilly. 'Craft . brew enthusiasts want to enjoy their beer as it was meant to be . experienced whether at home or at an event and the 360 Lid makes the . beverage can the perfect vessel to do just that.'

The metal too is 100% recyclable. The lid seems to have had a fairly . positive reaction online although some are concerned that the circular . design might simple lead to unfortunate instances of people cutting . their fingers or lips on the thin metallic edge. The designers say the top of the can has been specially designed to be sipped out of and has a blunted edge. Others . have also pointed out that lid can be thrown out to create litter just . like the old pull tabs of the 1970s and of course the drink is more . likely to spill when walking or driving.

"Students who texted the most displayed evidence of racism . Compulsive texters more likely to have shallow and rapid thoughts .

UPDATED: . 00:45 EST, 13 April 2013 . Teenagers who text more than 100 times a day tend to be shallow, image-obsessed and driven by wealth - not to mention pretty bad at spelling. The study from the University of Winnipeg suggests that a lot can be learned about a person’s personality simply from the number of texts they send. The most incessant texters often turn out to be a slightly more racist than others. Scroll down for video... Not getting the message: Research suggests frequent texters tend to be shallow . Personality: Psychologists say those who text more than 100 times a day are more interested in wealth and image . The data was gathered over a period of three years from 2,300 psychology students at the University of Winnipeg. The theory the university study tried to test was that constant use of twitter and texting for communication results in a world where people have quick and shallow thoughts. People with superficial opinions with little substance beneath. The results indicate that students who text frequently place less importance on moral, aesthetic and spiritual goals and greater importance on wealth and image. Long term: The study conducted over a period of three years amongst 2,300 students at the University of Winnipeg . Superficial thinking: Texting and using Twitter for extreme periods of time can change your thought process . Strikingly, the study states those who text more than 100 times a day were 30 per cent less likely to feel strongly that leading an ethical, principled life was important, in comparison to those who texted 50 times or less a day. The students texted, some spoke on cellphones, and some did neither. The students rated their feelings towards different social groups. Those who had been texting the most, rated ethnic-minority groups more negatively. In the most extreme cases, 30 per cent of the survey-takers texted more than 200 times a day and that 12 per cent texted at least 300 times a day. Priorities: Heavy teen texters place less importance on moral, aesthetic, and spiritual goals, and greater importance on wealth and image . The study was inspired by the 'shallowing hypothesis' first described by Nicholas Carr in his 2010 book The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains. It does not suggest that shallow mindedness is at all new, merely the growth of texting and twitter has resulted in new avenues for expression that has made such thoughts more acceptable. The theory states 'ultra brief social media like texting and Twitter encourages rapid, relatively shallow thought and consequently very frequent daily use of such media should be associated with cognitive and moral shallowness.' 'The values and traits most closely associated with texting frequency are surprisingly consistent with Carr’s conjecture that new information and social media technologies may be displacing and discouraging reflective thought,' Dr. Paul Trapnell, associate professor of psychology at The University of Winnipeg, said in a statement. 'We still don’t know the exact cause of these modest but consistent associations, but we think they warrant further study.'","Students who texted the most displayed evidence of racism .

"Power was lost on cruise ship caused by a 'mechanical issue' Ship was close to the end of a five-day cruise . Latest in a long list of cruise ship calamities with Carnival . Company announced $300 million safety and electrical upgrade to its fleet of ships . By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 11:31 EST, 20 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:04 EST, 20 April 2013 . Another Carnival cruise ship has lost power at sea. This time the lights went out on the 2,056-passenger Carnival Ecstasy. The ship was sailing off the coast of Florida at the time of the incident. Worst place to have a fire: In 1998 the Carnival Ecstasy was ablaze after a fire in the laundry room. Thankfully, this weeks outage saw the light go out for less than half an hour . It made for more uneasy moments for passengers who had decided to choose the Carnival Cruise line for their spring vacation. Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen said the cause of the power failure on Wednesday evening was a mechanical issue. The company say the problem was quickly fixed. The power failure shut down hotel services and the engines on the Carnival Ecstasy on Wednesday night as it was approaching its home port of Port Canaveral, Florida after a five-day cruise. Speaking to WESH-TV passengers described the moment when everything on the ship suddenly went black. Adrift: This weeks power outage left the Carnival Ecstasy floating in the Atlantic as it was returning to port . 'We were at dinner and all the lights went out, the whole ship went dark and the engine stopped,' said Mattie Lackore. 'We were dead in the water.' She said her daughter made her pack protein bars and water just in case something went wrong during the voyage. 'Knowing what happened in the past, you kind of wonder. We got nervous,' said passenger Janine Bratcher. The problem lasted for 12 minutes. The Ecstasy is now on a four-day voyage to the Bahamas. Carnival Ecstasy carries approximately 2,000 passengers and 920 crew members. It made its first voyage in 1991 and was refurbished in 2009. In 1998 a fire onboard the ship caused minor injuries to 14 crew members and eight passengers, and 'extensive damage.' It was likely caused by welding by crew members in the main laundry room, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Upgrade: Carnival is hoping scenes like this will be a thing of the past. The company is spending $300 million upgrading its fire prevention and generator capacity on its fleet of 24 ships . Bad run: Carnival has had a number of incidents in recent months with at least four ships affected . The latest power cut happened just as the Carnival Corporation announced they are to spend more than $300 million to improve the reliability of its 24 ships. Each ship will get an additional emergency generator. There will also be upgrades to each ships fire systems and engine-related electrical components. The company said the idea for the fixes came after a review that took place after the Carnival Triumph engine room fire in February. In that instance, the ship was left adrift in the Gulf of Mexico forcing 4,000 passengers and crew to be stranded at sea for days, without power or working toilets. Passengers described miserable conditions as the ship was towed to Mobile, Alabama. The past couple of months have seen a number of other incidents to added to Carnival's wrap sheet: . Last week the Carnival Fascination failed a recent CDC health inspection; in March the Carnival Legend developed a propulsion system problem and the Carnival Dream became stuck in port after its emergency diesel generator failed.","Power was lost on cruise ship caused by a 'mechanical issue'

Hero: Boydy the dog, who stayed with his owner Herbert Schutz for four days after he crashed his car . Trapped and seriously injured beneath the wreckage of his car, 76-year-old Herbert Schutz thought he was facing certain death. In agony and without protection from the elements, he knew the chances of being found quickly on his remote farm at the foot of an Australian mountain range were slim. But luckily for Mr Schutz,  his faithful sheepdog Boydy was with him. Boydy knew just what to do – he snuggled next to his owner to keep him warm as temperatures fell to  4C (39F). He even refused to leave his master’s side when rescuers finally located them four days later. Mr Schutz became trapped after his four-wheel-drive vehicle crashed into a tree on his property near Rylstone, in central New South Wales, on Friday. He managed to clamber out but as he did so the car rolled over, pinning him under the chassis. He suffered a fractured skull, two broken hips and a dislocated shoulder. Neighbours set out to look for Mr Schutz after his worried daughter rang on Monday to tell them she had not been able to contact her father. One neighbour, Eric Merritt, and his friend Julian Barrett discovered the upturned vehicle at the foot of the Nullo mountains yesterday afternoon. ‘We saw the car and that no one was in it,’ Mr Merritt said. ‘Then his dog ran around the front of the car and then we heard him call for the dog. That’s when we found him.’ Mr Merritt said Mr Schutz had Boydy’s hair all over him, a sign that the dog had provided some body warmth to help his owner combat the low night-time temperatures. ‘Even when we found him, the dog ran straight to his side and cuddled up to him. He didn’t want to leave him even then,’ Mr Merritt said. Ordeal: The car under which Mr Schutz was trapped for four days . Recovery: His daughter, who declined to give her name, released a statement today saying it was 'amazing' that he was now remaining conscious and lucid in hospital . Mr Schutz told his rescuers that several of his horses had approached during his ordeal and some of  his internal injuries may have occurred as they accidentally trampled him while walking around  the wreckage. His daughter, who declined to give her name, released a statement last night saying it was ‘amazing’ that Mr Schutz, who had no food or water with him, had survived his ordeal. She said she wanted to express her ‘deepest gratitude to neighbours for responding so quickly to her requests to check on his wellbeing after she could not get in contact with him’. ‘She is extremely thankful to her neighbours for locating her father and then staying with him until the emergency and rescue services arrived,’ the statement said. She paid tribute to the emergency services and the ‘fantastic’ staff at John Hunter Hospital in the town of Newcastle, 100 miles north of Sydney, where Mr Schutz is recovering from his ordeal. Although doctors described his condition last night as still being ‘serious’, his daughter added: ‘He is in very good care and is conscious and lucid at the moment, which  is amazing given what he has  been through.’","Herbert Schutz, 76, lay in agony after crashing into a tree on his farm .

Two women have been tortured for three days and then beheaded in a remote village in Papua New Guinea after being accused of witchcraft. A team of police rushed to the scene - but were forced to stand by and watch the victims being decapitated with axes as locals refused to let them come to their aid. A large crowd kept the police at bay within sight of the clearing where the women were lying trussed up on the ground. Villagers on the island of Bougainville ignored orders to let them go, and instead set about them with axes and knives. Villagers: Residents of the island of Bougainville have executed two women for witchcraft (other locals are pictured in this file photo) Brutal: In February, a young woman was burnt alive on a pile of tyres (pictured) for allegedly killing a boy . The women, from the village of Tandorima, were accused of using sorcery to kill a popular schoolteacher who died a few weeks ago. 'We couldn't do anything to help these two women,' said Central Bougainville police chief Herman Birengka. 'My men were threatened when they went to the area to negotiate the release of the women. We were helpless. We couldn't do anything to help them because of the threats made against us.' He said the mob had burned down houses in the women's village, forcing their relatives to flee into the jungle. 'These killings were both barbaric and senseless,' Mr Birengka said. Remote: The killings happened in a small village located on the island of Bougainville . Sorcery . and witchcraft is widely believed in Papua New Guinea and is commonly . practiced in remote villages across the island nation. The . cost of a witch doctor revealing a cause of death or casting out an . evil spirit is usually 1000 New Guinean kina (£303), plus a pig and a . bag of rice, . In 1971, whilst still a colony, the country introduced a Sorcery Act to criminalise the practice. However . the law has recently seen a rise in attacks on innocent people accused . of black magic, such as that on Miss Leniata, and convictions by . ‘kangaroo courts’ made up of of local village elders. As a result the Papua New Guinean law reform commission proposing to repeal the law. Last . July, 29 people were arrested accused of black magic and cannibalism . after allegedly murdering seven people in order to eat their brains and . use their genitals for sorcery rituals. In 2009 a man was hacked to pieces by machetes after a ‘kangaroo court’ convicted him of sorcery. The gruesome murders follow a number of . sorcery-related killings on the Papua New Guinea mainland, mostly in . remote highland villages. Earlier this year a young woman accused of being a witch and causing the death of a young boy was dragged to a rubbish dump and burned alive, with police once again unable to help because of threats by the crowd. 'I wish we could have helped these two women,' said Mr Birengka in a reference to the latest killings. 'But the villagers who had kidnapped the women were armed with five high-powered firearms, knives and axes.' He told the Post Courier newspaper that the two women were attacked at their village homes at night and taken to the nearby village of Lopele, where the mob accused them of practicing sorcery and bringing about the death of the teacher. They were tortured for three days and nights, receiving numerous knife wounds, before being dragged out to a clearing to face execution. Learning of the imminent murders, police desperately tried to bring in mediators, but all efforts to prevent the deaths failed. 'We did not want to resort to force as the whole situation could have turned nasty with more lives at stake,' Mr Birengka said. 'Even so, I'm disgusted with my officers for failing to find a way of stopping these people who showed utter disregard to law and justice. 'While they might well have been threatened, those police should have tried harder from the very beginning.'","Women taken from home in Papua New Guinea after popular teacher died .

A man convicted of hacking to death a woman he claimed was a witch has been sentenced to jail for 30 years in Papua New Guinea. The 21-year-old man from the central highlands, where other so-called witches have received severe punishment, began his sentence as the country reels from the shock of the gang rape of a U.S. academic. The rape of the unidentified 32-year-old American last Friday has resulted in scores of police searching the island where the incident occurred in the hope of finding the offenders in the untamed jungles. Over the years there have been numerous accounts of 'witch killings', with the victims in many cases being attacked with bush knives and their bodies burned in Papua New Guinea . Her ordeal was yet another example of the violence women experience in the country lying to the north of Australia - particularly any suspected of practising sorcery to bring about the death of someone. Many perpetrators who wreak vengeance on suspected witches escape justice - but this time villager Saku Aiya has been brought before a national court where he heard a judge tell him that his killing of a suspected witch was 'senseless, barbaric and brutal'. Judge Mekeo Gauli said that for too long women groups had been asking for tough sentences to be imposed on those who murdered women they claimed were using sorcery against others. The court was told that Aiya and two others blamed the death of their brother on witchcraft - and accused their uncle's wife, Penny Toyo. In the early hours of June 26, 2010, Aiya and the two who are still at large went to Miss Toyo's home and held the family hostage with home-made guns. Then they set about attacking Miss Toyo with machetes and an axe, striking her on an arm, neck and head. Miss Toyo's family told the court how they watched helplessly as the ferocious attack took place. They could only watch, they said, as 'her blood splattered across the floor before she collapsed and died'. Barbaric: The 21-year-old man began his sentence as the country reacted to the gang rape of a U.S. academic (pictured) who has spoken about her ordeal to highlight the violence experienced by women in Papua New Guinea . A senior police officer admitted that this was the first sorcery-related killing to reach the national court, although many other similar crimes occurred. 'So many such cases are reported but rarely go through to the high court as relatives accept their own customary ways of settlement in the village courts,' said Senior Sergeant Simon Mek, acting commander of the Porgera police station, in whose district the crime occurred. A spokeswoman for women's groups, Miss Pinema Vakai, told the paper that the court decision to send Aiya to jail for 30 years was 'good and encouraged women to stop accepting compensation and should instead take these matters to court.' Referring to the kinds of payments that were made to compensate for murders, Miss Vakai said: 'We don't want compensation payments for our sister's death - we have pigs, we have money. 'No compensation can bring our sister back to life.' The judge said that in his view some people were using sorcery as an excuse to terminate someone's life though the suspect may not be a sorcerer. But he said accusations of sorcery were becoming prevalent, yet only a handful were reported in the local media. Earlier this year a young woman accused of sorcery was dragged from her home in the central highlands and burned to death on a rubbish dump. In regional Bougainville a woman accused of being a witch was beheaded in front of a large crowd. Over the years there have been numerous accounts of 'witch killing', with the victims in many cases being attacked with bush knives and their bodies burned. An academic from the U.S. has spoken out about being gang raped in Papua New Guinea to highlight the violence suffered by women throughout the country . Meanwhile as the hunt continues for the nine armed men who attacked the US academic, police said they knew that one of the perpetrators was an escaped prisoner. The 32-year-old woman, who was conducting research into exotic birds in a remote forest on Karkar Island, was walking along a bush track with her husband and a guide on Friday when they were set upon by the gang armed with knives and rifles. Her husband and the guide were stripped and bound by the men, who then used a bush knife to hack off the woman's hair before raping her in a terrifying ordeal lasting 20 minutes. The woman chose to speak out about the horrific attack - condemned by the country's prime minister Peter O'Neil as 'the cowardly act of animals' - to highlight the violence that women in Papua New Guinea experience. The U.S. woman, who posed for a photograph but did not want to reveal her identity, spoke to media in Port Moresby as she and her husband waited for a flight to leave the country. Relaying an ordeal that has sent shock waves throughout the country, the woman said the men first ordered her husband and the guide to strip naked before they were tried to trees. Then they turned to the woman. Her clothes were torn off, her hands were bound and her blonde hair was chopped off with bush knives. She was then raped one by one by the gang for a terrifying 20 minutes. Her ordeal ended only when something in the forest startled the gang and they ran away. The U.S. couple's guide managed to break free and released them, before they all ran naked along jungle tracks for several hours, determined to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the scene of the attack in case the gang came back. Eventually they reached a remote village where they were given some clothing and from where they were able to raise the alarm.","Villager Saku Aiya and two others accused their uncle's wife Penny Toyo of witchcraft .

The mother of the two Boston bombing suspects had become an increasingly strict Muslim in recent years and cried for days when her eldest son said he wanted to move out before he was married because it was against the family's faith. Alyssa Kilzer, now 23, visited the home for facials between 2008 and 2012 and has revealed details about her regular interactions with Zubeidat Tsarnaeva and her younger son Dzhokar, 19, who police arrested last night after a 24 hour manhunt. The woman's older son Tamerlan, 26, was killed in a shoot-out on Friday morning. Kilzer said she started getting facials from Zubeidat at a Boston salon six years ago but when the woman left the spa, she began going to her crowded third-floor Cambridge apartment to continue the treatment. Parents: Alyssa Kilzer has described the home of Zubeidat Tsarnaev, pictured right with husband Anzor . 'The staircase was crowded with their shoes, the house filled with noises of arguing, cooking, etc..' the writer and yoga teacher recalled in an eye-opening piece for Fox News. 'She would often apologize for this.' Kilzer said Zubeidat's two daughters and Dzhokar always struck her as 'perfectly nice and normal kids' who were about the same age she was. And the mother gave 'a damn good facial,' prompting her, along with her mother and sister, to keep going back for years. But Kilzer said, over that time, she noticed a distinct change in the woman who she'd come to know, who became noticeably more religious. On one visit, in either 2010 or 2011, Dzhokar, who usually put a parking pass on her car so she wouldn't get a fine, wasn't home so Zubeidat did went out to the street and did it instead. Zubeidat K. Tsarnaeva, mother of the terrorist suspect brothers Dzokhar and Tamerlan, said her sons' are '100 per cent innocent' 'I noticed that she first put on a hijab before going outside,' she explained. 'She had never worn a hijab while working at the spa previously, or inside the house, and I was really surprised.' But she says the hijab shouldn't have shocked her so much 'because she had become increasingly religious while I was in college.' 'She often mentioned Allah, and the lessons of the Koran.' Kilzer gave one example in the Fox News article where she said she told the woman how her brother was close with her mother and would care for her in future, to which she said Zubeidat responded: 'Allah will reward him.' Other changes Kilzer noticed in the woman included her shying away from the opposite sex. She said she started to refuse seeing boys who had gone through puberty because a religious figure she had spoken with told her it was 'sacrilegious,' and she also mourned when her son wanted to move out of the family home. 'She told me that she had cried for days when her oldest son, Tamerlan, told her that he wanted to move out, going against her culture's tradition of the son staying in the house with the mother until marriage,' Kilzer wrote. Client: Alyssa Kilzer, pictured left, used to get facials from Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, right . Nice: Alyssa Kilzer said the family were always kind to her but she did notice some changes in bahaviour . The former client recalled how Zubeidat started telling her 'Don't worry, there aren't men in the house today,' when she asked to use the restroom during her sessions, something which didn't bother her in the least. During a facial session in her last year of college, Kilzer became concerned and annoyed when the woman started quoting a conspiracy theory about how 9/11 was a ploy by the American government to 'make America hate Muslims.' According to Kilzer, Zubeidat said: 'It's real. My son knows all about it. You can read on the internet.' 'I have to say I felt kind of scared and vulnerable when she said this, as I am distinctly American, and was lying practically naked in her living room,' she wrote in the Fox News story. Brothers: Kilzer said she saw very little of Tamerlan, left, but that Dzhokar, right, was friendly . She said in her contact with Zubeidat's daughters and Dzhokar, they were always friendly and kind. But she said she saw very little of Tamerlan. 'I think I only met Tamerlan twice, and he wasn't friendly,' she said. She described how Zubeidat mentioned arguing with him and how she was worried about him. Kilzer said she stopped going to the woman for facials in January 2012 in part because of her increasingly strict religious views and thoughts about 9/11. However, she said the woman struck her as a hard-working woman who cared a lot for her family. She said she couldn't believe it when her mom called her to tell her that Dzhokar was suspected of detonating the two bombs that killed there and maimed 170 at Monday's Boston Marathon. 'As her client for years I felt affection for Zubeidat and was very distraught to hear that her sons could have committed such horrific crimes,' she wrote.","Alyssa Kilzer, now 23, used to visit Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, the mother of Dzhokar and Tamerlan Tsarnaeva, at her family home for facials between 2008 and 2012 .

"Former President Bush says in a rare interview that he would like to see his brother run for the Presidency . Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush says he has not yet made up his mind about running in 2016 . Republican's and Hispanics likely to favour Jeb Bush and make him ideal Republican Candidate . Democrats wonder whether Hilary Clinton will also run again making it Bush Vs Clinton AGAIN . By . James Daniel . PUBLISHED: . 15:38 EST, 20 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:50 EST, 20 April 2013 . With President Obama well into his second term in office, it's never too early to contemplate who might be on the ballot in 2016. Hilary Clinton is refusing to confirm at this early stage whether a 2016 run for the Democrats is in the offing, but on the other side many see former Florida Governor Jeb Bush as a likely candidate for the Republican party. Certainly his brother and former President George W. Bush is hoping Jeb will make a run for it in just 43 months time. Seeing triple: Could Jeb Bush (right) be the third President Bush if he becomes the Republican party's candidate in the 2016 election? Here he is pictured next to his brother former President George W Bush (center) and their father George Bush Snr (left) When asked if the country is ready for another Bush, President Bush told Parade Magazine 'That’s for Jeb to figure out, you know what I mean? I would hope that people would judge [him], if Jeb were to run, on his merits and his track record.…So I hope he will run.' He does have plenty of thoughts when it comes to running for office: ' My first advice would be, don’t be afraid of entering the arena, win or lose. It’s a great experience. People are going to automatically not vote for you because of your name. On the other hand, people will listen to you because of your name, so I wouldn’t even worry about that. Just go out there and tell people what’s in your heart.' The former Florida governor has not yet made a decision about the race in 2016. He does not believe he will suffer from his brother's low popularity during his two terms as president. Preparation: Could we expect to see more pictures like this of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush? Well, yes if he decides to run for the Presidency in 2016! Familiar faces: Some are predicting Hilary Clinton to be the Democrats candidate of choice come 2016 . A recent Public Policy Polling survey suggested that Jeb Bush might only attract around 30 per cent of the votes in a general election - but anything can happen in the next three and a half years. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush loom the largest over their respective parties as the long road toward 2016 begins. After only just failing to secure the nomination in 2008 and achieving high approval ratings as America’s top diplomat she has a strong claim in being the Democrats front-runner. If Jeb Bush were to run, it might not be as straight forward as a Clinton candidacy but his ties to Florida and Hispanics would make him a decent candidate for the Republicans. Both Clinton and Bush have number of backers on both sides who are ready to sign up. Backers: Both Clinton and Bush would have guaranteed support in terms of activists, fundraisers and ground staff if they decided to run for office . Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said that Americans are loyal to political families like they are loyal to trusted brand names. 'The political equivalent of a brand is the dynasty, the Bushes or Clinton's. And even if Coke produces New Coke, or Ford, an Edsel, now and then…. we remain loyal. We know and value what the brand stands for … otherwise, we wouldn’t want it rehabilitated.' Castellanos told Politico. Even if Jeb Bush decides not to run, tt may not be the last the public have heard from the Bush's when it comes to public office; President Bush's nephew George P. Bush is running for Texas Land Commissioner. Brother to brother: Former President George W. Bush (left) hugs his brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush (right) - and presumably gives him a few words of advice on running for President . Brotherly love: George W. Bush (left) hugs his brother Jeb Bush (right) could continue the Bush dynasty in American politics come 2016 . During the interview, President Bush said he did not believe the Republican Party was 'doomed forever'. He said, 'the party ought to nominate somebody who can stand by principles and explain why conservative principles are better for the vast majority of the citizens.' President Bush has kept a low profile since leaving the White House in 2009. He told the Dallas Morning News that people are surprised to know he likes to paint. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read,' he said.","Former President Bush says in a rare interview that he would like to see his brother run for the Presidency .

A woman who used to be mistaken for overweight soap character Mandy Dingle after her weight reached 23 stone has shed more than half her bodyweight - and is now a trim size 10. Danielle Sheehan used to overindulge on junk food and sit in front of the television watching soaps every day, resulting in her piling on the pounds and becoming morbidly obese. Her size 26 frame was so big that she wouldn't go on public transport or on fairground rides because she took up two seats. What a difference: Danielle Sheehan, 23, from Bulwell, Notts, dropped from 23st and a size 26 to a trim 10st 12lbs and size 10, by adopting a more healthy diet . Doppelganger? Danielle used to be compared to the Emmerdale character of Mandy Dingle, played by Lisa Riley, before she dropped the weight . Danielle was even likened to Strictly Come Dancing star Lisa Riley, better known as Mandy Dingle from the TV soap Emmerdale, when she went out. But now, having dropped to a svelte size 10 and after losing a staggering seven stone in just six months, she says she gets compared to sexy soap star Kym Marsh. After three years of hard work and determination she now weighs just 10st 12lb. Before, Danielle's diet consisted of a Full English for breakfast, big baguettes and crisps for lunch and fatty meals like lasagne and chips in the evening with at least 12 bars of chocolate a day as snacks. Danielle, 23, from Bulwell, Notts, said: 'My calorie intake was unreal. It was more the quantity, the amount of food I was eating and I didn't exercise - I was so lazy. Morbidly obese: Danielle's weight spiralled as she spent her evenings sitting in front of the television eating junk food . Disciplined: Danielle lost the first seven stone in a remarkable six months and continued to drop the pounds through regular exercise and a diet of 1,500 calories a day . 'At 23 stone, I was miserable. I wanted to look like an FHM High Street Honey, not Mandy Dingle. My confidence evaporated and I stopped going out with my mates. Instead I stayed at home in my comfort zone, gorging on cakes and chocolate, slumped in front of the soaps. 'It took over my life. I was embarrassed by my size so I would sit in and binge - it was a vicious circle. It was a lonely place to be.' After being told by doctors she would not be able to conceive naturally if she didn't dramatically change her lifestyle, Danielle decided to use this blow as her 'thinspiration' to take action. Unhealthy: Danielle was told by doctors she would not be able to conceive naturally if she didn't dramatically change her lifestyle . Trapped: Danielle describes how she was caught in a vicious cycle of binge eating and over-indulging on comfort food . She became a fitness fanatic, embarking on long runs five days a week, going to the gym and doing spinning classes, and stripped back to a diet of fruit, vegetables, lean meat and fish. The coffee shop worker said: 'I decided enough was enough. I looked like a fat soap character but I was the only one who could change that. I wanted to walk into a room and be noticed but not as the 'fat one with a pretty face.' I wanted to feel sexy and be me again. 'I was like a bull in a china shop, exercising and sticking to 1,500 calories a day.' Recalling the start of her diet in September 2009, she said: 'It was like a drug addiction but with food and chocolate - I had withdrawal symptoms. I was nasty, aggressive and snappy at first but then I would go for a run and it would make me feel amazing. Danielle was motivated by the thought of having children and says she was tired as being seen as the 'fat girl with a pretty face' and wanted to feel sexy again . The dramatic weight loss helped Danielle to conceive naturally. She gave birth to Keenan, now two and a half, in February 2010. That gave her even more motivation to continue with her new regime and she is now enjoying a new lease of life and her new slim frame after three years of hard work. Danielle, who has since split with her partner, added: 'My son was my only motivation. I was not going to be the fat mum at the school gates and have him bullied because of my size. 'I feel a lot more confident now and sexy. I feel amazing. I have lost the old me and gained this amazing confidence. 'Now people compare me to Kym Marsh instead of Mandy Dingle, which is a huge compliment.","Danielle Sheehan has dropped from 26st to 10st 12lbs .

Lisa Lynch, a magazine editor, died after the disease spread to her bones and brain. Shortly after her diagnosis in 2008 Mrs Lynch started writing a blog, Alright Tit, which became so popular that it was turned into a book – The C-Word. Mrs Lynch, who was born and brought . up in Derby, chronicled her battle with the disease in her witty and . honest blog which received 140,000 hits in the first year alone. Lisa married Peter Lynch in December 2006 and was diagnosed with cancer just 18 months later after her husband found a lump in her breast . Lisa and Peter are pictured on holiday in May 2008, just before she was found to have a grade three tumour . She dubbed the cancer The Bullshit and took to ‘writing while fighting’ as a way of coping. Mrs Lynch, from south-west London is survived by her husband of six years, Peter Lynch, who announced her death on the blog. He wrote: ‘I've been batting some words around in my head for the last two days searching for poetic prose to do justice to my world, my rock, my best friend, my lover and my wife. Alas, there will never be an easy way in which to tell you all that Lisa passed away very peacefully on Monday, March 11th, 2013. ‘In a way that only Lisa could pull off, she left us in exactly the way she had planned. The plan was to be at Trinity Hospice with her husband and parents. ‘The plan was that we would be overlooking the beautiful gardens. The plan was that it would also be peaceful, beautiful, tranquil and pain free. ‘I probably don't need to tell you that Lisa ticked all of those boxes (what can I say? Some people are just so damn talented that they can plan for any eventuality). ‘We, her family and closest friends, feel complete and utter devastation that is matched only by resounding pride that she was, and will forever be, our girl. ‘For us, it's a time to privately shed tears and to reflect on what she meant and will continue to mean to us. Lisa, I love you with a passion that burns as brightly as you did. Your light will never ever go out.’ Lisa Lynch, 33, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 when she was just 28-years-old . Mrs Lynch turned to writing a blog - Alright Tit - as a way of coping with her cancer . Mrs Lynch was diagnosed with a five . centimetre tumour in her breast after her husband noticed a lump just 18 . months after they were married. It was an aggressive grade three tumour that had spread to 24 of her 25 lymph nodes. She underwent a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It is believed that the growth of the cancer may have been encouraged by pregnancy hormones as Mrs Lynch suffered two miscarriages before her diagnosis. She wrote: ‘On the outside, my husband Pete and I are a professional couple with mortgage protection and one eye on our Air Miles. Happier times: Lisa and Peter on holiday in South Africa with Lisa's parents, Jane and Ian . ‘Behind closed doors, however, we draw on one another’s foreheads and tickle each other until we can’t breathe for laughing. ‘It . was during one such tickle fight that I knew something was wrong. In a . playful boob-grab, Pete felt something unusual. That is when the fun . stopped and my cancer journey began.’ She continued: ‘Inside the hospital I’d had a biopsy and a mammogram. I remembered the specialist pointing to a cloudy area on the scan and uttering the words “breast cancer”. ‘The rest had been white noise. After we’d been led out of the room we both cried, but the kind of crying that comes without tears. Frozen-to-your-core, terrified crying. ‘Then Pete had stared at his BlackBerry and looked at me with yet another level of terror in his eyes. “Your mum and dad – I’ve missed a ton of calls.' We’d been in the hospital for almost . four hours and they’d been calling the entire time. “We’ll have to . speak to them,” I said. So we did; well, Pete did. ‘I . retched at the thought of Pete’s words bringing the news that no parent . can prepare themselves for – that despite the fact we had zero family . history of breast cancer, I, at 28, had a firm diagnosis.’ In June 2009, after a year of intensive treatment, she was told that her mammogram was clear and she prepared to get on with her life, cancer-free. However, in September 2011 the cancer returned and Mrs Lynch and her family were told that it was terminal. She was informed that the cancer would now have to be managed, as opposed to cured, but that she could still have years to live. In June 2009, after a year of treatment, Mrs Lynch was told that her cancer had gone. She and Mr Lynch are pictured with friends at Glastonbury after receiving the good news . In October 2009 Mr and Mrs Lynch were enjoying a break from the cancer treatment. They are pictured on holiday with Mrs Lynch's brother Jamie and his wife Leanne . Mrs Lynch recorded the devastating news in her blog: ‘So here it is: my cancer has returned. Not as a localised recurrence, but a distant spread. It’s now grade 4 (as we know, there is no grade 5) which is also known as a secondary cancer or, to be blunt, a cancer which cannot be cured. ‘The spread is to my bones: not just in my back, as was first my suspicion, but everywhere, in the form of dot-like tumours (worst in my spine, hips, shoulders, ribs, clavicles, sternum). ‘All of which explains the increasing pain I’ve been in recently whose severity I have, for longer than I care to admit, been denying to those around me – most of all me. (It’s funny – I always used to wonder as a kid whether I had a superpower of some sort, and had an inkling that it might be a superhuman pain threshold... turns out an oncologist has since confirmed just that, albeit in a somewhat less superhero-ey manner. Henceforth expect to see my undies on the outside of my leggings.)’ ‘Please please just BE A MATE to my husband and my parents and my brother and my family and my friends. As shitty as my health outlook is at the moment, I’d still much rather be in my position than theirs, and it would thus make me immeasurably happy if you’d just, y’know, be there for them.’ In September 2011 Mrs Lynch was told that the cancer had returned and that it had spread to her bones. There was no longer anything the doctors could do to cure her . In October 2012 she was given the news that the cancer had spread to her brain and that she had just months to live. She is pictured in September 2009 with her cat, Sergeant Pepper . In October 2012 Mrs Lynch and her family were dealt another devastating blow as she was told that the cancer had spread to her brain meaning that she only had months to live. She wrote: ‘Today, I’m not letting you know how I am; I’m just letting you know. I’m letting you know that my cancer has spread to my brain; I’m letting you know that that it’s had a far from desirable effect on my prognosis; I’m letting you know that I’m due to be starting a new treatment this week that will hopefully shrink the tumour enough to postpone its effects for as long as possible; and I’m letting you know that I am – as are my family – devastated to the point of not knowing how to carry on. ‘But I am going to carry on. We are going to carry on. For you, Corey James [Mrs Lynch’s newborn nephew]. Because, regardless of the unspeakable shit that’s been thrown in her direction, the most important thing for your Auntie Lisa to worry about right now is staying around long enough to make you feel as loved as she does.’ Following her death, Mrs Lynch's friend Toby wrote a moving tribute on her blog. He said: 'You shone even brighter and more brilliantly than any of us could have imagined. 'This blog is testament to it. Here you remain, a part of everyone who loves you, who cried along with you as the road turned rough and laughed as you wrote with humour and tenderness and life. 'You're still right here. You are here in these pages. You are here in the lives we led with you.' Mrs Lynch's book The C-Word is being adapted for television by the BBC.

They may be more commonly associated with workmen, but Australian spies will now have to wear high visability vests when they are at work . It may mean the end for any undercover operation. It has been revealed that Australian spies have to wear high visability vests when they are at work. The country’s strict Commonwealth Work Health and Safety Act means that everyone working for the government must wear a bright yellow or orange safety vest. It means, of course, that any spy trying to work, following a foreign agent for example, has a great deal of difficulty in remaining out of sight. The work place rule applies to all officers working on the job for the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. The service’s spies work mostly overseas, collecting intelligence against individuals or organizations who might be plotting against Australia’s interests. On its website it claims: ‘ASIS is Australia’s overseas secret intelligence collection agency. Our mission is to protect and promote Australia’s vital interests through the provision of intelligence services as directed by Government.’ But it is understood that whether the spy work involves peeping on foreign agents overseas or on home soil, the Health and Safety regulations must still apply because the spies are paid by the government. Two other spy groups – the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and its Australian Defence Force counterpart – are exempted from the rule of wearing safety vests. Learning of the problem that exists for the Secret Intelligence Service spies, the government is now taking steps to make life a little easier for its agents. Amendments are now before Parliament which will allow the ASIS director-general to waive the vest requirement. Australian Parliamentary Secretary Richard Marles (pictured right shaking hands with Hillary Clinton and New Zealand's Foreign Minister Murray McCully) told parliament that it might be tough for spies to follow hazard reduction to a tee . Foreign Affairs parliamentary secretary Richard Marles told parliament that it might be tough for spies to follow hazard reduction to a tee. In these environments, the requirements of national security may not always be compatible with full compliance with Australian work health and safety obligations,’ said Mr Marles. ‘Indeed, full compliance could in some circumstances place people who work for the director-general of ASIS at risk and prejudice national security.’","Health and Safety regulations apply because spies 'paid by government'

Thug: Anthony Coyle, 25, head-butted and punched a taxi driver in the face as he drove to Middlesborough . A thug head-butted a taxi driver at 70 miles an hour in a violent attack on a dual carriage way. Anthony Coyle then punched the cabbie, knocking his glasses from his face, as they travelled down the A19, on the outskirts of Hartlepool, Cleveland. Hartlepool magistrates heard the 25-year-old had booked the taxi from Peterlee firm, Red Line Taxis, to travel from the Horden Labour Club to Middlesbrough. The driver, from Crimdon, County Durham, arrived at the club just before 8pm to collect Coyle. Coyle asked the driver to first take him to a nearby off licence where he went inside and bought a bottle of wine to drink on the journey. But as the taxi travelled along the A19, Coyle began to bang on the dashboard and the driver asked him to stop. Coyle then jumped towards the driver and head-butted him 'hard to the side of the head'. The yob then punched him to the left side of the face, the force of which knocked his glasses off. The taxi driver pulled off the A19 and into the car park of The Windmill pub, at Dalton Piercy, where he went inside and phoned police. Prosecuting, Joanne Hesse told justices: ""The complainant picked Coyle up from the Horden Labour Club with an agreement of a £20 fare to take him through to Middlesbrough. 'En route they stopped off at a shop where the defendant bought a bottle of wine. He was drinking it and then started braying on the dashboard of the taxi.

She also issued a plea to be 'allowed' to visit the cemetary in Mitcham, south London. 'I really want to go see her grave,' said Knox in an interview with USA Today.

'I was in the courtroom when they were calling me ""devil,""' she told ABC.

Her first one-night stand was with a man called Cristiano, whom she met on a train in Florence.She wrote: ‘We shared a joint, and then, high and giggly, we went to his hotel room. ‘I’d just turned 20. This was my first one-night stand. ‘I’d told friends I couldn’t see myself sleeping with some random guy. But Cristiano was a game-changer.’ Two . weeks after arriving in Perugia from her home in the US she had sex . with an Italian named Mirko, who invited her back to his house for . pizza.

Soon after meeting, Knox asked him: ‘Do you like marijuana?’, to which he said, ‘It’s my vice’. ‘It’s my vice, too’, she replied.  Knox, who was in Perugia for the third year of an Italian, German and creative writing degree, said: ‘Around our house marijuana was as common as pasta. We all chipped in. It was purely social.’ Knox also describes how she became suicidal locked up in a women’s prison outside Perugia. She wrote: ‘I imagined myself as a corpse. It made me feel sick, not relieved, but it was a fantasy I had many times – terrible, desperate recurring thoughts that I never shared with a soul.’ She also recalled the sexual advances made by her cellmate Cera, who had the ‘tall, lean looks of a model’. She said: ‘One morning I was walking into the bathroom to put something away, I bumped into Cera and she kissed me on the lips.’ Following their release from prison, Sollecito moved to Switzerland while Knox returned to Seattle to finish her degree at the University of Washington. She has been in a relationship with classical guitar student James Terrano, 25, for 18 months. Knox cannot be compelled by Italian law to appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at all.

When the Pilgrim Fathers landed at Cape Cod in 1620 to start a new colony, they ensured that the name of Plymouth would be immortalised in American history for ever. But now it has been claimed that their ship, the Mayflower, should not be associated with the city in Devon which it set out from, but with the Essex port town of Harwich. The ship which transported the enterprising Puritans across the Atlantic was apparently built in Essex, and may have made only a brief stop-over in Plymouth as it began its journey. Voyage: The Mayflower set sail from Plymouth, pictured, but may have actually been built in Harwich, Essex . The Pilgrim Fathers named their landing place 'Plymouth Rock', meaning that every schoolchild in the U.S. has heard of the city on the south coast of England. Plymouth is currently gearing up for the 400th anniversary of the fateful landing, which will fall at the end of this decade. Officials are planning a series of events to celebrate the voyage, and have even invited the future President of the U.S. to attend - seven years in advance. If the President does decide to go to the festivities in Plymouth, he or she will find the name 'Mayflower' adorning dozens of sites and businesses in the city, including a museum, school and sailing club. Iconic: A replica of the Mayflower, which transported the Pilgrim Fathers to what is now Massachusetts . But Harwich, on the east coast, insists that it should be the town remembered as the birthplace of the Mayflower, and residents are planning a rival set of anniversary celebrations. The ship was described in some port documents as 'The Mayflower of Harwich', and the main builder was a native of Harwich, implying that that is where it was probably built. Its voyage to the New World seems to have begun in London, where it picked up passengers at the East End docks before travelling on to Southampton and then Plymouth. The Pilgrims themselves came from a number of different places in Britain, with at least four of them being from Essex, although none seems to have had pre-existing links to Devon. Campaigners at the Harwich Mayflower Project have launched a £2.5million plan to build a life-size replica of the boat and sail it across the Atlantic. True home? Residents of Harwich, pictured, are campaigning for recognition of its place in American history . Far off: Harwich, on England's east coast, is 330 miles away from Plymouth on the south coast . Organiser Andy March told The Times: 'Plymouth has grabbed the limelight but the vessel has much closer ties with Harwich, where she was built. 'It may put Plymouth noses out of joint, but we are determined that everyone should know of Harwich's role.' Another supporter, John Acton, claimed that Plymouth had 'hijacked the ship and claimed it as their own', pointing out that many of America's early settlers were proud of their East Anglian roots. He has lodged a legal claim to block any attempt by the Devon city to claim ownership of the Mayflower. However, while the ship may have started life in Essex, it is unlikely to shake its association with Plymouth any time soon. A spokesman for Plymouth City Council told The Times: 'The Mayflower departed from Plymouth on September 8, 1620, nearly 400 years ago on its Pilgrim voyage to New England. 'The journey and the vessel are a piece of our country's history and we are proud to celebrate being a part of that.' Plymouth Colony, founded by the Pilgrim Fathers after they landed in the Mayflower at Cape Cod in November 1620, is one of the best-known American colonies despite not being the first. Its fame is partly because it was the first community in what would become the U.S. to be founded by Puritans fleeing religious persecution, establishing the New World's reputation as a land of tolerance and freedom. The Pilgrims were mostly English men, women and children who had been banned from worshipping as they wished thanks to strict laws against all Christian denominations outside the Church of England. Many had previously fled to Leiden, in the Netherlands, but seized the opportunity to found a new community based on the spirit of religious equality. They travelled in the Mayflower from London via Plymouth, and made landfall at a spot they called 'Plymouth Rock', founding a colony of settlers nearby. Despite widespread illness and harsh conditions, the community survived, and in late 1621 held a ceremony which later became known as the origins of the Thanksgiving holiday. The settlement founded by the Pilgrims has remained continuously occupied for nearly 400 years, and is now the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts.","Pilgrim Fathers sailed from Devon and named landing site 'Plymouth Rock'

"PUBLISHED: . 10:49 EST, 18 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:46 EST, 18 April 2013 . Masked men stole stuffed rhinoceros heads bearing eight valuable horns from the warehouse of Ireland's National Museum, police revealed today. Officials have linked last night's raid on a storeroom in Swords, north of Dublin, to an Irish Gypsy gang that specialises in such heists across Europe. The theft was carried out by three men who tied up the lone security guard. He later freed himself and raised the alarm. Stolen: A gang of thieves took these rhino heads from the National Museum in Ireland which have horns worth £427,000 . Store room: The heads had been moved from public display at the site near Dublin because officials feared they may be stolen . Nigel Monaghan, keeper at the National Museum's natural history section, said the museum had never experienced such a theft before but had worried that the rhinos would be targeted. He said the four heads - three of black rhinos from Kenya, one of the virtually extinct white rhino from Sudan, all killed more than a century ago - were removed from display last year and put into storage specifically to safeguard them from thieves. He said the eight horns could be worth a total of about £427,000 ($650,000) on the black market based on their weight. Three of the five species of rhinoceros in Africa and South Asia have been hunted to the verge of extinction because their horns command exceptionally high prices for use in traditional Asian medicine chiefly in China and Vietnam, where the powdered horn is marketed as an aphrodisiac and even as a cure for cancer. The horns are made of keratin, a fibrous protein that is the building block for skin and hair, and has no documented medicinal value. In 2011, Europol issued a warning that an Irish Gypsy criminal network based in the County Limerick village of Rathkeale was responsible for dozens of thefts of rhino horns across Europe. Valuable: The horns are made of keratin which has no documented medicinal value despite being highly prized in certain cultures . Europol said the thieves - officially called the Rathkeale Rovers but also dubbed the Dead Zoo Gang by Dublin tabloids - had already targeted museums, galleries, zoos, auction houses, antique dealers and private collections in Britain, continental Europe, the United States and South America. In 2010, U.S. undercover agents arrested two members of the Rathkeale gang trying to buy four black rhino horns in Colorado. They both received six-month prison sentences. Rathkeale is considered the epicentre for Ireland's Gypsy minority, known locally as travellers. They own most of the properties in the town, which regularly experiences huge influxes of Irish travellers from throughout Ireland and Britain arriving in luxury vehicles for clan events. Irish police and Europol say the Rathkeale criminal network also is involved in road-tarmac fraud and the sale of counterfeit goods, particularly tools and engine parts.","Security guard managed to free himself after the heist and raise the alarm .

A collection of disturbing photographs, recovered by police show . Joynes sticking his finger into the mouths of 'approximately seven' students and putting a peppermint stick into a young girl's mouth. Bad man: Lawrence Joynes, 57, a music teacher in Maryland, is in jail after police discoevred child pornography on his computer along with inappropriate photographs and videos of his own students . Last June he sent one such video to producer, Gerald Roberts in South Carolina, with an accompanying message that read: 'Try some pics like these.' Since his arrest, Mr Joynes has also confessed that, having fantasised about one 7-year-old in particular, he gave her a 'horsey' ride on his lap and got a tattoo of her name on his right shoulder. 'When you put it all together it’s extremely disturbing,' Lisa Dever, a Baltimore County prosecutor told the Washington Post. 'He had access to kids. Every year, a new batch of kids.' Parents and staff are angry with school . authorities for not having taken more seriously the various complaints . of inappropriate behaviour that were lodged prior to his arrest, based on student testimony. One child said Joynes had asked to be called 'daddy' and another said Joynes made comments about drug addiction. Two former teachers at New Hampshire - a pre-kindergarten to second grade school - admitted they had reported him for locking his classroom door when inside with the children. Mary Silverman said she reported Joynes for this as well as for hugging a young girl between his legs as he sat on a stool. Ms Silverman's colleague, Ellen Holder, told the principal that a child had told her Joynes had been tickling her in one class. Though there was nothing 'criminal' about either accusation, parents feel that the complaints should have raised alarm bells. Too little too late?

'It's hard to imagine how he remained in place teaching such young children for so long, given the string of complaints,' said Luis Clemens, the parent of a former student . In response, community superintendent for the county, Bronda Mills, assured worried parents and staff that the school system would be reviewing how the case was handled. At a meeting of 75 parents including principal of the school for the past three years, Marinda Thomas Evans, Ms Mills insisted: 'I assure you that when I have the evidence and the pattern, I move it to the next level.' Joynes has taught at 11 Montgomery public schools  in total, including Eastern Middle, Francis Scott Key Middle and Cannon Road Elementary. A spokesman for the school system, Dana Tofig, backed up Ms Mills' reaction, explaining that a school investigation would be led after the criminal investigation was complete. 'We have - and will continue - to take swift action if we become aware of inappropriate conduct by a member of our staff,' she said. 'We expect our staff to act in the best interest of students at all times, and the vast majority do.' Regarding previous complaints against Joynes she added: 'Never have I received information that this teacher was taking inappropriate pictures of children... or anything that would make me believe I needed to report something to the police.' For now, police are talking to the students and former pupils who were involved in some of Joynes' questionable activities. Lt. Bob Carter, acting commander of the Family Crimes Division, noted: 'In retrospect, they now realize they'd been put in a horrible position by someone they trusted. This is painful for them.' Joynes is being held in Baltimore County on $1 million bond .","Videos and pictures on Lawrence Joynes' computer were sent to child pornography producer in South Carolina .

The moment in ET that the silhouette of Elliott and his alien friend fly across the full moon on their way to the forest has been lauded the most magical moments in cinema. It was, of course, the result of clever use of special effects, but now one Swiss photographer has shown how the same picture could be almost replicated with no tricks. Just a lot of patience. Magical: Swiss photographer Philipp Schmidli waited four months to capture this breathtaking image of a cyclist dwarfed by the rising full moon . Iconic: The most famous image from SSteven Spielberg's 1982 film ET shows the alien flying across the face of the moon in a bicycle basket . Philipp Shmidli from Lucerne waited four months to capture this breathtaking photograph of a mountain biker's silhouette as a colossal moon rises on the horizon. After bad weather thwarted his attempts to take the picture in January, February and March, the persevering photographer finally took the photo last week. He was lucky enough for the weather to clear over his chosen scene just as the moon's cycle reached its April climax. That scene had been decided on following hours of exploration on Google Earth, searching for the perfect location on which to frame the image, and from which to shoot it.

Women are carrying the heaviest burden of ‘recession stress’, a survey has revealed. Two in three – 66 per cent – are concerned about the rising cost of living, compared with 56 per cent of men. At the same time, 55 per cent are more stressed about work and money than before the economic downturn began in 2008, compared with 42 per cent of men. The concerns spread beyond the day-to-day battle about how to put food on the table and make sure the bills are paid. The study found that 43 per cent of mothers are worried about what the crisis means for the prospects of their children, compared with just 33 per cent of fathers. The figures come from the Future Of Britain study, published today. It identified that the real ‘squeezed middle’ are those aged 35-54. ‘ . With mortgages and children, more of this age group say they are struggling with bills than younger or older groups,’ it said. With women taking the lead role in seeing their families through the crisis, two in three are saving money by switching to cheaper supermarket own-label products, versus 57 per cent of men. Meanwhile 41 per cent of women have turned to websites such as eBay to sell possessions in order to pay bills compared with 34 per cent of men. Women are also saving more  and making cutbacks by eating out less frequently and postponing home improvements. Recession stress: More than half of women in Britain are more stressed about work and money now than before 2008, compared to only 42 per cent of men . But the study also concludes  that the downturn has caused profound changes in family choices, with one in 20 saying  the lack of money means they have put off having children, while 3 per cent have delayed getting divorced or lived with someone longer than they wanted to. Ten per cent have stayed in a job they do not like, and more than one in four are working more hours or have also taken a part-time post. However, a lack of money can have some positive effects on health – one in five smokers have quit or are lighting up less, while one in three have cut down on alcohol or given up completely.","Women worry about the effects of the economic downturn more than men .

A home-grown terror gang facing life in jail for plotting ‘another 9/11’ were today ordered to ‘stay quiet’ by a crown court judge as they laughed and joked in the dock while awaiting sentence. The 11 men, all from Birmingham, were ordered to be silent by Mr Justice Henriques at Woolwich Crown Court in south-east London and did not appear fazed by their impending prison sentences. The men, aged from 21 to 34, whom the court heard wanted to kill up to 2,000 Britons, are expected to be sentenced on Friday - but the hearing started today because there are so many defendants. Sketch: The group's members Irfan Naseer, Rahin Ahmed and Ashik Ali are pictured (left to right) in court today . The ‘chief financier’ of the jihadist cell joked about stealing money from charities, the court heard. Rahin Ahmed, 26, acted as fundraiser for the gang, who aimed to explode eight rucksack bombs and possibly other devices in crowded places in the UK. Under the cover of legitimate street collections for Muslim Aid and local Islamic learning centre Madrasah-e Ashraful Uloom, he stole thousands of pounds to fund the planned attacks in 2011. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC told the sentencing hearing that Ahmed had joked to one accomplice: ‘I’ve got so much Muslim Aid money I’m stealing, I have to bank it all,’ and then laughed. Mr Altman told the court that ‘Ahmed had a large part to play not only collecting money, but also in investing and managing the money collected’. He and others would wear high-visibility tabards and carry buckets to collect money from ‘unsuspecting passers-by’. Ahmed banked over £13,500 from his fundraising activities, but only passed on £1,500 to Muslim Aid and £900 to Madrasah-e Ashraful Uloom. He then set up a Forex capital markets trading account, lying about his qualifications and claiming that his net worth was between of £100,000 and £250,000 and he had liquid assets of up to £50,000. Planning to boost the group’s funds by investing in commodities such as gold, he instead lost over £9,000 and the group’s trust. Irfan Naseer, 31, Irfan Khalid, 28, and Ashik Ali, 28 - the group’s three leaders - have been warned they face life imprisonment after they were found guilty of masterminding the plot in February. Plans: West Midlands Police photo of Irfan Nasser, Rahin Ahmed and Irfan Khalid at Birmingham Airport. They are part of a home-grown terror gang facing life in jail for plotting 'another 9/11' They will be sentenced during a three-day hearing together with eight other defendants who pleaded guilty to terror offences before they could face trial, including Ahmed. Ahmed, from Moseley, admitted engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts by collecting, investing and managing money for terrorist acts. Guilty: Rahin Ahmed, 26, acted as fundraiser for the gang, who aimed to explode eight rucksack bombs . He also pleaded guilty to assisting others to travel to Pakistan for training in terrorism. Judge Mr Justice Henriques said that ‘conservative estimates’ suggested the group had raised a total of £39,000 for their cause. This is believed to include money stolen from Muslim Aid and the madrasa, Ahmed’s own money and other sources. The court heard that Naseer claimed that ‘blowing yourself up with a rucksack bag is not such a hard thing to do’ and envisaged attacking synagogues in the UK or a ‘Mumbai-style attack’ with guns. As part of the plot, the ringleaders sent four youngsters to Pakistan to train for terrorism in August 2011, the court heard. Shahid Khan, 21, Khobaib Hussain, 21, Ishaaq Hussain, 21, and Naweed Ali, 25, all from the Sparkhill area, were sent in pairs from Birmingham International Airport on separate days. They told their families they were travelling to attend a madrasa and were expected to return to the UK in October. However, Khobaib Hussain, Ishaaq Hussain and Ali returned just three days later after a relative got wind of the sinister motives for their journey, with only Khan remaining abroad for the expected duration. All four have pleaded guilty to engaging in conduct in preparation for terrorist acts by travelling to Pakistan for training in terrorism. Funding: Irfan Nasser, Rahin Ahmed and Irfan Khalid during a bogus charity collection to help pay for the attack . The cell’s leaders also spent ‘a great deal of time and effort’ in recruiting Ali’s older brother Bahader Ali, 29, Mohammed Rizwan, 34, and Mujahid Hussain, 21. Bahader Ali and Rizwan were unsure whether to join the ‘ammal’ (action) against ‘infidels’ in the UK or fight abroad, the court heard. They were instructed to practice ‘istikhara’, a prayer intended to help believers make a wise decision, and Bahader Ali and Mujahid Hussain were supplied with ideological material to convince them to join. As a result, Mujahid Hussain became actively involved as a fundraiser and ‘fully aware’ of the other plotters’ intentions, Mr Altman said. 'Blowing yourself up with a rucksack bag is not such a hard thing to do' What Irfan Naseer allegedly claimed . Rizwan and Bahader Ali, both from Sparkbrook, both admitted engaging in conduct in preparation of acts of terrorism earlier this month. Mujahid Hussain, from Yardley, pleaded guilty to entering a funding arrangement for terrorism and possessing information about terror offences. Bahader Ali eventually decided to go to Pakistan for training rather than take part in the planned attack in the UK, the court heard. ‘He was off to join the Foreign Legion, if I may put it that way, without knowing what demands were going to be made of him,’ Mr Justice Henriques said. Mujahid Hussain, meanwhile, was fully aware that the group was ‘up to no good’ but did not have knowledge that an attack was being planned in the UK. Jonathan Whitfield, for Naseer, asked for an extended sentence rather than a life sentence for his client. Mr Whitfield said in mitigation: ‘There are real issues as to whether this would have gone further than it actually did or indeed could have gone further than it did. ‘He has qualities about him which are sloppy and which suggest that this wasn’t going to go unmissed by the authorities. We respectfully submit that the court should guard against ignoring the difference between what he wanted to do and what he did do and could do.’ The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow, when Mr Justice Henriques will continue hearing mitigation for the defendants. The judge said he would not sentence the defendants until Friday morning.","Eleven men from Birmingham told to be silent by judge at London court .

The RSPCA has warned it is struggling to cope with soaring levels of abuse and some of the worst cases of cruelty it has ever seen . The number of convictions for animal cruelty and neglect of pets has soared by more than a third last year to reach record levels, shocking new figures reveal. The RSPCA has warned it is struggling to cope with soaring levels of abuse and some of the worst cases of cruelty it has ever seen. In 2012, the charity rescued and collected almost 131,000 dogs, cats, horses, rabbits and other pets - a 10 per cent rise on the previous year. Its inspectors investigated more than 150,000 cases of suspected cruelty and secured 4,184 convictions - 34 per cent more than 2011. Some 86 people were jailed. The 'shocking catalogue of deliberate cruelty and neglect' includes: . The RSPCA's statistics show that dogs took the brunt of the abuse. However, there have been large rises in the mistreatment of horses, farm animals and hamsters and rabbits. The charity said that the increase cannot be explained away by greater awareness of its work leading to more members of the public reporting concerns to it. Gavin Grant called on judges to take the offences 'far more seriously'. He added: 'The RSPCA is leading the fight against a growing animal cruelty crisis. Left to die: Hope the dog, who was found abandoned in 2012 is just of the many cases the RSPCA has dealt with . 'Our staff, volunteers and branches show tremendous dedication but they are struggling to keep up. 'For us, prosecution is always the last resort. 'However, if there is evidence of crime and serious animal abuse, then we will take legal action.' A spokesman for the charity added: 'It may cause surprise for some who think of the UK as a nation of animal lovers to see these figures indicating the opposite. 'Although our annual cruelty statistics highlight the worst cases we are involved with, it is worth remembering that there are millions of responsible, caring pet owners who look after their pets appropriately and the cruelty figures are very small in comparison. 'We must not, however, ignore the fact that there are some people out there who think it is acceptable to beat, kick, kill, starve or neglect an animal and these are the people we are trying to re-educate and, if necessary, prosecute.'","In 2012, the charity rescued and collected almost 131,000 dogs, cats, horses, rabbits and other pets .

Natural remedies such as evening primrose oil are useless for helping sufferers of eczema, warn researchers. They found supplements worked no better than taking ‘dummy’ capsules at relieving the itchy, dry skin caused by the disorder. The findings follow years of controversy over whether complementary therapies are effective. Supplements such as primrose oil have been found to be useless in treating the symptoms of eczema . Mixed findings from clinical studies have left many sufferers confused and doctors uncertain about the advice they should be offering. But researchers in the US claim a systematic analysis of 27 studies covering almost 1,600 adults and children in 27 countries failed to show that it was worth buying evening primrose oil or borage oil, both popular treatments for eczema. Joel Bamford, lead researcher at the University of Minnesota, said: ‘There is no evidence that taking either is of benefit to sufferers. ‘Further studies on the use of these complementary therapies would be hard to justify.’ The key ingredient in the two oils is gammalinolenic acid (GLA), one of the essential fatty acids which maintain the structure of cell membranes and can help reduce inflammation. Dermatologists say that the findings of the study will be disappointing to eczema sufferers . Supplements have become popular as a way of speeding up the process by which GLA moves to where it is most needed in the body. Millions of children suffer with eczema, which has no cure and is also known as atopic dermatitis. Skin problems persist into adulthood for some, who are prescribed treatment including creams,  ointments, bath additives, topical steroids and antihistamines. However, patients often turn to natural remedies to try to avoid the side-effects of conventional drugs. In the latest review, participants took evening primrose oil or borage oil, or a placebo such as olive oil, for between three and 24 weeks. Scientists from the University of Minnesota say that the supplements made no difference to people studied . Overall, the report published online in The Cochrane Library, an international health database, found taking the oils offered no clear improvement of symptoms over placebos. There was also no improvement in quality of life. Some in the study had mild side-effects, such as headaches and stomach upsets, but so did some of those on the placebos. Margaret Cox, chief executive of the National Eczema Society, said there were anecdotal accounts that evening primrose oil worked for some patients. She said: ‘But they may be taking it at the same time as conventional treatment so it can be difficult to disentangle the effects.’ London dermatologist David Fenton said the findings were ‘disappointing’ for eczema sufferers. He said: ‘People like to do something for themselves. If the oils improve your skin and you’re aware of the mostly minor side-effects, then this doesn’t mean you need to stop taking them.’","Scientists from the US found that taking supplements did not work .

He is one of the deadliest characters in gaming - an assassin feared by terrorists around the world. Glimpses of Sam Fisher have been few and far between, but this latest gameplay video shows he's lost none of his skills. Following on from the events of Splinter Cell: Conviction, the President orders all Third Echelon members to be terminated. New tricks ups his sleeve: The critically-acclaimed Conviction focused on action more so than the others, and Blacklist looks to take that premise further . Third Echelon have formed a terror ultimatum called 'The Blacklist' - a countdown of attacks on United Sates assets. Fourth Echelon is formed to take down the activists with Fisher at the helm. Conviction was more action orientated than the previous games, and Ubisoft are clearly not changing that formula with Blacklist. A new mechanic called 'killing in motion' evolves the silky-smooth mark and execute function, allowing Fisher to take down multiple foes when on the run. Interestingly, there is voice integration which allows players to distract enemies by making a noise, and Kinect sensor functionality that lets gamers move Fisher without using a controller. Perhaps the biggest change, though, is that Michael Ironside - the voice of Sam Fisher since the 2002 original - will not be reprising his role. Smallville actor Eric Johnson takes over, providing both the voice and the motion capture. The Splinter Cell movie has also been announced, with Inception and Bronson actor Tom Hardy taking on the lead role, with The International director, Eric Warren Singer, at the helm.

The pair are so close that they once went on holiday together to Italy. His appointment caused despair among Tory MPs who think Mr Cameron is unwilling to trust people from outside his social circle. ‘Great move, Dave,’ one said. ‘Good luck trying to argue we are not a bunch of toffs after this.’ Tim Montgomerie, a former Conservative chief of staff, said: ‘Extraordinary that Cameron has appointed yet another mate to Number 10. 'Where is the openness to new thinking from different backgrounds?’ And a Tory minister said: ‘Many of us wanted the Downing Street operation beefed up but the biggest problem we’ve got is looking like we’re out of touch. Picking another crony doesn’t help.’ Last week Mr Cameron brought in Boris Johnson’s brother Jo to run his policy unit. Mr Johnson, like Mr Cameron and the London Mayor, is an Old Etonian and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford. Mr Lockwood was educated at St Paul’s . School, the exclusive London independent school that Chancellor George . Osborne also attended. Political pals: David Cameron recently hired Boris Johnson's brother Jo, yet another fellow Etonian and Oxford graduate, to run the policy unit where Mr Lockwood will be working . He studied PPE at Oxford and later became Boris Johnson’s deputy at the Daily Telegraph’s Brussels bureau. The appointment lays bare the ‘chumocracy’ of public schoolboys Mr Cameron has invited into No 10. However last night Mr Cameron dismissed claims that he promotes people based on social class. He said: ‘I choose the most talented people. ‘I judge people by what they can do, what they can bring, by the quality of their brains and the passion in their hearts, not which school they went to.’","Cameron has hired journalist Christopher Lockwood for his policy unit .

Teresa Moses, 23 at the time of this 2006 mugshot, was found not guilty by reason of insanity in 2010 of murder, torture and child abuse after her son, Raijon Daniels, 8, was found dead next to a pool of his own vomit . A San Francisco woman who tortured, abused and murdered her eight-year-old son is a free woman today, seven years after her little boy was found dead in a pool of his own vomit in 2006 and three years after she was sentenced. Teresa Moses, 30, from Richmond, was declared not guilty by reason of insanity in 2010 for killing her son Raijon Daniels and has spent the last three years in a mental hospital receiving treatment for a condition that doctors have called 'fleeting'. No longer deemed a risk to society, the rehabilitated mother has been placed in Contra Costa County's Forensic Conditional Release Program, known as Con-REP under which her continued recovery will be monitored closely. Ms Moses was mother to Raijon and a younger daughter who was placed in foster care while she awaited trial. The news of Ms Moses' premature release will no doubt come as a shock to many who followed the story in 2006. Ms Moses was charged with torture and child abuse after Raijon's body was discovered in her house on October 27th. Autopsy reports showed that the boy had been beaten, scratched and starved and further investigation revealed that he had been locked in a bedroom in Ms Moses' house where he was strapped to the bed and watched by surveillance cameras. Ms Moses was said to have used a high pressure water hose to wash feces off his body and forced her son to take baths in his own waste mixed with cleaning detergent Pine Sol to deter him from relieving himself. On the day of his death, she admitted to having poured the highly chemical product on his genitals. Responding to news of her client's release on Saturday, deputy public defender, Stephanie Regular told Contra Costa Times: 'The incident which led to Ms. Moses' commitment is a horrible tragedy - a tragedy which Ms Moses will regret for the rest of her life. 'However, I also think it is important to remember that Ms Moses was legally insane at the time she committed the crime. The person she was then is not the person who she is now.' Victim: Raijon Daniels, 8, was strapped to a bed by his mother who poured Pine Sol on his genitals, made him wash in his own waste and starved him . Ms Regular's claims were backed up by three doctors during the trial who all testified that Ms Moses was legally insane at the time of the torture. A friend of the defendant who went to see her shortly after she was taken to hospital told the Contra Costa Times that Ms Moses was genuinely 'shocked' to hear of her son's death. She told her friend that she had learned her parenting skills from watching ants while growing up in the projects of Richmond. 'Of course, I thought she meant ""aunts""', said the woman who preferred to remain anonymous. 'No, she meant the insects.' Though Ms Moses' medical records are kept strictly private, she was described by one attorney as having paranoid delusions. Mr Butts quoted doctors in Napa as describing her condition as 'a mental illness than can be fleeting.' Explaining the way the law treats insanity cases such as Ms Moses', deputy district attorney Derek Butts said: 'As unfortunate as it may be, a person can suffer a short period of insanity and not be held accountable for the crimes they commit, however heinous they may be. 'It is a difficult part of our justice system to accept, especially under circumstances such as these.' He also added that a not guilty by reason of insanity verdict in a burglary case would be given the same punishment as a murder case. The District Attorney's office raised objections to Ms Moses' release in February but since all the defendant's doctors at Napa State Hospital supported it and called her a ' model patient', Mr Butts did not pursue a trial. For Ms Regular, the reversal has shown the remarkable way in which the mentally ill can be given a second chance provided they receive the right treatment and support. She referred to the agreement made between doctors, lawyers and judges, 'an insurmountable task.' Sentenced: Ms Moses has served only three years in a mental hospital and has been released on the advice of doctors who called her mental condition at the time of the torture 'fleeting' and her transformation, remarkable . While Ms Moses' attorney and doctors . have applauded her recovery and have pointed to her work with 'New . Start', a program she co-facilitated at the hospital, her nameless . friend has called her transformation 'remarkable'. 'For . her, being in Napa has been a real gift, and she took it as that,' she . said. 'One of her graces is she really wanted to take responsibility and . wanted help and took advantage of every opportunity that she could.' But one person struggling to understand the transformation so readily is Raijon's father, Desmond Daniels. 'How can three years pass and she be OK after the acts that she did? How could someone who put Pine-Sol in a child's food, allow a child to jump from a second-story building, how could they be a model patient?' he wonders. 'I still have so many questions.' Still, even despite the way in which his young son's life ended, Mr Daniels has astonishingly found a way to forgive Ms Moses. 'In the beginning, I really wanted to see her suffer because she had made him suffer,' he admitted. ""But I can't pass judgment, I wasn't in the home. I forgive her, as crazy as that may sound, because of the faith that I have. Who am I to beat her down and dog her?'","Teresa Moses' son Raijon Daniels was found dead at her home in 2006 .

"Latest effort to combat smoking in the five boroughs . Last month, Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed legislation that would require stores to keep tobacco products hidden from public view . Price of cigarettes in NYC are highest in the country at almost $14 a pack . By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 09:23 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:10 EST, 22 April 2013 . No one under 21 will be able to buy cigarettes in New York City, under a new proposal that marks the latest in a decade of moves to crack down on smoking in the nation's largest city. New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn discussed details of a proposed law that would raise the minimum age for tobacco purchases from 18 to 21. Quinn announced the proposed legislation today. She was joined by Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley, other council members and health advocates. ID required: New York City council is proposing to raise the age at which tobacco can be sold from 18 to 21 . 'With this legislation, we'll be targeting the age group at which the overwhelming majority of smokers start,' Quinn said. Officials say 80 percent of NYC smokers started before age 21, and an estimated 20,000 New York City public high school students now smoke. While it's already illegal for many of them to buy cigarettes, officials say this measure would play a key role by making it illegal for them to turn to slightly older friends to buy smokes for them. The vast majority of people who get asked to do that favor are between 18 and 21 themselves, city officials say. 'We know that enforcement is never going to be perfect,' but this measure should make it 'much harder' for teens to get cigarettes, Farley said. Texas recently attempted to pass legislation changing the age from 18 to 21 but it failed. Several states have a 19 age limit for the purchase of cigarettes. Should New York raise the age to buy tobacco to 21? Public health advocates say a higher minimum age discourages, or at least delays, young people from starting smoking and thereby limits their health risks. Opponents of such measures have said 18-year-olds, legally considered adults, should be able to make their own decisions about whether or not to smoke. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire . who has given $600 million of his own money to anti-smoking efforts . around the world, began taking on tobacco use in the city shortly after . he became mayor in 2002. Pricey habit: The city has highest tobacco taxes and most expensive cigarettes in the county with packs costing between $12 and $14 each . Stubbed out: Public health advocates say a higher minimum age discourages, or at least delays, young people from starting smoking and thereby limits their health risks . Over his years in office, the city – at times with the council's involvement – helped impose the highest cigarette taxes in the country, barred smoking at parks and on beaches and conducted sometimes graphic advertising campaigns about the hazards of smoking. Last month, the Bloomberg administration unveiled a proposal to keep cigarettes out of sight in stores until an adult customer asks for a pack, as well as stopping shops from taking cigarette coupons and honoring discounts. Healthier living: Mayor Bloomberg's administration say initiatives aim to help people live better, but many complain that they are nannyish and bad for business . New York City has had a ban on smoking in bars, restaurants and other indoor public spaces for 10 years. The measures also have drawn complaints, at least initially, that they are nannyish and bad for business. Several of New York City's smoking regulations have survived court challenges. But a federal appeals court said last year that the city couldn't force tobacco retailers to display gruesome images of diseased lungs and decaying teeth. The habit costs smokers more in New York than in any other city in the nation thanks to the highest cigarette taxes in the country. A of cigarettes routinely costs between $12 and $14. West Virginia has the cheapest cigarettes coming in at roughly $4.80 a pack.","Latest effort to combat smoking in the five boroughs .

Mitch Winehouse has revealed he has moved into his late daughter Amy's London apartment - because he can't bear to let it go. As the star was celebrated at the Amy Winehouse Foundation Inspiration Awards and Gala in Manhattan last night, her still grieving father told MailOnline: 'One thing we can’t let go of is Amy’s apartment in Camden...She loved that flat, and we live there now. ' And despite selling Amy's North London house for $2.89 million (£1.9 million) in December - Mitch admitted all the cash from the sale had gone to pay off legal fees and debts. Tragic: Amy Winehouse died aged 27 in July 2011. Her father Mitch says he's still living in her London apartment. Remembering Amy: The singer's parents Mitch and Janis Winehouse joined the legendary Tony Bennett at the Amy Winehouse Foundation Inspiration Awards and Gala on Thursday night at the Waldorf Astoria Starlight Room in New York. Amy, who died aged 27 in July 2011, lived in her small Camden apartment while recording her number one album Back to Black. And . Mich, 60, said: 'When Amy was running out of money before Back to Black . came out, I said, “Amy, we’re going to have to sell the flat’, she told . me: “Never sell the flat, Dad. I’m going to bring out a new album, and . we’re going to make millions.” So I thought we’d hold onto it for . another three or four months. 'She loved that flat, and we [with his wife Jane] live there now.' Memories: Amy Winehouse's house in Camden, North London. It was sold in December for $2.8 million. Mitch . - who turned up to the event at the Waldorf Astoria hotel wearing a waistcoat emblazoned with his daughter's . picture on the back - said the family had found it extremely hard to . sell her house, where she died. He . said: 'Anything linked with Amy is very hard to get rid of, but it was . an incredible drain on our resources. We had to have a lot of security . there, and it cost us an absolute fortune.' The . house - which became a shrine for the late singer and drew fans from . around the world following her death - was sold at auction for less than . $1.5 million  (£1million) less than the asking price. It . was originally on the market for $4.2 million (£2.8 million) and Mitch . said the family had made no money from the sale, revealing it had been . spent on legal fees and debts, adding: ‘It’s all gone, to be honest’. Amy's mother Janis, speaking at the gala, which was attended by stars including Jennifer Hudson and Mark Ronson, said she was still struggling with her daughter's loss. Janis, 57, suffers from Multiple Sclerosis and said: 'It’s been quite a tough trip so far. 'The thing that has helped us through the last 18 months or so is knowing that she’s always here – she’s always, always here with us. ‘The family has never been so close. We were always close, but losing Amy has really brought us closer.’ With the marriage of Amy's older brother Alex to Riva Lefton in November 2011, Janis said she is hoping for grandchildren, but said: 'We'll have to wait and see.' Tender: Mitch Winehouse and his ex-wife Janis share a kiss - while Mitch, joined by wife Jane, pays tribute to his daughter Amy with a picture of the star emblazoned on the back of his waiscoat. Petite: Mitch Winehouse shows off one of his daughter's 1950s-inspired tiny dresses that the late star wore while performing. Mitch said that instead of worrying about coping with the second anniversary of Amy's death, he and his ex-wife instead plan to celebrate what would have been her 30th birthday on September 14, adding: 'We're focusing on that. We're planning all sorts of things in London for Amy's birthday - there will be lots of events. 'There will also be a statue unveiled at the Roundhouse – subject to planning permission. The sculptor, Scott Eaton, is commissioned, so fingers crossed.’ The evening was made all the more emotional as Tony Bennett was honoured at the gala with the Foundation's Lifetime Achievement award. 'It’s been quite a tough trip so far...The . thing that has helped us through the last 18 months or so is knowing . that she’s always here – she’s always, always here with us' The legendary crooner, 86, recorded what turned out to be Amy's last recording, a cover of the jazz standard, Body and Soul, which went on to win a Grammy. And Mitch said: ‘When Amy won all of her Grammys in 2008, it was Tony Bennett who uttered the immortal words: “And the winner is, Miss Amy Winehouse”. And she said: “Dad, I can’t believe that Tony Bennett knows my name, and that he knows who I am.” And when she was asked to do the duet with Tony, she was so excited. I asked her what she was going to sing, and she said: “I’ve chosen Body and Soul, because it’s your favourite”. I said: “Do you know the words love?” She said: “Dad, you’ve been singing it to me for 25 years – of course I know the words."" Brushing away tears, Mitch added: '‘You’ve only got to watch the video of them performing together to see the wonderful relationship they had in such a short space of time. 'After Amy passed away, I didn’t know how I was going to survive. The thing that saved me the most was that on that Sunday afternoon, Tony called me and spent an hour on the phone with me. I couldn’t believe that someone like Tony Bennett would do that for someone like me – and it just showed how much he loved and appreciated Amy.’ White hot: Jennifer Hudson showed off her curves in a figure-hugging white dress as she attended the first annual Amy Winehouse Foundation Inspiration Awards and Gala at The Waldorf Astoria in New York City on Thursday . Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson was also honoured at the event and looked stunning as she took the stage to perform And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going and The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face. Jennifer, 31, called the event 'beautiful' and called Amy 'such a talent, such a gift.' Before Amy died from alcohol poisoning, , she had avoided drugs for two years and nine months, her father said. The foundation, founded in England just weeks after her death in 2011, steers young musicians from engaging in such abuse. Mitch revealed the Foundation will start helping youngsters in the U.S. - joking about a telegram of support from New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, jibing: 'Thank you to Mayor Bloomberg for that wonderful dedication. It would have been better if you had sent $10 million or something, but thank you.’ He added: ‘Amy Winehouse created the Amy Winehouse Foundation long before it was called the Amy Winehouse Foundation. 'She was the one who took a homeless young person into her home; she was the one who made me fly to St Lucia with a suitcase full of money to pay for a stranger to have an operation on his hernia – someone she’d just met. She was the one who sold all of her dresses and gave the money to charity. 'She started this long before we did – she was a very charitable and loving young lady.' Sexy extras: The Grammy Award-winning singer wore hot red lipstick and had her brunette hair styled in sleek curls . Remembering a legend: Jennifer performed on stage at the Amy Winehouse event . Tony Bennett also paid tribute to the star, saying she lived a complete life because she was able to achieve her . goal: becoming a respected musician. 'Her . dream was to become famous and a beautiful singer and she accomplished . that,' he said. 'Even though she had a . short life, she had a great life because she ended up praying for the . success that she wanted and it happened. This is what this night's . about.' Harry Belafonte presented the award to Bennett, and even said Bennett introduced him to Amy's music. Kind words: The former American Idol star called the event 'beautiful' and said Winehouse was 'such a talent, such a gift' Meanwhile, producer and musician Mark Ronson, who was accompanied by his mother Ann Dexter Jones, told MailOnline: ‘When Mitch or Janis or anyone from the family asks me to come out, I always say yes.' Mark, 37, produced Amy's hit record Back to Black, and said: 'We recorded all the stuff we did on Black to Black here in New York. All the stuff with the band was in Brooklyn and then the vocals were done at a studio downtown that isn’t there any more. 'I first met Amy in New York – this is where we started our friendship, so it’s very relevant to have this event here tonight. 'It is quite ambitious to spread the Foundation’s work across the US, including the New Orleans Jazz Orchestra, but it makes sense – so much of what Amy loved came from American jazz and soul music in America.’ Embrace: Producer and musician Mark Ronson shared a hug with Mitch Winehouse and posed with Amy's parents .

She wrote: 'The logic is simple and . irrefutable: any self-respecting woman wants to be thin, and to be thin . you need to spend your life on a diet. 'I . don't believe overweight is ever attractive. Whether we like it or not, . we live in an age and a part of the world where men and women regard . thin as beautiful.' Samantha was writing an opinion piece in response to news that Joan Collins had revealed that the secret to her good looks was to spend every day of her life dieting. Samantha added: 'Joan, 79, said she controlled her weight during a long career so that she could stay in work - an entirely laudable attitude. 'Like . Joan, I have no intention of letting my body slide flabbily into middle . age. I believe that any woman with a modicum of self-respect should . watch her figure with the same vigour. Is it any coincidence that Joan . is still attractive and in demand for work' Samantha's comments divided readers and she was soon trending on Twitter. Today the outspoken blonde appeared on This Morning to defend her views that women can only be happy if they are thin. She said: 'In the article I talk about the first time that I realised that I was overweight and overlooked and chose to do something about it. I am not suggesting that anyone follows my 14-year-old self's diet methods but we do have a massive problem in this country with obesity. 66 per cent of the population are obese and 25 per cent of 4 and 5 year olds are overweight, it is a massive issue. 'I put on weight while undergoing IVF treatment and my husband has been incredibly supportive but yes I do think that he would leave me if I got fat.' Journalist Samantha appeared alongside Natasha Devon a writer and positive body image campaigner . Joining the debate was writer and positive Body Image campaigner Natasha Devon. Natasha, . who admitted that she has suffered from an eating disorder in the past, . started the Body Gossip campaign which educates young girls on . self-esteem. She said:'There are hundreds of ways . to be gorgeous. We believe that healthy and confident is beauty, and . healthy and confident means different things to different people.

At the end of the debate just 6% of viewers agreed with Samantha that you can only be happy if you are ona  diet while 94% agreed with Natasha's view that Samantha's opinion is dangerous and that we should concentrate on being healthy and happy. Samantha told the MailOnline: 'Every woman who voted against me during the debate needs to take a long hard look at the digits on their scales. 'I find it extremely alarming that, even though 1 in 4 British women are obese and 66% are overweight - they still believe diet is a dirty word and that it leads to eating disorders. There is zero evidence to back this up. 'I've yet to meet a woman (myself included) who has lost a lot of weight and wished they remained fat. The fact remains that obesity costs British business £2billion a year and obesity is estimated to cost the NHS £6billion in the next 2 years. Who is going to pay for this? 'We've made drinking-driving and smoking in public unacceptable - we need to do the same with over-eating and the excessive consumption of calories. There are grave consequences to pay if we don't do this; there is a generation of children who will be buried by their parents if we don't recognise that eating more than we need is leaving us at risk of heart disease, diabetes and various cancers. 'I stand by my position that fat is failure. Every time someone eats more than they need they are failing themselves, their children and society - by assuming someone else will pick up the health tab for their eating habits. 'I know how hard it is to change cooking and eating habits. It took me years and is something I write about honestly in my memoir: Head over Heels in France. There is no greater pleasure than cooking your own food, with the aware of its calorie contents and eating it with family and friends.'

Five boyhood buddies who were injured as they watched another pal run in the Boston Marathon are now helping each other recover from the life-changing blasts. After the first bomb went off near the finish line of the April 15 race, brothers Paul and J.P. Norden huddled with long-time pals Jarrod Clowery, Marc Fucarile and James 'Bim' Costello not realizing they were inches away from the second device. When it blew, both brothers and Fucarile lost a leg, while Clowery suffered burns and shrapnel wounds and Costello was hospitalized with serious injuries. Facing it together: J.P. Norden, right, and long-time pal Jarrod Clowery, left, are recovering from their injuries . Two weeks and numerous surgeries later, the friends' health is improving but the tight bond, cemented through years of fishing trips and poker games - and just hanging out like they were that Monday - is what is helping them pull through. 'What's up, kid?' Clowery, 35, asked Paul Norden, 31, who is in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center recovering from having his right left amputated. Clowery is being treated for burns at Brigham and Women's Hospital, but another friend pushed him, still dressed in his hospital gown, the two blocks so he could visit his pal, The Boston Globe reported. Friends: Paul Norden, pictured center, is visited by pals including Mike Jefferson, far right, who was running in the marathon . Life-changing: J.P., 33, pictured left, is at Brigham and Women's recovering from his amputation while Paul, picture right with Jarrod Clowery, is at Beth Israel . 'Yeah, dude, I escaped,' he said. 'I had to see you. I had to come.' Paul's older brother, J.P., 33, is just two doors down from Clowery at Brigham and Women's recovering from his own amputation while Fucarile is at Massachusetts General hospital. Mike Jefferson, the school buddy they came to cheer on at the marathon, was the only one spared. Feeling guilty he dragged his pals along that fateful day, he now keeps watch over them, sleeping outside Paul Norden's hospital room in case he needs anything. 'He blames himself,' Norden told the Boston Globe. 'But I told him: It's not your fault. That bridge has passed. We have to get to a new place.' Lost legs: Both J.P. Norden and Marc Fucarile, pictured left and center, lost legs in the blasts while James 'Bim' Costello, right, suffered burns and shrapnel injuries . Fundraiser: The Nordens' mom Liz, pictured center, is trying to raise funds for her boys' treatment . The men, who met at elementary school or youth clubs in the small Massachusetts town of Stoneham, grew up at each others' houses, though the Norden brothers' mom, Liz, who they all called 'Ma,' tended to play host. They all found jobs in the construction industry, but the past winter had a been a brutal one with work slowing and paychecks stretching thin, according to the Globe. Now they face months of rehabilitation and the Norden brothers and Fucarile must learn to walk again using prosthetic legs. And it's likely the laborers will need to find new careers. Bombing: Jarrod Clowery, center, was pictured in the aftermath of the blasts . Close: Clowery, left, and the brothers including Paul, right, are very close . Old time: J.P. Norden, left, Marc Fucarile, right, and the other men have been friends for years . Paul Norden is set to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital this week but his main concern is that his brother, who is not yet ready to leave the Brigham, ends up at the same one. 'I have to go to rehab with my brother,' he told The Globe. Emotional, Paul Norden recalled the first phone call the brothers, who still haven't seen each other, shared after the tragedy, when they each learned the other had lost a leg. It ended: 'I love you. We'll get through this no matter what.' The Stoneham community and others are fundraising to help the friends pay for their treatment.

An amateur photographer has captured stunningly beautiful images of one of nature's finest fishermen at work. Phiphat Suwanmon, an amateur Thai photographer, spent two years photographing the blue-eared kingfisher in an attempt to document its extraordinary feeding habits. His striking photographs show a family of kingfishers diving into water to hunt. Phiphat Suwanmon, an amateur Thai photographer, spent two years photographing the blue-eared kingfisher in an attempt to document its extraordinary feeding habits . The blue-eared kingfisher is found in Asia - across the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia in countries including Nepal, India, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Thailand. It is mainly found in dense forests where it hunts in streams. It is 16cm long and is almost identical to the common kingfisher except for its blue ear coverts and darker cobalt blue upper parts. It hunts crustaceans, dragonfly larvae and fish. The birds are so rare that many experts are awestruck that an amateur photographer managed to take the pictures at all. Mr Suwanmon said: ‘It was important to allow the birds to see me often and build up trust in order to allow me to take their pictures while they act naturally - not an easy feat to get wild birds to do. ‘I spent ages among the birds and had to be extremely patient but I finally got to take pictures of this wonderful bird doing what it does best.’ The 33-year-old roped in his family to help him create a hide in the birds’ habitat in Thailand's southern province, Satun. After studying the animals' natural mating, feeding and living cycle the family built a studio within the wilderness and created a new feeding pond for the birds to fish in. The photographer then encouraged the birds to continue their natural hunting while he shot exceptional pictures.

This is the dramatic moment a gunman is wrestled to the ground by paramilitary police guarding Italy's new government. Two officers were shot as they took down the attacker, half a mile from where members of parliament were being sworn in in Rome yesterday. The drama unfolded while the new prime minister Enrico Letta and his staff took their oaths at the presidential palace. Scroll down for video . Caught: The attacker, his gun in the foreground, grimaces in pain as he is held by police officers . Treatment: A Carabinieri police officer lies injured on the ground after the shooting in Rome . Rome prosecutor Pierfilippo Laviani said the 'desperate' man, a 49-year-old bricklayer, had 'lost work, had lost everything'. 'He is a man full of problems,' he . said. 'He wanted to shoot at politicians, but given he couldn't reach . any, he shot at the Carabinieri paramilitary police.' Target: Prime Minister Enrico Letta . The man, identified as Luigi Preiti, . is from Calabria, a southern agricultural area plagued by organised . crime and chronic unemployment. One of the officers was shot in the neck and was in a serious condition, and the other was shot in the leg. Preiti 'confessed everything', and did not appear mentally unbalanced, officials said. The shooting comes at a difficult . time for Italy, which has suffered badly from the recession in the . eurozone and had been in political deadlock since an inconclusive . February election. It also sparked ugly memories of the 1970s and 1980s, when domestic terrorism plagued the country. Dressed in a dark business suit, . Preiti was seen walking along a narrow street that leads to the Colonna . Square outside the premier's office, when police stopped him. He then . began firing. Interior minister Angelino Alfano . said Preiti also wanted to kill himself but ran out of bullets. Six . shots were fired, in what appeared to be an 'isolated act'. He shouted 'shoot me, shoot me' to other officers nearby, police said. Reaction: Carabinieri police and Guardia di Finanza patrol around the area where gunshots were fired . Keep back: It was initially unclear whether the attack in Rome was linked to the launch of the new government . In a surreal scene, outgoing prime . minister Mario Monti received a trumpet salute at the nearby Chigi . palace before walking across the cordoned-off square past police . crouching over the scene of the shooting. Preiti's uncle told new agencies his . nephew had had to move back to his parents' home because he could not . find work. He was a 'great worker', he added. 'He could build a house . from top to bottom,' he said. The more seriously injured of the two police officers was a 50-year-old brigadier. A bullet had entered the right side of the officer's neck, damaged his spinal column and was lodged near his shoulder. It was not yet known if the spinal column injury had caused any paralysis. The other victim was a 30-year-old officer who was shot in the leg and had suffered a fracture, hospital officials said.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

The all-you-can-eat buffet has long been a dieter’s worst nightmare, but now researchers believe they have found the key to staying slim. Dr Brian Wansink, of Cornell University, in New York, believes dieters should take a small plate and then look at everything on offer before choosing what they want. He noticed that there are plenty of slim people at all-you-can-eat buffets so he decided to observe how they behaved in this situation. At a buffet dieters should take a small plate and then look at everything on offer before choosing what they want . He sent 30 observers to watch 300 people at 22 all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets across America. According to HealthDay, these observers estimated people’s Body Mass Index and then watched how they behaved around the food. This included noting where they sat in relation to the buffet, whether they used forks or chopsticks, and how many times they went up for more food. Dr Wansink told the website: ‘Skinny people are more likely to scout out the food. They're more likely to look at the different alternatives before they pounce on something. ‘Heavy people just tend to pick up a plate and look at each item and say, “Do I want it? Yes or no”.’ Slim diners are seven times more likely to take a small plate than larger ones are . The observers also found that slim diners were seven times more likely to take a small plate than larger ones were. They also noted that larger people sat, on average, 16 feet closer to the buffet than thin people and that they chewed their food for less time. ‘The interesting thing was that almost all of these changes were unconscious to the person making them,’ said Dr Wansink. ‘They essentially become habits over time.’ The news comes after it was revealed that, thanks to huge portion sizes and the prevalence of all-you-can-eat buffets, the average Briton gains 8lb in weight during a two week holiday to America.","Dr Brian Wansink drew his conclusions after watching slim people's behaviour at an all-you-can-eat buffet .

When Sergeant Rick Clement got married a year after suffering devastating injuries in Afghanistan, it seemed an uplifting denouement to a story that once seemed destined to end tragically. The soldier lost both legs when he stepped on a bomb and 'died twice' on the flight home. When he came round he was told he would never be able to have children or a sex life. But his fiancee, Leanne Isaacs, went ahead with the wedding, insisting he was still her 'perfect man'. But now the painful realities of their life together have brought their marriage to a sad end. As newlyweds: Rick Clement from Blackpool who when stepped on an IED in Afghanistan with his wife shortly after they married in 2011 . In a deeply moving interview, 33-year-old Rick revealed that Leanne has left him after less than two years. He blames his injuries, which doctors said were among the worse they had seen. Blast victim: Rick Clement lost both legs when he stepped on a bomb . 'Neither of us could take any more,' he said. 'We had gone from being a very happy, active couple, dreaming of a long future together to a relationship more like being brother and sister. We talked it through so many times and we took it very badly. There were a lot of tears. 'I wanted to make her happy and at my lowest moments I would say to myself, “Christ, I am not a man any more.” A guy can't feel much worse than that.' The couple had foreseen difficult times ahead but hoped their love would transcend them. 'We could never make up for what was missing,' said Rick. 'Watching Leanne mourn for me and for not having the man I'd been before the blast and not being able to fulfil her, that became too much to take. 'Obviously I've lost my legs as well as my testicles but there is simply no comparison in how these injuries affected my life with Leanne.' Rick and Leanne, 31, met on Facebook in 2008. He was in the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment and a keen footballer. They seemed perfectly matched and Rick was more than happy to spend time with her children from a previous relationship; a daughter Erin and son Kyle. By 2010, when Rick was deployed to . Afghanistan, he and Leanne were planning to have their own children. 'I . was going to pop the question when I came home on leave. Everything was . perfect. But on May 27,  2010, I was leading a foot patrol in Helmand . province when I stepped on a mine. Casualty: A wounded British soldier is carried to an ambulance by a U.S. medical team in Helmand Province . Fateful day: Rick was pictured posing with the flag of St George while serving with The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment in Afghanistan, on the day he was hit by the bomb . 'My mates carried me on to a Chinook helicopter and they say that on the flight back to our base, while I was lying on a stretcher, I was groping at my crotch, reaching down there and trying to feel something, just to assure myself. British troop deaths during the conflict in Afghanistan currently stands at 441. The number of fatalities is now much higher than Iraq and even the Falklands conflict. Deadliest years for British troops in Afghanistan were 2009 and 2010 . But last year, with the arrival of U.S. troops to Helmand, casualties fell. Figures released by the the Ministry of Defence reveal that  amputations on British troops serving in Afghanistan between April 2011 and March 2012 was 46 . Eighteen of the cases were significant multiple amputees. The number is down from 2010/11, when 75 service personnel suffered amputations. According to the latest data, the figure is still falling, with 24 troops suffering amputations in 2012. 'A soldier said I'd lost my legs but he didn't mention my testicles; it is like a taboo in the Army that you don't talk about that. The medics put me to sleep at Camp Bastion. 'I went into a coma and woke up in hospital in Birmingham three weeks later where I saw Leanne by my bedside. From the moment I came around she started looking after me, always at my side. 'Naturally I worried about losing her because of my injuries, but we got engaged and I think we thought we'd get by, just because we loved each other. 'Our wedding day was like a perfect dream, a celebration of being alive, because the doctors said I should have been dead.' Before 100 friends, relatives and soldiers from Rick's regiment, they got married on June 4, 2011, at The Great Hall at Mains, a 16th Century house at Little Singleton, Lancashire. The following day they went on honeymoon: three nights in New York followed by a seven-night cruise off Bermuda. Despite his appalling injuries, Rick demonstrated incredible determination and began to regain his independence, mastering a wheelchair and learning to drive again. Rick said the time he spent setting up his charity, A Soldier's Journey, also put pressure on his relationship with Leanne. On patrol: A British soldier from A Company, 2 Mercian in the Babaji village in Helmand . Combat: British soldiers and Afghan National Army soldiers in Helmand province . A Soldier's Journey has raised £36,480 so far and last year Rick carried the Olympic torch through Blackpool. He said: 'For the first year after I got back from Afghanistan I spent nine months in hospital having operation after operation. 'Leanne gave up her job as a professional carer to care for me and Erin and Kyle would stay in hospital with me. That was my life. We were like a family and I needed Leanne to do everything for me. I couldn't even go to the toilet by myself. 'Yet at the same time we were happy and the relationship part was easy. But then I got in my chair and I could cope with being by myself. This gave Leanne time to think about me and her, and what had changed. 'I wasn't useless any more and I didn't need her as my carer. Sometimes I blame myself for our relationship going wrong. Maybe I took on too much too soon and became more independent. Everything was simpler when I was helpless. 'Then last year we realised we'd grown apart. We talked about how things were and it was very tearful. I hated seeing Leanne so sad. 'We knew we weren't going to work things out with counselling; the basic problem wasn't going to change and that couldn't be worked out. Looking to the future, a hard aspect to this is that as much as I want Leanne to find happiness, I don't want it in my face that she's meeting other guys. 'I have had to put a bit of space between us.' Leanne has moved out but Rick continues to see her children and pictures of Erin and Kyle adorn the walls of the former marital home. The soldier, who is soon to be invalided out of the Army, also looks after the couple's pet dogs. Despite his suffering, Rick received just £9,075 from the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme for his genitalia and £48,875 for his infertility. 'If you told any guy in a pub he could have £9,025 for losing his genitals, I don't think anyone would say yes,' he said. 'But I am glad to get a pension from the Army and for the support I've received from my regiment. 'I am looking positively to the future and, if the right woman comes along, I would like to have  a relationship.' He would also like the Ministry of Defence to introduce a system allowing soldiers to provide sperm samples before going to war zones so they are still able to have children if the worst happens. He said: 'Sadly I will never have my own children. I don't want other soldiers to suffer like me.'","Sergeant Rick Clement lost both legs when he stepped on a bomb .

The row over the tax status of coffee chain Starbucks reignited today, as the firm's tax advisers insisted the global firm made no profit in the UK. Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at Deloitte, took to the airwaves to defend companies who use loopholes to avoid paying money to the Treasury. He claimed he was 'slightly mystified' that Starbucks had agreed to pay £20million in tax voluntarily after a public boycott over revelations it had paid no corporation tax since 2009. Bill Dodwell from Deloitte, which advises Starbucks on its tax affairs, defended the coffee chain from claims it used elaborate internal charges to cut its UK tax bill . The row came as a damning report by MPs said Britain's biggest accountancy firms have . ‘an unhealthily cosy relationship with Government’. Staff from private firms were seconded to work in the Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs, then used their insider knowledge to advise clients on how to avoid tax, it was claimed. The Public Accounts Committee said that . 'much' of the profit made every year by the 'Big Four' accountancy firms . - Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers - comes . from 'minimizing the tax paid' by their wealthy clients. Margaret Hodge, the Labour chairman of the committee, accused Starbucks of using elaborate charging structures to 'get the money out' of the UK and reduce their tax bill. One arm of the firm in Switzerland charged a 20 per cent mark up on coffee beans while a Dutch subsidiary charged the UK business to use the Starbucks brand, she said. She told BBC Radio 4: 'This is a company that for 15 years filed accounts in Companies House saying they were making a loss. 'They were saying one thing here to the Companies House, they were saying another thing to their shareholders and they promoted the guy who was in charge of this because he was so good.' But during intense exchanges on the Today programme, Mr Dodwell repeatedly defended the company. Margaret Hodge said accountants knew about tax loopholes . Asked if he believed that Starbucks . was making no profit in the UK, Mr Dodwell replied: ‘Yes. Vince Cable . thinks that and he spent time looking at it.’ He added: ‘Vince Cable, the Business . Secretary, looked at it with his officials and he told us he thought the . company did not make a profit in the UK. I'm prepared to take his view . on that.’ Mr Dodwell said: ‘There is a complete . disconnect between people who think that maybe a company should be . making gigantic profits and then they walk past a shut-down HMV or . Blockbuster because the retail environment in the UK is difficult.’ Starbucks' ability to pay no . corporation tax in the UK was not due to transfer pricing arrangements . which allow companies to shift profits into low-tax jurisdictions, he . said. ‘It is not because they have a . transfer pricing mechanism,’ he said. ‘They are losing money in the UK . because their rents are much higher than some of their competitors and . their staff costs are high.’ And MPs slammed the firms’ practice of parachuting their tax experts into government departments to provide tax advice. This creates a ‘ridiculous conflict of interest,’ the committee said, because it allows the accountants to gain ‘inside knowledge’ of the tax system which they then use to help big companies avoid paying tax in the UK - leaving the taxpayer millions of pounds worse off. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the influential committee, said the way the firms operated had created a generation of ‘poacher-turned gamekeeper’ accountants with ‘inside knowledge’ of tax loopholes. She said: ‘When those staff return to their firms, they have the very inside knowledge and insight to be able to identify loopholes in the new legislation. ‘[They can] advise their clients on how to take advantage of them. ‘The poacher turned gamekeeper for a time returns to poaching.’ The report, published today, said it is ‘inappropriate’ for tax experts from accountancy giants ‘to advise on tax law and then devise ways to avoid the tax.’ Mrs Hodge said these controversial secondments into the Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs should be ‘banned’ in a new code of conduct for tax advisers. Tax bosses from the Big Four insisted the expertise that they provide is not sinister in the way that the report suggests . The PAC report comes amid a growing furore over the widespread tax avoidance by big companies in Britain, with some paying not a single penny in corporation tax. Earlier this month [apr], the energy firm nPower admitted it has not paid UK corporation tax for three years despite making £766million in profits. Amazon, Google and Starbucks have also come under fire for making millions in Britain while contributing little to the Treasury’s coffers. Yesterday the accountancy firms insisted the number of staff seconded into the Treasury or HMRC is tiny. PWC said it sends just two a year, while it is understood that Deloitte sends just one. Ernst & Young said it has had one person on secondment to HMRC over the last three years. The report says a ‘substantial’ part of the Big Four’s revenue comes from tax advice, equal to an average of around 22 per cent of their total UK turnover. It highlights how HM Revenue and Customs is waging a David and Goliath type battle with the accountancy firms due to the key Government department’s ‘limited’ resources. HMRC employs around 65 tax specialists who are experts in how multinational companies operate the payments between their overseas divisions, while they have around 250. Yesterday tax bosses from the Big Four insisted the expertise that they provide is not sinister in the way that the report suggests. Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at Deloitte, said: ‘We have responded to requests for secondees and have provided a small number of people with some tax experience to help the Treasury and HMRC teams working on policy initiatives. ‘Our secondees have all reported to experienced Treasury and HMRC officials and have never driven any policy initiative. ‘We do not believe that there has ever been any conflict of interest but would want to help ensure that there is no perception of conflict.’ Kevin Nicholson, head of tax at PwC, said: ‘We strongly disagree with the PAC’s conclusions about the role of large accountancy firms which seem to be based on a misunderstanding both of what we do and how we do it. ‘We operate under a clear code of conduct, professional guidelines, and work constructively with HMRC. ‘We provide technical insight to Government but only when asked and are never involved in deciding tax policy which is a matter for the Government.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The suggestion that Government shouldn’t work with business and indeed anyone affected by its policies is totally absurd.’","Bill Dodwell insists coffee chain is making no money in Britain .

A ban on pesticides feared to be killing bees was on the cards today after a majority of EU governments backed a move fiercely resisted by the UK coalition. After a vote in Brussels, Greenpeace urged the European Commission to act swiftly to introduce the ban for at least two years on three pesticides the organisation says have been shown scientifically to be harmful to bees. 'Today’s vote makes it crystal clear that there is overwhelming scientific, political and public support for a ban,' Greenpeace EU agriculture policy director Marco Contiero said. Move: A ban on pesticides feared to be killing bees was on the cards today after a majority of EU governments backed a move fiercely resisted by the UK coalition . 'Those countries opposing a ban have failed. Now, the Commission must draw the only conclusion possible and immediately halt the use of these pesticides as a first step to protect European food production and ecosystem.' The UK Government has come under fire for repeatedly opposing a ban on 'neonicotinoids' used on crops such as oil seed rape, which are attractive to bees. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has urged delays in deciding until more studies are completed into the effects on bees. But today EU deputy ambassadors voted by a majority to accept the available evidence, which many say confirms the danger to bees. Criticism: The UK Government has come under fire for repeatedly opposing a ban on 'neonicotinoids' used on crops such as oil seed rape, which are attractive to bees . Friends of the Earth said the vote was a 'significant victory for bees and common sense' - and urged the UK Government to introduce a 'bee action plan'. FoE head of campaigns Andrew Pendleton said: 'This decision is a significant victory for common sense and our beleaguered bee populations. Restricting the use of these pesticides could be an historic milestone on the road to recovery for these crucial pollinators. 'But pesticides are just one of the threats bees face - if David Cameron is genuinely concerned about declining bee numbers he must urgently introduce a bee action plan.' On the UK’s lack of support for a ban, Mr Pendleton added: 'The UK Government’s refusal to back restrictions on these chemicals, despite growing scientific concern about their impact, is yet another blow to its environmental credibility. 'Ministers must now help farmers to grow and protect crops, but without relying so heavily on chemicals - especially those linked to bee decline.' FoE says it has played a major role in persuading home and garden retailers to act on neonicotinoid insecticides, with firms including B&Q, Homebase, Wyevale and Dobbies removing such products from their shelves.","Majority of EU governments backed move fiercely resisted by UK coalition .

Suspect: Eliver Kestler has been charged with practicing dentistry without a license and distributing controlled substances . New Mexico investigators are looking for more victims of an unlicensed tooth doctor found operating as a ‘mobile dentist’ out of his small sedan around Santa Fe. Authorities are asking all victims of a man known as ‘El Dentista’ to file a report. Santa Fe police say they want to build a strong case against Eliver Kestler, also known as Eliver Lopez. The 36-year-old was arrested April 20 on a tip from a former customer. Investigators discovered Kestler with a portable drill machine and other dental equipment in a small, red sedan. Kestler told police he had a dentistry license in Mexico but no license in the U.S. One woman told investigators she had teeth removed by Kestler but he didn't come through with replacements. Kestler has been charged with practicing dentistry without a license and distributing controlled substances. Clinic on wheels: Police discovered a portable drill machine and other dental equipment inside his red Chevrolet sedan . Man of many names: Kestler, who also goes by the last name Lopez, called himself El Dentista on his Spanish-language business cards . Filthy conditions: Police say all of the equipment was being stored in the car in unsanitary conditions . Disgusting finds: Officers came across teeth molds scattered around the interior of the car . Celina Westervelt, a spokeswoman for the Santa Fe Police Department, described the conditions inside Kestler’s dental practice on wheels as 'disgusting,' explaining that the car was filled with 'leftover residual materials.' Among the items seized from the red Chevy sedan were teeth molds scattered around the interior and prescription drugs, including Lidocane, Epinephrine, Septocaine and Disprospan. Westervelt told the station KRQE that an undercover officer called Kestler Saturday pretending to be a new client in need of dental work. Kestler was initially apprehensive, inquiring how the would-be patient got his phone number, but he eventually agreed to meet the officer on Agua Fria Street, where he was arrested by police. Police searched Kestler's portable office and discovered and photographed unsanitary equipment and materials. Health hazard: One of Kestler's alleged patients developed a serious infection after he had removed her four bottom teeth . 'Drug pusher:' Officers found prescription drugs, including Lidocane, Epinephrine, Septocaine and Disprospan, which are commonly used in dentistry, inside the red car .

Excuse: Kestler told officials that he had a dentistry license in Mexico but not in the U.S. Investigators believe the bogus dentist has been working on patients out of his car for at least five years. The patient who ended up blowing the whistle on the 36-year-old suspected con artist told police that he paid Kestler $280 to put in four replacement teeth and get two crowns done. Police say so far five people have come forward to file reports, including a 45-year-old woman who contracted a severe infection after Kestler allegedly pulled out her four bottom teeth without cause.","Police believe Eliver Kestler, 36, also known as Eliver Lopez, has been practicing out of his car for five years .

Davena Kumar, whose brother Suneet Jeerh was sentenced to four years in prison, said:  ‘I know my brother was tortured – I’ve seen  the marks.’ Mr Jeerh, 25, was arrested last July with Grant Cameron, also 25, and Karl Williams, 26, while on holiday in the Gulf state after synthetic cannabis, known as ‘spice’, was found in their car. Defence: Davena Kumar says her brother Suneet Jeerh is innocent of drug possession . Beaten: Davena said that she saw the marks from her brother's torture . They have now been found guilty at Dubai’s criminal court of possessing, taking and intending to distribute illegal drugs. There were fears they could be jailed . for 15 years but the more serious supply charges were dropped. But Mr . Cameron and Mr Williams, from Wanstead, East London, and Mr Jeerh, from .

Conviction: Karl Williams is another Briton sentenced to serve four years in a Dubai prison . Prime Minister David Cameron has . expressed concern over the torture allegations and pledged to raise . their case during a visit to the UK this week by the president of the . United Arab Emirates. Miss Kumar said her brother would . appeal his sentence, adding: ‘He is innocent, he is not guilty. All . those charges will be dropped. I originally found out about the torture . from a friend and I just started screaming. I couldn’t believe any human . could do that. ‘They dragged my brother from his . apartment, kicking and punching him. They handcuffed him so he couldn’t . move and punched and electrocuted him with a cattle prod. ‘His whole spine was electrocuted . quite badly. Even now you can see where his back is still not the same.’ She added: ‘They used the back of the gun to smash him on the head and . cut him. I was there last week and saw his head open. ‘That was ten months later, so it shows the severity.’ Miss Kumar also spoke of her . brother’s mental turmoil during his ordeal, saying: ‘He was happy and . always positive and never negative, but this has changed him . completely . He’s isolated in a prison where no one speaks English.’ Before yesterday’s hearing, Mr . Cameron said from behind bars: ‘They Tasered my torso three times in the . police car. It was unbelievably painful. ‘I still cannot believe this is . happening. I have shared a cell with murderers and fraudsters. It was . scary in the beginning but you get used to it.

A Missouri couple have returned home with their rare identical girl triplets more than one month after their birth, but they are still finding it difficult to tell them apart. Brad and Laura Partridge from Des Peres, celebrated the successful delivery of their daughters Sonja, Sylvia and Scarlet, on March 19 - seven weeks before their due date. Despite kitting them out with color-coded outfits, Mr Partridge told NewsmagazineNetwork.com that he constantly gets the newborns mixed up, especially when his wife sends photos and asks him to 'guess who'. Bundles of joy: Laura and Brad Partridge show off their identical triplets, Scarlett, Sylvia and Sonja . Who's who? Scarlett wears pink, Sylvia purple and Sonja yellow as the parents struggle to tell them apart . 'I don’t think I’ve gotten one right yet,' he admitted. 'We know it’s just going to take some . extra coordination and focus to make sure we don’t get them mixed up, . but they’ll eventually be developing their own little quarks and . personalities to tell them apart.' However Mrs Partridge,34, is better at identifying her babies by looking at the shape of their faces. 'Our smallest, Scarlett, her face is still a little bit thinner and more petite . . Sonja, who has the biggest face, is a little fuller,' the mother-of-five explained. 'We know it’s just going to take some . extra coordination and focus to make sure we don’t get them mixed up' However, she said as they grow and their bodies change shape it will become increasingly difficult to work out who is who. 'When everyone is at the exact same . weight, once they’re bundled up in blankets and have their hats on and . their eyes closed – it’s going to be like looking at the same baby times . three.' Making it easier to identify their daughters the Partridges devised a nifty plan. 'Everyone . has a signature colour,' Mrs Partridge told MailOnline. 'Pink for . Scarlett, purple for Sylvia and yellow for Sonja, and they have . corresponding outfits. Peaceful: Scarlett Partridge pictured ay the Mercy St. Louis Hospital shortly after her birth . Nap time: Like her sisters, Sylvia Partridge weighed over three pounds when she was born 7 weeks early . Baby steps: Sonja and her sisters remained in hospital for several weeks until their weight was up . 'A . friend is even getting me non-toxic nail polish for their toenails so that . way we know for sure who's who in the middle of the night, or during a . bath.' After they were born the three sisters, who all weighed three pounds, remained in intensive care at Mercy Children's Hospital . until they reached certain feeding and weight goals. The Partridges, who also have a three-year-old son, Stephen, and a . 17-month-old daughter, Stella, conceived the triplets without the use of fertility treatments. Recalling the news that she was pregnant with triplets at her eight-week scan Mrs Partridge said: 'The doctor said, ""There's one... There's . two..."" I was like, ""What!"" 'I honestly don't even remember her telling . me about the third. They were sharing one placenta so we knew they would . be identical.' The only multiple births on either side of the family are Mr Partridge's grandmother's twin sisters. Growing: Laura and Brad already have a three-year-old son, Stephen, and a 17-month-old daughter, Stella. Laura was on bed rest in hospital for three weeks before they welcomed their little sisters . Brotherly love: The Partridge's son Stephen couldn't wait to have his sisters home . After their initial shock subsided, the Partridges grew concerned about the dangers. 'They told us the scary statistics,' she said. 'We weren't able to celebrate like we were with our other two children. I think it . really wasn't until they were actually born that I could relax.' The family is now overjoyed at getting to know the new additions; Mrs Partridge said that as well as being identical, they're even alike in personality and take it in turns to have a 'feisty' day. The couple introduced their other children to the . babies on Easter Sunday at hospital. 'It was a bit overwhelming for my . son,' Mrs Partridge said of Stephen. 'He covered his eyes when he saw the babies because . there were machines and tubes around. 'But he thought it was neat that they weren't crying and always talks about going to visit them at the hospital again.' Delicate: Mrs Partridge returned home before her baby girls . Colour code: The family plans on painting the babies' toenails in the colours to make bath time easier . Support: The Partridges said family, friends and neighbors have rallied around to help out . The likelihood of having identical . triplets is unknown, but some estimates range from one in 60,000 births . to one in 200 million. Obstetrician Dr. Gilbert Webb said the Partridge trio are only the third set of triplets he has seen in his 27-year career. 'It is extremely rare to have three babies share the same placentas,' he said. 'I'm so happy for Laura and Brad that their beautiful new babies are doing well.' Mrs Partridge said relatives, neighbors and church friends have helped with the babies' return home. 'Everyone has been wonderful,' she said - and the love is paying off. 'They are all doing very well,' Mr Partridge added of his baby girls. 'They are our one in 200 million babies.'","The chances of giving birth to identical triplets ranges from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million .

During a two-week leave in 2007, Private First Class Kimberly Rivera crossed the Canadian . border to avoid having to complete a second tour of duty in . Iraq. Rivera, 30, was a wheeled-vehicle driver in Fort Carson's 4th . Infantry Brigade Combat Team and served in Iraq in 2006. At a court martial on Monday the . mother-of-four said she had became 'disillusioned' with the U.S. mission . and pleaded guilty to two counts of desertion and a bad-conduct . discharge. The Colorado . Springs Gazette reported that when judge Colonel Timothy Grammel asked . Rivera how long she remained absent, she replied: 'As long as I possibly . could, sir. ... I intended to quit my job permanently.' After fleeing to Canada, Rivera applied for refugee status but was denied. She also applied for permanent residency, but Canadian immigration officials rejected that application as well. Requests to stay on humanitarian and compassionate grounds were also rejected by the authorities. An online petition was set up in Canada . to oppose Rivera's deportation order, which was signed by 19,000 people . and rallies were held in a number of cities in the country calling on . the government to let her stay in the country. Deserter: Kimberley Rivera, a female soldier in the U.S. Army has been sentenced to 10 months in prison after she admitted fleeing to Canada to avoid a second tour of duty in Iraq . Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop . Desmond Tutu and the U.S. veterans organization Veterans for Peace also . protested the deportation order. But, following an unsuccessful appeal against the order, Rivera was finally deported last year and was arrested as soon as she entered the U.S. and taken into military custody. During her sentencing hearing, government lawyers argued that Rivera, who was granted leave shortly into her tour to work out marital issues, failed to return because her husband threatened to leave her and take their children. James Matthew Branum, Rivera's civilian defense attorney, said Rivera never filed for status as a conscientious objector because she didn't know the option was available to her. Mr Branum said Rivera should have . been informed about it when she met with a chaplain in Iraq over . concerns that she couldn't take a life. In . 2012, the War Resisters Support Campaign, a Canadian activist group, . estimated that there were about 200 Iraq war resisters in Canada. It . said two other Iraq war resisters who were deported, Robin Long and . Clifford Cornell, faced lengthy jail sentences upon their return.

Long was given a dishonorable discharge in 2008 and sentenced to 15 months in a military prison after pleading guilty to charges of desertion. The lower house of Canada's Parliament most recently passed a motion in 2009 in favor of allowing U.S. military deserters to stay, but the Conservative Party government was not persuaded. During the Vietnam War, as many as 90,000 Americans won refuge in Canada, most of them to avoid the military draft. Many were given permanent residence status that led to Canadian citizenship, but the majority went home after President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty in the late 1970s.

He was arrested on suspicion of launching what is . described as the biggest cyberattack in internet history operated from a bunker and had a van capable of hacking into networks anywhere in the . country. On parade: Sven Kamphuis with a flag outside his 'CyberBunker'  HQ last month . CyberBunker, is the organisation accused of slowing down the world wide web and disrupting popular film services such as Netflix. An . anti-spam group has tried to block internet traffic from CyberBunker, . which allegedly launched a ‘denial of service’ attack in revenge. This involves sending billions of megabytes of useless data over the internet to clog it up. In . charge at CyberBunker is Sven Olaf Kamphuis, who styles himself the . ‘Minister of Telecommunications and Foreign Affairs’ of the ‘Republic . CyberBunker’. He denied being responsible for the chaos but said he was a spokesman for the culprits. He claimed the guilty parties were .

CyberBunker brags on its website that it . has been a frequent target for law enforcement agencies because of its . controversial customers – it hosts websites for companies offering . ‘anything except child porn and terrorism’. A source close to the investigation told . the Telegraph that the suspect S.K. is Sven Olaf Kamphuis, who acted as . a spokesman for Cyberbunker at the time of the attack. The suspect travelled in Spain using his van 'as a mobile computing office, equipped with various antennas to scan frequencies', an interior ministry statement said. The suspect is accused of attacking the Swiss-British anti-spam watchdog group Spamhaus whose main task is to halt ads for counterfeit Viagra and bogus weight-loss pills reaching the world's inboxes. The anti-spam group tried to block internet traffic from CyberBunker, which allegedly launched a ‘denial of service’ attack in revenge.

The statement said officers uncovered the computer hacker's bunker, 'from where he even did interviews with different international media'. The statement said the suspect called himself a diplomat belonging to the 'Telecommunications and Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Republic of Cyberbunker'. Spanish police were alerted in March by Dutch authorities of large denial-of-service attacks being launched from Spain that were affecting internet servers in the Netherlands, United Kingdom and the US. These attacks culminated with a major onslaught on Spamhaus. The . Netherlands National Prosecution Office described them as . 'unprecedentedly serious attacks on the nonprofit organisation .

A woman stabbed her uncle to death during a family gathering after he confessed to molesting her late sister 12 years earlier. Bernadette Watt, 29, went berserk and knifed 48-year old Peter Watt in the heart with a kitchen knife after he admitted touching Michelle when she was 16. Initially Watt tried to claim a friend was behind the attack but confessed to the stabbing in a sudden outburst to police saying: 'He deserved it. He's a paedo. I stabbed him, I stabbed him.' Knifed to death: Peter Watt, 48, who was murdered by Bernadette, 29, right, after apparently confessing to molesting her sister when she was 16 . Today she was found guilty of murder at Manchester Crown Court and was jailed for a minimum term of 22 years. Mr Watt was stabbed to death when a violent row broke out at his brother Michael's house in Sholver, near Oldham, last November. Shortly afterwards a 999 call was made . to police and the operator gave instructions to the caller about giving . CPR to the victim. The call handler could hear a voice in . the background shouting: 'He's dead, he's dead. I've killed him, I've . killed him, he's dead.' Scene: Police start their investigation in Sholver, Oldham, after Peter Watt was stabbed to death last November . Probe: Police were called after a row broke out at the family gathering last November . Officers arrived and found Mr Watt . lying on the floor, being cradled by his brother. Bernadette Watt was . sitting on the settee screaming and shouting. The victim had been stabbed repeatedly . with a kitchen knife and had bruising to his face neck and body . indicating a sustained attack. Killer: Bernadette Watt who was today jailed for a minimum of 22 years after being found guilty of murder . The court heard in the immediate . aftermath of the killing family friend John Connolly, 39, who was at the . gathering, agreed he would 'take the blame', and Watt was taken to . Oldham police station as a witness. When police arrived Connolly said: 'Arrest me I did it.' Neighbour Doreen Barnes-Roberts said: 'I heard a female voice and I heard something about not phoning the police. The female said that she would get the blame but he said ""don't worry I'll take the blame"".' In interview with police Watt said 'it was my mate John who stabbed him' but she later confessed and said her uncle had slept with Michelle who died last year at the age of 28. While on remand ahead of the murder trial she again admitted the stabbing and said that Connolly was not involved. Theresa Fletcher, who met Watt while at Styal prison said: 'I was told he was present but he did nothing. If anything he was trying to get her to stop.' Ms Fletcher claimed she had been told by Bernadette Watt that the victim had admitted to 'touching' her sister Michelle and added: 'Once he actually admitted it she went berserk. I couldn't believe the extremes she went to.' She said that Bernadette Watt had dismissed Mr Connolly as 'daft' for admitting to the stabbing. Tests showed Peter sustained three stab wounds in total, two to the chest and one to the heart which first penetrated the left upper arm. Connolly, of Oldham, stood trial for murder alongside Watt but he was cleared on the directions of the judge after defence lawyers argued there was no case to answer. Senior Investigator Andrew Tattersall of Greater Manchester Police said today: 'Our thoughts remain with the family of Peter Watt. 'While I hope that Watt being brought to justice provides Peter's family some consolation, there are clearly no winners in this tragic case. 'Only Watt knows why she did what she did, and it is clear that she will have to live with that for the rest of her life.'","Bernadette Watt, 29, stabbed her uncle Peter in the heart, the court heard .

If the drudgery of the daily commute has lost its charm, businessman Jeremy Paxton may have the high-octane antidote. He's started doing his treks to the office on an amazing water-powered jet pack that appears to owe more to the technology of James Bond and Buzz Lightyear than the Clapham omnibus. Instead of getting the car out of the garage or heading to the bus stop, he straps on the device, which uses water pressure to lift him up to 30ft in the air and propel him along horizontally at speeds of up to 25mph. Scroll down for demo!... To infinity and be-Bond! Jeremy Paxton shows off his 007-style jet pack which he uses to commute to work . Water way to travel: The jet pack can lift Mr Paxton up to 30ft in the air and propel him horizontally at speeds of up to 25mph . He says the 40-mile journey from his riverside boathouse home in Marpledurham near Reading to his office at the Lower Mill Estate in the Cotswolds is possible because the River Thames and waterways run direct between the two. Though he does have to walk the last three minutes to his office. Mr Paxton, 51, has also been asked to be the UK's 'test pilot' and to compile a 'Pilot User Guide' for other would-be customers. But the fun comes at a price. The jet pack, which is imported from Germany where it is made under license from American company JetLev, will set you back a cool £115,000 – enough to buy an Aston Martin V8 Vantage for 007 and still have change for a few gadgets. Who needs the car: The 51-year-old uses the device to travel from his riverside boathouse home in Marpledurham near Reading to his office at the Lower Mill Estate in the Cotswolds . A practical plaything: Depending on the pilot's weight, a JetLev Flyer can top speeds of 30mph and cruise for between two to three hours before refueling, with a range of around 80 miles . The jet pack is not a rocket. Instead it operates on the same principle as a giant pump by generating huge amounts of water pressure to provide a thrust similar to that of a fireman’s hose. Mr Paxton, whose business interests include the Lower Mill Estate in Gloucestershire, an upmarket 600-acre waterside community of eco-friendly luxury second-homes in the Cotswolds, said: 'I’m the first person in Britain to buy one. I just like alternative means of transport. 'It’s a different way to commute. It’s better than sitting in a traffic jam or being stuck on a crowded train. It’s environmentally-friendly. 'It’s fantastic fun and it’s not complicated to operate. I often commute to London by train and sometimes take my boat to the station. I have a pilot’s licence and fly planes and helicopters. Why not this?’ 00-heaven: The jet pack, designed by Chinese-born Canadian Raymond Li, was inspired by the one used by James Bond in the opening scenes of the 1965 film Thunderball (right) A Toy Story: The jet pack is not too dissimilar to the backpack used by Buzz Lightyear (right) The jet pack comprises a number of key parts. First, there is the pack itself which resembles the one used by James Bond in Thunderball or by Buzz Lightyear in the movie Toy Story. This is connected to a 33ft hose which in turn is connected to a boat-like flotation device, inside which is a 250cc four-stroke petrol motor. The 'boat' is the pump generator and sits in the water sucking up vast quantities of water which are then forced through the hose and into the jet nozzles on a special lightweight carbon-fibre frame weighing 30lbs strapped to the pilot’s back. The sheer force of this jet lifts the pilot off the ground or out of the water. He or she then controls the speed by a motor-cycle-style twist-grip on one of the handles. Direction is just like flying and depends on the pilot shifting his or her weight. The maximum altitude is limited by the length of the tube, which also limits the distance from water a pilot can travel. A digital fly-by-wire system is used to . control the throttle which the makers say make flight controls simple, . light and intuitive. Mr Paxton added: 'It’s entirely buoyant so it won’t sink. You can go 30ft high or hover over the water – even walk on the water. 'If . you want to go right you put down your right hand you can do tight . turns. After a few goes, you get the hang of it It’s like riding a . bicycle. You have a ""kill switch"" around your wrist to cut the power.' Inspired by the jet pack used in the . opening scenes of Thunderball, the Jetlev is the brainchild of Raymond . Li, a Chinese-born Canadian who first . sketched out his concept on a yellow Post-it Note in 2000 and spent the . next 10 years developing it. The makers say that, depending on pilot weight, a standard JetLev Flyer could top speeds of 30mph and cruise for between two to three hours before refueling with a range of around 80 miles. It can accommodate pilots of 1.5metres to 2metres in height and between 40kg and 150kg in weight. Mr Paxton is himself a keen flyer who has his own aeroplane and helicopter. Earlier this month, he abseiled down London’s new Shard skyscraper with the Duke of York in aid of charity. The makers say basic skills can be mastered in just 15 minutes though intermediate skills will take between one and 10 hours. Pioneer: Mr Paxton has been asked to be the UK's 'test pilot' and to compile a Pilot User Guide for other would-be customers . Price: £115,000 . Maximum altitude: 30ft . Top speed: circa 30mph . Cruising duration: 2 to 3 hours . Range:Around 80 miles . Weight of jet-pack harness: 30lbs . Jetpack height: 3ft 2in . Width: 2ft 11ins . Length: 2ft . Power: 250cc four-cylinder petrol engine . ‘Boat’ length: 10ft 7 inches . Height: 2ft 3 inches . Weight: 649 lbs . Jetlev’s website notes: ‘As soon as sufficient lift is applied, you and the jetpack become weightless and levitate in the air and even small amounts of force will move or turn you. 'You will feel some pressure from the saddle and the trapeze, but usually no more than from riding a bicycle.’ But pilots must be 18 years old. And Jetlev cautions: ‘You must be a good swimmer and should not feel uncomfortable having your face in the water from time to time. 'You should not have a fear of heights. 'You should be in good health and physical condition. 'You should have no history of any heart conditions and flying is not advised for women who are pregnant.’ Last month, hotel manager Grant Engler, 25, and his fiancé and Amanda Volf tied the knot in the world’s first jet pack wedding at a ceremony in the U.S. They each flew to the beachside ceremony at Newport Beach in California wearing Jetlev water-powered jet pack. After exchanging vows the newlyweds performed an airborne first dance - above the water - to Frank Sinatra’s ‘Come Fly With Me’. The daring couple, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, became engaged on an adventure holiday to Mexico in April.","Jeremy Paxton, 51, uses £115k device to make 40-mile journey along Thames .

The laboratory which created Dolly the sheep has produced a disease-resistant piglet using a new technique which is simpler than cloning. It is believed the development could bring GM meat a step closer. The piglet, known only as 'Pig 26', was created through a process called 'gene editing' at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute four months ago. It was engineered to have a gene making it immune to African swine . fever which can kill European pigs within 24 hours of . infection. The technique is faster and more efficient than existing methods, and also does not involve the use of antibiotic-resistance genes. One of the main arguments against the use of GM is based on the use of the genes which campaigners fear could lead to crucial drugs becoming ineffective. Scientists looking for ways to feed the ever growing population hope it could make genetic engineering of livestock more publicly acceptable, the Telegraph reports. The process works by snipping an animal's DNA and inserting new genetic material. Researchers say it copies a natural genetic mutation and would therefore by impossible to tell by looking at an animal's DNA whether it had been modified. It has a success rate of ten to 15 per cent compared to less than one per cent for the existing methods used by scientists. It can also be carried out on a fertilised egg without the need for cloning techniques. Prof Bruce Whitelaw told the paper: 'We can get rid of antibiotic resistance and for some situations we can get rid of cloning as well. I think cloning does have some baggage attached to it.' The gene was taken from wild African pigs. The creatures are naturally immune to the African fever virus but cannot breed with European species. The piglet, known only as 'Pig 26', was created through a process called 'gene editing' at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute where Dolly the sheep was created 17 years ago . It is now hoped other livestock, such as cattle and sheep immune to a host of diseases, could become immune to a host of other diseases with the technique.

"PUBLISHED: . 16:30 EST, 24 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:34 EST, 24 April 2013 . Accused: Dr Kermit Gosnell faces the death penalty if he is found guilty of killing babies and a woman . Defense lawyers for a doctor accused of killing four babies in a Philadelphia abortion clinic by snipping their spines have rested their case without calling a single witness. The high-profile murder trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, 72, has been underway for almost six weeks, during which time the jury has heard from a plethora of former employees who have shared startling stories of the practices they allegedly witnessed. He is charged with killing four infants during botched abortions as well as a 41-year-old woman who died of an overdose after the procedure at his Women's Medical Society clinic in urban West Philadelphia. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Prosecutors said Gosnell ran a clinic where women went for late-term abortions. Gosnell's defense lawyer, John McMahon, characterized the prosecution of his client, who is black, as 'elitist, racist' He added that there is no evidence that the babies were delivered alive, noting 'the first rule of homicide is someone has to be alive'. Earlier this week, three of eight murder charges were . thrown out, . apparently because the judge had not heard sufficient evidence that the three babies were viable, born alive and then . killed. The defense questioned testimony from staffers who said they had seen babies move, cry or breathe. McMahon argued that each testified to seeing only a single movement or breath. Tragic: He faces a murder charge in the overdose death of Karnamaya Mongar, left, who died in 2009 . Scene: A police car is seen outside the the Women's Medical Society in 2011 following Gosnell's arrest . 'These are not the movements of a live . child,' McMahon said. 'There is not one piece - not one - of objective, . scientific evidence that anyone was born alive.' The jury will also ponder third-degree . murder charges against Gosnell for the 2009 overdose death of . 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar, who died after an abortion at his Women's . Medical Society. Former staffers have testified that patients received heavy sedatives and painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended. Despite that, the workers testified that they had never seen a woman go into distress before Mongar. Yet a 2011 grand jury report alleges that dozens of women were injured at Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a ‘house of horrors.’ House of horror: A grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the Philadelphia practice . Operating table: Women were often given such high doses of drugs that they gave birth in the toilet . Mess: The interior of the clinic, which an report noted smelled of cat urine and was splatted with blood . Some left with torn wombs or bowels, . some with venereal disease contracted through the reuse of . non-sterilized equipment, and some left with fetal remains still inside . them, the report alleged. And the report blamed Gosnell for an earlier maternal death that was not charged. Assistant . District Attorney Ed Cameron, in defending the Mongar charge, said it . stemmed from the totality of the circumstances at Gosnell's clinic. They . included the repeated medication dosages given by medical assistants; . the doctor's absence during most of her two-day visit; and the hour it . took to open a locked side door and take her by stretcher to an . ambulance. The prosecutor . questioned why else Gosnell and his staff would 'snip' babies if they . were not born alive. The brains were intact, so it was not done to make . the delivery easier, he said. 'Why would you cut a baby in the back of the neck unless you were killing it?' Cameron argued. The doctor: Kermit Gosnell . Charged: Pearl Gosnell . Employee: Elizabeth Hampton . Arrested: Tina Baldwin . Assistant: Lynda Williams . Worker: Adrine Moton . Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil . Mugshot: Sherry West . Held: Maddline Joe . Gosnell . had also been charged with five counts of abuse of a corpse, for . removing the feet from aborted fetuses and storing them in specimen . jars. McMahon argued that his client did so to keep DNA samples, and . Minehart agreed to dismiss those counts. Minehart upheld charges that Gosnell . violated Pennsylvania's abortion laws by performing abortions after 24 . weeks and failing to counsel women 24 hours before the procedure. Last . week, a medical assistant told a jury that she saw one late-term baby . who survived an abortion 'swimming' in a toilet 'trying to get out.' Kareema . Cross also claimed she saw the spines of at least 10 babies snipped . using scissors during unorthodox late-term abortions at a West . Philadelphia clinic. Other employees at the clinic also . confirmed that babies were often expelled from their mothers into the . toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be removed from the . floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.' Charged: Dr. Kermit Gosnell, a Philadelphia abortion doctor, is accused of killing 4 babies allegedly born alive . Many pregnant women were given drugs to induce labor. Cross, who worked at the clinic from . 2005 to 2009, was so disturbed by its operation that she took photos and . called authorities, although she gave a relative's name. Employee Latosha Lewis said 'one or . two babies fell out of patients each night. They dropped on lounge . chairs, on the floor, and often in the toilet.' The 2011 grand jury report blasts state . and city officials for failing to inspect or shutter Gosnell's busy . clinic in West Philadelphia. The 300-page grand jury report, that . initially laid out the charges against Gosnell, details the appalling . conditions of the West Philadelphia clinic the doctor operated. Clinic: When Mongar fell unconscious, staff took an hour to unlock a side door to get her out, pictured . Discarded: Bags stashed with body parts, pictured, were also found in the Philadelphia clinic . It . was described as reeking of cat urine, with walls splattered with blood . and patient rooms filled with unsanitary instruments and broken- down . equipment. The tiny fetuses and many of their . bodyparts were piled high throughout Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and . freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, even cat-food containers. Jars with severed feet lined shelves, prosecutors said. 'It was a baby charnel house,' the grand jury report said. Gosnell has been in jail since his . January 2011 arrest.

Allowing women the right to travel, work or use contraception without their husbands' permission would lead to the 'complete disintegration' of society, Egypt's powerful Islamic movement has warned. The statement from Muslim Brotherhood - the movement that backs President Mohamed Morsi -  came as it urged Muslim countries to reject a UN declaration on women's rights it claims would 'undermine Islamic ethics and destroy the family'. The document, which is being drafted by the UN Commission on the Status of Women, would grant girls 'full sexual freedom', 'allow Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men', and provide 'respect for prostitutes', the party said in a statement on its website. Disintegration of society: The statement on the Muslim Brotherhood website detailed the 'decadence that awaits' should the country sign the UN document on women's rights . The Brotherhood, whose Freedom and Justice Party propelled Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi to power last June, posted the statement objecting to the UN declaration on its English language website on Thursday. It joins Russia, Iran and the Vatican in voicing opposition to the document, which was set to be formally adopted as the 57th session of the Commission in New York came to a close today. The Muslim Brotherhood said the declaration would give 'wives full rights to file legal complaints against husbands accusing them of rape or sexual harassment, obliging competent authorities to deal husbands punishments similar to those prescribed for raping or sexually harassing a stranger'. U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice last week touted at the commission - a global policy-making body created in 1946 for the advancement of women - progress made by the United States in reducing the rate of violence against women by their partners. 'All 50 states in our union now have laws that treat date rape or spousal rape as just as much of a crime as rape by a stranger,' Rice said. 'We cannot live in truly free societies, if women and girls are not free to reach their full potential.' The contrasting views show the gap that needs to be breached in negotiations on the declaration, which this year is focused on urging an end to violence against women and girls. The commission failed to agree a declaration last year on a theme of empowering rural women due to similar disagreements. Mohamed Morsi: The Muslim Brotherhood helped to propel President Morsi to power in Egypt last June . Egypt has proposed an amendment, diplomats say, that would allow countries to avoid implementing the declaration if it clashed with national laws, religious or cultural values. But some diplomats say this would undermine the entire declaration. The Muslim Brotherhood warned the declaration would give girls sexual freedom, legalize abortion, provide teenagers with contraceptives, give equality to women in marriage and require men and women to share duties such as child care and chores. It said the declaration would allow 'equal rights to homosexuals, and provide protection and respect for prostitutes' and 'equal rights to adulterous wives and illegitimate sons resulting from adulterous relationships'. A coalition of Arab human rights groups - from Egypt, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, Jordan and Tunisia - called on countries at the Commission on the Status of Women yesterday to stop using religion, culture, and tradition to justify abuse of women. 'The current positions taken by some Arab governments at this meeting is clearly not representative of civil society views, aspirations or best practices regarding the elimination and prevention of violence against women and girls within our countries,' said the statement issued by the Coalition for Sexual and Bodily Rights in Muslim Societies. Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile and head of UN Women, which supports the commission, said the commission was unable to reach a deal a decade ago when it last focused on the theme of women's rights and ending violence against women. 'Ten years later, we simply cannot allow disagreement or indecision to block progress for the world's women,' Bachelet told the opening session of the commission last week. 'The world is watching ... the violence needs to stop'.","Muslim Brotherhood slammed UN report on ending violence against women .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and Tamara Cohen . PUBLISHED: . 10:17 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:23 EST, 22 April 2013 . David Cameron’s plan to enshrine an increase in foreign aid into law has been shelved, it emerged yesterday. The Government is committed to fixing international development spending at 0.7 per cent of GDP, one of the highest levels in the Western world. Increasing foreign aid is an article of faith for the Prime Minister, but he is opposed by many Tory MPs who want it cut. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today during an Q&A session in Derbyshire, has promised to pass the 0.7% target into law before the 2015 election . All three main parties signed up to the policy before the last election and the Tories and Lib Dems wrote it into the coalition agreement in 2010. The Bill has been ready for more than a year, with ministers promising it will be introduced when time allows. The rumoured omission will delight many Tory MPs who have called for rises in foreign aid to be curbed and protections lifted at a time when other areas such as defence and police are suffering budget cuts. The Coalition’s Mid-Term Review, published in January, stated: ‘We have committed to increasing overseas aid to reach 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income from 2013.’ It would mean that future governments would have to change the law if they wanted to cut overseas aid below the United Nations target - met for the first time by the UK this year. Chancellor George Osborne announced in last month's Budget that Britain would meet the target this year . But campaigners fear that a failure to include it in the Government's agenda for the year ahead announced by the Queen on May 8 would indicate a waning commitment to fulfil the promise by the end of this Parliament. Mr Cameron's official spokesman today told a Westminster media briefing: ‘The position is as set out in the coalition agreement, which the mid-term review clearly restated. There is no change.’ The spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the Queen's Speech. In last month’s Budget, Chancellor George Osborne said that the UK was already meeting its target without it being set down in law. He told MPs: ‘We deliver in this coming year on this nation’s long-standing commitment to the world’s poorest to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on international development. ‘We should all take pride, as I do, in this historic achievement for our country. As previously, the DfID budget will be adjusted to ensure we don’t spend more than 0.7 per cent.’ Melanie Ward, head of advocacy at development charity ActionAid, said: ‘News that the Government may be dropping its long-standing commitment to legislate to spend 0.7% of national income on aid is extremely disappointing. ‘To do so would break the promise made by all three political parties at the last general election to the British people and to the poorest people in the world. ‘We know that aid is most effective when it is predictable and so the certainty provided by legislation is crucial. Now is the time to enshrine that commitment in law, not to back away.’ The row comes as International Development Secretary Justine Greening said more UK aid money must be spent on 'disaster proofing' earthquake-prone countries. Today she visited British-funded projects in Haiti where a catastrophic tremor left 230,000 dead in 2010. In the wake of the Lushan County . earthquake in Sichuan Province, China, International Development Secretary Justine Greening promised more UK aid for quake-hit countries . Miss Greening said Saturday's deadly quake in rural China which killed at least 200 people and injured more than 11,000 was a fresh reminder of the fact that natural disasters tend to 'hit the poorest hardest'. Miss Greening said the UK could not just wait for the next natural disaster . She said: 'Britain is a world leader in humanitarian emergency response but it makes complete sense to invest in helping Haiti to take earthquakes and hurricanes in its stride. As the devastating earthquake in China this weekend has shown, natural disasters hit the poorest hardest. 'There is no point in getting involved only when the latest catastrophe hits if we know that simple improvements to infrastructure and training people to consider the risks of natural events mean that the country's development is not wiped out every time a major disaster strikes.' Miss Greening was in the Caribbean nation - one of the most natural disaster-prone on the planet - with former New Zealand prime minister and head of the United Nations Development Programme Helen Clark and UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator Baroness Amos. Britain has devoted £10 million to dealing with the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake - almost a quarter of the 1.5 million displaced people remain in camps -  and helping it prepare better for future disasters. Miss Greening used the visit to announce a £300,000 project to provide legal support and counselling for up to 500 victims of rape and violence and build 'safe spaces' for up to 300 girls aged 10-14. 'Improved rights and safety for women is just one ingredient necessary for Haiti to have a social, physical and financial infrastructure able to withstand setbacks and to continue on its path to development and growth,' she said. 'Haiti can only have a bright future if Haitians of both genders play a full and confident role in building prosperity.'","All main parties said it should be written into law to prevent cuts in future .

The image, taken in the village of Winmarleigh near Garstang, Lancashire, shows the wild animal caught in a vehicle's headlights. Wallaby in the wild: Police were handed this picture of a wallaby bounding down a country lane in the village of Winmarleigh near Garstang, Lancashire . The animal has now been nicknamed 'Skippy' by locals after the 1960s Australian TV series. Wallabies are native to Australia but have . been introduced in the UK in parks, zoos and farms. It is thought the . Lancashire wallaby had escaped from a nearby farm near the 19th century . Winmarleigh Hall adventure centre. It was spotted after a series of alleged sightings of the so-called 'Pilling Panther' - a wildcat on the loose on the outskirts of a nearby village. Sighting: Police have received regular reports of the wallaby on the loose - but had dismissed them . Police Constable Dave Kerfoot of Lancashire Police later posted the picture on his force's Facebook page. PC Kerfoot said: 'We have been receiving reports of a kangaroo being on the loose in Winmarleigh - at first, I suspected that it was just residents in Winmarleigh wanting a Winmarleigh Wallaby to rival the Pilling Panther. 'But when the photographic evidence came through we couldn't really dispute that there was a wallaby, or a kangaroo, in the road. In fact the photo would suggest I have been overly suspicious. 'As far as we know it's still out and about, it's certainly an interesting one. Whatever next I wonder.' Kangaroos and wallabies are marsupials and are closely related, though adult kangaroos are larger than wallabies. They can be identified via their teeth, which are different as kangaroos mainly eat grass while wallabies mostly eat leaves. One local Jozanda Parkinson posted a message saying: 'It's been living in the woods at the hall for a few weeks now and we've seen it numerous times. So it is definitely real!'

An anniversary appeal for information on the murder of Stephen Lawrence has prompted two 'very significant' phone calls, police said today. The appeal was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch programme last night, a week after the 20th anniversary of the racist attack in Eltham, South-East London. Officers are now following up a number of phone calls received after the programme. Victim: Stephen Lawrence was murdered 20 years ago and a special BBC1 Crimewatch appeal broadcast yesterday sought new information on the case . Distinctive: A man in a green jacket was seen opposite the Coronet cinema near the scene of the murder wearing a green jacket with a large 'V' Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll said they had many calls last night, but two in particular were 'very significant'. 'One could produce a potential . eyewitness to the attack, and one gives very good background information . about suspects already known,' he said. 'In addition to that we have also had . three phone calls about the green jumper or jacket and we will . certainly be making inquiries around those bits of information to verify . them.' Mr Lawrence, an 18-year-old aspiring . architect, was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in . an unprovoked racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in Well Hall Road . with a friend on the evening of April 22 1993. In January 2012 Gary Dobson and David . Norris were found guilty of being involved in the attack and sentenced . to life imprisonment, after a forensic review of the case found . significant new scientific evidence on clothing seized from their homes . following the murder. Gary Dobson, left, and David Norris were convicted of Stephen's killing in January last year. Dobson dropped his appeal last month while Norris continues to fight against his conviction . But police have said that, despite . securing two convictions, the investigation remains open and officers . believe there were people in the area of the murder who have never come . forward. These include two men who got off a . bus at the stop opposite where Mr Lawrence was attacked and walked . southbound along the east side of Well Hall Road; a man who ran from the . area of Well Hall Road roundabout to the bus stop on the same side of . Well Hall Road as the attack; a man who was walking on the east side of . Well Hall south of the roundabout, opposite the Coronet cinema, wearing a . distinctive green jacket with a large 'V'; and anyone else in the . general vicinity, such as those outside the cinema and on passing buses. Mr Driscoll said previously: . 'Although two individuals are serving a life sentence in connection with . this murder, we have always known there were other people involved in . the attack. As such this investigation remains open and my team is . committed to pursuing all viable lines of inquiry available to us. It is . hoped this appeal will assist with our inquiries. 'We believe there were people in the . area that night who may have seen something - not the murder itself . necessarily, but events or individuals leading up to the event. 'I am taking this opportunity to . appeal directly to those people to come forward and speak to us. You may . think you won't remember something from so long ago, but we would still . implore you to come forward.'

Maverick Tory Nadine Dorries has backed Boris Johnson to be Prime Minister and accused David Cameron of a 'controlling' leadership. She branded critics within her party of her decision to be the first serving MP to appear on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of here! as 'infantile and stupid.' Ms Dorries was suspended by the Conservatives for taking a month away from Wesminster so she could take part in the reality show in the Australian jungle, but claimed the then Chief Whip . Andrew Mitchell approved her absence. Out of there: Nadine Dorries was the first celebrity to be evicted from the reality jungle show . The MP for Mid-Bedfordshire, who has described Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne as 'posh boys', hailed London Mayor Johnson as her 'king of the jungle'. Nadine's 'hero': London Mayor Boris Johnson . In a interview published in the Sun today, she said: 'I long for the day Boris Johnson is Prime Minister. He is a good man and a hero of mine, and he can reach people other politicians can’t. 'I do believe this will happen, and . that he will be Prime Minister. If he doesn’t it might be the day I . consider giving up being an MP.' She attacked a 'real control mechanism' of MPs under Mr Cameron claiming MPs and how they vote are 'tampered with.' Mr Johnson, she said, would allow parliament to have a genuine free vote on issues like the abortion time limit. She added: 'He wouldn’t tamper with . people’s views, unlike what happens now in Cameron’s Westminster, and he . would be more statesmanlike.' Ms . Dorries said that she had told Mr Mitchell she would be away for a . month and that it would be 'controversial' - insisting she had missed . just three parliamentary sessions and no legislation. Mr . Mitchell quit as chief whip after a row over his confrontation with . police at the gates of Downing Street in which he allegedly called the . officers 'plebs.' Ms . Dorries told Sun writer Laura  Armstrong that new Chief Whip Sir George . Young had asked for a meeting when she returns to Britain, but that she . could not be de-selected. She said she would 'justify' her activities to her constituents when she returned home. Eviction: The MP survived 12 days in the jungle as a contestant on I'm A Celebrity . The MP claimed that a 'degree of panic' had set in at Downing Street when it learned she would appear on the programme. She said they feared she was going to 'damage' Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, adding: 'They thought, ""What can we do to distance her and rubbish her quickly before she rubbishes us?"" It was completely infantile and stupid.' Ms Dorries is now holed up in a luxury hotel on Queensland's Gold Coast after being the first celebrity to be voted off the show by the public vote. She was greeted by her partner, vet Chris Hammond, after surviving 12 days on the show and tackling some of its infamous Bushtucker Trials, which included eating an ostrich anus to win meals for her campmates . After leaving the jungle, she claimed to have gone straight back to her day job as a politician, but her bewildered constituency association said the MP, has still not been in contact. Bugged out: She was subjected to Bush Tucker trials, including being buried in a coffin with bugs . Miss Dorries insisted she had started . work within hours of being evicted from the Australian jungle, as seen . by viewers of the ITV show on Wednesday night. She said she was working from the Palazzo Versace resort, where a superior room costs £285 a night, and where she is due to stay until the series ends early next month. The MP, who has been paid up to £40,000 to appear on the show, said: ‘There’s been an office set up in my hotel room and I’ve already been back at work actually. Missed you: The evicted MP was greeted by partner Chris . 'As soon as I got out of the jungle I was straight back to work.’ But Budge Wells, deputy chairman of the Mid-Bedfordshire Conservative Association, last night said he has still to hear from his MP, adding: ‘She has not been in contact with me or anyone else in the association. ‘As I understand it she has set up an . office in her hotel and says she has gone straight back to work but we . have not heard from her.’ There have been more than 100 complaints from constituents about her absence. A poll in her constituency revealed almost 60 per cent of Conservatives ‘disapprove’ of her decision to abandon Parliament. Asked to rate how they feel about Miss Dorries, ranked from 0 to 10 where 0 is ‘extremely negative’, she scored just 2.82, while 58 per cent said David Cameron was right to suspend her.Just 8 per cent said they are now more likely to vote for her. Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, who commissioned the survey, said: ‘Nadine said she was doing the show for the chance to talk to a huge audience about important questions, at a time when nobody pays attention to politicians. 'Unfortunately, her constituents are not buying this. ‘There is a long way to go to the next election and voters can be forgiving. But however well-intentioned, Nadine’s publicity stunt does not look like the triumph she hoped for.’ Labour MP Steve McCabe mocked Miss Dorries’s claim to be working, saying: ‘I’m sure her constituents will be greatly relieved to hear that she is going to do part of her job from her five-star hotel.’","MP slams party critics of her stint in the show as 'infantile and stupid'

Wives living in small towns and villages get worse divorce settlements than those who split in big cities, according to new research. The disparity is so great than growing numbers of women from the north of England are ‘racing’ to have their cases be heard in London courts. Lawyers claim there is now a ‘maintenance map’ which dictates the generosity of divorce settlements and the frequency of maintenance payments. City dwelling ex-wives secured a bigger slice of the cake in divorce cases, research suggests . According to the research wives who had their cases heard in provincial courts were less likely to be granted maintenance from their ex-husband in addition to splitting marital assets. Legal firm Pannone analysed some 700 cases from the last two years. Partner Liz Cowell claims wives from London, Manchester, Bristol, Leeds or Birmingham could expect to receive ongoing financial support from their former spouse. But  those in smaller towns were told to ‘stand on their own two feet’. Women in cities like Leeds (left) and Birmingham got a better deal than those whose cases were heard in provincial towns, lawyers said . She said: ‘It is a complicated picture which reflects the differing interpretations certain courts appear to place on the needs of wives after divorce. ‘Courts have an obligation to have a financial clean break between spouses on divorce, if possible. If that cannot be achieved, they look to meet the immediate needs of a wife for things such as a house from any joint capital which couples might have built up as well as providing ongoing maintenance. ‘Divorce law is designed to be discretionary, so that it can be flexible enough to produce outcomes suiting the particular needs of individuals. That also means there can be great variety in settlements. ‘We came across many instances of wives from the North wanting their cases heard in London because they felt they had a better chance of securing capital and generous maintenance whilst, in the North East, family lawyers told me that maintenance awards were infrequent at best. ‘However, it’s not simply a North-South settlement divide. There are considerable local and regional variations which demonstrate the impact of discretion on divorcees’ circumstances.’ It effectively means wives face a postcode lottery over whether they will get extra support. Some parts of the country are considered more ‘wife-friendly’ while judges in other areas will urge a ‘clean break’.","Lawyers say wives in big cities are more likely to be awarded maintenance .

A rusty old Jaguar left to rot in a barn for 30 years has sold at auction for nearly £110,000 - more than three times its estimate. The Jaguar E-Type is one of the most iconic cars in history and also regarded as one of the most beautiful. But this 1961 Flat Floor Roadster model - which is the 59th ever built - is in need of a full restoration after suffering so much neglect. The owner, a retired naval architect in his 80s from Bath, Somerset, decided to sell it at this week's Bonhams' auction in Hendon, north-west London. Two Bonham employees put the 1961 Jaguar E-Type 'Flat Floor' into place in preparation for yesterday's car auction at the RAF Museum in Hendon, north-west London . Due to spiralling running costs, the former owner stored the E-Type Jaguar in a garage in 1983 and it had been left there ever since, gathering dust . Experts offered the battered vehicle . with an estimate of just £30,000 - but they were stunned when the . English sports car eventually sold for a staggering £109,000. A spokesman said: 'We were delighted with the performance of this ""barn find"", which more than tripled its highest pre-sale estimate, boosting the auction to a strong £1.7million result. 'We had suspected it would do well, given that it is one of the earliest surviving right-hand drive roadsters - dating from the first few weeks of production - and the market's ongoing enthusiasm for original, unrestored ""project"" cars.' The car was bought from an Exeter dealer by its most recent owner in 1965. He then drove it regularly for around 18 years before hiding it away in the lock-up in Bath where it remained until being unearthed by Bonhams. It was one of a number of classic cars which were sold yesterday at the RAF Museum in Hendon. Covered in cobwebs: The original red leather interior will need to be carefully cleaned and restored to its former glory . Under the bonnet of the Jaguar E-Type is the car's original 3.8-litre engine. The car has not been in use since 1983 . The car's new owner, who has remained anonymous, will now have to spend in excess of £50,000 returning the Jaguar to its former glory. Enzo Ferrari once described the Jaguar E-Type as the most beautiful car ever made. Under the bonnet of the Jaguar E-Type - which has done 65,000 miles in its 52-year history - is the car's original 3.8-litre engine. When it is fully reconditioned, the convertible should be capable of a top speed of around 150mph. Some 70,000 of the classic British cars were built but this is one of only a handful of originals still around. Birth of a legend: 1960s advertising for the revolutionary E-Type . But due to spiralling running costs, the former owner stored it in a garage in 1983 and it had been left there ever since. Its cream panels and chrome bumpers became spattered in rust over the last three decades and its red . leather interior filled with dust. Experts say it will take at least £50,000 to restore the tatty sports car to its former glory. Jon Polson, motor car specialist at . auctioneers Bonhams which sold the Jaguar, said: 'It's an . incredible car - very rare and very desirable. 'It's the E-Type at its purest before . changes had to be made to the model to adhere to safety laws. It is the . 59th ever built, and there are only a handful of the original models . remaining. 'It would have been the owner's pride . and joy when he bought it in 1965. Sadly the rising running costs forced . him to garage the car in 1983 and it has not been used since.' The sale of the E-Type has once again showcased the strong classic car market. On Saturday, a rotten Jaguar XK120 sold for £96,000 at auction - £80,000 more than the initial estimate. When it was first bought, the iconic British car would have been the pride and joy of its former owner .","Decaying 1961 Flat Floor Roadster was only 59th E-Type to be built .

These heartbreaking pictures show a rural Indian girl of just 18 months old suffering from hydrocephalus, a build up of fluid inside the skull. The family of Roona Begum, from the village of Jirania in India's north-eastern state of Tripura, cannot afford to pay for her to be treated. Her father Abdul Rahman, 26, works in a brick factory, where he earns the equivalent of just £1.79 a day. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: Indian labourer Abdul Rahman, 26, holds his 18-month-old daughter Roona Begum who suffers from hydrocephalus,a build-up of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling, in front of their home . Babies who are born with hydrocephalus would normally require prompt surgical treatment to avoid being left permanently disabled. But without the means to pay for a doctor, Mr Rahman and his family can only do their best to keep Roona comfortable as they watch her condition slowly and inexorably deteriorate. Sometimes misleadingly known as water on the brain, hydrocephalus is caused by a build-up of the cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull, increasing pressure on the brain inside. The brain constantly produces new cerebrospinal fluid at the rate of about a pint a day, while old fluid is released from the brain and reabsorbed into the blood vessels. But if this process is interrupted, as in individuals with hydrocephalus, levels of the fluid can quickly build up and place pressure on the brain, causing headaches, blurred vision and, eventually, permanent brain damage. 'Left untreated, if it progresses very quickly, the babies usually die because their brain tissues are unable to adapt,' said Gill Yaz, health development manager for Shine, a UK charity set up to help people affected by hydrocephalus. But, she added, if the condition develops more slowly, as in Roona's case, the child adapts by growing their skulls to contain the excess fluid. However, the adaptation can only go so far. Desperately sad: Babies who are born with hydrocephalus would normally require prompt surgical treatment to avoid being left disabled. It can be caused by birth defects or as the result of an infection in the mother . The main treatment for hydrocephalus is to implant a thin tube, called a shunt, in the brain to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid to another part of the body where it can be more easily reabsorbed. The shunt has a valve inside it to control the flow of fluid and to ensure it does not drain too quickly, which those treated can feel as a lump under the skin of their scalps. Ms Yaz told MailOnline: 'It's done by paediatric neurosurgeons, but its not a very demanding procedure. The operation usually lasts about 30 minutes.' The shunts themselves usually cost a few hundred pounds, she said, going up to around £800 for the state-of-the-art models. Roona rests inside her house: The main treatment for hydrocephalus is to implant a thin tube, called a shunt, in the brain to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid to another part of the body where is can be absorbed . A spokesman for Headway, the brain injury association, told MailOnline that shunting is very effective, but there can be complications of infections, obstructed shunts and haemotomas. 'These are avoided by another operation called a third ventriculostomy. This involves creating a hole in the floor of the third ventricle for the fluid to drain through,' he said, adding that this is only suitable for some types of hydrocephalus. Experts estimate that the congenital form of the condition affects around one in every 500 children. It can be caused by birth defects like spina bifida, or as the result of an infection that the mother develops during pregnancy, such as mumps or rubella. The condition can also be acquired after birth by both adults and children, often as the result of a serious head injury or medical condition such as a brain tumour. Keeping her comfortable: Hydrocephalus can be cured by surgery, but without money to pay for a doctor, Mr Rahmancan only keep Roona comfortable and watch her condition inexorably deteriorate . Without an expert medical opinion, it is impossible to know how Roona came to be affected by hydrocephalus and impossible to know what related conditions she might be suffering from. In the West, children diagnosed with the disorder and promptly treated can go on to lead normal lives. In India, things are different. In a blunt assessment of his government's failure to extend a social safety net for the poor, India's rural development minister said last year that the country's public health system had 'collapsed'. But experts say it is too late for Roona, as any surgery could be fatal. Mr Sanj Bassi, Consultant Adult and Paediatric Neurosurgeon at Kings College Hospital, said: 'It is too late to do anything now. The brain will be damaged, and  draining the fluid can cause problems by causing the brain to collaspe and bleed. 'Roona should really be left untreated. She will not make any recovery and will not ever live a life of any independence. 'Hydrocephalus is very common, and we see it to this extent very commonly in developing nations.'

Tennessee investigators and the mother of a nursing student missing for two years say a purse found this week is not that of missing nursing student Holly Bobo. Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm said Friday that Bobo's mother had seen a photo of the recovered purse two days ago and thought it was her daughter's. But after seeing it in person Friday, Karen Bobo said it wasn't. Neighborhood dogs had found the purse in the hills in west Tennessee on Wednesday, prompting a search for other clues. But nothing was found. Major breakthrough: A dog found what was believed to be nursing student Holly Bobo's bag (pictured) more than two years after she went missing in rural Tennessee . Tragic beauty: The bright-eyed 20-year-old college student Holly Bobo was allegedly abducted by a man who led her into the woods in April 2011, never to be seen again . Holly Bobo was last seen April 13, . 2011, when her brother said he saw a man in hunting clothes leading the . 20-year-old into the woods around the family home outside Parsons, about . 125 miles northeast of Memphis. Officials with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation came out in full force Thursday in an effort to locate the place where the dog may have discovered the purse hoping to find additional clues, the station WSMV reported. The new hunt for Bobo came less than a week after her hometown marked a somber two-year anniversary since her disappearance with a walk and a run in her honor. Bobo went missing from her home in Darden, Tennessee on the morning of April 13, 2011. Her brother Clint, 25, told police he had seen her being led into the woods by an unknown man wearing hunting camouflage at around 7.30am. Snatched: It turns out the bag did not belong to Holly, according to her mother and investigators . Keeping the faith: Friends and strangers have been tirelessly spreading the word about Miss Bobo with fliers and pictures adorned with pink ribbons . Sombre benchmark: Investigators thought they had a break in the case less than a week after a two-year anniversary of Bobo's disappearance . Family pulling together: Bobo's parents have been traveling around the state talking about their daughter's case . He called authorities when he saw a small amount of blood in the family's carport where Bobo was believed to be abducted on her way to school. Clint Bobo said he initially thought she was being taken into the woods by her boyfriend, but became alarmed when he saw the man's arm holding onto his sister and called 911. John Mehr, spokesman for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said in 2011 that officials believe Bobo followed her abductor into the woods without showing resistance because she was 'in fear of her life.' The reward fund for information leading to Holly's safe return home has swelled to $250,000. Investigators have claimed they have had 'significant' findings over the past two years, yet none have led to the discovery of Holly. Her parents have previously said they thought it could have been someone who knew the family and their morning routine. Home turf: The tattered pink bag turned up near Darden, Tennessee, about a mile from Bobo's home . New search: Authorities returned to the rugged area in Decatur County hoping to find the spot where the dog discovered the purse . Fresh start: Officials returned to the rugged area around Bobo's home, which previously had been scoured by hundreds of volunteers . After her disappearance, more than a thousand volunteers searched nearby wooded area, and especially Natchez Trace State Park, for clues, Fox News. Authorities armed with high-resolution imaging equipment scoured lakes and ponds, but to no avail. Bobo's mother, Karen, quit her job as a teacher to devote her time to spreading the word about her daughter's abduction.

A father of three died in front of his daughter when a gun went off during a fight with police in his bedroom, an inquest has heard. Unarmed officers raided Colin Berry's home in Bradford earlier this month to carry out a search for illegal drugs. They found him with his daughter in an upstairs bedroom with a gun held behind his back. A scuffle ensued, during which the weapon was discharged, and Mr Berry was pronounced dead at the scene from a gunshot wound to the head. Death: Forensic officers at the home of Colin Berry after he was killed by a gunshot wound . The 49-year-old's death came as a shock to neighbours, who knew him as a reformed character and a born-again Christian. Mr Berry was often seen walking the streets near his home with his dog as leader of the local Neighbourhood Watch, keeping the area free from crime. Jude Lee, an investigator from the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), told the inquest in Bradford yesterday that police went to Mr Berry's house on April 1 with a search warrant issued under the Misuse of Drug Act. Officers forced entry into the home, and a number of them went upstairs and entered a bedroom where they found Mr Berry with a firearm. Investigation: The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched an inquiry into the incident . Tragic: An inquest heard that Mr Berry's daughter was present at the time of his death during a scuffle . 'His daughter was with him at the time,' Ms Lee said. 'A scuffle seemed to ensue, it's still under investigation, the firearm went off.' The father of three was officially identified by his wife Jeanette the next day, the inquest was told. Coroner Paul Marks asked if a second post-mortem examination had been carried out, but he was told neither Mr Berry's family nor the police had requested one. He then authorised the release of the deceased man's body for burial. The IPCC launched an investigation after West Yorkshire Police informed it of Mr Berry's death. Home: The house in Bradford where Mr Berry, a born-again Christian, died during the raid on April 1 . Ms Lee told the inquest: 'At present there's no evidence there was any criminality, but it is still under investigation.' Mr Berry's family did not attend the hearing, which was adjourned pending further inquiries. Mr Marks said: 'My condolences are with the family for their sad loss.' It is understood that none of the three members of the Neighbourhood Policing Team who were involved in the raid at Mr Berry's home have been suspended from duties. At the time of his death, neighbour Susan Myers said: 'Colin was supposed to be the Neighbourhood Watch organiser for this area and he would walk round at night with his Staffy. 'He was a pleasant fellow, but had a bit of a past. About two years ago he became a born-again Christian and was trying to be a better person and do the right thing.'","Colin Berry, 49, died in drugs raid on his Bradford home earlier this month .

Analysis of grave sites across central Europe found that 7,000 years ago, in the early Neolithic era, some farmers had better land ¿ and better tools, which they were buried with . The gap between rich and poor began far earlier than most of us might imagine. In 5,000BC, long before the Egyptians built the pyramids, Europeans were already divided into ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’. Analysis of grave sites across central Europe found that 7,000 years ago, in the early Neolithic era, some farmers had better land – and better tools, which they were buried with. Some farmers grew fat on fertile land, armed with the latest tools, while others starved – even when world population stood at a mere five to seven million, and farming had only just begun to spread across Europe. What’s  more, their children ‘inherited’ their wealth, starting a cycle that continues to this day. Hereditary inequality began over 7,000 years ago in the early Neolithic era, with new evidence showing that farmers buried with tools had access to better land than those buried without. By studying more than 300 human skeletons from sites across central Europe, Professor Alex Bentley and an international team of colleagues funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council uncovered evidence of differential land access among the first Neolithic farmers – the earliest such evidence yet found. Radioaactive ‘strontium analysis’ of the skeletons, which provides indications of place of origin, indicated that men buried with distinctive Neolithic stone adzes (tools used for smoothing or carving wood) had less variable isotope signatures than men buried without adzes. This suggests those buried with adzes had access to closer – and probably better – land than those buried without. Professor Bentley, Professor of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Bristol, said: ‘The men buried with adzes appear to have lived on food grown in areas of loess, the fertile and productive soil favoured by early farmers. This indicates they had consistent access to preferred farming areas.’ A typical neolithic longhouse: But research hints that some had rather better dwellings than others, even 7,000 years ago . People buried with axes had access to better farming land than those who had none . The strontium isotope analysis also revealed that early Neolithic women were more likely than men to have originated from areas outside those where their bodies were found. This is a strong indication of patrilocality, a male-centred kinship system where females move to reside in the location of the males when they marry. This new evidence from the skeletons is consistent with other archaeological, genetic, anthropological and even linguistic evidence for patrilocality in Neolithic Europe. The results have implications for genetic modelling of how human populations expanded in the Neolithic, for which sex-biased mobility patterns and status differences are increasing seen as crucial. Professor Bentley said: ‘Our results, along with archaeobotanical studies that indicate the earliest farmers of Neolithic Germany had a system of land tenure, suggest that the origins of differential access to land can be traced back to an early part of the Neolithic era, rather than only to later prehistory when inequality and intergenerational wealth transfers are more clearly evidenced in burials and material culture. ‘It seems the Neolithic era introduced heritable property (land and livestock) into Europe and that wealth inequality got underway when this happened. After that, of course, there was no looking back: through the Bronze Age, Iron Age and Industrial era wealth inequality increased but the 'seeds' of inequality were sown way back in the Neolithic.’","People buried with stone 'adzes' had better farming land .

Chloe was rushed to hospital and has undergone two operations and required more than 100 stitches to repair her injuries. The dog attacked her so viciously her tear duct was torn out, her cheekbone was fractured, . her nose ripped out of place and her lips torn to shreds. Chloe added: 'My cheekbone will always be fractured - they can't fix that unless I have major surgery. 'Because my tear ducts were ripped . out I have to have a glass tube inside my eye that filters my tears. The . doctors had to sew my nose back on and sew my lips back together, and . I've got a really deep scar on my face. It still hasn't healed, 18 . months later.' Chloe and her parents contacted the . police, but were shocked to discover no action could be taken against . the owners of the dog because the incident happened on private property. It is understood the dog was put down following the . attack in August 2011. Chloe is now urging the Government to go ahead with plans for a change in the law. Last month, 14-year-old Jade Lomas-Anderson was mauled to death by a pack of dogs at a house in Atherton, Greater Manchester. Still recovering: Chloe Walker says she still feels nervous about going out in public following the horrific attack . The dog was a cross-breed between a Japanese Akita, pictured, and a Rottweiler . The dog, a cross between a Rottweiler, pictured, and Japanese Akita was put down after the attack . Greater Manchester Police, who are investigating Jade's death, have said it is 'unlikely' anyone will be prosecuted over Jade's death. They are unable to take action because the dogs involved were not banned breeds and under current laws dog owners cannot be prosecuted if attacks take place on private property. But Jade's family have launched an e-petition calling for a change to the law and her death has prompted MPs to call for urgent reform of dog control laws. In February, the government announced it would amend legislation so dog owners could be prosecuted if their animal attacks someone on private property. Eighteen months after the attack, Chloe says she has been left so traumatised she is scared to go out in public and constantly feels like she's being judged. Angry: Chloe has spoken out as the Government is trying to pass new laws regarding dog attacks . She said: 'It's affected me in so many ways. I've become anxious around dogs, dog lovers and people I don't know. 'Even walking in public with no makeup on is a demanding task, I can't bring myself to do it. 'I dread sleeping at night in fear of having nightmares. 'I find it difficult to have relationships because I think the constant reminders and moods I go in over the intrusive thoughts will destroy them. 'My old friend and her family have blamed me and said it's my own fault because I was told it was the dog's chair, but it was a sofa, I didn't see anything wrong in sitting down. 'The family have not shown any remorse - I still see them near my home and they act like nothing has happened. 'That's why the Government needs to carry on trying to change the law on this. 'I fully support it, and knowing other people think they should be prosecuted has given me the confidence to speak out. 'It'[s happening too often now, and the attack on me and other attacks on young girls in the news show it can happen to people of any age. 'I will fight until the day I die for justice for people in the same boat as me.'","Chloe Walker, 16, attacked by Japanese Akita crossed with Rottweiler .

Nasa has begun testing models of a 'son of Concorde' aircraft - a passenger plane that would travel faster than the speed of sound. The supersonic aircraft, which has been designed by The Boeing Company, is hoping to fill the gap left by Concorde when it was retired in November 2003. At the moment, commercial supersonic planes are not allowed to fly over land because of the noise created by sonic booms.

This shot of the 'son of Concorde' model is taken through the window of Nasa's supersonic wind tunnel at the Glenn Research Center in Ohio.

November 1986. It took 29 hours and 59 minutes to complete this trip. The tests being carried out at Nasa's Glenn Research Center in Ohio are trying to establish whether the volume of these sonic booms can be reduced. A photo of Nasa's latest test, taken through a window in the sidewall of Nasa's supersonic wind tunnel in Cleveland, shows a 1.79 percent scale model of the aircraft. Boeing has been tight-lipped on the details of the aircraft. Researchers tested the performance of air inlets situated on the top of the model to see whether changing the amount of airflow at supersonic speeds affected the aircraft's performance, emissions and noise levels. The researchers controlled the flow of air through the inlets using a remote-controlled device. The device sits in the inlet on the right-hand side of the plane - the pilot's side. These tests are part of ongoing research as part of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate. The directorate is looking at ways of making future supersonic flight over land possible, as well as developing green aviation, which looks to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. Similar tests are being carried out at Nasa's Langley Research Center in Virginia. The models being tested use technologies including the F-100-like propulsion system, a tail blister, and varying shapes, combined to achieve a lower target perceived decibel level. If tests are successful, it could lead to the development of the first commercial supersonic passenger plane since Concorde. Concorde's maiden commercial flight was on 21 January 1976. It flew regularly from London Heathrow and Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport to New York and Washington. Concorde's first commercial flight was in 1976. It flew regularly from London to New York, before it was retired in 2003. Flights from London to New York took just three and a half hours, compared to the eight hours it takes to fly there on subsonic planes. In 1986, Concorde flew around the world covering 28,238 miles in just 29 hours and 59 minutes. On 25 July 2000, Concorde crashed into a hotel in Gonesse, France, killing all passengers and crew, as well as four bystanders. It was the only fatal accident, and the aircraft was retired three years later. It's last commercial journey was made on 24 October 2003 from New York to London.","Tests could lead to first commercial supersonic flights since Concorde .

A British travel operator has been warned North Korea is on the brink of war after the government announced nuclear rockets are prepared to strike at the U.S.. Dylan Harris, director of Lupine Travel, which specialises in holidays to unusual places like Iran, Chernobyl and Siberia, received a worrying email from Pyongyang this morning. The message from North Korean authorities said: 'The situation in Korea is now very serious as the U.S. have carried out a simulated nuclear attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea using B52 bombers and now B2A stealth bombers. 'The DPRK has now ordered its rockets to standby to destroy U.S. bases if the DPRK is attacked. The situation is now critical with the outbreak of war probably only hours away.' Warning: Dylan Harris, 34, the director of Wigan-based unusual destinations tour company Lupine Travel pictured with a North Korean border guard at the Korean Demilitarised Zone . Leader Kim Jong-un has put missile units on standby to attack U.S. bases marking a 'turning point' against American 'imperialism' and 'opening a new phase of history'. Mr Harris, 34, from Wigan, has been a visitor to North Korea since 2007 and organises golfing trips to the country up to four times a month. At the moment, there is a group of 10 - one Brit and nine Chinese - on the border who have just completed a five-day tour. The Brit was due to leave the country tomorrow but left one day early after getting angry with how state-managed the visit was. The university student, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline from the Chinese border city of Dandong: 'I felt safe and well cared for on the trip but that in itself felt annoying when you think about the poverty in the country. 'I was concerned when what was happening from the BBC News channel in our hotel in Pyongyang but I didn't feel any tension there despite that. 'We tried to find out what we could from the tour guides but they didn't seem too worried, they just kept saying that North and South Korean people didn't want a war and that if there was one it would be manufactured by outside forces.

'They seemed to say North Korea would . only go to war if it was provoked but when we asked what would provoke . them they didn't say. 'It seemed very relaxed and peaceful . there, but you can't really tell what is going on or what people think . because of all the propaganda and everything you see is stage-managed.' Speaking before the group left North . Korea, Mr Harris said: 'I contacted the Foreign Office and if they say . it's unsafe we will not travel or organise further trips to North Korea. 'However, . there is a group of ten golfers in Pyongyang, which is where the only . public golf course is, who are due to fly out of the country tomorrow. 'One of them is British and nine are Chinese. 'I'm in constant touch with them and they are all safe and in good spirits. 'My customers know what they are getting into and they are travelling to hostile locations with the treat of war in the air. Retaliation: A map appears to show potential targets of the rocket attacks. Kim's order followed a drill by two U.S. stealth bombers over the Korean Peninsula the previous day . 'Deterrence': A B-2 stealth bomber (right) soars through the sky over a U.S. air base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, amid rising tension between the country and its neighbour to the North . Tensions: The drill involved the bomber striking a mock target, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap . 'I think a lot of it is Kim Jong Un just showing the world his power and I'm optimistic that there will be no nuclear war with the U.S..' 'We had planned to organise a golfing tournament in May but with the current situation I don't know if that will go ahead, some customers have already cancelled.' Mr Harris, who has been to the state, said: 'We've had warnings before but this is bit stronger than usual and seems a lot more serious this time . 'It's never been much of a concern before but it has been in the back of my mind.' In the early hours of this morning he received an email from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea warning him the outbreak of war could be 'hours away'. State news agency KCNA said leader Kim Jong Un had signed off on the order at a late-night meeting of top generals. KCNA quoted him as saying the time to 'settle accounts' with the U.S. had arrived and the the B-2 flights signalling an 'ultimatum'. The DPRK has been unhappy about UN sanctions and felt antagonised over South Koream military drills. Kim Jong Un Convenes Operation Meeting, Finally Examines and Ratifies Plan for Firepower Strike - Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) The moves of the U.S. imperialists to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and encroach upon its supreme interests have entered a grave phase. Not content with letting B-52 make sorties over south Korea in succession despite the repeated warnings, they made B-2A stealth strategic bomber and other strategic strike means fly from Whiteman air force base in Missouri State, the U.S. over south Korea on March 28 for the first time in history to commit such dangerous provocation as openly staging a drill for striking ground targets of the DPRK. This fully proves that the brigandish ambition of the U.S. imperialists for aggression to stand in confrontation with the DPRK has reached an extreme phase defying the meaningful warning made by its revolutionary armed forces in the March 26 statement of the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army. In view of the prevailing grim situation, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, convened an urgent operation meeting on the KPA Strategic Rocket Force's performance of duty for firepower strike at the Supreme Command at 00:30 Friday. Present there were Hyon Yong Chol, chief of the KPA General Staff, Ri Yong Gil, director of the Operation Bureau, Kim Yong Chol, director of the General Reconnaissance Bureau, and Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the Strategic Rocket Force. At the meeting he first received a report from General Kim Yong Chol, who is also vice chief of the General Staff of the KPA, on the information about the nature of action of the nuclear strike means of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces. After receiving a report from Lieut. General Kim Rak Gyom on the technical conditions of the strategic strike means of the KPA, he made an important decision. He said he has judged the time has come to settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists in view of the prevailing situation. If they make a reckless provocation with huge strategic forces, the KPA should mercilessly strike the U.S. mainland, their stronghold, their military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in south Korea, he said. He examined and finally ratified the plan of the Strategic Rocket Force for firepower strike. The U.S. imperialists let B-2A make sorties over south Korea in succession, indicating once again that their hostile acts against the DPRK have entered a reckless phase, going beyond the phase of threat and blackmail, he said. B-2A's flight to the sky above south Korea is not a simple demonstration of forces in reaction to the tough stand of the DPRK but an ultimatum that they will ignite a nuclear war at any cost on the Korean Peninsula, he noted, underlining the need to put a definite end to the times when they could threaten and blackmail the DPRK with nukes. He declared the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK would react to the U.S. nuclear blackmail with a merciless nuclear attack, and war of aggression with an all-out war of justice. He finally signed the plan on technical preparations of strategic rockets of the KPA, ordering them to be standby for fire so that they may strike any time the U.S. mainland, its military bases in the operational theaters in the Pacific, including Hawaii and Guam, and those in south Korea. He said the enemies are bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war testing the DPRK's self-restraint, adding the DPRK can no longer tolerate this. He ordered the KPA to blow up and reduce everything to ashes at a single strike, if an order is issued. He said the heroic service personnel of the KPA and all other people, their hearts burning with irrepressible resentment at the reckless war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists, are now waiting for a final order of the WPK Central Committee, hardening their will to turn out in a do-or-die battle with the enemies. The KPA will never remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. imperialists' frantic moves for aggression but do its best to defend the destiny of the country and nation, he said. It is the truth confirmed by history that no force on earth can hold in check the people all out for the just cause, he noted, stressing if an undesired war breaks out on this land again due to the consequences of the unpardonable action of the U.S. imperialists, it will bring them a shameful ruin and the Korean nation will greet the bright day of national reunification. The important decision made by him under the grave situation where the Korean Peninsula has been pushed to the brink of a nuclear war by the U.S. imperialists will mark a turning point in putting an end to the history of the long-standing showdown with the U.S. and opening a new phase of history.","Dylan Harris, of Lupine Travel,  received worrying email this morning .

"By . Talal Musa . PUBLISHED: . 10:00 EST, 15 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:11 EST, 15 April 2013 . With the imminent release of Painkiller Hell & Damnation on consoles and the exciting Deadfall Adventures announced, MailOnline talked to Wojciech Pazdur from The Farm51 and Reinhard Pollice from Nordic Games to find out what we can expect. 1.    How does this version of Painkiller differ from the PC?WP: I think additional months of expanding and polishing are noticeable. There's more content, including exclusive console maps. Plenty of bugs have been removed and adjustments made for PC after the game’s initial release, these changes are already implemented in the console version. We put in additional effort toward code optimization and balancing gameplay and controls for using a pad. Basically it's still good old demon-slaying mayhem. Hellishly good: Painkiller Hell and Damnation features some of the largest bosses in games of the same genre . 2.    What about the graphics? What can console owners expect?WP: Besides the optimization required by the console engine itself and the screen resolution adjusted for TVs, there's not a real reduction in visual quality. Some of the textures had to be more limited with density; however during work on the console builds we've also improved the look of certain special effects. Therefore sitting in front of the TV with a console pad, I'm actually enjoying the game more than on a PC (but my hard work at the office on this game for the last year also has something to do with that, I must admit).3.    Why did you decide to make the game on current gen with next gen around the corner?WP: Without being ready to use the game engines and not having a really clear vision of player’s expectations, the next gen consoles weren’t the best target for us. We may aim towards next gen with some of our next projects, but Painkiller Hell & Damnation was planned long ago and we were already in the advanced stages more than a year ago so we didn't want to wait. RP: The next gen release is probably not too far away but this doesn’t mean that the mass market will adapt to that with the same pace. With the current generation we can basically make all we want. Of course there are limitations here and there but with the great technology and optimizations that we have, we can make fantastic looking games. From a business perspective it’s just very attractive to publish games for devices that have an install base of 70 Million or even more.4.    To those who are new to Painkiller, what is the story?WP: Daniel Garner, the main hero, is dead. He is trapped between Hell and Purgatory because his sins are hard to be forgiven even by Underworld's rulers. Also with Daniel being an ultimate bada**, he's pushed to fight against demons and collect their souls for the Grim Reaper to set his own soul free and join his wife in Heaven. Sounds fanciful? Great, that's only the beginning – the story is both a continuation and re-imagination of the events from the original Painkiller game released in 2004 and you can expect a lot of dark themes there. All killer: Painkiller is one of the fastest FPS games around which, until now, may have best suited PC gamers . 5.    You have Deadfall Adventures on the horizon. How has working on Painkiller influenced this game?WP: Besides technology, not too much. There is a different design and art team, different gameplay rules and controls, completely new ways of building the player's immersion. Deadfall Adventures is like a classic summer adventure movie, not dark and gothic fantasy horror that we can compare Painkiller with. Of course, because of the 10 years spent on Painkiller-like titles, some of the design decisions have come surprisingly easy (like why not to add some demonic mummies). The key fun factor of Deadfall Adventures is related to exploration combined with combat, treasure hunting and puzzle solving, not to look for the fastest way to dismember as many undeads as you can.RP: Deadfall Adventures has very different demands. While Painkiller is mainly a shooting experience, for Deadfall Adventures it is necessary to make the bridge between a shooter and an adventure game where it’s all about exploration and telling an interesting story. A lot of work goes into making that right and telling a great story. 6.    What can we expect in Deadfall? What graphics engine does it use?WP: We’ve used Unreal Technology, so you may expect all the bells and whistles provided by one of the best rendering engines in the world. The game has very specific player mechanics – you'll use not only weapons, but also adventurer's equipment like a compass, flashlight, notebook and maps. On top of that you need to prepare for an extensive use of the most important item: your brain. Deadfall balances between action and adventure gameplay and there are separate difficulty modes for puzzles and for combat, so depending on your preferences you may customize the experience more towards your style of play.7.    What can we expect plot wise?WP: It's hard to describe it without giving away the game’s secrets. However the plot starts in the late 1930s, when the main hero named James Lee Quatermain joins an international chase for a mysterious artifact that can give people immortality. Fighting against Nazis, thugs, Russian spies and travelling across several continents, he avoids deadly traps and solves countless riddles leading to the greatest treasure of all time. New adventure: Deadfall Adventures is nothing like Painkiller - focusing on exploration and combat rather than trying to dismember as many of the undead as possible . 8.    Will there be multiplayer and are there any unique modes given the subject matter?WP: We have multiplayer modes and also unique modes. I don’t want to reveal any more at this time.9.    What will the difference be between the PC and console versions of Deadfall?WP: We're making both versions consistent at all levels, but we plan to make some exclusive content for each platform, for now let’s just keep it as a hidden treasure to be discovered…RP: Yes and of course we do platform specific optimization and polishing to bring a great game to fans of both console and PC gaming. Painkiller Hell & Damnation is out on May 31 for Xbox 360 andPS3. While Deadfall Adventures is released on July 30 on Xbox 360 and PC.

Andy Nyberg said: 'This is the only place you can see the whole of . London at once and, as such, is a natural starting point for exploring . the UK's capital.' Comment from spokesman about the 'loo with a view': 'The main toilets for The View from The Shard are located on level 1 of the attraction. 'A limited number of these 'loos with a view' are available on Level 68 for those that need them, however they are not normally open for general use.' Plenty to see: St Paul's Cathedral and the BT Tower are just some of the world-famous London landmarks that can been seen on clear day from The Shard . Quick ascent: The open-air public viewing platform towards the top of the 1,1013ft building is accessible by high-speed elevators . Breathtaking: The viewing platform at the enormous skyscraper offers this incredible view of the 17th Century St Paul's Cathedral, the West End and further afield . Organisers say there should not be queues, but to amuse those waiting to go through security, special, cheeky, murals have been created.

Stone tablets hidden in the Museum of Bologna's archives may contain a terrible, ancient curse calling a devil-goddess to bind and torment a named victim. The tablets were hidden in the archives for nearly a century - thought to have been put aside at the start of World War I - and rediscovered in 2009. The tablets are believed to be 1600 years old. Now a translation has revealed the dark purpose of the slabs - calling a snake-shrouded figure to 'bind' a man who is mummified with his hands tied. He is named as 'Porcellus.' The tablet calls a snake-shrouded devil-goddess to 'bind' a mummified man - the victim is named as 'Porcellus' Hecate: The Bologna 'Defixiones' is unusual because of its mixture of terrifying demonic figures and text - and, Natalias, says, could invoke the 'three-formed' goddess Hekate, often seen as the 'mother' of witches . Diagram: Celia Sanchez Natalias, of the University of Zaragoza has interpreted the strange tablets for the first time . Celia Sanchez Natalias, of the University of Zaragoza has translated the strange tablets for the first time. 'In the foreground is a standing barefoot figure, with crossed or tied hands at belly height. On hischest are a magic sign while in the genital area is an eight-pointed star,' she says. 'Sinuous snakes emerge threateningly from the side of his crowned head. Below, lying down, mummified and with his hands tied, or at least crossed, is the victim of the curse, perfectly recognisable because of the inscription running down both arms, which reads: Porcellus.' Carving curses into tablets was a common practice in the ancient world - with lead tablets used in some areas, and stone in others. The Bologna 'Defixiones' is unusual because of its mixture of terrifying demonic figures and text - and, Natalias, says, could invoke the 'three-formed' goddess Hekate, often seen as the 'mother' of witches. The first figure, with snakes streaming out of his/her head, and a crown is thought to be the demon - or goddess - who is being called on to carry out the curse. 'The deity of the Bologna curse is barefoot and has a magic sign on the breast - and also has an eight-point star in its genital area,' says Natalias. The star is almost unique - but other features such as the snakes make an identification with the Goddess Hecate tempting. The film 'Hecate, Mistress of the Night': The goddess is often seen as the 'mother' of all witches . The curse tablets were lost in the archives of the museum of Bologna for nearly a century . Hecate - the witch-goddess - is often invoked in curse tablets. 'While it is tempting to identify this figure with this deity, the absence of other characteristics, such as her three forms or her bearing torches, as traditionally associated with her, undermines this hypothesis,' says Natalias. Interestingly, the images seem to show both the goddess - or demon - AND the victim as being bound, tied up, or mummified. The 'spell' is binding Hecate - or another demon - to torment Porcellus, whoever he may have been. ‘Just as the deity is bound, so will Porcello be,' says Natalias.","Snake-haired figure called to 'bind' victim .

Bodies tense and noses twitching, the dogs sniff the fertile hunting ground before them: a lower Manhattan alley, grimy, dim and perfect for rats. With a terse command -- ‘Now!’ -- the chase is on. Circling, bounding over and pawing at a mound of garbage bags, the four dogs quickly have rodents on the run. ‘Come on ... I mean, `Tally ho!' says one of their owners, Susan Friedenberg. In a whirl of barks, pants and wagging tails, dogs tunnel among the bags and bolt down the alley as their quarry tries to scurry away. Within five minutes, the city has two fewer rats. Scroll down for video of rat hunt . Fresh kill: A dog named Paco, owned by Bill Reyna of Wayne, NJ, looks over a dead rat in a lower Manhattan alley in New York . Hunting party: A group of dog owners known as Ryders Alley Trencher-fed Society (RATS) gather in a lower Manhattan park before a hunt for rats that takes their various breeds into alleys . Thrill of the chase: The hunters say that having their dogs track down and kill rats helps preserve the animals' hunting skills . In a scrappy, streetwise cousin of mannerly countryside fox hunts, on terrain far from the European farms and fields where many of the dogs' ancestors were bred to scramble after vermin and foxes, their masters sport trash-poking sticks instead of riding crops and say it's just as viable an exercise for the animals' centuries-old skills. ‘It's about maintaining the breed type through actual work,’ says Richard Reynolds, a New Jersey-based business analyst and longtime dog breeder who might be considered the group's organizer -- if it would accept being called organized. Known with a chuckle as the Ryders Alley Trencher-fed Society -- parse the acronym -- the rodent-hunters have been scouring downtown byways for more than a decade, meeting weekly when weather allows. Watch the full video here. On a couple of recent nights, an eclectic group of ratters converged on an alley near City Hall about an hour after sunset. The lineups included two border terriers; a wire-haired dachshund; a Jack Russell terrier/Australian cattle dog mix; a Patterdale terrier, an intense, no-nonsense breed that's uncommon in this country; and a feist, a type of dog developed in the American South to tree squirrels. ‘Get `im! Go!’ Serge Lozach yelled as his cairn terrier, Hudson, streaked down an alley after a fleeing rat. Unlike many of the other owners, Lozach doesn't breed or show dogs, but he has taken Hudson to several alley hunts. ‘I like watching him have fun,’ Lozach said. Although . the dogs have hunting instincts, it takes training to capitalize on . them. Just because your pet runs after backyard squirrels doesn't mean . it could ever catch one. When . at its best, the alley pack works together. One dog will sniff out a . rat and signal its whereabouts, often by barking. Another leaps at the . hideaway to rout the quarry, and then a third lurches to catch it as it . flees. Gruesome end: An unfortunate rat might get caught in a tug of war between dogs that circle and flank it . Final destination: All the rats killed in a night of hunting end up in the trash . Natural-born killer: Susan Friedenberg takes a rat from Tanner, her Border Terrier, that caught the rodent . A rat that scuttles into the open might get caught in a rundown, or even a tug of war, between dogs that circle and flank it. After making a kill with a bite or a shake, the hunters trot back, rat in mouth, and allow their owners to take it from their jaws. The night's kill ends up in a trash bin. There's no official estimate of how many rats rove the city's streets, basements, parks and subways. But there are plenty. Officials have tried a number of innovative tactics to rout them, including a 2007 city Health Department initiative that sent inspectors with hand-held computers to map infestations in a Bronx neighborhood and then followed up with owners to address the problems. Recently, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed to let an Arizona-based company test a form of rat birth control by setting out bait in some subway stations this summer. But the terrier forays are an unofficial undertaking, and participants say they're less about killing rats than giving dogs the experience of chasing them. The Health Department declined to comment on the hunts. The idea has a long history. A noted 1851 examination of working-class life in London describes rat-catchers working the city's streets with ferrets and terriers. More recently, a rat-catching dachshund got attention in Seattle when its owner happened by while City Councilman Tom Rasmussen was checking out a downtown cleanup program in 2010. Rasmussen snapped a picture of the dog, rat in mouth, and posted the photo on his website. There's even an American dog breed called a rat terrier, though its origins lie on farms. Rat-tracking recently became an official canine sport, called ‘barn hunt.’ Dogs get two minutes to sniff around a hay-bale maze and indicate where they smell a rat concealed in a crush-proof, aerated tube; the dog never catches the quarry. Dozens of dogs competed in the first trials this past month in Columbia, Mo. Ruff work: Dogs taking part in the urban hunts sometimes get stuck in waste bins, fall into holes or walk away with scrapes . Backlash: PETA has expressed outrage after learning of the rat hunts, calling the practice 'a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control' Catch of the day: The dogs tracked down dispatched 13 rats within about a half-hour . While dog owners may see it as time-honored pursuit, rat-hunting riles animal-rights advocates. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which opposes hunting in general, expressed outrage after video of a dog snatching rats in a New York City park surfaced online two years ago. PETA Spokesman Martin Mersereau calls the alley rat quests ‘a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control.’ Reynolds counters that ‘there are lots of worse things that people do to rats,’ noting that poisons can sicken the animals for hours. As for the dogs, they have sometimes gotten stuck in waste bins or tumbled into holes, and a recent night left two with scrapes. But Reynolds says none has ever been seriously hurt or fallen ill. In one recent foray, the dogs dispatched 13 rats within about a half-hour. The dogs prowled and prodded for about 90 more minutes before the group gave up for the night. But not to worry, said dachshund owner Trudy Kawami. ‘There will always be a million rats in the naked city.’","Members of Ryders Alley Trencher-fed Society (RATS) have been meeting weekly for a decade to hunt rats .

Millions of Britons would prefer to have a current account with John Lewis or Asda rather than Britain’s disgraced banking giants, according to a report. Published today, it reveals the level of anger felt by hard-working Britons towards banks, which have been hit by a series of scandals, from mis-selling insurance to manipulating key rates. In a poll, around 1,300 adults were asked which brands they thought would be most trustworthy if the company moved into banking and offered current accounts. Anger toward banks: Britons said they would trust companies John Lewis and Asda more than banking giants if the companies offered bank accounts . John Lewis, best-known for its ‘never knowingly undersold’ policy, came out top, with three in four adults saying they would trust it to take care of their cash. Nearly half said they would trust Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership. Asda, Morrisons, House of Fraser and online retailer Amazon were also rated highly. Meanwhile, less than one in ten said they believed their bank offered ‘the best value for money’, while only 37 per cent said they receive ‘good customer service’. Despite a deeply troubled five years, few rivals have emerged to compete for the customers of big banks such as Barclays, RBS and HSBC. Banks deeply troubled: Less than one in ten said they believed their bank offered the best value while only 37 per cent said they received good customer service . In 2010, Metro Bank became the first high-street bank to open in the UK for more than 100 years. It has attracted around 50,000 personal current account customers. And in October, Marks & Spencer will . launch a current account, but will charge either £15 or £20 per month . for the service. Tesco and Virgin are also expected to launch current . accounts. Michael Ossei, a personal finance expert at comparison site Uswitch.com, which carried out the poll, said: ‘It is a telling reflection of the UK banking industry that consumers are willing to put their trust in brands that have no previous banking experience.’ Louis Brooke, of Move Your Money, which campaigns for people to switch from big banks to ethical, local or mutual alternatives, said: ‘For years, the big banks have not bothered competing in the current account market and instead made it as difficult as possible for customers to switch whilst swindling them for everything they can. ‘The banks contempt for their customers is finally coming home to roost.’ Recently Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, the City regulator, admitted there is widespread lack of trust in banks. He said: ‘They doubt whether banks have their interests at heart.’","People would prefer a bank account with John Lewis or Asda rather than Britain's bank giants .

People carrying a specific gene may be more at risk of developing mental health problems from smoking cannabis, according to researchers . A study from King’s College London found that cannabis smokers carrying the gene AKT1 had double the chance of developing a psychotic disorder and this increased up to seven-fold if they used the Class B drug daily. The scientists, led by Dr Marta Di Forti, said their research could be used to advise people who are particularly at risk of the psychological side-effects. Previous research has shown a link between smoking cannabis and psychosis. There is also emerging data that cannabis exposure during adolescence may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia. The team studied 489 patients who had had their first episode of psychosis and 278 healthy controls. They looked at the AKT1 gene which is involved in dopamine signaling and known to be abnormal in psychosis. They performed genetic tests on all volunteers, and assessed their use of cannabis. Dr Di Forti said: 'We found that cannabis users who carry a particular variant in the AKT1 gene had a two-fold increased probability of a psychotic disorder and this increased up to seven-fold if they used cannabis daily. 'Although using cannabis increases the risk of schizophrenia, most cannabis users come to no harm. It has therefore been suggested that those who develop psychosis may carry some genetic vulnerability. 'Our findings help to explain why one cannabis user develops psychosis while his friends continue smoking without problems. Such findings could also help to design health educational campaigns tailored to reach those young people at particular risk.' Dr John Krystal, Editor of Biological Psychiatry says: 'While the AKT1 genotype does not rise to the level of a clinically useful test of the risk for cannabis psychosis, it does show that this source of psychosis risk has a genetic underpinning. 'This advance also points to cellular signaling mechanisms mediated by Akt1 as being relevant to the biology of cannabis psychosis. This may suggest research directions for novel therapeutics for cannabis psychosis.' The authors added that further research is needed before the findings can be clinically significant.

A vulnerable woman who married a predatory sex offender whilst he was behind bars will be allowed to live with him after top judges today upheld her right to choose in a landmark ruling. Although it might be ‘extremely unwise’ for the woman to cohabit with the man, whom she wed while he was serving a long sentence, the law simply had no power to stop her, a court heard today. The woman with learning difficulties, referred to as ‘PC’, began seeing the man - ‘NC’ - before he was convicted and jailed for a series of sex offences, the Court of Appeal in central London was told. Ruling: The Court of Appeal (pictured) in central London heard today that the woman with learning difficulties began seeing the man before he was convicted and jailed for a series of sex offences . But despite his sordid crimes, PC stood by him and they became married whilst he was in jail. With his release imminent, social workers went to court in a bid to protect PC. Top family judge Mr Justice Hedley ruled last year that it was ‘in her best interests’ to undergo a ‘phased transition’ before being allowed to resume cohabitation with him. The judge also authorised social workers to split the couple if they spotted an ‘imminent and serious threat to PC's welfare’. But PC can now do what she likes after the court ruled that because she was agreed to have the legal capacity to marry, she also had the right to decide whether to live with her own husband. Lord Justice McFarlane said: ‘I well understand that all the responsible professionals take the view that it would be extremely unwise for PC to cohabit with her husband. But adult autonomy is such that people are free to make unwise decisions, provided that they have the capacity to decide.’ The judge, sitting with Lords Justice Richards and Lewison, added: ‘If PC has capacity to marry she must be taken to have capacity to decide to perform the terms of the marriage contract. Ruling: Lord Justice McFarlane said at the court that people are 'free to make unwise decisions, provided that they have the capacity to decide' ‘Any finding to the contrary required clear and cogent evidence. Such evidence was lacking in the present case and the finding that PC was unable to make this decision was simply not open to the judge.’ Paul Bowen QC, representing PC, earlier pointed out that she has only ‘mild’ learning difficulties and has lived ‘more or less independently since leaving school’. Middle-aged PC has managed to hold down several jobs over the years. But, as the husband's release date approached, the council initially applied to the Court of Protection for an order that PC lacked legal capacity to make decisions for herself or ‘engage in sexual relations’ with anyone. However, after protracted investigations by social workers, the council accepted she was able to choose for herself whether to have sex with her husband and suggested that the best way forward was for the relationship to be tightly monitored. There was no ‘outright ban’ on sexual contact, said Mr Bowen, who added that PC was allowed to visit her husband in his local authority accommodation and was given ‘unsupervised overnight contact’ with him. Lord Justice McFarlane said today: ‘Any court would be bound to entertain very significant concerns at the prospect of any woman going to set up home with NC. ‘Looked at objectively, through the eyes of experienced professionals, NC clearly presents a significant risk to any woman who enters into a close relationship with him.’ The judge added that it was a common ‘modus operandi’ for sex offenders to subject their victims to lengthy periods of ‘grooming’ before embarking upon abuse. ‘There is therefore an understandable and justified professional concern to protect a potentially vulnerable woman who has formed a close relationship with NC’. However, emphasising that the law must not trespass on the ‘autonony of the individual’, the judge added: ‘There may be many women who are seen to be in relationships with men regarded by professionals as predatory sexual offenders. 'There is a space between an unwise decision and one which an individual does not have the mental capacity to take' Lord Justice McFarlane . ‘The Court of Protection does not have jurisdiction to act to “protect” these women if they do not lack the mental capacity to decide whether or not to be, or continue to be, in such a relationship. ‘The individual's decision may be said to be “against the better judgment” of the women concerned, but the point is that, unless they lack mental capacity to make that judgement, it is against their better judgment. ‘It is a judgment that they are entitled to make. The law respects their autonomy so to decide and the Court of Protection has no jurisdiction to intervene’. The judge concluded: ‘There is a space between an unwise decision and one which an individual does not have the mental capacity to take. ‘It is important to respect that space, and to ensure that it is preserved, for it is within that space that an individual's autonomy operates.’","Court of Appeal: Law has no power to stop woman cohabiting with man .

The distraught aunt of Boston bomb suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlin Tsarnaev believes the men have been framed - so is flying to Massachusetts to protest their innocence. Sobbing uncontrollably, trainee lawyer Maret Tsarnaeva, who lives in Toronto, told MailOnline that she feared for 19-year-old Dzhokhar's safety. The younger Tsarnaev is in hospital recovering from wounds sustained in a gun battle with authorities on Friday, while his brother was killed. 'One has been killed and it would be convenient if the other was not able to speak out to declare his innocence,' she said. 'I have to go to Dzhokhar. To be with him at his bedside – to protect him – if they will let me.' Protests: Maret Tsarnaev, the aunt of Boston bombing suspects, said she believes they have been framed . Maret, a single mother with a four-year-old son, believes her nephews have been 'conveniently framed' for the marathon attacks. 'I feel I have to be there in Boston for Dzhokhar – otherwise people will think the family do not care. 'I spoke to my brother Anzor – the boys' father – and I promised him I would be there for Dzhokhar until the end of this ugly journey. 'The phone call tore me up. Anzor was distraught and today so am I. When the manhunt was on I was strong. But now I am so lost. 'I feel so helpless because I don’t know who to call for help. No one wants to know, everyone is saying they are guilty. 'As soon as their names came out I called the FBI. I told the woman on the tip line that they had never been in trouble, that they could not have done this. Accused: Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and his younger brother Dzhokhar allegedly planted the marathon bombs . 'She didn’t even take down my contact information and no one for the FBI has been in touch since. 'Then I called the police and all they could do was try to prohibit me from speaking to the media. 'I have to speak out. These boys could not have done this – they have never been around guns or explosives. 'Listen to what their friends, their teachers and their sports coaches are saying. They were good boys. 'After the marathon bombs Dzhokhar was going about his normal daily life. He wasn’t on the run or in hiding. It was only after the FBI put their photographs out that all the trouble happened. 'Then these photographs come out – . showing them at the marathon, moving about. I do wonder what really . happened. Maybe they were photo shopped on. Scene: Dzhokhar was found in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday following a massive manhunt . Caught: He was found in the boat after a massive manhunt and is now recovering in hospital . 'They have been framed. I don’t know why but someone has done this and these boys have been smeared by cheap lies. 'Now one has been killed and the . other is badly injured. He has been shot in the neck, so he cannot speak . and it would be convenient if he did not survive. Fears: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's aunt said she now fears for his safety after he was 'framed' 'I have to speak out for them. I am going to go to Boston in the next few days. I promised their father that.' Maret moved to Toronto in 1996, then filled out much of the paperwork to bring the rest of the family over. Dzhokhar was eight when he arrived with his mother Zubeida and father in 2002. Tamerlan arrived the following year with his uncle Ruslan. Maret, 45, said the boys’ father returned to Russia last year after being beaten up on the street in Boston. 'It was an unexplained attack. It is unimportant,' she said. 'He was frustrated in America. His sons were growing, they didn’t need him anymore. 'He said to me, ""I’m losing my family. They all seem to know everything, how to run a family, how to raise a family."" 'But he knew at heart they were good boys. And we know they not involved in the marathon bombs, they have been cruelly framed. 'People want to start something - they say lets involve the Russians or the Chechnyans, whatever sounds convincing. 'My nephews have been framed. Now the authorities don’t want Dzhokhar to stand up and declare his innocence. 'I have never felt so helpless. But I will not keep silent. I do not want people to think the relatives don’t care, that we aren’t concerned.' Distraught: Parents Anzor and Zubeidat Tsarnaev are hoping to visit their son in the U.S. Maret said she had been monitoring Facebook and other internet sites to see if there was any 'chatter' about her nephews being framed. When asked who she thought had framed her nephews, she became hysterical and started wailing loudly. 'You tell me. Who do you think did this?' she said. 'They were good boys, dragged from their beds by unidentified people and framed. They shot one, then the other. 'I have had threats, people phoning my home to tell me to be careful. I don’t answer them back, I just put the phone down. I am very scared.' Maret said she had last seen her nephews five years ago. But she spoke to Tamerlan on the phone a year ago and was excited to hear news of his wife and toddler daughter.

'He was not good at staying in touch, that’s why when he phoned another of my brothers this week and asked for forgiveness he was saying sorry for not being in touch enough.

Tough: Companies put up prices for the majority to help pay for green solutions for the poorest and oldest in society, but now face fines for not spending the cash . Energy giants that are failing to help thousands of poor families and pensioners cut their bills face huge fines. Millions of households saw bills increase on the promise that companies would use the extra money to pay for home insulation, double glazing and new boilers. However, a number, including British Gas and SSE, took the money but failed to carry out all the work that was expected. The idea was to cut the UK’s carbon emissions by helping the poor to reduce their energy use. Under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target and Community Energy Saving Programme, each major energy supplier and generator was given targets in terms of the number of homes that would be improved. All the work was due to be completed by last December. As a result of the missed deadline hundreds of thousands of homes have not had the help expected to cut energy use. Industry regulator Ofgem yesterday said the firms involved face enforcement action – likely to include multi-million-pound fines. Executive director of the consumer . champion Which?, Richard Lloyd, welcomed the crackdown, saying: ‘It's . right that Ofgem is taking action against those energy companies who . have not met their energy efficiency targets. ‘Consumers pay for these schemes through their energy bills, and so have a right to know how much they are costing.’ Requirements to make millions of homes more energy efficient were established under two schemes, CERT – Carbon Emissions Reduction Target – and CESP – Community Energy Saving Programme. The idea was that these would cut the UK’s carbon emissions by helping the poor to reduce their energy use and bills. Each major energy supplier and generator was given specific targets in terms of the number of homes that would be improved and the resulting cut in carbon emissions. The CERT scheme involved insulating homes, switching the energy supply from oil to gas or paying for free energy displays to encourage people to cut down on use of heat and light. The work would save 293million tonnes of carbon emissions, which was the equivalent to insulating 11.5m homes. Improvements: The money raised from higher prices was meant to be used to pay for new boilers, insulation and other greener energy products . The CESP scheme encouraged the firms to form partnerships with local councils and housing associations to support major schemes that would transform entire estates. This involved replacing old inefficient boilers, providing solid wall insulation or green energy through, for example, solar panels. All the work was due to be completed by December last year, however, British Gas, the country’s biggest household supplier failed to meet the targets. In terms of CESP, it only reached 62.4per cent of its obligations, while the figure was 98.9per cent for the CERT scheme. Earlier this year, the company revealed an 11per cent rise in profits to £606million for 2012. This helped its parent company, Centrica, to post a 14per cent rise in profits to £2.7billion. Scottish Power only met 70per cent of its CESP target. SSE managed a score of 90.9per cent on CESP and 98.5per cent on CERT. Hot water: British Gas is among the companies facing punishment from the energy watchdog . A number of electricity generating firms also failed badly to hit CESP targets, including the giant Drax power station, in north Yorkshire, at just 37.1per cent, and GDF Suez/IPM, which has seven power plants, at 38.6per cent. The worst performing firm was Intergen, which runs three power stations in England, which met just 6.5per cent of the target it was given to help families improve their home energy efficiency. The net result of the collective failure is that hundreds of thousands of homes have not had the help expected to cut energy use and so lower bills. Energy & Climate Change Secretary, Ed Davey, said millions of people have been helped by the schemes, which have now been replaced by what he said was a new tougher regime. However, he said: ‘I am disappointed that under the old schemes, some companies failed to meet their obligations. ‘Ofgem will be conducting a thorough investigation and will take any necessary enforcement action. We are already acting through the Energy Bill to give Ofgem the teeth it needs in future to get compensation to those directly affected.’ Ofgem’s enforcement chief, Sarah Harrison, said: ‘At a time of rising energy bills energy efficiency can make a big difference for consumers. ‘Ofgem’s role is to ensure that consumers do not lose out by the failure of firms to deliver all the help required or are not disadvantaged by late delivery.’ British Gas B said it has spent £1.1billion on home insulation and energy efficiency measures under the CERT and CESP schemes. This paid for the insulation of three million homes and 65,000 new boilers. It blamed the bad weather over the winter for not being able to carry out as many home improvements as it would have liked. Scottish Power said that while it did not meet the December 2012 deadline, it has contracts in place to ensure the promised insulation and other measures are carried out. SSE said it did complete all the work that was expected, but was unable to provide the necessary verification in time.","Prices went up to pay for free home insulation, double glazing and boilers .

A paramedic who sent grotesque hate messages to the founder of an NHS campaign group has been sacked. Roy 'Murph' Guest, 51, posted a string . of vile comments on Facebook about Julie Bailey, 51, after she set up . the Cure the NHS campaign to highlight failings at scandal-hit Stafford .

Astonishing rant: The senior West Midlands Ambulance Service worker said on a Facebook group in support of staff at Stafford Hospital that Miss Bailey, 51, should 'shut her face' and 'go back to her bacon butties' A spokesperson said: 'After reviewing . all of the information available to us, and taking into consideration . national guidance, it was decided that the comments do not meet the . threshold for criminal charges. 'We have been liaising with Julie Bailey throughout the investigation and updated her about its outcome.' Ms Bailey set up Cure the NHS to . campaign for an investigation into Mid Staffordshire NHS trust which . later found up to 1,200 patients had died needlessly. Following the harrowing death of her mother, Bella, at the hospital, Ms Bailey vowed to bring those responsible to account. Shocking report: Up to 1,200 patients are feared to have died from neglect at Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust (Stafford Hospital pictured) from 2005 to 2008 with thousands of others suffering 'inhumane' treatment . After the investigation into Guest's comments was launched earlier this year, mother-of-two Ms Bailey said: ‘It has been the same for five years now, it’s the same as the threats I have always had hoping that I get some kind of disease. ‘These people need to be rooted out, they are just the kind of bully who works for the NHS. ‘I have had a great response from lots of NHS staff, overworked staff have written to me to thank us for our hard work.’ Mr Guest, 54, made the threats even though his mother Irene died at the trust in 2008 having suffered from dementia. His father, Jeff, 82, a member of Cure the NHS, said she was never bathed, not properly fed and was left to lie in soiled sheets. Mr Guest – whose wife Claire, 54, is a nurse at the trust –  apologised and removed the comments from Facebook after he was hauled up for making them. Loss: Miss Bailey started her campaign after her mother Bella (pictured), 86, died in 2007 at the hospital . In February he said: ‘I’m a healthcare professional. 'I’ve apologised for my comments on Facebook and I’ve removed the comments.’ Mrs Bailey set up Cure the NHS in an attempt to bring those responsible to justice after witnessing appalling treatment when her mother Bella was admitted to the hospital in 2007.

A bungling robber who held up a shop at knife point was caught when his mask slipped and revealed his face to CCTV cameras. John Cleaver, 31, was fleeing the Spar shop in Rowley Regis, West Midlands, on November 16 last year with £1,000 in cash when a scarf he used to disguise himself slipped. The image was captured on the shop's security cameras and detectives recognised Cleaver as the robber. Cleaver, described as a 'career criminal', had recently been released from prison after serving 11 years for car-jacking . The moment the mask slipped: Robber John Cleaver held up a shop at knife point in West Midlands but his face was caught on CCTV footage when his mask slipped . When officers swooped on his home in Pensnett, Dudley, West Midlands, they discovered four photos of the stolen cash on Cleaver's mobile phone and clothes which matched those of the raider. Cleaver, described as a 'career criminal', had recently been released from prison after serving 11 years for car-jacking. On Wednesday he was jailed for seven years at Wolverhampton Crown Court. Speaking after the case, Detective Constable Ryan Matthews, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Cleaver's face covering slipped for just a split second during the robbery but that was all we needed to identify him and put arrest plans in place. 'He's the kind of person people class as a ""career criminal"" - but it's a career leading to him spending most of his life behind bars.' Cleaver sped away from the Spar in a stolen Mazda 6 which he had taken from the driveway of a house in Kingswinford, three hours before the robbery. A search of his home uncovered clothing worn during the robbery and further CCTV enquiries showed Cleaver buying a crowbar used in the robbery from a hardware store the previous day. Det Con Matthews added: 'None of the store staff were injured but a seven year prison sentence reflects the gravity of the offence and that the shop assistants were understandably fearful for their safety.'","John Cleaver, 31, robbed a Spar .

Liverpool forward Luis Suarez is back in the spotlight after appearing to bite Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic on the arm during the 2-2 draw with Chelsea at Anfield, going on to score a late equaliser. Here are some of the previous controversies surrounding the Uruguayan forward. February 2007: Suarez made his international debut for Uruguay against Colombia but was sent off in the final minutes after being shown a second yellow card for dissent. November 2007: Joined Ajax from Uruguayan side Nacional but he was later suspended by the Dutch giants after a half-time dressing-room altercation with team-mate Albert Luque. July 2010: During the 2010 World Cup quarter-finals, Suarez prevented Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah from scoring in the final minute with a deliberate handball on the line and was subsequently sent off. A penalty was awarded but missed by Asamoah Gyan and footage showed Suarez celebrating on the sidelines. Uruguay eventually went through to the last four on penalties. November 2010: Suarez was handed a seven-match ban by the Dutch FA and fined by his club for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal during an Eredivisie match. October 2011: Following his move to Liverpool in January 2011, he was involved in a tackle with Everton's Jack Rodwell and goes down with apparent minimal contact. Rodwell was then sent off. October 2011: Suarez was alleged to have racially abused Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League match. Suarez was later found guilty by an independent regulatory commission and banned for eight matches and fined £40,000. December 2011: Was seen making an offensive gesture towards Fulham fans. At this time he had already been charged by the Football Association over the racism incident, although not yet punished, but was handed a further one-match ban for the gesture. February 2012: United and Liverpool met again at Old Trafford, but more controversy blew up as Suarez refused to shake Evra's hand before kick-off. October 2012: Celebrated a goal against Everton by diving in front of Toffees boss David Moyes who had earlier claimed that 'divers' such as Suarez were putting fans off the English game. January 2013: Handles the ball prior to scoring Liverpool's winner in the FA Cup third round tie at Mansfield. April 2013: Appears to bite Branislav Ivanovic on the arm but escapes punishment on the pitch as the referee fails to see it, and scores Liverpool's equaliser seven minutes into stoppage time as they draw 2-2 with Chelsea at Anfield.","Luis Suarez charged with violent conduct by FA for bite on Ivanovic .

Two planets found around a distant star have been described as the most similar to Earth yet discovered. The planets in the newly found Kepler 62 system are made of rock and ice, and researchers believe they could contain water. Kepler-62e and Kepler-62d are among five new planets found within the 'habitable' zone of a Sun-like star. The newly discovered planets named Kepler-62e and -f., two of the five planets found around a far-off star have been described as the most similar to Earth yet discovered . Nasa’s Kepler mission has discovered two new planetary systems that include three super-Earth-size planets in the 'habitable zone,' the range of distance from a star where the surface temperature of an orbiting planet might be suitable for liquid water. The Kepler-62 system has five planets; 62b, 62c, 62d, 62e and 62f. The Kepler-69 system has two planets; 69b and 69c. Kepler-62e, 62f and 69c are the super-Earth-size planets. Two of the planets, named Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f, are rocky or made mostly of ice, and are believed to be the most likely to be earth 'doubles'. Physicist Professor Justin Crepp said: 'From what we can tell, from their radius and orbital period, these are the most similar objects to Earth that we have found yet.' They were identified by data from the Kepler mission launched in 2009 to identify extrasolar planets. It has so far resulted in several dozen of some 3,000 'Kepler Objects of Interest' having been studied in detail but of those the 'five-planet system' is the most important. Crepp noticed a faint dot near Kepler-62 a year ago, leading to months of detailed study to confirm the planet interpretation. The discovery was made by astrophysicists at the University of Notre Dame. The findings were published in Science magazine. Researchers use fluctuations in the brightness of a star to identify the presence of a potential planet whose transit periodically dims the light of the star. Crepp uses large ground-based telescopes to image the host star and analyzes the system to make sure other astronomical phenomena, such as nearby eclipsing binary stars, are not causing the fluctuation, a common 'false positive' encountered in the research. 'What really helped is that this star has five planets,' he said. Relative sizes of Kepler habitable zone planets discovered: Left to right: Kepler-22b, Kepler-69c, Kepler-62e, Kepler-62f, and Earth (except for Earth, these are artists' renditions) 'You can mimic one planet with another event, but when you have five of them and they're all periodic, that helps to put the nail in the coffin. 'It's hard to make that kind of signature with anything else that you can dream up.' Kepler-62 and the Solar System . The diagram compares the planets of the inner solar system to Kepler-62, a five-planet system about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra . Kepler-69, the second new system revealed today, a two-planet system about 2,700 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. The two planets of Kepler-69 orbit a star that belongs to the same class as our sun, called G-type. The Kepler space observatory, named . after the 17th century German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was launched . on 7 March 2009 to survey a portion of the Milky Way for Earth-size . planets that could harbour life. The research team used data from . NASA's Kepler space telescope, which simultaneously and continuously . measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes. When . a planet candidate transits, or passes, in front of the star from the . spacecraft's vantage point, a percentage of light from the star is . blocked. This causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet's size relative to its star. The size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet's size accurately. To . learn more about the properties of the stars, scientists . examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface . of the star. They . probe the interior structure of stars just as geologists use . seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure . of Earth. The science is called asteroseismology. The sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface. The waves cause oscillations that Kepler observes as a rapid flickering of the star's brightness. Like bells in a steeple, small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones. The barely discernible, high-frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure. This is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun. Eric Agol, a Univeristy of Washington  associate professor of astronomy, identified Kepler 62f, a small, probably rocky planet orbiting a sunlike star in the Lyra constellation. The planet is about 1.4 times the size of Earth, receives about half as much solar flux, or heat and radiation, as Earth and circles its star in 267.3 (Earth) days. It's one of two ""super-Earth"" planets discovered in the star Kepler 62's habitable zone, that swath of space the right distance from the star to potentially allow liquid water to exist on a planet's surface, thus giving life a chance. A super-Earth is a planet greater in mass than our own but still smaller than gas giants such as Neptune. Kepler 62's other super-Earth, nearby 62e, is 1.61 times Earth's size, circles the star in 122.4 days and gets about 20 percent more stellar flux than the Earth. The two are the smallest exoplanets — planets outside the solar system — yet found in a host star's habitable zone. 'The planets this small that we have found until now have been very close to their stars and much too hot to be possibly habitable. The artist's concept depicts Kepler-62e, a super-Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun, located about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. Kepler-62e orbits it's host star every 122 days and is roughly 60 percent larger than Earth in size. Scientists do not know if Kepler-62e is a waterworld or if it has a solid surface, but its discovery signals another step closer to finding a world similar to Earth. Kepler-62f, a super-Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun, located about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. Kepler-62f orbits it's host star every 267 days and is roughly 40 percent larger than Earth in size. The size of Kepler-62f is known, but its mass and composition are not. However, based on previous exoplanet discoveries of similar size that are rocky, scientists are able to determine its mass by association. The artist's concept depicts Kepler-69c, a super-Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a star like our sun, located about 2,700 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler-69c, is 70 percent larger than the size of Earth, and is the smallest yet found to orbit in the habitable zone of a sun-like star. Astronomers are uncertain about the composition of Kepler-69c, but its orbit of 242 days around a sun-like star resembles that of our neighboring planet Venus. 'This is the first one Kepler has found in the habitable zone that satisfies this small size,"" Agol said. 'Kepler 62f is the smallest size and the most promising distance from its star, which by these measures makes it the most similar exoplanet to Earth that has been found by Kepler.' Agol is the second author of a paper documenting the discovery published April 18 by Science Express, the online edition of the journal Science. While the sizes of Kepler 62e and 62f are known, Agol said, their mass and densities are not — but every planet found in their size range so far has been rocky, like Earth. 'Based on its size, our best guess is that it's rocky and has some atmosphere, but not a thick gaseous envelope, like Neptune,' Agol said. The Kepler telescope was launched in 2009 with the aim of finding Earthlike planets beyond the solar system. It detects planets by 'transits' that cause their host stars to appear fainter when the planets pass in front as they orbit. Kepler 62f was a late-arrival in terms of its discovery. Its planetary siblings were found by a team of researchers led by William Borucki of the NASA Ames Research Center, principal investigator for the Kepler Space Telescope. Kepler 62 b, c and d are 1.31, 0.54 and 1.95 times the size of the Earth, respectively, but orbit the star too close to be in the habitable zone. 'This type of discovery is the reason we launched the Kepler spacecraft — . to find small, Earth-sized, potentially Earth-temperature planets,"" Agol said. 'At the same time, though, it isn't exactly the same as . Earth. 'It is slightly larger and cooler than Earth. 'It tells me how . special the Earth is and how it may take some time — hopefully not too . long — to find its exact twin.'","Discovery of five new planets made by Nasa's Kepler telescope .

A vaccine against shingles could cut the risk of infection by half and reduce complications associated with the condition. New research has found that vaccine's effectiveness against post-herpetic neuralgia  - nerve pain that occurs at the site of a previous attack of shingles - was 59 per cent. Shingles is an infection of a nerve . and the surrounding skin. It is caused by the herpes varicella-zoster . virus, which also causes chickenpox. Battleground: Vaccination has been shown to be incredibly effective in preventing shingles (pictured) Most . people suffer with chickenpox in childhood, and after the illness has . disappeared, the virus remains dormant in the nervous system. The immune system usually keeps the virus in check, but later in life it can be reactivated and cause shingles. Shingles tends to affect adults over the . age of 50. It is not fully understood why the virus . is reactivated, but it may be due to lowered immunity due to age, . stress or another underlying condition. The lifetime risk of developing shingles . is between ten and 30 per cent but this increases to 50 per cent in . those aged 85 years or  older. In the new study, Dr Sinéad Langan and her colleagues . at the London School of . Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, studied the medical records of 766,330 . American private healthcare patients aged over 65 between 2007 and . 2009. The vaccine could reduce much unnecessary pain suffering in the elderyl . They found that while almost 13,000 . participants developed shingles, the vaccine reduced the rate of infection by 48 per cent. But the research, published in medical journal Public Library of Science, did find that the vaccine was less effective against shingles in older adults with impaired immune systems. The vaccine is already widely used in the U.S. and the UK Department of Health(DoH) is keen to roll out an immunisation programme for everyone aged over 70. However the DoH has failed to negotiate a large enough contract with manufacturers to enable a national immunisation programme any time soon. This has put the UK in a unique position – 60,000 doses have been supplied to Britain but there is no fair way of distributing them. It is not known when a nationwide scheme will be . brought in. Currently it is possible to get hold of the vaccine, Zostavax, on private prescription for a cost of around £100. Dr Langan said: ‘This study shows the effectiveness of the herpes zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia in a general population of over 65s. ‘Our findings should be taken in to consideration by those developing policy, particularly in the UK where plans to offer the vaccine are being made.’","Each year 250,000 Britons develop the condition .

Manhattan dog Jack, who swallowed $1.11 in change, gives his best innocent look to the camera after vets saved his life . A belly full of small change caused a big problem for this Jack Russell who had to be operated on after slurping up 111 pennies. Jack jogs the streets of New York daily and usually only eats the best holistic food, but he's got a voracious appetite and is always licking things off the floor, said his owner Tim Kelleher. It was after knocking over a jar of pennies while going for a few crumbs of bagel that the pampered pooch chomped up the collection of coppers. Dr Suliman Al-Ghazlat at BluePearl . Veterinary Partners in New York had to use a camera attached to a net to . fish 111 coins out of the 13-year-old's stomach. Scooping . up five at a time, the procedure took more than two hours. But letting . the coins pass could have killed Jack because pennies made after 1982 . contain toxic zinc. The day . the long-legged, broken-coat terrier ate the pennies, Mr Kelleher had . left a sack with a few bagel crumbs on his desk at home in Manhattan. Jack . pounced on the leftovers, but in so doing Jack knocked over a jar of . pennies. As he licked the crumbs off the floor, he slurped up the . pennies too. X-rays . clearly showed the pile of potentially fatal pennies lodged in the small . dog's guts and vets decided the only option was an emergency endoscopy. Endoscopy is a non-invasive procedure using a scope with a camera, which is safer and easier to recover from than surgery. The procedure to retrieve the currency lasted approximately two hours. During that time, Jack was monitored closely under anaesthesia.

Letting the coins pass could have killed Jack because most pennies contain toxic zinc . Besides the risk that the toxic zinc in the pennies could damage Jack's kidneys, liver and red blood cells, there was the danger that they could block the intestines and cause gastrointestinal problems. 'Early and safe removal was absolutely imperative to Jack’s health,' said Dr Amy Zalcman, a senior emergency doctor at BluePearl, who oversaw Jack’s treatment. 'If Jack would not have had the pennies removed, the consequences would have been fatal.' Following the incident in March, Mr Kelleher told the Associated Press he thought he had 'Jackproofed' his apartment. But just a few days ago, the hungry hound ate a whole bag of hamburger rolls after pulling it off a kitchen counter.

But just days ago, the hungry hound ate a whole bag of hamburger rolls after pulling it off a kitchen counter . Hundreds of pets undergo surgery every year to remove small articles of clothing and other objects from their stomachs and intestines, said Dr Karen Halligan. Dr Halligan, an author, TV consultant and the director of veterinary services for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Los Angeles, said ingested clothing can be the most dangerous, since it won't show on X-rays. And surgeries to remove or dislodge things that pets swallow are not cheap. 'We are talking $2,500 to $5,000 at the least,' said Dr Halligan.

A newlywed who stole £100,000 from his employer so that his wife could go on a spending spree for a new car, motorbike and breast enhancement surgery has been jailed. Arron Thomas, 32, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, wrote fraudulent cheques from building firm Grafton's and deposited them in his wife Rhianna's account, Oxford Crown Court heard. Mrs Thomas, 24, then embarked on a series of extravagant purchases including £4,000 to have her breasts enlarged, £9,000 on a Suzuki motorbike and £14,000 on a Volvo C70 coupe. Guilty: Arron Thomas stole £100,000 from a building firm and deposited in his wife Rhianna's account . In the midst of the fraud the couple also got married on April 29, 2011, the same day as Prince William and Kate Middleton. But their lavish lifestyle soon attracted suspicion and in January last year they were arrested at their home and charged with a string of fraud-related offences. The couple, pictured arriving at court for an earlier hearing, married on April 29, 2011, the same day as Prince William and Kate Middleton . Mr Thomas admitted his part in the fraud and was jailed at Oxford Crown Court today for 22 months. Mrs Thomas denied charges of . possessing and transferring criminal property but was found guilty by a jury on . three counts following a trial. She was cleared of four similar charges. The court heard how Mr Thomas had orchestrated the fraud by writing false invoices while . he worked as a purchase ledger clerk at building firm Grafton's. Cheques were written out under the name 'Tucker', implying they were for intended for a supplier of that name. In fact, they were paid into Rhianna Thomas' account under her maiden name, which was also 'Tucker'. Money started to flow into her account . and Mrs Thomas visited a Make Yourself Amazing (MYA) branch for cosmetic . surgery in a £4,250 pounds operation in Birmingham on February 20, . 2011. A Suzuki motorbike was bought . and a Volvo was purchased from Johnsons Cars Limited in Oxford after . Thomas traded in her eight-year-old old Rover MG ZT. Mrs Thomas was handed a 15-month jail . sentence suspended for two years after the judge said she was 'under . the spell' of her husband when she committed the crimes. Sheilagh Davies, representing Mr Thomas, said: 'Prior to his employment at Graftons Mr Thomas had got himself into debt. 'He wanted the very best for Rhianna . and so he borrowed an awful lot of money - £12,000 pounds initially, . rising to £20,000 pounds. 'He had lost his job when the recession hit, but he wanted to recompense her for looking after him and his daughter. 'He bought her a car with the money. It was misguided and stupid as it was one of those loans with huge interest. 'In the end he turned to fraud and . these are why these offences come about. He accepts what he did and he . must be punished for it.' Mr Thomas had several convictions for dishonesty stretching back to 2000 and was jailed for 90 days in February 2007. Claire Fraser, representing Mrs Thomas said her client had no previous convictions. She said: 'She was not charged with any fraud herself. At the beginning . of the activities she did not know or suspect they were a criminal . product of fraud. 'Had it not been for Aaron Thomas then Rhianna Thomas would not be where she stand today.' A judge at Oxford Crown Court jailed Arron Thomas for 22 months after he admitted defrauding his former employer . Recorder Philip Brooke-Smith, . addressing Mrs Thomas, said: 'The offences for which you have been . convicted are very serious ones. 'You may have been under the spell of . your husband, that is not to say you were without a mind of your own, . you are an intelligent person and probably remain so, however, you were . and probably remain in love with your husband. 'Through that period you married him and I regard these matters as the background around you.' Mrs Thomas dressed in a grey coat wept as her husband in a blue tee-shirt was led away to begin his jail term. Speaking after the case, . Investigating officer Detective Constable Matt Welsh, of Thames Valley . Police, said: 'Arron Thomas embarked on this large-scale fraud just . months after starting his new job and made little effort in covering up . his crimes. 'His actions were blatant but he . believed the fraud would go unnoticed. He couldn’t carry this fraud out . on his own so he involved Rhianna, who was well-aware the money was . stolen. 'The couple enjoyed a lavish . lifestyle, spending just under £100,000 in just three months on . expensive goods such as cars, motorbikes, a luxury wedding and even . cosmetic surgery. 'This lifestyle was a far cry from what they were used to which would have raised suspicions among those who knew them. 'I welcome the sentences and would like to thank all the witnesses and those who assisted with the police investigation.

London 2012 was dubbed the women's Olympics thanks to the opportunities made available for females to finally compete in traditionally male-dominated sports including football and boxing. But one may wonder why it has taken so long for women to gain some equality in sport - as these vintage pictures show sisters doing it for themselves more than one hundred years ago. The remarkable photographs, supplied by the U.S. Library of Congress, are taken from the George Grantham Bain Collection - one of America's first news picture agencies. Take that: The female competitors - whose names are recorded as Fraulein Kussin and Mrs Edwards - fought on 7 March 1912 . Girl power: But while women were boxing at the start of the 20th century, it wasn't until more than a hundred years later they were allowed to compete in the Olympics . The photos show how Edwardian women were pushing the boundaries imposed on them by their gender by proving they could fight, swim and play football just like men. One of the pictures shows 'Mrs Edwards and Faurlein Kussin' in the boxing ring for a bout on 7 March 1912. Befitting of the time, neither of them wear any protective head gear and one of them wears a dress as she throws a punch at her opponent. During this period, women's boxing and wrestling would often be held as theatrical displays as part of Vaudeville entertainment. World champion: Rose Pitonof proved women could swim long distances by completing a 17 mile challenge . Men and women's boxing was . then introduced at the modern Olympic games in 1904 as display events. However, while the men's participation was accepted, the women's was not. It was more than one hundred years until women were finally allowed to compete in the Olympics with Britain's Nicola Adams winning the first gold medal for women's boxing in 2012. It wasn't just in boxing that women defied expectations at the start of the 20th century. Rose Pitonof made history as she proved that women can be capable endurance swimmers. As a 15 year old in 1910, she was the first woman to complete the eight mile Boston Light Swim and blew the men who towed the start line with her out of the water - beating them all in a time of six hours 50 minutes. Winner: Wimbledon champion May Sutton shocked the Edwardian crowd with her shorter skirt that exposed her ankles . Williams sisters of their day: May's sibling Florence was also a successful player . She became a household name and a world champion long distance swimmer as she went on to complete a number of other endurance events including a 17 mile swim   from Manhattan to Steeplechase Pier, Coney Island in 1911. She died in 1984 aged 89 but her legacy lives on with the annual 17 mile Rose Pitonof Centennial Swim. Other pioneering women in sport captured in the George Grantham Bain Collection are tennis stars May and Florence Sutton - the Williams sisters of their day. British born May grew up in the U.S. after her parents emigrated when she was a child. She won her first Grand Slam title in 1904 and then won the Wimbledon title in 1905. Her appearance at the British championship caused a stir because she broke with tradition by wearing a shorter skirt than was usually seen on the female players which flashed her ankles. She shocked further by rolling up her sleeves to expose her elbows. Such public 'flashing of the flesh' was unheard of at the time. Kicking for equality: Other pictures in the archives show women playing football and baseball . She won the Wimbledon title again in 1907 beating the British favourite Dorothea Lambert Chambers. Meanwhile, her sister Florence was also a formidable player who made the U.S.Open singles and doubles finals. Further pictures in the Library of Congress archives show women playing football and baseball at the turn of the last century.","'Mrs Edwards and Faurlein Kussin' met in the boxing ring on 7 March 1912 .

British drivers are spending up to three days a year stuck in gridlock, new research reveals today. The UK ranks 5th in Europe for time wasted in traffic jams. But one silver lining form the economic downturn is that jams have actually eased over the last year as cash-strapped motorists hit with rising fuel prices have cut their driving. The findings are revealed today by leading in-car data company INRIX which supplies real-time traffic information to car sat-nav companies. Worst hit by jams in the UK are . drivers in Greater London where last year motorists lost 72 hours of . their lives in gridlock – equivalent to three whole days or nine working . days. It is followed by . Greater Manchester (45 hours), Merseyside (37 hours), South . Nottinghamshire, (36 hours), Greater Birmingham (32 hours), Belfast (31 . hours), Edinburgh (28 hours), South Yorkshire (27 hours), Leeds-Bradford . (27 hours) and Portsmouoth-Fareham area (925 hours). The . average time spent in gridlock across the UK is 29 hours. However, this . is seven hours less than in 2011 – a drop of 19 per cent. One of the biggest drops is in Tyne and Wear which encompasses Newcastle and Sunderland, where hours lost to jams are down 38 per cent - or 14 hours – to 24 hours in a year. In Glasgow gridlock delays are down by nearly a third (32 per cent) or ten hours a year to 21 hours. Those in Coventry are down a quarter (25 per cent) or by seven hours to 21 hours. By comparison, London has one of the lowest fall of nine per cent - or seven hours to 72 hours. Experts blame the economic downturn for the drop as motorist are forced or choose to drive less to save cash. The researchers found jams have actually eased over the last year as cash-strapped motorists hit with rising fuel prices have cut their driving . Across Europe, the  UK has the fifth highest level of gridlock in Europe averaging 29 hours a year behind Belgium (59 hours), Netherlands (52 hours), Germany (37 hours) and France (37 hours). It is equal to Luxembourg (also 29 hours), but worse than Austria (25 hours), Spain (25 hours), Switzerland. London (at 72 hours is the third most congested city in Europe behind Brussels (83 hours) and Antwerp (77 hours) but ahead of Rotterdam (71 hours), Stuttgart (65 hours) and Paris (63 hours). The INRIX report says: 'Overall motorists in the UK spent less time in traffic than fellow drivers in Germany, France and the Netherlands and a massive 30 hours less than travellers in Europe's most congested country Belgium. 'Traffic levels continued to decline steadily in the first quarter of 2013, with initial results indicating congestion in the UK is down 11 per cent year on year and drivers are spending around an hour less in gridlock than in the first quarter of 2012.' INRIX chief executive Bryan Mistele said: 'There has always been strong correlation between the state of the economy and the level of traffic congestion on our roads. 'It tells us if people are employed and driving to work, going out to eat or doing some shopping, as well as whether or not businesses are shipping products.' He added: 'Considering unemployment hit record highs in 2012 and European household wealth dropped 13.6 per cent it's hardly surprising that traffic levels have dropped significantly.' The report notes: 'The UK capital, London, has moved up the European traffic congestion ranks to become the third most congested city in Europe in 2012.' The report says: 'Drivers in London spent a full three days of 2012 sitting in traffic, that's over a day more than the UK's second most congested city Manchester, where drivers spent 45 hours in congestion. 'Manchester also climbed the European ranks moving from 20th to 18th place. Even with the jump in European rankings, all 18 UK cities analysed showed declines in traffic congestion throughout the year indicative of the impact of rising unemployment and fuel prices combined with declines in consumer spending. ' 'However even in London traffic levels continues to drop, with congestion down nine per cent year on year. In Belfast traffic dropped 20 per cent and the city moved down the UK rankings from 4th to 6th place.'","Findings are revealed today by leading in-car data company INRIX .

Argentina has been accused of trying to ‘strangle’ the Falkland Islands by intimidating cruise ships which stop there, it emerged yesterday. At least 12 incidents of luxury liners being targeted have been reported to Britain’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office since November - typically one a fortnight. Protesters or industrial action by militant unions are disrupting vessels that have a stopover in islands on their itinerary. At least 12 incidents of luxury liners being targeted have been reported to Britain¿s Foreign and Commonwealth Office since November - typically one a fortnight (file picture) Some cruise ships have cancelled visits to the Falklands because of the fallout from continuing tensions over sovereignty of the South Atlantic archipelago. Protests have included officials refusing entry to Argentine ports or delaying ships, masked militants attacking and ransacking shipping company offices in Buenos Aires and cruise schedules either altered or abandoned to appease locals. Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire has condemned the intimidation and the Government has summoned Argentine Ambassador Alicia Castro to complain about the incidents involving 10,000 passengers. The effect on so many visitors is a huge blow to the islands’ tourist industry, based in the capital, Stanley, which is worth as much as £10million and employs a quarter of the population. Some cruise ships have cancelled visits to the Falklands (pictured) because of the fallout from continuing tensions over sovereignty of the South Atlantic archipelago . Dick Sawle, a member of the Falkland Islands Government, said: ‘This is yet another example of a country of over 40million people attempting to bully and threaten our 3,000 people and strangle the economy of our home. ‘We regret this, and strongly encourage the tourism industry to stand firm, and not to allow themselves to be scared into assisting attempts to damage our economy in what is tantamount to an economic blockade. ‘There are countless families in the islands whose livelihoods depend on the cruise vessel industry. ‘For over a decade we have enjoyed welcoming visitors from all over the world to see our wonderful wildlife and heritage.’ In December two cruise ships, the Seven Seas Mariner, which carries 700 passengers and the Regatta, which carries 600, cancelled visits to the Falklands because of intimidation. The following month British cruise firm P&O announced two of its liners, Arcadia and Adonia, responded by scrapping stopovers in Argentina during their round-the-world cruises to avoid disruption.","At least 12 luxury liners have been targeted, says Foreign Office .

Cumbria PCC Richard Rhodes has offered a salary of nearly £600 a week for someone to carry out duties which will include giving advice on ‘how to handle the media in order to maintain public perception’. The job offer comes after the commissioner reported four members of staff to the police for telling a local newspaper about his expensive taxpayer-funded trips in a hired Mercedes. New position: Cumbria PCC Richard Rhodes has offered a salary of nearly £600 a week for someone to carry out duties which will include giving advice on 'how to handle the media in order to maintain public perception' Three of the staff members were arrested while a fourth has been questioned. MPs have condemned the arrests as an outrage against democracy and a threat to freedom of speech, and Prime Minister David Cameron has promised an inquiry. The three, who have not been named but who include two police staff members, face serious charges and possible jail sentences if charged with crimes and found guilty. They have been bailed until 24 May. Now in an extraordinary move Mr Rhodes has advertised for a permanent staff member to ‘raise the perception’ of himself among the public. The Cumbria PCC website is offering a salary of up to £30,633 for a ‘communications and engagement officer’ whose job will include ‘raising the public perception of the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner and managing any reputational risks.’ The spin doctor will also ‘carry out media and/or public relations activity in the event of a major or critical incident’. Cumbria Constabulary already have a press office which deals daily with media inquiries. A spokesman for Mr Rhodes said yesterday the spending on a spin doctor had been approved before the Mercedes incident and the arrests that followed drew him to national attention. ‘It is in the medium to long term strategy to recruit a Commissioning Manager and fill the vacant Communications and Engagement post. The Police and Crime Panel approved the Office structure in early April,’ she said. The two journeys in the chauffeur-driven Mercedes, one to a dinner with the Archbishop of York and the other to a regimental reunion, cost the taxpayer £313 and £385. Probe: MPs have condemned the arrests of members of staff who told a local newspaper about Mr Rhodes's expensive taxpayer-funded trips in a hired Mercedes - and David Cameron (pictured) has promised an inquiry . Mr Rhodes, who was the winning Tory candidate in the Cumbria Commissioner election in November, said last week: ‘I have made two mistakes. 'Firstly, not checking the cost of the car. Others had made the arrangements. I failed to ask questions about the costs. Once I knew the costs, I immediately asked the office to stop the arrangements. Spin doctor help: Hertfordshire Police PCC David Lloyd is to hire a mouthpiece on a salary of £66,312 - £75,786 . ‘Secondly, I apologise that my expenses were not published earlier. The short period of time since November has been a very busy period for the office. ‘I apologise unreservedly to the people of Cumbria, regarding my expenses.’ The Commissioner has now been supplied with a Hyundai 4x4 vehicle for travel around his patch. It is estimated to have cost £23,000. In the Commons on Wednesday Lib Dem party president Tim Farron, who is MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, told the Prime Minister: ‘Last week three people in Cumbria were arrested for apparently blowing the whistle in the public interest over the actions of the police commissioner.’ He asked Mr Cameron: ‘Will you agree with me that this is a threat to freedom of speech, an outrage in a democratic society and will you intervene to make sure there is an independent investigation?’ Mr Cameron replied: ‘I will look carefully at this case. In general we should support whistleblowers and what they do to help improve the provision of public services. I will have a look and get back to you.’ Another PCC was also revealed to be hiring a spin doctor yesterday. Hertfordshire Police PCC David Lloyd is to hire a mouthpiece on a salary of £66,312 - £75,786, with a car allowance and final salary pension scheme. Tory Mr Lloyd, who was elected on a turnout of just 14.5 per cent of Hertfordshire’s voters, is himself paid £75,000 a year. The advert, which on his website, is for a Director of Communications and Engagement and reads: ‘You will have a track record in providing vision, direction and clarity in the development and delivery of communication plans and strategy and play a key role in the successful implementation of the Commissioner’s ambitious Police & Crime Plan, Everybody’s Business.’","Cumbria PCC wants someone to give advice on how to handle the media .

A baker who was pressured into quickly drinking a lethal amount of absinthe at a party died ten minutes after paramedics refused to take him to hospital for being too drunk, an inquest heard. Ambulance technician Ian Wilson put baker Jason Dance, 33, into the recovery position before leaving the house party in Allenton, Derbyshire, because he felt ‘claustrophobic and intimidated’. Mr Wilson admitted to his manager he had ‘messed up’ over his treatment of Mr Dance, who had downed a quarter of a pint of the spirit to prove he couldn't be 'drunk under the table' by peers. Death: Jason Dance, of Allenton, Derbyshire, had downed a quarter of a pint of absinthe to prove he couldn't be 'drunk under the table' by peers, before he died in August 2010 . The deadly dose of the drink, which is often up to 80 per cent alcohol, left him severely intoxicated - and minutes later he stood up and collapsed in the kitchen, smacking his head on the way down. An inquest into his death at South Derbyshire Coroner's Court heard that emergency services were called to the scene, but they refused to administer life-saving treatment because he was too drunk. Witness Tanya Brown said: ‘We were sat . around and someone said to Jason that they could drink him under the . table. A quarter of a glass of absinthe was poured for him. ‘Jason was saying “no” but everyone was egging him on to do it. He said he would have it, then he was going home, and he necked it.’ She added that he got up to go to the kitchen but fell over before projectile vomiting on the night in August 2010, adding: ‘The paramedics said they wouldn't take him because he was too drunk.’ Party-goers were told to leave him on the decking at the back of the property to sleep it off, Miss Brown said. He snored for a few minutes then she noticed that his lips and ears were turning blue. She . said: ‘People thought it was just the light but then they checked his . pulse and there wasn't one.’ She added that a party-goer tried to . administer heart massage and the ambulance was called again. When questioned as to whether Mr . Wilson and his colleague Louise Stanley were asked to leave at any . point, Miss Brown said 'nobody asked them to leave the first time'. Peter . Bainbridge, clinical quality manager for East Midlands Ambulance . Service, was asked by coroner Dr Robert Hunter whether Mr Dance had . received the 'minimum standard' of care. Mr Bainbridge said: ‘This patient should have been taken to hospital. He was in a vulnerable situation.’ Dr Hunter was told how the duo put Mr Dance into the recovery position and left him with friends. But less than 10 minutes later a second . 999 call was made after Mr Dance had stopped breathing and had turned . blue. By the time the ambulance team arrived back at the house he was . dead. Giving evidence on the first day of the inquest on Monday, paramedic team leader Louisa Allcock told the court how she had been called to the house about an hour after the death. She said: ‘When I arrived, Ian was standing against a wall. 'A policeman asked me if it was common procedure to attend to a patient that was not feeling coherent and then to leave them with their friends. I said no, it was not normal procedure at all.’ Home Office pathologist Professor Guy Ruttey, determined that the amount of alcohol found in Mr Dance’s system - which was 10 times the legal drink drive limit - 'would be enough to kill him'. Partygoer Jonathan Croft also told the coroner the atmosphere was not intimidating at the event. The inquest continues.","Ambulance technician put Jason Dance into recovery position and left him .

Police in Michigan have released a surveillance video of a vehicle that may have been driven by a suspect in the disappearance of a mother who vanished as she worked the night shift at a gas station. Jessica Heeringa, 25, who has a three-year-old son, was finishing her shift at an Exxon gas station in North Shores on Friday night when she apparently disappeared, leaving her purse and car behind. The video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead Tavern, shows a minivan that witnesses told police had been in the area around the same time that Ms Heeringa went missing. Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw . admits that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence, . but they're hopeful that releasing it could help unlock the . mystery.

Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV: . 'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it . up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesn’t exist for me.' He told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town & Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's disappearance. Wanted for questioning: On Tuesday, police released a sketch of the suspect that they believe was driving the minivan . Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old. Later on Tuesday, police released a sketch of the suspect. Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor.' 'There is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews. Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm. That customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there. After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police. Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend. In the call, he tells the dispatcher: . 'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just . walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car . out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.' Vanished: The mother-of-one disappeared from this gas station and police are now treating the case as an abduction . Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm. The missing girl's family made a . heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her . disappearance as an abduction. In . a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were . treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene. No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter. Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes. 911 caller: Empty Exxon 'suspicious' Help: Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., blond shoulder length hair, and blue eyes .

The gas station has no surveillance cameras so police are relying on public information for help in the investigation. 'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.' The . anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return.

A bitter Cabinet battle over which ministers face a fresh round of deep spending cuts has turned into the ‘something from the Hunger Games’, government insiders claimed. The ring-fenced health and international aid budgets are being targeted by angry ministers in charge of unprotected departments told to find and extra £11.5billion. Across Whitehall ministries are trying to off-load some of their costs by reclassifying into areas with rising budgets in a political ‘battle to the death’. Government insiders have likened the Cabinet battle to the Hunger Games book and film, in which 24 people are pitched into a battle to the death . Insiders said a ‘battle to the death’ reminiscent of the film the Hunger Games has erupted in Whitehall, as ministers try to off-load some of their costs by reclassifying them into areas with rising budgets. It is a reference to the futuristic sci-fi book and film, starring Jennifer Lawrence, in which 24 people are pitched into a battle to the death. David Cameron today signalled that some defence spending could be shifted into the foreign aid budget to ease financial pressures on the armed forces. Food, health and education programmes could also be moved into the Department for International Development, the Prime Minister hinted. He said it was ‘right to ask the question about what does development actually consist of’. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘Of course there are vaccination programmes, there’s helping the poorest people in our world to grow food programmes, there’s helping people go to school programmes. ‘But there is an argument that one of the most fundamental parts of development is security; you don’t get development without peace and security.’ David Cameron hinted that spending from some unprotected areas could be shifted into the protected foreign aid budget . Mr Cameron yesterday admonished Defence Secretary Philip Hammond for leaking details of MoD plans to grab £200 million from the Department of Health and another £120 million from the school’s budget to pay for private schooling for the children of servicemen. At a Tory political cabinet yesterday morning, the Prime Minister called on ministers to ‘keep their thoughts to themselves’. The future of the NHS budget has now become a bitter battleground. The Ministry of Justice and Home Office both want to breach the NHS ring fence too. And the Mail revealed last week that NHS funds could be funnelled to councils to fund personal care. Deputy PM Nick Clegg defended protecting NHS spending . ‘It’s every man for himself now,’ said one ministerial aide. ‘It’s a battle to the death, like something from the Hunger Games.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is refusing to accept any cuts to his budget. He will remind the Prime Minister that ringfencing the NHS budget was his personal pledge to voters and argue that great harm will come to the Tory brand if he backtracks. ‘We will be arguing for the retention of the ringfence,’ a DoH source said. ‘This was a pledge the Prime Minister made in opposition. It was a big call to make and it has proved to be right. ‘Demand is rising by 4 per cent a year in the NHS and having the budget means we can just about meet the requirements and plan ahead. There is a very strong case for maintaining the ringfence. It would undo much of the good work of the original pledge.’ He seems to have an ally in Mr Clegg, who defended the controversial decision to protect spending on foreign aid and the NHS. ‘We’ve decided we’re sticking with the protected departments,’ he said. ‘Now the unprotected departments are being weighed up to see what savings they can yield. ‘I am absolutely convinced that at a difficult time like this protecting our NHS spending, protecting our spending on schools, honouring our international contributions to developing countries around the world was a big decision, a controversial decision but was the right one to take.’ The Department of Education is also resisting the raid on its funds by Mr Hammond. Education Secretary Michael Gove will argue that deep cuts to his budget will threaten the government’s pledge to provide free childcare to 40 per cent of 2 year olds and mean cuts to school sport. One insider even said that if the Ministry of Defence wants money to send service children to private schools, Mr Gove should have some say over where they are stationed. ‘They don’t have to be posted to Germany,’ one irritated source said. ‘Perhaps Michael should be consulted about their deployments.’ The Mail has also learned that both the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office hope to seize funds from the department for International Development – plans Mr Cameron has previously endorsed. Foreign Office insiders say that further cuts will damage the British Council and lead to the closure of historic embassy buildings around the world.","Whitehall told to find an extra £11.5billion in 2015-16 beyond the election .

Ideas: Martyn Underhill, Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Dorset, pictured, is considering taking on private sponsorship . A crime commissioner is considering taking on £1million in private sponsorship to help his hard-up police force cope with a shrinking budget and workforce. Martyn Underhill, Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Dorset, revealed yesterday he has held talks with a possible sponsor about an arrangement involving all five police forces in the south west region. Writing on his blog, Mr Underhill, a former detective chief inspector for Sussex Police, said he could see 'huge potential benefit to forming appropriate sponsorship relationships with reputable organisations'. And according to the Telegraph, he said: 'I am allowed by law to obtain 1 per cent of my budget, which in Dorset is £1million – that is a lot of policemen walking the streets.' The 43 police forces across England and Wales face funding cuts of up to 20 per cent by 2015. Mr Underhill, who was second-in-charge in the Sarah Payne child murder case, said: 'The police family in Dorset is living in austere times with a shrinking budget and workforce. 'Despite those challenges, we are maintaining an efficient and effective service for Dorset. 'However, our funding needs to be readdressed and I continue to lobby the Government for extra funds. We are the lowest- funded force and have seen the worst cuts.' Mr Underhill said he met a possible sponsor at a crime reduction event last Friday and will ask for the issue to be added to the agenda at the next regional PCCs and chief constables meeting. He went on: 'I can see huge potential benefit to forming appropriate sponsorship relationships with reputable organisations. They will give Dorset Police greater funding to maintain a high-quality service. 'They will also ensure that we have the funds to help us to combat crime and provide reassurance to communities.' But he added: 'I need to be clear that we are looking for longer- term business support, rather than one-off sponsorships. 'This will help us to . plan and sustain projects that might otherwise not have been possible . due to the ongoing financial constraints. 'I . also need to stress that neither myself as police and crime . commissioner for Dorset, nor the force, will ever allow operational . functions to become dependent on, or to be influenced by, sponsorship . agreements.' Money-making: Writing on his blog, Mr Underhill, a former detective chief inspector for Sussex Police, said he could see 'huge potential benefit' to forming sponsorship deals with reputable organisations . PCCs, which replaced existing police authorities in 41 force areas across England and Wales, were handed the power to set force budgets and even hire and fire chief constables. Just 15.1 per cent of registered voters took part in the November 2012 PCC election - the lowest recorded level of participation at a peacetime non-local government election in Britain. Clive Chamberlain, chairman of Dorset Police Federation, said Mr Underhill 'rightly recognises' the force is the lowest funded in the country and fully supported his efforts to lobby government for more funding. He said: 'The issue of sponsorship is not new to the police service and any such arrangements are subject to rigorous parameters. 'Sponsorship is subject to a 1 per cent limit of the force’s total annual income and does not make any of the statutory functions of the force dependent on this funding nor does it allow for any companies to interfere with the duties of the police.'","Dorset's Police and Crime .

But there were no empty stomachs among this pride in Kenya's Masai Mara after they managed to hunt down an adult male giraffe. At least four lionesses and three cubs were pictured feasting on the unusual kill for days. Dinner time: A pride of lions swarm over their unusual kill - an adult male giraffe . Feeding frenzy: At least three cubs and four lionesses fed on the giraffe for a number of days . Fresh meat: Giraffes are not usually prey for lions due to their size and the fact they have a vicious kick . It is believed the giraffe was either ill or wounded, otherwise it would be extremely difficult for lions to take down an animal which weighs on average 1,600kg and can stand up to 20ft tall. British . wildlife photographer and safari guide Paul Goldstein, who had been following the pride for months, said he was kept . awake most of the night from the noise of the lions killing then . fighting over the prey. Paul, from Wimbledon, said: 'This was an adult bull giraffe, it must have been sick or wounded otherwise this particular pride, which I have spent many months with, would never have taken him down. 'However it proved a huge larder for many days and, as it was quite cool, the meat did not go off too quickly. Fresh meat: Wet and cold weather meant the kill kept the lions fed for several days . In for the kill: Photographer Paul Goldstein said he heard the lions killing and fighting for their prey during the night . In the wild: One of the lion cubs shakes himself dry as rain threatens to spoil the pride's meal time . 'Watching the hierarchy on the dinner table was fascinating although with such a large feast the elders were not as robust as they normally are with the cubs.' Giraffes are not easy prey for lions because of their height which makes them difficult to bring down. Lions kill by grasping the throat of their prey and suffocating it, and they cannot easily reach the throat of a giraffe whilst it is standing up. However, by working together lions can hunt and kill adult giraffes. They will often chase them onto rocky ground, where they cannot keep their balance easily, hoping to trip them up. At other times they simply surround the giraffe and repeatedly attack it as a group until it falls, when they can seize its throat. Giraffes also have a very powerful kick that can kill a lion so lions prefer to hunt easier prey such as antelope and zebra.","At least four lionesses and three cubs pictured feasting on unusual kill .

Response: Her article was in response to the recent Italian translation of a 1920 book by two German scholars, Karl Binding, pictured, and Alfred Hoche . The book she is discussing set the agenda for the Nazi programme of extermination -  they believed that select people did not have the right to survive, such as disabled or terminally ill patients.

The Civil Rights Captcha asks users to take a moral stance on a real-world civil rights issue by offering them three options about how they feel about it. Only one answer is correct, and that is the one which shows compassion and empathy. Moral stance: A new kind of Captcha asks users to prove they are human by choosing the morally correct response from a choice of three . For example, the Captcha might ask a user: 'In Kosovo people are tortured in detention. How does that make you feel?' It then asks them to enter either 'excited', or 'bothered', or 'great'. A Captcha is a type of challenge-response test used in computing as an attempt to ensure that the response is generated by a person. The acronym, coined in 2000 by researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, is based on the word 'capture' and stands for 'Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart'. A common type of Captcha requires the user to type letters or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen, and the tests are commonly used to prevent unwanted internet bots from accessing websites. Are you human? The test was designed by Swedish campaign group . Civil Rights Defenders and draws from examples of incidents that breach . the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Devised by campaign group Civil Rights Defenders, an Swedish campaign group, the Civil Rights Captcha is intended to raise the profile of civil rights struggles worldwide.

Unlicensed tattoo parlours are increasingly advertising home visits or on social media websites, according to the Local Government Association (LGA). It claims such operators are more likely to use substandard equipment and inadequate sterilisation, and are less likely to check the customer's age or medical history. As a result, customers looking for a cheap deal are exposing themselves to a higher risk of serious skin irritations or viruses like hepatitis and HIV. Tattoos are continuing to rise in popularity with an estimated 29 per cent of Britons aged between 25 and 34 having one or more, while there are now more than 1,500 licensed tattoo parlours in the UK, according to the LGA. Councillor Mehboob Khan, chairman of the LGA's safer and stronger communities board, said: 'Unlicensed tattooists and parlours continue to operate across the country in an unscrupulous bid to cash in on the growing popularity of body art. 'People looking for a cheap tattoo by using them run the real danger of picking up a serious infection such as Hepatitis or HIV or permanent scarring from botched procedures that are often delivered by these dangerous imposters. 'Everyone likes a bargain but it is simply not worth the risk to save a few pennies. Ultimately, the tattoo may be cheap but disfigurement or a life-changing health condition could be the final price paid. 'There are thousands of legitimate, licensed tattoo parlours doing a great job across the country. Many are left having to correct substandard work and frustrated that their industry is being brought into disrepute. 'All tattooists and their premises must be registered with the local authority by law to make sure they are meeting strict standards.

We would also encourage anyone who has visited an unregistered tattooist to seek medical advice from their GP and report the parlour to their local authority. 'Councils and the police will continue their unrelenting crackdown on these illegal parlours to continue shutting them down and bringing the perpetrators to justice.'

The Palaeolithic paintings in northern Spain have been precisely dated for the first time, proving the art form began in Europe 10,000 years earlier than previously thought. This means the cave paintings were created by either the first anatomically modern humans in the area - first thought to exist 41,500 years ago - or by Neanderthals. Record-breaker: The 'Panel of Hands' artwork in the El Castillo cave in northern Spain. Made by blowing or spitting paint onto the wall, scientists have estimated the art to be at least 40,800 years old . The paintings were created by either the first anatomically modern humans in the area - first thought to exist 41,500 years ago - or by Neanderthals . Scientists were able to work out the . age of the paintings by dating the formulation of tiny stalactites on . top of the art using the radioactive decay of uranium. They . examined a total of 11 caves in northern Spain, including the UNESCO . World Heritage sites of Altamira, El Castillo and Tito Bustillo. Hand . stencils and disks made by blowing paint onto the wall in the El . Castillo cave proved to date back to at least 40,800 years. This makes . them the oldest known cave art in Europe - up to 10,000 years older than previous examples from France. A large club-shaped symbol in the . polychrome chamber at Altamira was found to be at least 35,600 years . old, showing that painting started there 10,000 years earlier than . previously thought too. Research found that the cave was revisited and painted a number of times over a period spanning more than 20,000 years. The creation of art is considered . important to the evolution of modern cognitions and symbolic behaviour, . and could be associated with the development of language. Dr Alistair Pike, of the University . of Bristol, said: 'We see evidence for earlier human symbolism in the . form of perforated beads, engraved egg shells and pigments in Africa . 70,000 to 100,000 years ago, but it appears that the earliest cave . paintings are in Europe. 'One argument for its development . here is that competition for resources with Neanderthals provoked . increased cultural innovation from the earliest groups of modern humans . in order to survive. 'Alternatively, cave painting started before the arrival of modern humans, and was done by Neanderthals. 'That would be a fantastic find as it . would mean the hand stencils on the walls of the caves are outlines of . Neanderthals’ hands, but we will need to date more examples to see if . this is the case.' Gathering evidence: University of Bristol researchers remove samples from paintings in Tito Bustillo cave in Asturias, Spain, for radioactive dating . Dr Alistair Pike removes calcite crusts in the 'Corridor of Disks' inside the El Castillo cave . Social history: The creation of art is important to the evolution of modern cognitions and symbolic behaviour, and could be associated with the development of language . The scientists were forced to use the . uranium method as the paintings lacked organic pigments or binders . suitable for radiocarbon dating. And even if there was organic material . - such as charcoal pigments - only small samples can be used for dating . to minimise damage. This can cause contamination, leading to an inaccurate result. Instead, the international team . measured uranium isotypes in the thin calcite flowstone growths which . had formed on the surfaces of the paintings to date the art. The method, known as uranium-series disequilibrium, is used in Earth Sciences to accurately date ancient objects. Dr Dirk Hoffmann, of the National . Centre for the Investigation of Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain, said: . 'The key development was our method to date tiny tiny calcium carbonate . deposits similar to stalactites. 'We can now date samples of just ten . milligrams - about as small as a grain of rice. This has allowed us to . find samples that had formed directly on top of hundreds of paintings, . whereas the larger stalactites were much less frequent.' Cave art specialist Dr Paul Pettitt, . of the University of Sheffield, said: 'Until now our understanding of . the age of cave art was sketchy at best; now we have firmly extended the . earliest age of European cave art back by several thousand years, to . the time of the last Neanderthals and earliest Homo sapiens. 'These earliest images do not . represent animals, and suggest that the earliest art was non-figurative, . which may have significant implications for how art evolved.'","The Palaeolithic paintings in northern Spain have been precisely dated for the first time .

A revolutionary renewable power scheme dubbed 'Poopy Power' could provide cheap heat for Britain, it emerged today. Britain's first commercial-scale venture . to convert canine excrement into bio-gas that can be used to power a turbine is set be unveiled after  three years of development work. Flintshire-based firm Streetkleen is the brainchild of Gary Downie, a former Manhatten banker now living in Cheshire, who has persuaded an unnamed English local authority to get involved. Creating a stink: How former banker Gary Downie's revolutionary dog waste system works . The system converts canine excrement left in bins into bio-gas that can be used to power a turbine (file picture) The council is in final negotiations to adopt the revolutionary Streetkleen Bio system which could be rolled out as soon as July. Councils spend £72.5million a year sending Britain's annual mountain of 700,000 tonnes of dog waste to landfill sites. In London, borough councils spend £9.5million annually on sending waste from the capital's 800,000 dogs to landfill. But under the proposed green energy scheme some of that will be sent to digesters capable turning the waste into methane, CO2 and fertiliser. Gary Downie, who came up with the idea, aims to collect four tons a day of waste, which will be broken down by microorganisms and turned into power . Mr Downie, 42, designed the self-contained system capable of powering up to 60 homes at a time. Despite using animal faeces, Mr Downie insists it is odour free and can operate on as little as . 500kg of waste a day, generating . 200,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a year. He said every tonne of excrement kept out of . landfill will displace 450kg of greenhouse gases. He expects to make money by charging a fee to process the waste, along with income from National Grid feed-in tariffs for its . electricity. Mr Downie told MailOnline: 'People already understand the ideas behind this and why it is necessary to do it so it is an easy step. Mr Downie added: 'There has been a lot of interest and we're talking to councils now in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.' Mr Downie, who spent a decade working for Investec on the oil and gas markets, came up with the idea when he became fed up of pushing his baby's pushchair along streets and parks covered in dog mess. His system uses anaerobic digestion - using micro-organisms to break down organic material in the absence of oxygen - to produce a mixture of methane and CO2. The system will remove the waste from plastic bags used to pick it up using an automated system and then pass it through to a digester tank. The bio-gas will then be used to power a turbine generating electricity, while the heat and CO2 will be fed into an adjoining commercial greenhouse to grow plants with the help of a pasteurised bio-fertiliser resulting from the remains of the waste. Mr Downie added: 'We're going to grow Christmas trees, which can be donated to schools each year and then returned to the greenhouse so they can grow up with the child.'","The green power system is already being dubbed 'Poopy Power'

Erica DePalo, from Montclair, New Jersey, has been sentenced to a three-year suspended sentence, meaning she will not serve jail time but will be registered as a sex offender. The former Essex County Teacher of the Year pleaded guilty in February and agreed today to never seek public or government employment again, nor have any contact with her victim.

DePalo had previously been prescribed anti-depressants, which Alfano said should not have been given to a bi-polar sufferer. 'She thought she was too good, that she could do anything', he said. During her sentencing, the former . teacher said: 'I feel nothing but remorse for my actions and deep, deep . sadness for all I've lost because of them.' DePalo was initially charged last August, with aggravated sexual assault and a second count of sexual assault since the student was 15 and could not consent. Those charges were dropped as part of the plea deal. She could have faced up to 10 years in prison if convicted on all initial charges. She told Judge Peter Ryan in February that on June 27, 2012 she had sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old boy, who was also her student, who had came to her apartment after school. Assistant Prosecutor Tony Gutierrez said in February that he had spoken with the boy's father and the family was happy with the initial plea deal.

Being overweight and drinking alcohol dramatically increases the risk of developing fatty liver disease, according to a study presented at the International Liver Congress. A study of over 100,000 British women found that being overweight and drinking alcohol regularly increased the chances of suffering and dying of the disease threefold. Dr Daniele Prati, of the  European Association for the Study of the Liver Committee, said: ‘It's well known that alcohol and a person's weight are major causes of chronic liver disease,but there has been a need for a large population study to compare these factors' influences on each other. Cut back on wine and sweet treats: Being overweight and drinking alcohol significantly increases risk of deadly liver disease . ‘Interestingly, the research found the combination of a woman's drinking habits and weight has an important effect on liver health and life expectancy.’ The study, conducted by Dr Paul Trembling and Professor William Rosenberg at the UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, analysed 107,000 women. All participants were classed as having a low or high BMI and a low or high alcohol intake ranging zero and 15 units a week. One unit is about one 25ml single measure of whisky or half a standard glass of wine. BMI helps gauge whether a person is under or overweight. People who have a BMI of 25 or over are classed as overweight. The study found that compared to a thin woman who did not drink,  drinkers were at 1.8 times the risk of developing the disease. Overindulging in sweet treats and alcohol is fuelling rise in liver disease . Those who did not drink but were overweight had 1.7 times the risk of the disease. But those who did both were at three times at risk of fatty liver disease. Dr Prati explained: ‘These findings will have a significant impact on how we can help millions of people across the world at risk of developing liver disease. Liver disease is now the fifth . biggest killer in the UK with the number of people dying from it rising . by 20 per cent over the past decade. However, there are often no warning . signs until it is far advanced, so many people could have the potentially . fatal condition without even realising it. Women are at particular risk as they are twice as sensitive as men to alcohol related liver damage and developing a more severe form of the disease. The UK government advises  not to regularly drink more than the daily unit guidelines of 3 to 4 units of alcohol for men and 2 to3 units of alcohol for women, where 'regularly' means drinking every day or most days of the week.","UK study confirms the dangerous link between drinking alcohol, being overweight and liver disease .

The reputation of the City of London was dealt another blow last night after a probe was launched into the deal which kept Barclays afloat at the peak of the financial crisis. The beleaguered bank – which is still without a chief executive following the exit of disgraced boss Bob Diamond – revealed that the Serious Fraud Office is investigating a cash injection by Qatar. It follows a summer of shame for Britain’s leading banks including Barclays, HSBC, Standard Chartered and taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland. Scrutinised: Funds raised by Barclays in 2008 in order to save the bank is now under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office . Barclays is one of a number of global banks under investigation over the rigging of the crucial Libor interest rate which sets borrowing costs around the world. The rate fixing scandal led to resignation of former chief executive Bob Diamond, chairman Marcus Agius and chief operating officer Jerry del Missier. It also cost the bank £290m in fines and it faces lawsuits from investors across the globe which could run into the billions. Barclays is now under fire over a contentious fundraising in 2008 when the bank secured £4.5bn from the Qatar. Later that year, it raised another £7.1bn from Qatar, Abu Dhabi and other shareholders. Troubled times: The investigation is another hard blow to London's financial centre in the City of London . At the time, it was feared that Barclays would be the next bank to fall following the government rescues of Northern Rock, RBS and Lloyds Banking Group, owner of crippled HBOS. ‘Barclays confirms that the Serious Fraud Office has commenced an investigation into payments under certain commercial agreements between Barclays and Qatar Holding,’ the bank said in a statement last night. No leader: Barclays has yet to replace Bob Diamond as chief executive . The SFO is understood to be looking at whether disclosure of payments to advisers was sufficient when it raised the money. It is yet another blow to London as a pre-eminent financial centre as American regulators pore over reports into HSBC over money laundering in the Middle East and Mexico. Standard Chartered, having settled to the tune of £217m with regulators in New York over money laundering in Iran, still faces investigations by other American authorities. Royal Bank of Scotland, like Barclays, is also in the firing line over its involvement in the Libor-fixing scandal which is thought to involve more than a dozen global banks. Britsih bankers have sought to portray the clampdown by American regulators as a form of financial protectionism. However, the disclosure the Barclays is under investigation in the UK for its fund raising activities shows that there are serious concerns about the culture of British banks on both sides of Atlantic. Boss: Antony Jenkins, who has been on the executive committee since 2009, will be paid £1.1 million a year in the role . Under-fire banking giant Barclays today named its retail and business banking boss Antony Jenkins as chief executive. Mr Jenkins takes on the post with immediate effect and succeeds former chief executive Bob Diamond, who quit in the wake of its interbank rate rigging scandal. Mr Jenkins, who has been on the executive committee since 2009, will be paid £1.1 million a year in the role, with a package including potential annual bonuses of up to 250 per cent of salary and long term incentive shares worth a possible £4.4 million each year. He will be joined at the top in November by incoming chairman Sir David Walker, who takes over from Marcus Agius, who announced his intention to resign after the Libor rigging furore. Their appointments end a period of uncertainty over the group's leadership at a crucial time for the bank. Oxford University graduate Mr Jenkins, who started his career at the bank before moving to Citi in 1989, said he would seek to repair the bank's tarnished image as a top priority. He said: 'We have made serious mistakes in recent years and clearly failed to keep pace with our stakeholders' expectations.' The bank has been searching for a new chief executive since Mr Diamond resigned in early July amid the furore following its £290 million settlement with UK and US authorities for attempting to manipulate the Libor rate at the height of the financial crisis.","Barclays secured £4.5bn from Qatar in 2008 .

A nine-year-old girl was diagnosed with a brain tumour after her family noticed she had started singing out of tune. Eloise Mills was saved by her own voice after her grandparents took her to the doctor to find out why she could no longer sing, walk in a straight line or ride her bike. A brain scan revealed a tumour the size of a walnut, surrounded by a cyst the size of an orange. Bright note: Eloise, pictured with grandparents and guardians Cheryl and Steve Mills, is back behind the piano after a tumour and a cyst the size of an orange was removed from her brain . The Nottingham schoolgirl had been suffering from constant headaches for years but it was not until she became tone deaf and lost her balance that her family became convinced something was seriously wrong. ‘You could say her bad singing saved her life,’ her grandmother Cheryl Mills, 57, said today. Eloise was diagnosed with pilocytic astrocytoma - a type of brain tumour which releases fluids, creating a cyst around it. She underwent a three-hour operation to remove the benign tumour at Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham in August last year. Now, after making a remarkably speedy recovery, Eloise is back behind the piano at her grandparents’ home in Ruddington, Nottingham. Bright note: Eloise, pictured with grandparents and guardians Cheryl and Steve Mills, is back behind the piano after a tumour and a cyst the size of an orange was removed from her brain . The schoolgirl now belts out her favourite Adele songs, hitting every note, and even performs in her school assemblies. Grandmother Cheryl, who is the nine-year-old’s guardian, said: ‘Eloise used to have a beautiful voice when she was little but gradually it got worse and worse. ‘We just thought she was tone deaf but when she started walking in wobbly lines we knew something must be wrong. ‘We're actually very thankful she did sing so much because it was the dramatic change in her singing which got us thinking something was wrong with her.’ Specialist Donald Macarthur, who performed the surgery, said although it was risky surgery which could have been fatal or left Eloise in a coma, it was deemed a risk worth taking as she was struggling to walk. Brain tumour: A scan photograph show the tumour and tumour cyst that was effecting Eloise . Mr Macarthur said: ‘Often, patients . with conditions like this have headaches, which can have them feeling . sick. We did the scan and decided we needed to do the operation. ‘We told the family there were risks, as there are with most operations.' Mrs Mils added: ‘It was terrifying, although I think in my heart I had already guessed. ‘It had been going on for such a long time - we kept thinking it was bad. She couldn't even ride her bike.' Eloise, an only child, suffered from headaches for four years, before she was finally diagnosed last year. The tumour was located at the base of her skull - making it difficult to detect. Remarkably, Eloise only spent a few weeks in hospital after the operation and has been back in school since October. She said: ‘I'm glad it's all over and really pleased. ‘The nurses at the hospital were so kind. I am just glad I can do my favourite things again like singing.’","Eloise Mills, nine, had a walnut-sized tumour inside a cyst in her brain .

These amazing photographs show the heartbreaking plight of India's widows, who are often ostracised from society after the death of their husbands. Elderly women face living on their own or in decrepit ghetto areas, and are prevented from participating in religious festivals and other important communal events. But a new charity initiative aims to re-integrate the widows into the community by providing them with a regular income and allowing them to mix with their neighbours. Widow: An elderly woman living in an ashram in Varanasi looks out of her door; campaigners are trying to raise the status of women who have lost their husbands . Squalid: A widow rests on her bed in her cramped living quarters in Varanasi, where thousands of women flock to beg from passing pilgrims . Abandoned: A Nepalese woman who has been thrown out of her family home and now lives in the sacred site of Varanasi . The women pictured here are from the northern town of Varanasi, the holiest site for Hindus where millions travel on pilgrimage to bathe in the Ganges. Widows are often considered to be cursed, meaning they are thrown out by their families for fear of spreading their bad luck. Many go to live in Varanasi or Vrindavan, another holy city, where they earn a living by begging and are paid pennies to recite prayers in Hindu temples. Community: But the widows are ostracised from mainstream society and not allowed to take part in religious festivals . Sleeping rough: Many widows are unable to support themselves and rely on the goodwill of pilgrims for their basic needs . Devotion: A widow reads sacred texts in a room in an ashram decorated with images from Hindu mythology . Alone: India's widows are considered to be cursed after their husbands die and are often shunned by other members of the community . They are not normally allowed to bathe in the sacred river alongside pilgrims, and are banned from participating in celebrations such as Holi, the annual festival of colour. Now Bindeshwar Pathak, chairman of charity Sulabh International, is spearheading a scheme to raise the status of widows. He has invited 150 of them from Varanasi to start participating fully in the religious life of the city in an effort to end the stigma against them. Despair: A widow fans herself in her small room; around three per cent of women are believed to be widows . Hard at work: An elderly woman cleans rice in front of her tiny home in Varanasi, considered the most sacred city in Hinduism . Laundry: A widow dries her clothes in the ashram where she lives, as other women look on in the background . Steep climb: An elderly widow mounts the stairs up to her room in the Varanasi ashram . The charity will also hand out an income of 2,000 rupees (£24) per month for each woman to ensure they can pay for basic needs such as food, clothing and healthcare. Mr Pathak has also called on the country's parliament to pass a new law ensuring the widows' welfare by paying them a basic salary from state funds. Around three per cent of Indian women are said to be widows, and more than half of them have no source of income. Prayer: Many widows are too old to look after themselves independently but do not receive sufficient support from the Indian state . Help: Bindeshwar Pathak, right, is providing 150 widows with a monthly income of 2,000 rupees (£24) through his charity Sulabh International . Gathering: Dozens of widows attended a function organised by Sulabh International on the banks of the Ganges yesterday .","Amazing photos show how thousands of women travel to holy city of Varanasi to beg for money from pilgrims .

A 15-year-old high school student has become the second boy to die after playing the 'choking game' in a small Colorado town in two years. Sean Hill, a ninth-grader at Discovery Canyon High School in Colorado Springs, died in his home on Friday - nearly 21 months after 12-year-old Gian-Luc Jordan passed away after playing the game. During the 'choking game' children temporarily asphyxiate themselves - either with the help of friends or by momentarily hanging themselves - to the point of passing out to achieve a brief high. Tragedy: Sean Hill, left, died after playing the 'choking game', in which children momentarily asphyxiate themselves for a high. It comes two years after Gian-Luc Jordan, right, also died from the game . But the Centers for Disease Control and . Prevention said children do not realize the deadly dangers of hanging or strangulation, and many of the game's victims die while playing it alone. The school district released a statement on Monday on behalf of Sean's parents, who decided to share the cause of his death in order to warn others of the game's dangers. 'Sean died accidentally while . experimenting with what's commonly referred to as the ""choking game"",' it read, asking parents and students to 'please . make safe decisions'. 'He enjoyed Tae Kwon Do, debate, theater [and] piano,' Sean's obituary reads. 'He was a mentor to younger kids and active in many school activities. He was a loving son, brother, grandson and friend.' Loss: Gian-Luc, pictured with his siblings, was found unconscious in his room in August 2011 and later died . Warning: His mother, Petra Verhoeven-Jordan, now works to raise awareness of the dangerous game . During the 'choking game', children temporarily asphyxiate . themselves - either with the help of friends or by hanging . themselves - to the point of passing out to achieve a brief high. The game is also known as space . monkey, pass-out game, airplaning, flat lining, purple hazing, cloud nine and many . other names. The CDC said that 87 per cent of the victims . are boys, and nearly all were playing alone. Most of the deaths occur between 11 and 16. The CDC advises parents to look for . warning signs that children might be playing the game, such as marks on . their neck, bloodshot eyes disorientation after being alone, and noticing ties or belts tied around doorknobs or furniture. Gian-Luc Jordan's family has created the website www.lucastrong.com to educate children and their families about the game. Gian-Luc, a seventh-grader, died in August 2011 after he was found hanging from his bunk bed. His father found him unconscious when he went to get him for a soccer game. The boy, who was an honor roll student and a popular school athlete, suffered brain damage and never regained consciousness. Now his family is trying to raise awareness of the deadly game. Speaking to News 5, Gian-Luc's mother Petra Verhoeven-Jordan warned of the dangers of the game and the pain it can inflict on a family. 'Your family will never be the same, there's a person missing no matter what,' she said. 'It's unimaginable because two children within two years in this community dying of the same cause that is so avoidable.' District spokeswoman Nanette Anderson told The Colorado Springs Gazette that crisis counselors were at Discovery Canyon on Monday to talk with children, and many opted for further counseling on Tuesday. Advice: Staff at Discovery Canyon High School, where Sean was a student, said they regularly addressed risky behaviors such as drugs, alcohol and the choking game with its students . She added that after Gian-Luc's death, the school had spoken to children and parents about 'risky behaviors', touching on the choking game as well as drug and alcohol consumption. The issues are addressed at least once or twice throughout the district, with individual schools talking to their students about them much more frequently, she said. A graveside service at Monument Cemetery and a later reception were held on Tuesday to remember Sean, who is survived by his parents and sister, Bridgit.","Sean Hill, 15, died accidentally in his home near Colorado Springs .

A 22-year-old climber fell over 300 feet to his death yesterday while scaling a ridge on Britain's highest mountain. Ben St Jospeh, from Essex, was climbing Tower Ridge on Ben Nevis when he fell into the gully below. Two fellow climbers saw the man fall at 11am and Lochaber Mountain Rescue were called out and a Royal Navy helicopter from Prestwick was also dispatched. The climber was scaling Tower Ridge, pictured from the summit of Ben Nevis, when he fell into the gully below . The man, who is in his 20s or early 30s, was about 2,800 feet up the 4,409 feet mountain when he dropped. John Stevenson, team leader of .

The ridge, which is popular with climbers, is almost 3,000 feet long and has almost 2,000 feet of ascent. Tower Ridge is one of several rocky ridges protruding north west from the summit plateau. His death came just one week after four climbers were killed in an avalanche in Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands.

The entire U.S. fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners have been temporarily grounded after a second battery failure caused one of the massive aircrafts to make an emergency landing in Japan. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Wednesday it would temporarily ground the fleet until airlines could demonstrate that the lithium ion batteries involved were safe. However, the FAA's emergency order affects only United Airlines, the lone U.S. carrier to operate 787s; in all, it has six Dreamliners. Boeing said in a statement it was confident the 787 was safe and that it stood by the plane's integrity. Banned: All U.S. Boeing 787s are temporarily banned after a Nippon Airways Dreamliner was forced to make an emergency landing, the second in a week . So long: Grounds crew wave at an ANA Dreamliner on the 11th; the FAA said on Wednesday it would temporarily ground Boeing after its repeated battery failures . Emergency: An All Nippon Airways Boeing 787 Dreamliner is seen after making an emergency landing at Takamatsu airport in western Japan January 16 . The FAA decision was another setback for a plane that was supposed to establish a new standard for jet travel but has instead been beset by one mishap after another. The latest trouble arose when pilots for Japan's All Nippon Airways smelled something burning and received a cockpit warning of battery problems on a flight from Yamaguchi Ube airport in western Japan to Tokyo. They made an emergency landing Wednesday at Takamatsu airport in western Japan, and passengers had to evacuate using inflatable slides. An inspection found that a flammable liquid had leaked from the main lithium-ion battery below and slightly behind the cockpit. Investigators found burn marks around the damage. Japan's Kyodo News agency quoted a transport ministry investigator as saying that the liquid leaked through the electrical room floor to the outside of the aircraft. The transport ministry said the leak could have led to an accident. That problem followed a January 7 battery fire aboard a Japan Airlines plane parked at Boston's Logan Airport. Both incidents involved the same type of battery, raising worries that the jet's electrical problems could be more dangerous than previously thought. Aviation authorities in other countries usually follow the lead of the country where the manufacturer is based. Burnt: The burned auxiliary power unit battery from a JAL Boeing 787 that caught fire on January 7 at Boston's Logan International Airport . Celebrated: The Dreamliner was celebrated in Long Beach, California in March; each plane costs more than $200million . Behemoth: The Dreamliner seats 210 to 330 passengers, depending on variant. Boeing states that it is the company's most fuel-efficient airliner . Boeing said in a statement that it is working 'around the clock' with its customers and investigative authorities. Chief Executive Jim McNerney said that the company is 'committed to supporting the FAA and finding answers as quickly as possible.' The 787, which has a list price of $207 million, represents a leap in the way planes are designed and built, but the project has been plagued by cost overruns and years of delays. Some have suggested Boeing's rush to get planes built after those delays resulted in the recent problems, a charge the company denies. According to flight tracking website FlightAware, some seven Dreamliners were in the air Wednesday night as the FAA order came down, including a United Airlines flight that left Los Angeles for Houston just a few minutes before the order. United said the planes already in the air would land as scheduled and that it would immediately comply with the FAA order. The use of new battery technology is among the cost-saving features of the 787, which Boeing says burns 20 percent less fuel than rival jetliners using older technology. Crux of the problem: There is significant concern over the plane's lithium ion batteries . Optional: Chile-based LAN said it will temporarily ground its three Boeing 787 Dreamliners following the safety warning . Cancelled: A TV monitor shows the cancelled status of the LOT Polish Airlines flight 004 to Warsaw, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner at the O'Hare International Airport in Chicago . Lithium-ion batteries can catch fire if they are overcharged and, once alight, they are difficult to put out as the chemicals produce oxygen, Boeing's chief engineer for the 787, Mike Sinnett, told reporters last week. QATAR AIRWAYS uses its five Dreamliners for services to London, Munich, Zurich and Frankfurt.AIR INDIA has six Dreamliners which it uses on domestic routes as well international services from India to Dubai, Frankfurt and Paris . ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES operates four Dreamliners on flights from to Johannesburg, Washington D.C., Toronto, Frankfurt, Beijing, Lusaka and Harare . LOT POLISH AIRLINES has two Dreamliners used on flights between Warsaw and London Heathrow and Warsaw and Vienna . ALL NIPPON AIRLINES had been operating 17 Dreamliners on domestic routes as well as international flights including a service from Tokyo to San Jose in the U.S. JAPAN AIRLINES has seven Dreamliners which had been used on services between Haneda and Singapore, Narita and Boston, and Narita and Singapore . UNITED AIRLINES has six Dreamliners operating on domestic services mainly from their Houston hub to destinations such as San Fransisco, Chicago, Newark, Cleveland and Washington Dulles. An international service between Houston and Amsterdam was scheduled to begin on December 4. Services between L.A. and Tokyo, Houston and Lagos, Nigeria were expected to begin early this year . He said lithium-ion was not the only battery choice, but 'it was the right choice'. In Asia, only the Japanese and Air India have the Dreamliner in service, but other airlines are among those globally to have ordered around 850 of the new aircraft. Boeing has said it will at least break even on the cost of building the 1,100 new 787s it expects to deliver over the next decade. Some analysts, however, say Boeing may never make money from the aircraft, given its enormous development cost. Any additional cost from fixing problems discovered by the string of recent incidents would affect those forecasts and could hit Boeing's bottom line more quickly if it has to stop delivering planes, analysts said. In the latest incident, All Nippon Airways Co Ltd said instruments aboard a domestic flight indicated a battery error, triggering emergency warnings. The incident was described by a transport ministry official as 'highly serious' - language used in international safety circles as indicating there could have been an accident. That led ANA and Japan Airlines Co Ltd to ground their 24 Dreamliners pending checks. Japanese transportation officials said they could not immediately comment on the FAA decision, as did a spokesman for JAL. An ANA spokeswoman said the FAA's order meant the airline could not use its 787s on its U.S. routes. Idle: A Boeing 787 sits parked at Boeing Field at far right and in view of Mount Rainier and smaller planes landing Wednesday in Seattle . Review: Boeing will work with the FAA to discern the root of the problem with the massive aircraft . But barring a prolonged grounding or a severe and uncontained crisis, aircraft industry sources say there is no immediate threat of cancellations for the plane, even after the FAA's decision to halt 787 flights. Among other reasons, they cite the heavy costs of retraining and investing in new infrastructure, as well as a shortage of alternatives in an industry dominated by just two large jet suppliers. The Dreamliner's problems could sharpen competition between Boeing and its European rival Airbus, which itself experienced a dip in sales for its A380 superjumbo following problems with wing cracks a year ago. The A380 crisis has since eased and most airlines report the aircraft are flying full.","Federal Aviation Administration grounds all U.S. Boeing 787s temporarily after two emergency landings this month .

Former Archbishop Desmond Tutu's non-surgical treatment is expected to take five days - and the campaigner is said to be 'good spirits' It added the non-surgical treatment is expected to take five days. Tutu was a vigorous campaigner against the system of white racist rule known as apartheid, which ended when democratic elections were held in 1994. The Nobel Pirze winner is going to a Cape Town hospital for the procedure . The Nobel Prize Winner was also the first black South African Archbishop of Cape Town, South Africa and primate of the Anglican Church of South Africa. He became a prominent leader, crusading for justice and racial conciliation in South Africa. In 1984 he received a Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his contributions to that cause. His hospitalisation comes weeks after Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first black president, was taken into hospital. The Nobel Peace Prize winner has not been seen in public since 2010 and in April was discharged from hospital following a nine-day stay for treatment of pneumonia. It was the third hospital visit for the former anti-apartheid leader since December when he underwent treatment for gallstones and a lung infection. He is currently receiving medical care at his Johannesburg home. Mr Mandela became South Africa's first black president in 1994 after elections were held, bringing an end to the system of white racist rule known as apartheid. Following his release from prison in 1990, he was widely credited with averting even greater bloodshed by helping the country's transition to democratic rule. Following the elections in 1994, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was set up to bear witness to, record and in some cases, grant amnesty to perpetrators of crimes relating to human right violations. President Mandela asked the former archbishop to chair the TRC, which heard harrowing accounts of the struggle for liberation. He retired from the Church in 1996 to focus solely on the TRC, and was later named Archbishop Emeritus. In 1997 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and underwent successful treatment in the US.","Nobel Prize winner in 'good spirits' before going to Cape Town hospital .

London fared worst in 2011, with 1,084 shops shutting and just 983 opening, according to a study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and the Local Data Company last year. Yorkshire and Humberside, North East and South West England, eastern England and Scotland also suffered.

Julian Fellowes' drama Titanic and the hit show Birdsong are both recent productions made overseas rather than in Britain. But a new tax relief which comes into effect this week aims to encourage high-end TV series and animation to be made in the UK instead.

Speaking at Ealing Studios, the Mayor of London said: 'We are at the dawn of a new golden age of TV production in London. 'We want to make sure . we're not losing money to places like Hungary or Ireland where they are . making TV shows that could well be shot in London. 'We . have an unprecedented opportunity to grow this exciting sector to . deliver jobs, produce more world-class British drama and, above all, . make London the city of choice for TV and animation production. 'It’s time for London to fulfil its . potential as the world leader and employer it’s destined to be in this . field. Let’s make sure that all future Downtons are filmed on our turf.'

Julian Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey (above), said: 'It is encouraging to feel that the tremendous, worldwide success of British high-end television is at last receiving some recognition and help' Already enjoying tax relief for film, London is now the third busiest city in the world for film-making after LA and New York. Film London, already working to facilitate major motion pictures shot in the capital, generated £770million in investment over the last four years alone and hopes are running high for the agency’s expansion into high-end TV, such as dramas, mini-series, franchise shows, international co-productions and animations. Last year, Wallace and Gromit-creator Aardman Animations warned they would have to move production overseas because they could no longer compete in Britain. The agency has been working with the Mayor since 2003 to deliver production opportunities and has the unique skills and expertise to help TV companies – many small businesses – who lack experience working with tax relief or securing inward investment. Andy Serkis and Jonathan Cavendish, founders of The Imaginarium said: 'For us, basing the Imaginarium in London is crucial. We have set up Europe's leading Performance Capture studio here because of access to the best creative people and the most interesting clients, partners and co-venturers in the field of next generation story-telling. 'The introduction of tax relief beyond film to animation, games and television is very important to our business, and helps us in setting up our Academy to train young people into the digital future.' David Parfitt, Chairman of Film London said: 'With these new opportunities in the television, animation and games industries, we can cement London's reputation as the greatest city in the world for all visual arts.' James Spring, CEO Managing Director of Film and Television at Ealing Studios said: 'Ealing Studios are delighted that the government is continuing its support for the creative industries. 'The extension of the tax credit system for high-end TV has already led to increased activity from foreign productions as well as UK originated television.

Standing at 6ft 2in and weighing in at a ground-shaking 18 stone, bare-knuckle bruiser Benjamin Caunt was known as 'Big Ben'. Such was his prowess that fighter after fighter put up to challenge him in the 1830s and 40s was beaten. But it wasn't just pugilists who suffered at the hands of the London champion... pigeons did too. A firearm that 'Big Ben' Caunt used to shoot the live birds from the air for sport is due to go under the hammer. This 19th century six-bore double barrelled sporting gun belonged to bare-knuckle boxer Benjamin 'Big Ben' Caunt. It is thought to have been used by him in live pigeon matches, a forerunner to clay pigeon shooting. A silver plaque on it is engraved with the words 'Benjamin Caunt, Champion of England' Bruiser Benjamin Caunt stood 6ft 2in, weighed in at 18 stone, and was such a formidable opponent that fighter after fighter put up to challenge him in the 1830s and 40s was beaten . It is even said that Big Ben, the bell in the Houses of Parliament clock tower, was named after him, as he was a favourite with MPs who would go and see him fight. Now, a North Yorkshire collector is putting his gun up for auction and it is expected to fetch between £5,000 and £7,000. Nick Holt, of Holt's Auctioneers which is selling the piece, said: 'Benjamin Caunt was a Londoner and he was 6ft 2in and 18 stone. 'As you can imagine, he was an absolute giant.

It is expected to fetch between £5,000 and £7,000 . Big Ben is the name of the Great Bell of the famous clock tower at the palace of Westminster in London, which was designed by architect Charles Barry. The bell was hoisted into place in 1858. Over the years, the source of the nickname has been widely debated with one theory being that it was named after the bare-knuckle champion. There is another school of thought that holds it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, the overweight commissioner of works who supervised the installation of the bell. An MP is said to have shouted: 'Why not call it Big Ben?' during a parliamentary debate but his thoughts have not been officially recorded. To mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, the clock tower was officially named Elizabeth Tower. 'His nickname was ""Big Ben"" and it's thought [the bell] Big Ben was named after him. 'This was a special gun because it was owned and used by him.' The piece going to auction is a mid-19th century six-bore double-barrelled percussion sporting gun, and is thought to have been used by him in live pigeon matches, a forerunner to clay pigeon shooting. A silver plaque on it is engraved with the words 'Benjamin Caunt, Champion of England'. Before the introduction of Marquis of Queensberry Rules in 1867, fights could last for more that two hours - with rounds lasting as long as the opponents were able to stay on their feet. 'Big Ben' was heavyweight champion of England from 1838 and 1845, though he lost his title briefly in 1841 to Nick Ward but won it back the same year. The fighter won his title in 1838 from William 'Bendigo' Thompson in a contest lasting more than 70 rounds. In 1845, he relinquished his title to Thompson after a 96-round fight with a controversial verdict given by the referee, when it was alleged that Caunt went down without a blow striking him. He denied this but announced his retirement, only to return for a final attempt at the heavyweight crown 12 years later. His final fight was declared a draw when, after 60 rounds, Caunt and his opponent were too exhausted to continue. Following his retirement from the ring, Caunt became a publican in London and also worked as a fight promoter. He died at the age of 46 in 1861, in London, reportedly from a cold caught at a live pigeon match and was buried in his home village of Hucknell, Nottinghamshire. The gun will be auctioned by Holt's in London on June 20.

Chasing suspected thieves through suburban back  gardens, the police dog was merciless when its prey came into sight. Unfortunately, instead of catching a criminal, the highly-trained canine sunk its powerful teeth into George the rabbit. The much-loved pet had no chance when the dog ‘simply acted on its natural instincts’. The 13-year-old rabbit was mauled and died moments later in the arms of his heartbroken owner Melissa Richardson, 20. Melissa Richardson is seen kissing her pet rabbit George just hours before the pet was killed by a bloodthirsty police dog that was chasing suspected thieves in the vicinity of the family home in York . After letting him out of his hutch to enjoy the fresh air, she had looked through the window to see the dog jump over the fence. ‘George was pottering around but the dog ran up to the hutch, where my three other rabbits were,’ she said. ‘It was barking like mad and scratching at the hutch trying to get at them. That was when it turned and saw George. ‘It ran up and started shaking him. I ran out shouting and that was when the handler jumped over the fence. He shouted at the dog to drop George but it wouldn’t. ‘It went on for about a minute but, at the time, it seemed like forever. I was screaming and sobbing but there was nothing I could do.’ Miss Richardson, a support worker from York, said George was ‘covered in blood’ when the dog eventually dropped him. ‘I picked him up and carried him inside and he died in my arms about a minute later,’ she added. ‘I was inconsolable. I’ve had George since I was seven and can’t put into words how I felt being  unable to protect him. The dog was clearly out of control and had run away from its handler. Miss Richardson hugs another of her pets after the incident. She said she turned down a police offer to buy her a replacement pet . ‘The men they were chasing hadn’t even been in our garden. ‘I don’t even want to think about what would have happened if there had been kids in the garden. ‘I’ve . been devastated. I haven’t been eating properly and had to leave work . early because I couldn’t stop crying. Not being able to give George a . cuddle has left me heartbroken.’ Officers from North Yorkshire Police consoled Miss Richardson and she also received a personal apology from Sergeant Simon Whitby, head of the dog section. He said: ‘We all feel terrible and  have apologised profusely for the distress this has caused. ‘The police dog simply acted on its natural instincts and grabbed hold of the rabbit.’ Miss Richardson, who buried George in the garden that evening, said she turned down a police offer to buy her a replacement pet. ‘Some people might think that it’s only a rabbit, but I’d had him for so long, he was like family,’ she said. ‘I’d give him cuddles and let him out so he could roam the  garden. I really miss him.’ Police said youths were seen  running into gardens on Tuesday around 6pm after power tools were stolen from a car. Two 18-year-olds were arrested that evening and released on bail pending further inquiries. A 19-year-old arrested the next day remains in police custody.

A father-of-four who died while taking his disabled son for a birthday drive in a Lamborghini supercar on a runway might have lived if he had fastened his seatbelt, an inquest heard. Graham Padmore, 58, from Northenden, Greater Manchester, was celebrating the 21st birthday of his son Mark, who has cerebral palsy, when he ‘ran out of runway’ at Woodford Aerodrome near Stockport. Mr Padmore drove the £150,000 Lamborghini Gallardo convertible through two fences before landing upside-down in a farmyard. The inquest at Stockport Coroners' Court yesterday heard the car reached speeds of up to 110mph but had slowed to about 60mph before the crash. Graham Padmore and his disabled son Mark who were in a Lamborghini crash. Mr Padmore, 58, suffered serious head and chest injuries and later died in hospital . Mr Padmore was celebrating the 21st birthday of his son Mark, who has cerebral palsy, when he 'ran out of runway' at Woodford Aerodrome near Stockport, Greater Manchester. He drove it through two fences before it landed upside-down . Mr Padmore, who worked for the Co-operative bank, was hurled 30ft out of the car and suffered serious head and chest injuries in the crash last June. He was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital where he died four days later surrounded by his family. Mark suffered minor injuries. Coroner John Pollard, who recorded a verdict of accidental death due to multiple injuries, said: 'It’s possible this might not have been a fatal case had Mr Padmore been wearing a seatbelt.' Mr Padmore’s widow, Georgina, 55, told the inquest: 'Graham was a careful and considerate driver who would never have done anything to harm Mark. 'He was very cautious and he always wore his seatbelt. He was insistent that everybody else in the car should wear their seatbelts too. 'All I can think is he thought he was going to get out of the car again before he set off and forgot to put it on. 'He was a family man who loved and lived for his children and would do anything to keep them happy and cared for.' The inquest at Stockport Coroners' Court yesterday heard the car reached speeds of up to 110mph but had slowed to about 60mph before the crash . The inquest heard Mr Padmore and his son would often hire cars to celebrate birthdays. They hired the Lamborghini for three days from Alpha Drive Ltd and arranged with James Fletcher, PR consultant for Avro Heritage which operates the runway, to use it for a ‘one-off’ treat on June 25. Mr and Mrs Padmore, Mark and their two daughters travelled to the aerodrome, where the family gathered at a midway point to watch the pair drive past. Mrs Padmore said she saw her husband and son looking happy with the roof down as they made their way to the end of the runway before turning and passing them at about 100mph. Mr Fletcher recalled remarking on their speed as they passed. He said: 'I said he should have been braking at that point. I could tell he wasn’t because the brake lights weren’t on. 'There is a mirage effect on the runway and they kind of just disappeared. There was no screaming, no braking, nothing - we just didn’t know what had happened.' Mr Fletcher followed tyre tracks off the runway, over grass, through a concrete barrier and down a 20ft embankment, where he saw the car upside-down and Mr Padmore lying on his back, semi-conscious and trying to sit up. He phoned the security hut to get paramedics to the scene. Mr Padmore and his son hired the Lamborghini for three days and arranged with James Fletcher, PR consultant for Avro Heritage which operates the runway (above), to use it for a 'one-off' treat . He said: 'I was scared the car was going to explode. Mark was held in a cocoon-like state in the passenger seat. I was trying to reassure him as I helped him out.' PC Mark Dickman, a reconstruction officer, said the car was in good condition and there were no signs of emergency braking on the runway. He added: 'In a case like this where the driver is not used to the speed, they don’t know how long it takes to stop. You can become distracted and not realise how much runway is left.' Mr Fletcher said he had numerous previous requests to use the runway for drives but had always refused. Mr Pollard acknowledged the car was in good order and praised Mr Fletcher for assisting after the crash.","Graham Padmore was in car with son Mark, .

An Arab princess who said she has not received 'a penny' since divorcing her husband - a member of the Qatari royal family - last year is suing him for a £100million share of his oil fortune in the British courts. Meshkah Tawfik, 40, who married Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim Al Thani in 1991, said he had left her with so little money that she was forced to sell her £240,000 Rolls-Royce Ghost as she couldn't afford the £15,000 insurance. The couple, who both live in London, have two children - Prince Sultan, six, and Princess Sheikha, 13. Meshkah Tawfik, 40, who married Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim Al Thani in 1991, said he had left her with so little money that she was forced to sell her Rolls-Royce Ghost (similar to the one pictured) as she couldn't afford the £15,000 insurance . Tawfik said she cannot pay their school . fees, adding that her four staff - a chef, nanny, bodyguard and driver - . all work for free owing to her financial predicament, according to the . Sunday Times. The sheikh, 62, who was educated at Sandhurst and is said to be worth £800million, had married Tawfik in an Islamic ceremony in London. The former interior, . petroleum and finance minister obtained a divorce in Qatar, which she did not attend, after the couple become estranged several years ago. Tawfik's decision to settle their divorce in the UK is an example of 'forum shopping' - where the best legal jurisdiction is chosen to maximise the chance of a favourable outcome. The mother-of-two lives in an £8million townhouse in Bayswater which, despite its price tag, is in state of disrepair, with peeling paint and a rat-infested basement. 'I am suing him not for me but to get . maintenance for the children. As members of the royal family they should . not be living like this,' she told the paper. In 2010, the Al-Thani family purchased Harrods - and Tawfik illustrated her once lavish lifestyle by producing a statement of her daughter's credit card bill from the store. It showed that the 11-year-old had spent over £90,000 there in 2011. Sheikh Hamad is said to . own a portfolio of properties in Britain, the Middle East and US. His uncle Khalifa, once emir of Qatar, was deposed in a bloodless coup by his son in 1995. When Sheikh Hamad was found guilty of . staging an abortive coup a year later, he and Tawfik left the country. He was sentenced to death in his absence but this was revoked in 2006. Tawfik has retained the services of family lawyer Ayesha . Vardag. David Hodson, the sheikh's lawyer, told the Sunday Times: '[My client] believes their . family matters and the lives of their children are private.' The Shard, which is owned by the Qatar royal family . Last August, Qatar's wealth fund - run by the Al Thanis - spent nearly £1billion to buy into British airport owner BAA, stepping up a shopping spree that has seen it hoover up a raft of household names. Qatar Holdings paid £900million for 20 per cent of BAA, which runs Heathrow, Stansted, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton airports. The deal extended Qatar’s drive to invest in Britain, where the tiny Middle Eastern nation – smaller than Belgium – is estimated to have spent some £10billion of oil money already. UK assets include Harrods and 26 per cent of supermarket giant Sainsbury’s worth around £1.6billion. Qatar also owns Europe’s tallest skyscraper The Shard, from which members of its royal family can gaze upon the rest of their property portfolio. This includes vast swathes of Canary Wharf and the Olympic Village. No 1 Hyde Park, the world’s most expensive block of flats, completes a glittering array of property investments. Qatar can also lay claim to 20 per cent of two London markets at opposite ends of the scale. It owns a fifth of the moneyed London Stock Exchange at the heart of the Square Mile and the same stake in Camden Market, home of ageing punks and European tourists seeking bargain clothes.","Meshkah Tawfik, 40, married Sheikh Hamad bin Jasim Al Thani, a member of Qatari royal family, in 1991 .
