"Two blonde, blue-eyed girls taken from Roma couples. Authorities turn to DNA tests for answers. For a family in Ireland, it's proof the girl is indeed their biological daughter. For a girl in Greece, the mystery remains as to who she is and who her real parents are. In Dublin, a 7-year-old girl whom Irish police took from her parents, a Roma couple, two days ago was reunited with them. A DNA test confirmed she is their daughter, a source familiar with the case's legal proceedings told CNN on Wednesday. Police, acting on a tip, had removed the girl from her home on Monday and placed her in protective care. The girl and her parents live in the suburb of Tallaght. The parents told CNN they have a passport for the girl, but they do not call her by the name on the passport. The couple, who appeared to be very upset by the situation, also showed CNN photos of the girl. The parents appeared in family court earlier Wednesday, after which their attorney said the couple is going to take some time before considering their legal options, the British Press Association reported. ""Her parents greatly appreciate the help and assistance that they have been given by friends and relatives over the last few days,"" Waheed Mudah told the PA. ""They now intend to concentrate on looking after their family and, in particular, in trying to reassure their daughter that she will be in their care."" For parents of the missing, hoes hope spring eternal? Similar case in Greece . The situation echoes a case in Greece that has grabbed the attention of authorities and parents around the world. Greek authorities say a girl believed to be 5 to 6 years old may have been abducted by a Roma couple there. Authorities have charged the couple with abducting the child they call Maria. Medical tests showed she wasn't their daughter, authorities have said. That girl's DNA didn't match any profile in Interpol's database, the international law enforcement agency said Tuesday. Greece mystery girl: Interpol says no DNA match in its database . Interpol said Greek authorities have asked for its help in finding out Maria's identity. ""Until now, a comparison of the girl's profile against Interpol's global DNA database has not produced a match,"" Interpol said in a news release. Maria's photograph has been broadcast worldwide. Interpol said it would make the database available to authorities in countries where someone who claims to be a possible blood relative to the child has submitted a DNA profile. The agency has more than 600 missing people listed on its website, 32 of whom are 5 or 6 years old. A spokesman for a Greek children's charity said about 10 cases of missing children around the world are ""being taken very seriously"" in connection with Maria's case. ""They include children from the United States, Canada, Poland and France,"" said Panagiotis Pardalis of the Smile of the Child charity. The couple who had Maria until last week, Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, and Christos Salis, 39, appeared in court Monday. Both were remanded into custody pending trial. A lawyer for the couple says the pair adopted the child from her biological mother. The Smile of the Child said the girl, who was found Thursday in a Roma community near Larissa, in central Greece, is being cared for in a group home. Suspicions of false documents . Police have said they suspect records that the couple provided for Maria and for other children in their care may be false. In addition to the abduction charge, the couple is accused of falsifying official documents. Four authorities, including the head of the registry office that issued Maria's birth certificate, have been suspended while a police investigation is underway, the media office of the Athens municipality said Tuesday. The girl received the document this year, it said. It is unusual for a birth certificate to be issued years later. 1,000 years of Roma discrimination . Authorities asked questions about Maria because she has fair skin and blond hair, while the couple who said they were her parents have darker complexions typical of Roma, a people descended from Indian nomads, who face widespread discrimination in Europe. Their lawyers say they took Maria into their home after her biological mother, who they say was from Bulgaria, was unable to look after her. CNN's Karl Penhaul spoke with residents of the Roma community who backed that assertion. ""Maria used to play here with the other children and go to the store with her mum. Maria was not hidden away,"" Maria Kaleas said. ""The mother gave her away and Eleftheria was enchanted by Maria's beauty. She shared the food for her own children with Maria."" Could 'Maria' be an American girl? Thousands of calls poured into Greece after authorities released photos of the girl last week. Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, whose daughter Lisa Irwin was 11 months old when she vanished two years ago from their home in Kansas City, Missouri, asked the FBI to contact Greek authorities about the case. ""There is no such thing as a tip too small,"" said Bradley, whose hopes were raised despite the apparent disparity in age between their missing daughter and Maria. A federal law enforcement official said the FBI is working with Greek authorities to determine whether the girl could be Lisa Irwin. A top official with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children in Virginia said the center works with law enforcement groups to collect data, biometrics information and DNA that can be used to compare with samples from Maria. ""Frankly, right now ... it does not appear that this may be any of our children. But again we want to confirm one way or the other,"" said Robert Lowery, the senior executive director of the organization's missing children division. He added that a definitive comparison could be done ""rather quickly."" Prejudice against the Roma . Prejudice and discrimination against the Roma are widespread in Greece and elsewhere in Europe, Amnesty International says. Maria's case plays into old prejudices about them stealing children for forced labor. Pardalis mentioned such a possibility, saying, ""We don't have any other information if this girl was forced to work or to beg on streets."" The government news agency also raised ""the possibility of the existence of a ring bringing pregnant women to Greece from Bulgaria and then taking their children for sale."" The agency cited past reports that empty coffins had been found for infants who supposedly were stillborn to foreign mothers in Athens.

"The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to stop Texas from implementing a part of a new abortion law that requires doctors to get admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic where they're providing abortion services. A federal appeals court had reinstated the key part of the law, which is considered among the most restrictive in the country. Abortion-rights groups, which say more than a third of centers that had provided abortions in Texas have since stopped, then asked the Supreme Court to overturn the appeals court ruling. ""We may not vacate a stay entered by a court of appeals unless that court clearly and 'demonstrably' erred in its application of 'accepted standards,'"" Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in support of Tuesday's order. ""Reasonable minds can perhaps disagree about whether the Court of Appeals should have granted a stay in this case. But there is no doubt that the applicants have not carried their heavy burden of showing that doing so was a clear violation of accepted legal standards -- which do not include a special 'status quo' standard for laws affecting abortion,"" he wrote. Four justices -- Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- dissented. Justices dismiss state law restricting medical abortions . The original lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Austin by Planned Parenthood on behalf of more than a dozen women's health care providers across Texas, alleged the state's new abortion law violates the constitutional rights of women and puts unreasonable demands on doctors who perform abortions. The bill originally failed to gain approval because of a Democratic filibuster led by state Sen. Wendy Davis. Gov. Rick Perry then called the Legislature into a second special session to continue consideration of the bill. Davis, who is running for governor, blasted Tuesday's decision. ""Clinics will close and women's health will be hurt because of this law. This is an abuse of power by politicians in Austin. I trust women to make their own decisions and will continue to work to make sure that women and mothers are safe and have access to adequate health care,"" she said in a statement. Perry cheered the ruling. ""This is good news both for the unborn and for the women of Texas, who are now better protected from shoddy abortion providers operating in dangerous conditions. As always, Texas will continue doing everything we can to protect the culture of life in our state,"" he said.

"Grigny, France (CNN)Hatouma Diarra doesn't want to be judged by the clothes she wears, by the religion she follows or, least of all, by where she grew up. But Diarra, raised by immigrants from Mali in the Paris suburb of Viry-Chatillon, says it's as if her neighborhood is stamped across her forehead. ""It's hard to dream when everyone says the place you come from only spawns 'jihadists, terrorists and delinquents,'"" the 21-year-old says. ""You end up feeling completely isolated."" Viry-Chatillon is just one of the many banlieues -- heavily immigrant, working class suburbs -- dotted around the periphery of the French capital. But its close proximity to Grigny has made the neighborhood synonymous with violence and failure. Grigny is the hometown of Amedy Coulibaly, who killed a policewoman as well as four hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris two weeks ago. His associates Said and Cherif Kouachi slaughtered 12 more at the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Together they are the worst terror attacks in France in decades. Diarra's concerns were exacerbated this week when French Prime Minister Manuel Valls declared that there was a ""geographic, social and ethnic apartheid"" that had developed in France. She believes the use of provocative language only further alienates the people living in the banlieues. Diarra says that the past two weeks have attracted a relentless and unwelcome media spotlight on Viry-Chatillon, with journalists descending en masse and filming from their cars for fear of being assaulted or having their equipment stolen. The negative press has dredged up many prejudices and cultural stereotypes that Diarra has spent most of her young life fighting to dispel -- ever since the 2005 riots that left thousands of cars burnt in the Paris region, thousands arrested and millions more traumatized across France. ""Yes, we need better education and, yes, delinquency exists in these towns, but the government tarnishes us all with the same brush. You stop feeling like an individual and begin to think you're reduced to a crime-ridden town,"" Diarra says. Diarra believes the media perpetuates certain cliches about towns like hers -- especially the one about how banlieues are full of ""bad apples."" It's a sentiment shared by Coulibaly's sister, Maimouna Coulibaly -- now a successful dancer -- who reflected on the 2005 riots in a 2009 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle. ""When you are in the projects, they want you to shut your mouth, to stay here, to grow up complacent. For me, the way that people in the projects are portrayed so negatively in the media really hurt me a lot,"" Maimouna told the paper. But Phillippe Rio, the mayor of Grigny, is trying to shatter this image of banlieues as crime-wracked ghettos. Rio grew up in the concrete maze that is the Grande Borne -- the same housing project as Coulibaly. Rio says it's easy to overlook the success stories of the banlieues in favor of tales of homegrown terrorists, but that not everyone from his town is a criminal. ""Grigny was home to a professional football player, an actress, even a patisserie chef who now works in Hong Kong,"" he says. ""These are all very successful people."" In the same breath, the mayor admits that his town faces grave economic problems. Forty percent of Grande Borne residents aged 16-25 are unemployed. The average net annual income in Grigny is 9,600 euros, according to Rio -- the lowest in the Paris region. These factors make it very difficult for those who live in the area to feel like they're part of society, the mayor says. Rio has been waging a campaign to get a fully staffed police station for the town's 30,000 inhabitants. But the Interior Ministry has yet to grant his wish. The mayor also believes that better education will help bridge the gap between the banlieues and the state, the ""us and them"" mentality. Eric Betencourt, a schoolteacher in the eastern Parisian suburb of Clichy-Sous-Bois, has a class largely made up of second and third generation immigrant children. A man with a calm demeanor, he believes opening a dialogue with his students on the theme of identity in France is crucial to helping his students find their place within the state. His main worry is what happens when they leave school and begin job hunting. ""Because they struggle to find a job, they feel disinherited, stigmatized, and suddenly these young adults can't find their role in the workplace and therefore they create their own communities,"" he says. De-Charles Clauda Aka was Amedy Coulibaly's social worker. His small office in Grande Borne is littered with photos of smiling children that he has helped guide into adulthood. Aka believes one of the reasons Coulibaly might have formed a relationship with hardened criminals when he was in jail was because he didn't fit into life outside the prison walls, despite desperately wanting to be part of a community. ""[Coulibaly] had a big problem with identity, he was lost. And prison offered him some bad examples to follow,"" Aka says. Coulibaly's cousin Amad agrees. ""He befriended a bunch of idiots and became himself an idiot,"" Amad told French radio RMC. ""He did not hate Jews, Christians, it's the state he hated."" Connecting the disaffected youth to the state through job creation is what Majid El Jarroudi has dedicated the last 6 years to. The business he founded, the Agency for Diversity in Entrepreneurship, strives to ""reveal the untapped potential of doing business with undeserved entrepreneurs in marginalized neighborhoods."" El Jarroudi says the negative publicity surrounding the banlieues means companies shy away from recruiting there -- and in turn, this further antagonizes the people of these towns. ""We feel like we're alone, and when we talk about the banlieues we only talk about its problems and never about the opportunity the banlieues represent today,"" El Jarroudi says. ""That is crucial to bringing everyone together."" In the meantime, Hatouma Diarra is hoping opportunity will come knocking as she pursues an internship this summer. Her dream is a career in journalism, but she knows that ambition alone may not be enough. ""To have a future you need to believe in yourself, but you also need others to believe in you,"" she says.","Attacks on Charlie Hebdo magazine and Paris supermarket draw negative attention to city's suburbs .

"What was known as the nuclear option yesterday is known as the Reid Rule today. Time will only tell if the Reid Rule is productive or destructive. But we'll leave that to the historians. As for how it became the Reid rule, it took a coordinated and sustained effort from an unlikely place -- progressive activists on the blogosphere. After Sen. Ted Kennedy died in 2009, Democrats lost their supermajority in the Senate -- enough to overcome a Republican filibuster -- progressive bloggers felt compelled to act against what they called ""Republican obstructionism."" The Senate, still with a huge majority of 59 Democrats, coupled with a Democratic majority in the House, struggled to pass legislation. The power of the Republican minority was outsized, filibuster opponents say. And filibuster reform became their mission. Daily Kos blogger David Waldman started to drum up support online. ""I knew that this would be an issue because I had seen mounting threats of obstructionism on the Republican side,"" Waldman told CNN. 5 ways life changes in the Senate after nuclear option . He wrote extensively about filibuster reform in 2005, another time when the Senate was mired in partisan gridlock. At that time it was over President George W. Bush's judicial nominees and Democrats were in the minority. Republicans threatened the nuclear option then, but never acted. Eventually, the bipartisan ""Gang of 14"" senators cut a deal that calmed things down. In the Obama era, Waldman argued that the use of the filibuster grew out of control. After blogging about the ability of the Republican minority to block legislation and presidential nominations, Waldman knew grassroots activists could only do so much. While they could engage fellow activists, he wasn't so sure he could convince senators, especially the veterans steeped in Senate tradition and reluctant to change the ways of the past, that change was possible. There was precedent . But Waldman knew that things could change. As draconian as the Senate could be, he knew the Senate had changed in the past. Senate historian Donald Ritchie believes that although the first filibuster took place in the very first Congress, the word filibuster was not used until the 1850s. At that time, there was no way to stop a rogue senator from holding up business until 1917 when senators voted to change the rules to allow a cloture vote, which enabled 67 senators to defeat the stalling tactic. What is the nuclear option? The filibuster was famously used to block two different versions of the Civil Rights Act. Former Sen. Strom Thurmond's successful 24-hour talkathon helped to kill civil rights legislation in 1957. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-West Virginia, tried the same tactic in 1964. His 14-hour filibuster was part of a 57-day-long stalling effort that, ultimately, was not effective in killing the legislation. The next major change to the filibuster came in 1975, when the threshold to stop a filibuster was lowered from 67 lawmakers to 60. Growing support . Waldman and his co-conspirators formed a strategy referred to as an inside-outside coalition. The outside consisted of the grassroots, charged with motivating progressives to sign petitions and call their senators. The inside, Waldman said, needed to sway senators. It would need to consist of people senators knew and trusted. He had to convince a diverse group of advocates that climate change, immigration, the judiciary, and the economy all had one thing in common: The filibuster blocked their legislative goals. ""Getting them to recognize outside their issue silo there's this one issue frustrating all of you"" was key to success, Waldman said. That's when Fix the Senate Coalition formed. The Sierra Club joined on. So did the NAACP and the Communications Workers of America, just to name a few. CWA President Larry Cohen said it was clear something needed to be done. For instance, Obama did an end run around Republican opposition to the appointment of Ricard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A circuit court ruled that the appointment was illegal. Cohen said those actions were ""connected"" because Republican opposition kept the President from filling the four circuit court vacancies. ""That's the torturous route that brought us to agreement,"" Cohen said. Cohen said he and the coalition of groups persuaded two million of their members to either call, e-mail or write their senators pushing for filibuster reform. The man who coined the term 'nuclear option' regrets ever pursuing it . He also said that at the NAACP conference this summer, around the time the Senate was on the brink of invoking the nuclear option, leaders paused the program for attendees to call their senators to end the filibuster. Things started to shift when Senator Majority Leader Harry Reid became warm to the idea. At first Reid was reluctant, but when handshake agreements with his counterpart, Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, didn't stick, Reid became more open, eventually turning his threats of nuclear option into reality. While it only applies to presidential nominees, it excludes legislative matters. Advocates, however, say this is a good start. ""I might be destroying the Senate,"" Waldman said on his radio program Thursday just before the Reid pulled the trigger. But he quickly dismissed that assessment: ""But it kind of sucks now.""","The progressive blogosphere had a major role in invoking the nuclear option .
A coalition of labor and advocacy groups persuaded 2 million members to contact their senators .

"Andres Iniesta did not feature in the contenders for the best player of the 2010 World Cup despite scoring Spain's winning goal in the final, but the midfielder has been recognized  for his country's historic triumph at Euro 2012. The 28-year-old Barcelona star is one of 10 Spanish players in UEFA's 23-man squad, which features four from losing finalists Italy. Iniesta, clubmates Xavi Hernandez and Sergio Buesquets plus Real Madrid's Xabi Alonso were included in a nine-strong midfield contingent, while David Silva and Cesc Fabregas were named among five forwards despite playing in Spain's so-called ""no striker"" formation. The Spaniards completely nullified Italy's midfield general Andrea Pirlo in Sunday's final, winning 4-0 in Kiev to clinch a third successive major title. Iniesta did not score and had just one assist, but was rewarded for his overall contribution to the merciless Spanish passing machine. At the 2010 World Cup, David Villa was Spain's only entry in the top three as Uruguay's Diego Forlan was named best player. ""Pirlo was magnificent and obviously circumstances didn't help him in the final,"" UEFA technical director Andy Roxburgh said. ""Xabi Alonso, Xavi Hernandez and Iniesta were all superb. In the case of Xavi, he won the award last time, and he could easily have won the award again, but we felt that Iniesta deserved it. Is this Spain team the best in football history? ""In many ways, he symbolized the tournament -- the creative, incisive runner, with and without the ball. We felt that he epitomized a lot of what we saw."" The squad included only two players not present in the semifinal matches: England captain Steven Gerrard and Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. ""The players in the squad are those who have contributed in a significant way over the entire tournament,"" said Roxburgh, a former coach of Scotland's national team. ""Inevitably, the squad is dominated by players from the teams who had the most success -- first of all the team which won the title, Spain, then those players who were in the other top three teams. ""There are other players who could easily have been in the squad, but we restricted ourselves to a set number. The line was drawn at 23 because this was the squad size for the tournament."" UEFA president Michel Platini hailed the tournament in Poland and Ukraine as a big success, despite earlier fears of problems with racism which -- despite several incidents inside stadiums -- did not escalate as predicted. ""This Euro, the first in the East, has been a resounding success, a real triumph,"" the Frenchman said on UEFA's website. ""Poland and Ukraine showed the whole world that they can organize this type of event and that they needn't have any concerns. They can be proud of the work they've done, their enthusiasm and the final results. I'm proud of them, anyway."" Platini said the biggest on-pitch success of the tournament was the use of extra match officials behind the goal lines. ""That was the principal innovation on the pitch compared to previous Euro editions, and the system of five referees was a real plus in terms of the football that got played: it helped get rid of simulation in the area and also helped significantly reduce shirt-pulling during set pieces,"" he said. ""In the end, there were more goals and, even more significantly, more headed goals in this Euro than in other big international competitions. That's no coincidence. The system of five referees acts as a deterrent and the quality of football benefits from that."" UEFA also raised €228,000 ($285,000) for the charity Center for Access to Football in Europe (CAFE) after pledging €3,000 for each of the 76 goals scored. Off the field of play, Internet users set a new record for a sporting event on Twitter during Sunday's final.

"Making a cell phone call while aloft could become a reality under a proposal by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. Cell phone calls, texting and other mobile services would be allowed when the aircraft are flying above 10,000 feet, but not during takeoff and landing, according to an official briefed on the proposal. Airlines would have to equip planes with special antennas approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration before passengers could start talking. The commission says this proposal aims to give airline passengers the same communication access in the air that they have on trains and buses or in coffee shops. What should become of Airplane mode? ""Modern technologies can deliver mobile services in the air safely and reliably, and the time is right to review our outdated and restrictive rules,"" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said in a statement. ""I look forward to working closely with my colleagues, the FAA and the airline industry on this review of new mobile opportunities for consumers."" For years, the FCC has banned talking on mobile phones aboard aircraft in flight due to concerns that high-flying phones could disrupt cellular towers on the ground. A proposal to lift the cell phone ban was considered in 2004 but abandoned three years later. At the time, the FCC said that the ""technical information provided ... was insufficient to determine whether in-flight use of wireless devices on aircraft could cause harmful interference to wireless networks on the ground."" A number of other nations around the world already allow cell phone use inflight on similarly equipped aircraft. FAA allowing most electronic device use throughout flight . In a 2012 study, the FAA collected data from 11 countries and concluded that ""civil aviation authorities reported no confirmed occurrences of cell phones affecting flight safety on aircraft with on-board cellular telephone base stations."" The commission is considering the proposal because passengers want it, but some surveys show passengers are split. In a survey conducted in 2012 by Delta Air Lines, 64% of passengers said the ability to make phone calls inflight would have a negative impact on their onboard experience. The current proposal will be discussed at the FCC's December 12 meeting and could then be opened for public comments.  The commission would have to vote on a final rule before it could take effect. If the FCC gives final approval,  individual airlines could choose whether to provide mobile service to passengers.","The FCC is considering allowing cell phone talk aboard aircraft .

"Imaginations everywhere have been stoked since Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced his company plans to start offering 30-minute deliveries via drone-like ""octocopters."" What's not fascinating about a near future in which fleets of whirring sky robots can drop our every impulse buy on our doorstep faster than we can get Chinese delivered? (You know, aside from accidental strayings into restricted air space or the rise of the machines.) But when Bezos took to ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday to introduce the world to Amazon Prime Air, his idea prompted more questions than it provided answers. So how close are we, really, to door-to-door drones becoming a reality? And how would they work? We reached out to Amazon, where official details are still scarce, and chatted with drone expert Missy Cummings, an associate professor at MIT and one of the Navy's first female fighter pilots. Here's some of what we've been able to piece together on a project that Amazon says is, at the very least, a couple of years away from takeoff. Could drones really be delivering packages by 2015? That's what Bezos said is the best possible scenario. But Cummings, a longtime advocate for the commercial use of drones, thinks that's optimistic. The Federal Aviation Administration needs to sign off on Amazon's flight plans, and Cummings says the agency hasn't been quick to move on the domestic use of drones. ""I think they (Amazon) are stepping out in a typically naive way, (but) maybe they have some secret insight to the FAA that I don't have,"" she said. Cummings predicts the company will get approval to start Prime Air in other countries before the United States, but she says that having a retail and technology giant like Amazon pushing for it could speed things up for everyone. ""I don't want anybody to think this is right around the corner,"" Bezos warned during the ""60 Minutes"" interview. How will I know if I'm eligible for a drone visit? Bezos said the octocopters will have a 10-mile radius. So, it's likely that folks in big cities near Amazon distribution sites would be a lot more likely to qualify than those in more remote areas. He says they'll initially carry items up to five pounds, which is roughly 86% of all deliveries Amazon makes. The best Twitter jokes about Amazon's drones . But for even that 10-mile range to work, Amazon better be onto something about battery life that the rest of us don't know. Cummings said drones the size of the octocopters have a battery life of about 30 minutes, and the weight of their cargo could make that even shorter. What will keep people from shooting them down? OK, it's perhaps a little off-topic. But every single conversation we've had about the Amazon drones has, at some point, ended up focused on the innate human desire to knock stuff out of the sky, preferably with a loud bang. Cummings joked about producing a reality show in which marksmen from different states compete to see how many octocopter targets they can bag. At least, we're pretty sure it was a joke. Perhaps not surprisingly, Amazon doesn't directly address its drones becoming high-tech clay pigeons in a statement about safety. ""The FAA is actively working on rules and an approach for unmanned aerial vehicles that will prioritize public safety. Safety will be our top priority, and our vehicles will be built with multiple redundancies and designed to commercial aviation standards,"" the statement reads. But Cummings says it's a real issue. ""It's not just people who hate drones,"" she said. ""It's people who want those packages."" She speculated the drones will need to fly at an altitude of at least 300 feet for as long as possible to avoid attracting pot shots from target shooters or thieves. She also envisions safe ""drop spots,"" at least at first, instead of delivery to any address within range. ""There are lots of details that need to be worked out, but nothing that is technologically overwhelming,"" she said. Will the drones work when the weather is bad? Amazon's official statement doesn't address this obvious question. But Cummings says that to make the drones reliable in most weather conditions, Amazon would need to improve on currently available technology. ""They can fly in some precipitation, but certainly not heavy precipitation,"" she said. ""Sleet or snow ... would obscure some of the sensors. It's hard to make it a really solid business if the weather holds you back. They're going to have to work on that."" What could come next? Amazon isn't the only company at least toying with the idea of using unmanned aerial vehicles for commercial purposes. Domino's posted video of the ""DomiCopter"" delivering two pizzas in the United Kingdom earlier this year. In June, the Burrito Bomber, the creation of a couple of engineers from Yelp, demoed its ability to fly that tasty treat to your doorstep as well. And in Australia, Zookal, a textbook company, is already using drones for deliveries. Cummings hopes that's all just the beginning. Using drones for beneficial civic or commercial purposes, instead of military actions, is a growing trend. ""Medical supplies, wildlife monitoring, cargo, firefighting -- it's a pretty long list of things that drones can do,"" she said. ""It's reinvigorating a dying aerospace industry.""","Amazon Prime Air would use unmanned flying vehicles for delivering packages .

"(CNN)Neanderthals, meet modern humans. Modern humans, say hello to Neanderthals. Now would you two care for a date? That was possible some 55,000 years ago in modern-day Israel, archaeologists announced this week -- a find that they say could be significant, since it could shed light on when and how our modern-day ancestors moved from Africa into Europe and Asia. It's all based on the discovery of portions of a skull (including the top but not the jaw) in Manot Cave in western Galilee detailed in a study published Wednesday in Nature. The specimen ""is unequivocally modern"" and is ""similar in shape to recent African skulls as well as to European skulls,"" according to the report from a team of researchers from the University of Tel Aviv, Ben-Gurion University, Israel Antiquities Authority and elsewhere. ""It's amazing,"" co-author Israel Hershkovitz told the Guardian, explaining how the skull was found on the rocky shelf of a cave that collapsed 30,000 years ago and was revealed in 2008. ""This is the first specimen we have that connects Africa to Europe."" Uranium-thorium dating suggests the skull dates back about 55 millennia. Why is that time frame significant? For one thing, many scientists believe modern humans left Africa for points north 40,000 to 60,000 years ago. The Nature study suggests it was closer to the older date, and that they might have gone through the modern-day Middle East. According to the report, an analysis of the skull indicates that ""the Manot people could be closely related to the first modern humans who later successfully colonized Europe."" In other words, the first modern-day Europeans -- thought to have arrived on that continent around 45,000 years ago -- may have stopped in Israel first. But it's not like they were all alone then among hominids, the blanket term for erect primates from chimpanzees to homo sapiens, in either place. Around that time -- what's known as the Upper Paleolithic Period, or Late Stone Age -- there were Neanderthals both in Europe and in what's now Israel. The Nature study claims the Manot find represents ""the only modern human specimen to provide evidence that during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic interface, both modern humans and Neanderthals concurrently inhabited the southern Levant."" This all was happening around the time of ""likely interbreeding ... with the Neanderthals"" -- meaning the two groups of hominids could have gotten together and reproduced. Without DNA tests, it's impossible to say if the adult whose skull was found was a pure descendant of the modern humans who came from Africa, or had a bit of Neanderthal ancestry mixed in. But it definitely could have happened. Or, just as possible, that person or some immediate ancestors could have reproduced with Neanderthals. ""Manot is the best candidate for the interbreeding of modern humans with Neanderthals,"" Hershkovitz told the Guardian. ""There really is no other candidate."" The discovery was generally greeted warmly by experts, though with some hints of caution. This was only one specimen, after all, so there may be others out there that could be even more informative. And it was only part of a skull. Chris Stringer, of London's Natural History Museum, tweeted that he agrees with skeptics that ""interbreeding could have happened elsewhere in Asia (50,000 to 60,000 years ago). Also skull lacks the most informative areas."" Yet in comments to Discovery News, Stringer also acknowledged that ""Manot might represent some of the elusive first migrants in the hypothesized out-of-Africa event about 60,000 years ago, a population whose descendants ultimately spread right across Asia and also into Europe."" Stringer said, ""It is the first modern human from western Asia that is well dated to the estimated time frame of interbreeding between early modern humans and Neanderthals.""

"Hong Kong (CNN)It wasn't just the nuts. The flight attendant who served the offending macadamia nuts testified that she and the chief flight attendant knelt before Heather Cho, the former vice president at Korean Air, and the daughter of the airline's chairman in apology. The former executive also shoved her, threw a tablet to her chest and called her a pejorative term for female dog after becoming angry over the service, Kim Do Hee, the flight attendant testified in court Friday. Cho, a former executive for South Korea's biggest airline faces charges, after she ordered an international flight back to the gate at New York's JFK airport after becoming dissatisfied that her macadamia nuts were served in a bag instead of on a plate in first class. Prosecutors say that the incident, dubbed ""nut rage"" extends beyond Cho's behavior, but also to an attempt to systematically cover up what happened on the flight. Kim testified that Korean Air told her to lie about what happened to investigators and not to talk about the violence. The December 5 flight bound for South Korea had to return to the gate to remove the senior steward from the flight. Although her former role put her in charge of in-flight service, Cho was a passenger and was not flying in an official capacity. Cho was served with an arrest warrant last month in Korea in a case that has outraged the nation over growing resentment of the power held by its large family-owned corporations known as chaebol. Cho Yang-ho, her father and Korean Air chairman apologized to the flight attendants and the public for the incident. Swarmed by reporters outside the courtroom, the chairman said, ""I sincerely apologize to the people who treasure Korean Air."" ""No matter what, mistreating the flight attendant is not correct,"" he said. ""I scolded her for not being able to control her emotions."" He vowed to reform the corporate culture within the airline. Kim, the flight attendant who initially served the offending nuts, said that Cho wasn't initially angry, but ordered her to bring over a service manual. Kim handed a tablet to the chief steward, Park Chang-jin who brought it to Cho. Then Kim testified that she heard loud voices and went back into the first class cabin, and spotted Park kneeling. Kim also knelt in front of Cho as the executive berated her for having Park bring the tablet. Then, Cho lifted her up from her kneeling position and pushed her, yelling at her to leave the plane, Kim testified. Before the plane could take flight, Cho ordered Park to get off the plane, Kim said. After the incident, Kim said she was told by a Korean Air manager what to tell South Korean investigators from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. ""One of the managers said everyone in this ministry from Korean Air, they are all related to us, don't worry, do what we tell you to do,"" she said. Kim said she was coached by Korean Air not to mention Cho's yelling and physical abuse. She added that she never received an apology from Cho, also known by her Korean name, Cho Hyun-ah. Cho resigned from her post as a vice president at the company in December and trotted out a public apology with her head bowed, saying she accepted ""full responsibility."" The airline faces possible disciplinary action from the government because of the captain's failure to command and supervise crew members to ensure the safe operation of the flight, according to the ministry. CNN's Paula Hancocks contributed to this report from Seoul, South Korea.","Flight attendant: Korean Air exec yelled, cursed, physically abused her after nuts served .

"A heckler standing just behind Barack Obama in San Francisco this week yelled to the President that he ""has the power to stop deportation."" A clearly irritated Obama interrupted his speech and shot back that he doesn't have that authority, saying the United States is ""a nation of laws."" So, who's right? Federal immigration law provides for the deportation, or removal, of an individual under several circumstances -- including being in the country illegally, overstaying a legal visa, violation of criminal statutes or a number of other offenses â€” after a judicial process. But the administration has latitude in how to enforce those laws, though legal experts say exercising that discretion too broadly is fraught with political and legal land mines. Related: As Obama makes turn to immigration, protests that he's not doing enough . Ju Hong, the 24-year old heckler, is a University of California, Berkeley graduate and a member of Asian Students Promoting Immigrant Rights Through Education, ASPIRE. After the event on Monday at a community center, the group insisted the President can use his executive authority to halt deportations. Hong and his group want Obama to stop all deportations, which they say creates a culture of fear among undocumented immigrants and breaks up families. Obama spokesman Josh Earnest pushed back, saying the President does not have that authority. ""As I think the President said rather definitively, there is also not an executive action that would address all of the concerns that that young man had raised,"" said Earnest Tuesday from Los Angeles. But that doesn't convince May Liang, an organizer for ASPIRE. She told CNN Tuesday that she still thinks Obama ""blatantly lied"" when he said he didn't have the power to stop deportations. In a statement Monday, the group asked him for his ""legal analysis"" of why he can't stop deportations. Obama, however, stood firm. ""The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws,"" Obama told Hong Monday. ""And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve. But it won't be as easy as just shouting. It requires us lobbying and getting it done,"" he said. Obama told Univision In January that he's ""required to follow the law,"" which makes it a misdemeanor to be in the country illegally. Those found guilty can be deported. But the President has exercised discretion on deportations in the past. In 2012, he announced that the Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not going to deport Dreamers, children of undocumented immigrants. And in August, he announced that parents would not deport parents caring for children. But still, he has been aggressive on that front. Obama has deported more people than any other president. For instance, 410,000 people were deported in 2012 compared to 116,000 in 2001. Obama has shifted the type of immigrants targeted for deportation. While the administration of President George W. Bush targeted working immigrants by raiding workplaces, Obama is focusing on convicted criminals and ""egregious"" immigration violators, including recent border crossers and illegal re-entrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said 55% of people deported last year were convicted criminals. Richard A. Boswell, immigration law professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law, said the President is ""partially correct."" It's called prosecutorial discretion. The executive branch has the ""inherent power to choose which cases to act on,"" Boswell said. Think of the police. They can theoretically give someone driving four miles over the speed limit a ticket, but the police officer also has the ability to use discretion to give a warning instead. That's the validation Obama used in his decision to halt deportations of youth and parents. But Philip Schrag, professor of public interest law at Georgetown Law School, said the President's position is that putting an end to all deportations would ""abuse"" his discretion. Immigration law attorney Austin Gragomen said he thinks Obama ""has an obligation to enforce the law"" even if he chooses how and to what extent to enforce it. Boswell disagreed. He said the President can use his discretion to hold deportations. The President is ""making a tactical political move to force Congress to act. He could just as easily told Congress that he would withhold deportations on broad categories of cases pending their action,"" Boswell wrote in an e-mail. The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform earlier this year, which includes a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the United States. The legislation has been stalled in the House and is unlikely to be taken up before the end of the year. The issue of deportations hasn't just upset immigration advocates. The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, announced he would hold a hearing on the issue to investigate the President's decision to not deport some people. The hearing is titled, ""The President's Constitutional Duty to Faithfully Execute the Laws.""

"The story of the Beatles has taken on the power of myth. Today, five decades after Beatlemania erupted, it seems almost inevitable, a magical confluence of talent and timing. A group of scruffy musicians from Liverpool, a depressed port in northern England, become the biggest band in the world, known on a first-name basis? They put out album after groundbreaking album, their influence as great as their popularity? They dominate the pop culture of the 1960s and break up while still at the top of their game? You couldn't make this stuff up. But there's been enough mythmaking, says Mark Lewisohn. It's time to get down to the facts. ""It's a story that's lost all its excitement, because it's been trodden down through too many bad tellings through the years,"" says Lewisohn, the Beatles historian and author of such detailed works as ""The Beatles Recording Sessions"" and ""The Beatles Chronicle."" ""I just felt I would disregard everything that's been done. I would start again."" The result is ""Tune In,"" a mammoth (800 pages, not including notes) biography of the Fab Four that's just the first of a projected three-volume work. The book ends in 1962, with the band on the cusp of stardom. (For those who really can't get enough detail, there's an ""Extended Special Edition"" available in Britain that runs 1,728 pages and retails for £120 -- about $190.) The Beatles in color: Unseen photos . Lewisohn, 54, has immersed himself in original documents, listened to and read contemporary accounts and interviewed those who were there, all those years ago. He compares the work to Robert Caro's equally monumental biography of Lyndon Johnson, which is now four volumes long and has just started the story of LBJ's presidency. ""This is a proper work of history,"" he says. ""And it needs to be done, and it needs to be done now, while the witnesses are still with us -- most of them -- and while access to archives is still possible."" He's emphatic that ""Tune In"" isn't a hagiography, the literary version of a Beatles concert's high-pitched screams. ""It's not about legends, it's not about icons, it's not about myths,"" he says. ""The book is anti-myth."" A little bit raw . Ah, but it's a season for myths. American media is currently drowning in biographies and retrospectives linked to the 50th anniversary of the JFK assassination, and for all the attempts at hard-nosed history, it's still challenging to watch videos of the youthful president and not be swept away by the yearning, emotional pull of what-might-have-been. The Beatles, too, have become encrusted by an aura of nostalgia and wonder, as if subjects of an ancient legend. Lewisohn is far from the first to try to get underneath the shell. Hunter Davies wrote an authorized take in the late '60s; Philip Norman published the essential ""Shout!"" in 1981. Just seven years ago, Bob Spitz published ""The Beatles: The Biography,"" which is just as massive as ""Tune In."" As the 50th anniversary of their ""Ed Sullivan Show"" debut nears on February 9, the marketplace fills with more -- not just books, but also a new music release. The 2-CD set, ""On Air -- Live at the BBC Volume 2,"" may in its own way be as revelatory as the books. Here are the Beatles from 1963, when they were still a little raw, driving the motorways of Britain in the era's version of an Econoline van to fulfill the latest one-nighter on their concert schedule. For the BBC, Britain's broadcasting monolith, the group was energetic and eager-to-please, says Kevin Howlett, who helped put together the collection. It's a sequel to the recently re-released and remastered ""Live at the BBC,"" which originally came out in 1994. For one recording, during a bitter, snowy winter, they did a show in Bristol and then drove to London -- a two-hour trip on a good day -- for their BBC take the next morning. Another day they recorded 18 songs in seven hours for the BBC's ""Pop Go the Beatles."" Later they did 19 songs in a single long session. The BBC didn't play many records, so it was perform live or nothing. ""They knew they only had one shot, really,"" says Howlett, who's also written a companion volume, ""The Beatles: The BBC Archives."" ""You hear how proficient they are as a live group -- not only doing the unusual repertoire (of covers on the earlier BBC album), but doing their own songs."" 'The biggest nickers in town' Indeed, they were amazingly versatile. One song on the CD, ""Beautiful Dreamer,"" is a Stephen Foster classic rearranged for Tony Orlando in late 1962, but didn't come out in Britain until January 1963. The Beatles somehow obtained a copy -- it probably helped that their manager, Brian Epstein, managed a record store -- quickly learned it and performed it on a broadcast. They were also known to adapt American favorites for cover versions or to give them ideas for originals. Those kinds of talents are what set the Beatles apart from their competition, says John Covach, the director of the Institute for Popular Music at the University of Rochester, who's taught courses on the group. Covach mentions a variety of early songs -- ""She Loves You,"" ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" ""If I Fell"" -- that start out with fairly conventional structures but always have a twist somewhere: a drop to a minor chord, a leap to a high note. ""Most of what's going on is something you'd hear routinely in even the most mediocre of pop songs,"" he says. ""But they twist it a bit and they come up with something that's innovative without seeming like it's totally strange."" The Beatles freely admitted borrowing from others. They had ""big ears,"" in the jargon of music aficionados -- they'd listen to anything -- and tried to write their own versions of American hits. After all, their Liverpool colleagues were doing the same covers the Beatles did. ""We were the biggest nickers in town,"" Paul McCartney told Playboy in 1984. ""Plagiarists extraordinaires."" Though the songs came in handy for their own group, even McCartney and John Lennon were under no illusions that the Beatles would last. Their long-term goal was to simply be songwriters for others, after all. ""When they came to America, the people they most wanted to meet were people like Carole King and Gerry Goffin -- the Brill Building,"" Covach says. ""This was all really about setting up a lifetime of writing songs and being involved in pop culture in a fairly old-school way. It kind of morphed into something else."" See Ringo's photographs . 'They never existed in isolation' Of course, that's what leads to the present mythology -- the ""something else."" It's all become wrapped up in a ball by now: the cheeky press conferences, the madcap lads of ""A Hard Day's Night,"" the psychedelic savants of ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" the Apple business and the fade-out -- not to mention the tragic deaths of Lennon's friend Stu Sutcliffe, manager Brian Epstein and Lennon himself. Even the parodies -- National Lampoon's ""Magical Misery Tour,"" Mark Shipper's 1978 novel ""Paperback Writer,"" the Rutles -- have somehow buffed the legend instead of undermining it. No wonder there are entire festivals devoted to all things Beatle, and have been for decades. For Lewisohn, the biographer, that just means digging deeper to get to the heart of it all. ""In life, there are those people who are always sticking their hand up saying, 'Come and see me,' and maneuvering themselves more centrally into a story they weren't so central to in the first place, and then there are other people who don't put their hand up at all,"" he says. ""You have to gain their trust, but then they'll tell you fantastic things. And then a key element is not believing everything people tell you, because people embroider things."" (For those who want to share their Beatle-related stories, he has a page on his website for contributions.) After he returns to his writing desk, he believes he has several years ahead of him. Volume 2 is 40% done; Volume 3 might be 10%. He expects the entire project may take to the end of the decade. Through it all, he's maintained great admiration for the group, of course -- they've been his life's work. But he's careful to separate the men from the myth. ""They never existed in isolation. They were always in the mix with other people,"" he says. ""They're not legends. They're just people."" In that, he echoes none other than John Lennon himself from his 1970 Rolling Stone interview. ""We were four guys. I met Paul, said 'want to join me band.' Then George joined, and then Ringo joined,"" he said. ""We were just a band who made it very, very big. That's all.""","New biography tries to set Beatles record straight .

"Bangladesh postponed the hanging of an Islamist leader shortly before his execution was to take place Tuesday, his attorney told CNN. Abdul Quader Mollah is now scheduled to be hanged Wednesday. His defense lawyers, meanwhile, are filing a petition for his sentence to be reviewed. It was not immediately known why the government decided to postpone the execution. The decision came a day after the United Nations called for the hanging to be halted. On Tuesday, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay joined the calls for a stay of execution. Mollah was sentenced in September for alleged ""crimes against humanity"" dating back to 1971, during the country's war for independence. The ruling against him set off rioting in the streets and sparked a strike across the country. Mollah was the assistant secretary general for the now-banned Jamaat-e-Islami party. In February, he was convicted of war crimes by an international panel set up by the government to bring to justice those accused of atrocities. He was originally sentenced to life in prison. Bangladesh's supreme court then sentenced him to death. In the country's legal system, that cannot be appealed. Two U.N. human rights experts called on Bangladesh on Monday to halt the execution because of concerns that Mollah did not receive a fair trial. ""The right of appeal is of particular importance in death penalty cases,"" said Gabriela Knaul, U.N. special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. ""Anyone convicted of a crime has the right to have his or her conviction and sentence reviewed by a higher tribunal, as laid down in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which Bangladesh is a party,"" she said in a prepared statement. ""This provision is violated where a court of final instance imposes a harsher sentence that cannot be reviewed."" Christof Heyns, U.N. special rapporteur on summary executions, said capital punishment ""may be imposed only following a trial that complied with fair trial and due process safeguards. ... Only full respect for stringent due process guarantees distinguishes capital punishment as possibly permitted under international law from a summary execution, which by definition violates human rights standards."" In a statement Tuesday, Pillay called for a stay, saying the trial had not met stringent international standards for the death penalty, the U.N. said in a statement.

"(CNN)Pope Francis urged millions gathered in Manila on Sunday to take care of one another -- and help promote peace in the world. Worshippers in ponchos of all colors held up flickering candles in the rain, hanging on his every word. The Pope wore a yellow poncho over his robe as he celebrated the Mass, which was attended by 6 million people, according to the Philippine News Agency. ""May he enable all the beloved people of this country to work together, protecting one another, beginning with your families and communities,"" the Pope said. His homily followed a thunderous welcome to the capital. As he entered the park, the huge crowd chanted, ""Papa Francesco, Papa Francesco!"" He waved, kissed babies and reached over to touch the hands reaching out to him. The Pope's message included one he's talked about many times: empathy. ""In these days, throughout my visit, I have listened to you sing the song 'We are all God's children,'"" he said. ""All of us are God's children, members of God's family."" Young people, he said, especially need extra care. ""Jesus himself needed to be protected,"" he said. ""We too need to protect, guide and encourage our young people, helping them to build a society worthy of their great spiritual and cultural heritage,"" he said. As Francis left the venue in the capital, some jumped over barricades and ran after his vehicle. ""We love you, Papa Francesco!"" others yelled. Heavy rains pounded the city ahead of the Mass. Tropical storm-force winds howled just east of the event venue. The nation intensified security at all venues, with the presidential detail deployed to safeguard the Pope. About 25,000 Philippine national police are backing the presidential security detail tasked with safety for the event, authorities said. ""We are putting our best foot forward in this historic national event,"" said Leonardo Espina, the deputy director general of the national police. ""We have rehearsed and fine-tuned all our systems and procedures for this event, such that we have established full backup system that will address any unforeseen situation that may arise."" Firearms were prohibited in all areas holding events linked to the papal visit, including the routes his entourage would use. A day earlier, the Pope cut short his trip to Tacloban as an approaching typhoon with blistering winds threatened the Philippine city about 600 kilometers (370 miles) southeast of Manila. Tacloban is still recovering from the 2013 disaster of Super Typhoon Haiyan, described as one of the strongest storms ever recorded with 195-mph sustained winds. It killed 6,300 people nationwide. Typhoon Mekkhala, which is called Typhoon Amang in the Philippines, made landfall Saturday afternoon just northeast of Tacloban. Francis donned a slicker to celebrate Mass in Tacloban on Saturday for hundreds of thousands who gathered despite the stormy weather. Mekkhala was downgraded  Sunday, but was still packing winds up to 45 mph and heavy rains. The Pope's trip began Tuesday in Sri Lanka; he landed in the Philippines on Thursday. On Friday, he met with President Benigno Aquino, and the pontiff urged the political leader to reject corruption and promote ""honesty, integrity and commitment to the common good,"" the Vatican said. He also called for social justice and respect for human dignity, according to a copy of his remarks provided by the Vatican. ""Here in the Philippines, countless families are still suffering from the effects of natural disasters. The economic situation has caused families to be separated by migration and the search for employment, and financial problems strain many households,"" he said. ""While all too many people live in dire poverty, others are caught up in materialism and lifestyles which are destructive of family life,"" the pope said. He plans to leave Manila for Rome on Monday. CNN's  Steve Tuemmler contributed to this report.","About 6 million people attend the Mass in Manila .

"The NTSB continues to rule out mechanical causes in a deadly Bronx train crash while adding to the possibility that human error was involved. Federal safety investigators have all but eliminated mechanical problems as the cause of the December 1 derailment but added one more clue suggesting the engineer might not have been as attentive as he should have been. At 7:11 a.m. that Sunday -- about 11 minutes before the derailment -- the engineer did not dim the train's headlights as required when it passed another train, the National Transportation Safety Board said Monday. Engineer William Rockefeller Jr. acknowledged to investigators having a lapse in attention as the train approached a sharp curve, according Rockefeller's lawyer, Jeffrey Chartier, and his union representative.  The train's motion might have caused him to nod off -- a case of what the lawyer termed ""highway hypnosis."" Four people died and dozens were injured when the train, traveling at about 82 miles per hour, derailed on the curve, which has a 30 mph limit. The NTSB said Monday it believes that positive train control, a high-tech system that targets human error, could have prevented the crash.  The safety board has pushed the system for about 20 years.  Congress is requiring most major railroads, including Metro-North, to install the costly systems by the end of 2015. Railroad announces safety upgrades . The NTSB said it has completed its inspection of the train and found no anomalies. The ""dead-man"" switch -- a foot pedal that must be depressed to keep the train moving -- was also working, the board said.  Nor did it find problems with speed sensors, the brake control unit or the train's propulsion controller. The board reiterated that it found no problems with the tracks or the signal system. Finally, the board said it conducted a ""site/distance"" test and found no problems with visibility. ""As a result, at this time, the NTSB believes that if positive train control technology was installed on this line and train, it would have required the engineer to slow the train to an appropriate speed or stop the train in the event the engineer did not do so, likely preventing the derailment,"" the board said in a statement. Investigators are still awaiting results of crew drug tests and cellphone records, the board said, and it is continuing interviews with passengers, Metro-North employees who were riding on the train and first responders.

"Sex between consenting homosexual partners is once again illegal in India after the country's Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling Wednesday. Four years ago, India's High Court decriminalized such a relationship, in what was then hailed by gay rights groups as a landmark ruling. The Supreme Court overturned that ruling. Known as Section 377, the law has been in the books since India's Colonial-era days. It bans people from engaging in ""carnal acts against the order of nature."" On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that the penal code was constitutionally valid. It was up to parliament, the court said, to decide whether or not to keep the law in the statute books. Seven year fight . In 2009, the non-profit Naz Foundation won a verdict from New Delhi's high court after a seven-year legal fight to decriminalize homosexuality. It argued that the law infringed on the right to equality, privacy and dignity as set out in India's Constitution. The High court ruled in Naz's favor. But the decision came under fire from Christian, Hindu and Muslim groups, who filed an appeal to the Supreme Court. India's central government did not appeal, saying it didn't disagree with the High Court's ruling. Amnesty International India called Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling ""a black day of freedom in India."" ""It is hard not to feel let down by this judgment, which has taken India back several years in its commitment to protect basic rights,"" the group said. 'Setback to human dignity' Until now, India hasn't maintained a central database of prosecution under Section 377, said Akhilesh Kumar, a chief statistical officer at the National Crimes Record Bureau (NCRB). ""Henceforth, we will be compiling crimes committed under this relevant section,""  Kumar said. ""Maybe from the next year."" Rights activists say a number of gay couples have faced court cases because of their relationships. ""There have been hundreds of trials under Section 377 in different parts of the country,"" said Colin Gonsalves, a human rights lawyer. He said the law also rendered gay couples vulnerable to what he called harassment by police. The New York-based group Human Rights Watch called on the Indian government to take steps to scrap Section 377. ""The Supreme Court's ruling is a disappointing setback to human dignity, and the basic rights to privacy and non-discrimination,"" the group said in a statement. ""But now the government should do what it should have done in the first place and seek to repeal section 377.""","Human Rights Watch calls the ruling a ""setback to human dignity""

"Horse-drawn carriages could soon be a thing of the past in New York City's Central Park after Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio announced plans to outlaw the popular tourist attraction once in office. ""We are going to get rid of horse carriages, period,"" de Blasio said at a news conference Monday, saying that the practice is inhumane. ""No tourist comes to New York City just to ride on a horse carriage,"" Allie Feldman, executive director of NYCLASS, an animal rights group, told CNN. ""Horses do not belong in a congested, urban setting,"" NYCLASS states on its website. ""They constantly breathe exhaust while dodging dangerous traffic ... confined to the shafts of their carriage and their tiny stable stalls, with no access to green pastures."" Steven Malone, a horse-carriage driver since 1987, said that allegations of horse abuse are ""ridiculous."" ""These horses lead exceedingly great lives here,"" Malone told CNN. Malone said that horses would be sent to paddocks, where they would have less interaction and exercise and would be far less happy. Malone also disputed claims that horses are overworked, saying that all horses get at least five weeks of vacation time, and some get up to six months. De Blasio and NYCLASS favor replacing the horse carriages with electric antique cars driven by the same carriage drivers, which would be more humane and still be appealing to tourists, de Blasio said. ""You can't create tradition. You can't create kids coming with smiles on their faces to pet the horses,"" Malone said. ""You're not getting that with an electric car... Kids can't pet fenders."" De Blasio, who takes office January 1, has hired legal counsel who will deal with the legislative approach, he confirmed at the news conference. Malone and his fellow horse-carriage drivers plan to fight back in court. The proposed law would have to be approved by the City Council before any horses are removed from New York City streets. ""We want to provide the same service that we've been providing since the park opened in 1858,"" Malone said.","Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio and animal rights group call carriages inhumane .

"North Korea is showing no signs of scaling back its fearsome labor camp system, with torture, starvation, rape and death a fact of life for tens of thousand of inmates, according to human rights group Amnesty International. The rights group released satellite images, purportedly showing evidence of expansion, including the construction of new housing blocks and production facilities, at two of the isolated regime's largest camps or ""kwanliso"" --15 and 16 -- used to hold political prisoners. ""The gruesome reality of North Korea's continued investment in this vast network of repression has been exposed,"" said Rajiv Narayan, Amnesty International's East Asia Researcher. ""We urge the authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all those prisoners of conscience held in political prison camps and close the camps immediately."" Orphaned and homeless: Surviving the streets of North Korea . Horrific conditions . Amnesty commissioned the images from DigitalGlobe, a commercial satellite imagery vendor. In their release, Amnesty claims that up to 200,000 prisoners, including children, are being held ""in horrific conditions in six sprawling political prison camps."" Survivor recounts escape from camp . Pyongyang denies their existence, despite satellite images and testimony from witnesses. Amnesty claims many prisoners are allegedly being held for nothing more than watching foreign soap operas or holding a particular religious belief, while others are incarcerated simply for having a family member deemed politically undesirable. Camp 16, which is located near Hwaseong in North Hamgyong province, housed an estimated 20,000 people, according to previous analysis by Amnesty in 2011. But the group claims the latest images, taken in May this year, indicate a slight increase in population with the new housing blocks clearly visible. They also appear to show significant economic activity -- including mining, logging and agriculture. Amnesty said the camp covered an area of around 216 square miles (560 square km), or three times the size of America's capital, Washington DC. Camp 15, also known as Yodok, is located in the river valleys of central North Korea just 75 miles (120km) from the capital Pyongyang. In 2011, Amnesty reported that around 50,000 people were imprisoned there, though it said 39 housing blocks have since been demolished with only six new blocks built. While Amnesty conceded this might indicate a reduction in prisoner numbers, it said significant industrial activity was visible in the area, including logging. Amnesty said its analysis of the images pointed to tight security at both sites with perimeter fences and security points clearly marked. ""Movement appears to be restricted and controlled through secured entrance gates, guard towers and internal check-points,"" its report read. Veteran POWs recall misery of North Korean captivity . New witnesses . Amnesty also published previously unheard testimony from witnesses in its new report. A former security official, identified only as Mr. Lee, who was at Camp 16 in the 1980s until the mid 1990s described the methods used to execute prisoners in an interview with Amnesty last month. He said detainees were forced to dig their own graves and were then killed with hammer blows to their necks. He also witnessed prison officers strangling detainees and then beating them to death with wooden sticks. How voice from gulag affected human rights discourse . According to Mr. Lee, women were ""disappeared"" after being raped: ""After a night of 'servicing' the officials, the women had to die because the secret could not get out. This happens at most of the political prison camps."" Kim Young-soon, a former detainee in Camp 15 in the 1980s, described a public execution she witnessed of two detainees caught attempting to escape: ""They were brought to a stage after they were badly beaten. The prisoners were tied to wooden stakes and shot three times in their head, chest and feet,"" she recalled. In September this year, a United Nations inquiry into human rights abuses in North Korea highlighted the ""unspeakable"" and ""widespread"" atrocities being carried out in camps that required an international response, including a mother forced to drown her own baby and a prison camp inmate compelled to eat rodents and lizards just to survive. The rights group says it has shared the latest evidence with the U.N. Commission of Inquiry investigating human rights abuses in North Korea.","Amnesty: New images show new activity, including the construction of new housing blocks .

"(CNN) -- Thanks to 3-D printers, dentists can today print false teeth and medical device manufacturers can print hip replacements. Such creations are useful, but not exactly sexy. Thankfully, artists are demonstrating another dimension of the technology, printing remarkable creations that wouldn't have been possible even a decade ago. Take Tobias Klein. The German artist wanted to meld the architecture of St. Paul's Cathedral with representations of his own body. Approximating the shape and dimensions of your own heart is a challenge, but Klein did not have to guess. He underwent a series of MRI scans, and then, with a few clicks of the mouse, was able to view his own heart in 3-D. He then merged that with a representation of the dome of St. Paul's and sent the design to a 3-D printer, which deposited material layer by layer to create a solid object. The result was 'Inversive Embodiment,' a twisting, mind-boggling sculpture that links man-made architecture with the architecture of a man. ""It allows me to move into more eccentric areas,"" Klein says. ""We see a super beautiful influx of people working with the medium. We're just seeing how far this can go."" New possibilities . According to Wohlers Associates, a manufacturing research firm, the market for 3-D printing topped $2 billion in 2012, up nearly 30% from the year before. And while most of the cash comes from manufacturing companies, artists are throwing ever more dollars at 3-D printers and related technologies. The desire to innovate is driving the trend, as are falling prices and the increased availability of 3-D printers. Suzy Antoniw organized ""3D: Printing the Future"", an exhibition running at London's Science Museum until June 15. ""Although 3-D printing as a technology isn't that new, there has been an explosion of creativity around it in recent years,"" she says. ""It gives artists more design freedom and enables them to create amazing things."" Bernat Cuni, one of the artists featured in the exhibition, takes children's drawings and, using computer aided software, blows the images up like balloons. A 3-D printer then produces these so-called 'crayon creatures,' turning scribbles into mini sculptures. Michaela Janse van Vuuren, an artist and former puppet maker, focuses on designs that can only be made using 3D printing. Her white horse marionette includes an elaborate set of wings made of countless interlocking parts, all printed in one go. That means there is no assembly required and the piece is ready for sale immediately. ""There is absolutely no way you can make this design using traditional manufacturing or handcraft methods,"" she says. Fashion has benefited as well. For the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in September, the lingerie giant wanted model Lindsay Ellingson to have spectacular wings that captured the intricacy of snowflakes. Designer Bradley Rothenberg relied on a 3-D printing process called Selective Laser Sintering that can fabricate complex interlocking support without additional support materials. 3-D printing also ensured a snug fit. ""We actually scanned the model and then wrote code that generated the snowflakes around the 3D mesh of Lindsay's body."" Financial incentive . For artists who live outside of the world's major art markets, 3-D printing helps them access customers further afield. Janse Van Vuuren, who is based in South Africa, says it can be costly to reach new markets and to travel to meet potential clients. ""3-D printing removes many of these barriers and has the potential to level the playing field,"" she says. ""My designs can be printed at a location close to the buyer and many online repositories exist where buyers can choose products."" Museums see commercial promise in new printing techniques as well. Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum, which holds the world's largest collection of paintings by the Dutch artist, has teamed up with Fujifilm to create 3-D replicas of five Van Goghs, including the iconic ""Sunflowers"" and ""Almond Blossom."" Fujifilm scanned the works and then printed 260 replicas of each—a process that takes three months. Known as ""Relievos"", the copies capture not only the colors—there are 32 shades of yellow in ""Sunflowers""—but also the particulars of Van Gogh's brushstrokes, including height and direction. They also include the frame and the backside of each painting, which have stickers and other markers of where the paintings have traveled. ""This way people can see the history of the painting,"" says Milou Halbesma, the head of public affairs at the museum. ""A painting travels around the world. People can see it was in exhibitions at the Moma and other museums."" The Relievos sell for €25,000 each, about $34,000, and will help the museum pay for essential renovations. Previous sales in Hong Kong and Taiwan were a huge success, so the museum has launched similar sales in Belgium and the Netherlands. It will take its works to Los Angeles in the new year. Baby steps . Critics of 3-D art reproductions like to point how much they vary from the original. But Joris Dik, a professor of materials science at Holland's Delft University of Technology, believes it is more interesting to compare 3-D reproductions to earlier 2-D reproductions. It shows how far technology has come. Working with Canon and the Rijksmuseum, Dik and one of his graduate students developed a scanning technique that allows them to capture the ridges and cracks of a painting, and to see beyond the surface layer of paint to understand the structure of the painting. To the untrained eye their reproduction of Rembrandt's ""Jewish Bride"" might be mistaken for the original. But for Dik that's not the point. What's important is that his 3-D representation is an incremental step forward. In the future 3-D scanning techniques and printing may even replicate layers and luminescence, the quality whereby particles in paint make it appear to shine. ""The one thing that is certain is that 3-D printing is advancing rapidly,"" Dick says. ""I'm quite sure that in a couple of years we'll be a couple of steps further.""","3-D printing is opening new avenues for artists .

"Shia LaBeouf's plagiarism apology tour took to the sky Wednesday as the ""Transformer"" actor hired an airplane to sky-write ""I'm sorry Daniel Clowes."" Clowes is the author whose story LaBeouf admits he copied for his short film ""HowardCantour.com"" without crediting Clowes. But it was a cloudy apology, raising suspicion that LaBeouf has moved on from saying he's sorry to Clowes and is now taunting Clowes fans and LaBeouf critics who have attacked him online in the two weeks since he was busted. The creativity shown by LaBeouf in more than two dozen Twitter postings of apology raises the question of why such a fertile mind needed to borrow ideas. Those tweets included the words ""naiveté,"" ""embarrassed,"" ""regret,"" ""terribly wrong,"" ""deeply sorry,"" and ""hurtful and thoughtless."" The apology tweets started clearly enough on December 16: ""Im embarrassed that I failed to credit @danielclowes for his original graphic novella Justin M. Damiano, which served as my inspiration. I was truly moved by his piece of work & I knew that it would make a poignant & relevant short. I apologize to all who assumed I wrote it."" Transforming apologies . But three days later, it appeared LaBeouf was frustrated that the online attacks against him continued. Sarcasm emerged in his tweets: ""I want to thank all of you who have written in and created groups and protested. Even though I wish I hadn't made so many of you angry."" Even here, LaBeouf plagiarizes -- maybe as a hidden treat for those obsessed with nailing him for plagiarism. It mirrors Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's landmark apology in 2006 for a failure in his then-fledgling social network:  ""Even though I wish I hadn't made so many of you angry, I am glad we got to hear you."" Sincere-sounding apologies continued for another week, including this on December 28: ""When you've made a mistake you should apologise. But more importantly -- most important of all -- you've got to learn from your mistakes."" This was a cut-and-paste ripoff of UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's 2012 apology for his party's breaking a pledge not to support a student tuition fee hike. It even included the British spelling of apologize. By December 31, LaBeouf was mocking those who refused to accept that he was sorry for copying from Clowes: ""I am sorry for all the plagiarized tweets, they all were unintelligent, ambiguous and needlessly hurtful. You have my apologies for offending you for thinking I was being serious instead of accurately realizing I was mocking you."" LaBeouf borrowed the phrase ""unintelligent, ambiguous and needlessly hurtful"" directly from a 2011 apology by film director Lars von Trier after he was banned from the Cannes Film Festival for remarks about Adolf Hitler. On New Year's Day, LaBeouf went old school and used a predecessor to the 140-character Twitter forum. He hired a single-engine airplane to write through the blue skies of Los Angeles: ""I AM SORRY DANIEL CLOWES."" He then tweeted a photo of the airborne apology, because it was unlikely the author, who lives in San Francisco, would have seen it for the short time it was visible before the words were gone with the wind. The text that accompanied the tweet posted Wednesday night read: . CLOUD: . - vapor floating in the atmosphere . - remote servers used to SHARE DATA . - to make LESS CLEAR or TRANSPARENT . If LaBeouf is considering a sequel to his short but controversial film about an online film critic, perhaps he already has a script for a movie about an actor who finds his voice on Twitter. Not everyone's laughing . For Clowes' editor, the plot of LaBeouf's film sounded awfully familiar, even before he saw it. ""I presumed that LaBeouf would be smart enough to change everything just enough to make it his own thing and shield himself from any legal liability, even if it didn't excuse him from being a weasel. Which is why, when I actually started watching it, I almost spit out my coffee when I realized he lifted the script, word for word,"" said Eric Reynolds, associate publisher at Fantagraphics, in a statement. ""The more I think about this, the more I'm fairly convinced that LaBeouf at least subconsciously knew what he was doing,"" Reynolds continued. ""He never completely claims ownership of the script, as near as I can tell; the credits conspicuously do NOT credit a screenwriter or source material, stating simply, 'A Film by Shia LaBeouf.' When you look at that, coupled with the quote he gave 'Short Film of the Week' about how details in his own life informed the script, it's clear he's trying to claim authorship without ever stating outright, 'I wrote this!' Which makes it even more egregiously shameless, in my mind."" And even if Clowes accepts the flurry of apologies, another publisher is considering legal action against LaBeouf. Melville House publisher Dennis Johnson sent a statement to CNN on Thursday accusing LaBeouf of ""extensive plagiarism of the Melville House book 'The Little Girl and the Cigarette' by Benoit Duteurtre."" LaBeouf's short graphic novel ""Stale N Mate"" allegedly mirrors passages from the book. ""We are puzzled by the fact that, considering the egregious plagiarism of our author's work by Mr. Laboeuf, he has taken such a cavalier attitude with regard to this matter,"" Johnson said.  ""We have been conferring with legal counsel over the holidays with the intention to pursue our legal remedies should we not hear from Mr. Laboeuf promptly to remedy this matter.""","Editor: Actor's action was ""egregiously shameless""

"Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky arrived in Germany after Russian President Vladimir Putin released him Friday following more than 10 years in prison, the German Foreign Ministry said. Khodorkovsky's son, Pavel, told CNN in a text message that he flew to Germany to meet his father. In a statement following his release, Khodorkovsky said he asked Putin to pardon him on November 12, ""and I am glad his decision was positive."" He further said ""the issue of admission of guilt was not raised"" in the discussion. He went on to personally thank those who followed his case and supported him and said he was ""constantly thinking of those who continue to remain imprisoned."" ""I am very much looking forward to the minute when I will be able to hug my close ones and personally shake hands with all my friends and associates,"" he said. ""I will welcome the opportunity to celebrate this upcoming holiday season with my family. I wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry welcomed Khodorkovsky's release. ""The United States strongly encourages Russia to pursue reforms that establish a transparent, independent and reliable judicial system that upholds its commitments to human rights, the rule of law and non-discrimination,"" Kerry said. Putin signed an amnesty decree for Khodorkovsky, a former Yukos oil tycoon, earlier in the day. The signature came a day after Putin announced that he planned to pardon Khodorkovsky. The oil magnate, who backed an opposition party, had been in prison since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud. He was due for release in 2014. Former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher apparently was involved in the release, saying he met twice with Putin to discuss the case. Genscher also arranged the flight on a private jet from Russia and picked Khodorkovsky up at the airport in Berlin. ""He is doing well considering the circumstances,"" Genscher told Caren Miosga of CNN affiliate ARD in Germany. ""He looks forward to seeing his family again in a few hours again. I heard his conversation with his family members in the car, although I don´t speak Russian. It was still moving. This is understandable because he had to suffer for 10 years."" Russian tycoon's prison sentence cut by two years . Speaking to reporters Thursday, Putin said Khodorkovsky had written a letter appealing for a pardon, citing humanitarian factors. A statement Thursday on a website set up in support of Khodorkovsky said that it could not confirm plans for a pardon but ""all of his family and supporters would of course be elated to see him finally free after ten years of imprisonment."" Putin's announcement came a day after Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law. The amnesty, to mark the anniversary of the adoption in 1993 of Russia's post-Communist constitution, will be applied to thousands of Russian prisoners, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. It comes at a time when Russia's human rights record is in the spotlight, as the country prepares to host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi in February. Russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, with countries including the United States accusing it of selective prosecution and abuse of the legal system. He has said his prosecution was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take control of the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s.","U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urges reforms in Russian judicial system .

"2014 is shaping up to be a pivotal political year for Republicans. Voters in a handful of GOP primaries will have to decide if Washington will move toward responsible partisanship, or if the Capitol slides further into polarization, shutdowns, manufactured crises and other forms of dysfunction. The battle has already begun. Karl Rove, the political wizard behind George W. Bush's campaigns, is engaging his American Crossroads Super PAC to take down any primary challengers to the GOP establishment's candidates. He's formed a group called the Conservative Victory Project to screen and recruit candidates the establishment likes for House and Senate seats. Although Rove unsuccessfully spent hundreds of millions of dollars on former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and other federal candidates in 2012, the U.S. Chamber of Congress joined efforts with Rove recently to elect candidates who favor big business and to defeat tea party, evangelical and libertarian candidates. ""Our object is to avoid having stupid candidates who can't win general elections,"" Rove said on Fox News. Scott Reed, a longtime Republican strategist and spokesman for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told The Wall Street Journal, ""Our No. 1 focus is to make sure ... that we have no loser candidates. That will be our mantra: No fools on our ticket."" The Chamber of Commerce plans to spend at least $50 million in 2014 Republican primaries. That's not much by current standards, but it's provoked a reaction. ""It's insane,"" Cleta Mitchell, Washington attorney and conservative activist told Newsmax. ""That's fine if they want to spend that money, but I think it's going to be wasted."" The Club for Growth, a big player in right-wing politics, isn't happy with Rove's declaration of intraparty warfare. The club's president, Chris Chocola, called the Rove-U.S. Chamber alliance ""misguided in many respects.""  After affirming their right to free speech, Chocola added, ""The problem with a lot of the groups is that they don't really care about what the candidates believe."" In other words, the Rove groups find big-business, big-government candidates acceptable as long as they're Republican. It's a little surreal to hear Rove and Reed insulting the tea party, while ""credentialed conservatives"" respond in polite and measured tones, but that's where we are. This will likely continue. Rove, a master at holding and stating diametrically opposed positions at the same time, predicted Republican unity while declaring victory in the battle to win over Republican voters who comprise the base of the party. ""Every Republican senator and virtually every representative challenged in a primary as insufficiently conservative will win,"" he wrote -- an in-your-face prediction aimed at the Club for Growth, tea party Republicans and anyone dissatisfied with Rove's ""winning for big business"" strategy. In reaction, the Club for Growth started a website that urges voters to ""primary"" their congressperson; that is, run candidates against Washington Republican officeholders.  However we slice it, ultraconservative, small-business, small- government Republicans are opposing establishment Republicans who are big- business, big-government conservatives. (There are only a handful of true Republican moderates left in Congress). To put this in perspective, let me recount a little recent history. After the 2008 election, the Republican Party was so unpopular that in response, Rove and others decided to capitalize on the nascent tea party movement, using the Republican Party's structure, connections and money to propel it into a viable political force. Rove, in a 2010 column, advised independents who identified with the tea party movement to remain apart from the Republican Party and to ""begin the difficult task of disassociating themselves from cranks and conspiracy nuts."" Rove's intent -- and that of the Republican establishment -- was to manipulate the tea party movement into kicking out Republican Party ultraconservatives. That failed. Independents stayed where they were, in the middle, unassociated with either party or the tea party movement. However, tea party organizers (almost all of them Republicans) captured a sizable portion of the Republican base, appealing better than the establishment to libertarians and evangelicals. This is why the Republican Party now finds itself in a civil war. Tea Party identifiers, libertarians and evangelicals keep separate identities, but they pretty well agree they don't like the establishment, which includes Mitch McConnell, John Boehner and anyone who associates too closely with them. For decades, the Republican establishment ran candidates in primaries who ""talked the talk"" of ultraconservatives but switched to more moderate talk for the general election, and after election, voted less conservatively.  As gerrymandering isolated congressional districts into almost pure Republican or Democratic constituencies, both parties began to nominate fewer and fewer centrist candidates. Now, groups such as the Club for Growth, the Madison Project and the Tea Party Leadership Fund, among others, want to toss out big-business conservatives because time and practice have proved them untrustworthy to deliver on primary promises. The irony of this internal warfare is that GOP establishment leaders are the ones who have schooled the tea party Republicans in the tactics of extreme partisan gridlock to achieve maximum political gain. Now, the establishment is running against the tea party as if they were the political extremists. Get ready for a showdown.

"The crowded world of social media apps got squeezed a bit tighter with the introduction of Jelly on Tuesday. The social Q&A app from Biz Stone, a co-founder of Twitter, relies on photos and friends to find answers to questions that may not fit neatly into a Google search, such as, ""What kind of flower is this?"" Sure, people can turn to their Facebook or Twitter feeds to ask which backpack to buy, or where to responsibly dispose of or donate old iPhone chargers (both real questions currently appearing on Jelly). The technology isn't new. Neither is turning to friends for help with everything from where to eat in Philadelphia to suggestions for an 8-year-old's birthday party. But Stone is hoping Jelly makes this experience fun while helping users find answers faster. The dedicated social-search app is free of news feed and timeline clutter, while still allowing you to make use of your social network. We spoke to Stone over the phone Tuesday about how Jelly works. His answers informed these instructions: . Using Jelly is simple enough. Open the app, connect your social networks (Facebook's platform app must be turned on) and users are immediately prompted to either look through pending questions (""7 people need help"") or snap a photo. Users can add links and draw on a photo before sharing a question with others. Seeing questions and answers from unfamiliar people? Stone says the app works much like LinkedIn, where ""2nd degree"" connections will appear. In other words, users will be asking questions and receiving answers from friends as well as friends of friends. To follow a question, simply tap the ""favorite"" star in the upper right corner and notifications will appear within the app. But if you dismiss a question, you can't go back to it later when you think of the answer or remember you have a friend on Facebook who probably knows it. Questions also can be shared outside the app and answered via the Web by people who don't use Jelly. These answers show up as ""forwarded by ..."" Stone says in the future they'd like to figure out a way to connect names with outside answers, but it isn't a top priority right now. Users can also rate answers to their own questions, and to other users' questions, as ""good,"" and send virtual ""thank-you cards"" to helpful respondents. So far, customer ratings for Jelly in iTunes are mostly positive. For a short time Tuesday Jelly experienced an error which prevented users from connecting and logging in, which appears to be the reason for most posted complaints. Some meaner critics called the app ""pretty but pointless."" Some also have criticized Jelly's inability to sort through questions, see questions only from certain users or filter results. In response, Stone said that categorizing questions defeats the purpose of using your entire social network. But he emphasized that he's open to the wishes of the nascent Jelly community, and the idea of sortable questions is not completely out of the question in the future.","Jelly, a new social Q&A app, was released Tuesday .

"Did business disputes play a role in the dramatic demise of Kim Jong Un's once powerful uncle? That's what South Korea's main intelligence agency appeared to suggest Monday in comments relayed by a lawmaker. The uncle, Jang Song Thaek, was considered instrumental in Kim's rise to power two years ago. But Kim turned his back on the man once seen as his protector in spectacular fashion earlier this month, having him executed on charges he tried to overthrow the government. Jang's death was announced in an unusually public declaration from the secretive state. Analysts have put forward a variety of reasons that may have led to Kim's decision to turn against his uncle and to publicize his execution. Some suggested there may have been a struggle for power between Kim and Jang. Pinning down the truth may prove impossible for a reclusive regime like North Korea. But agents at South Korea's National Intelligence Service, which broke news of Jang's initial fall from power before North Korea announced it, are nonetheless trying to get to the bottom of the situation. The agency briefed lawmakers of a parliamentary intelligence committee Monday about what it thinks was behind Jang's downfall. The head of the agency, Nam Jae-joon, played down the theory of a simple power struggle between Jang and Kim, said Jeong Chung-rae, a lawmaker from the United Democratic Party who attended the briefing. Based on the intelligence agency's analysis, Jang's aides in certain government agencies involved in business projects, including coal and trade, overstepped their authority, creating conflicts with other agencies, the lawmaker said. The agency believes Kim may have stepped and demanded that the disputes be resolved -- an order Jang apparently declined to carry out, Jeong said. That decision may have cost Jang his life. ""Jang was purged for violating the supreme leadership, according to the NIS report,"" Jeong said. North Korea state media made some references to business wrongdoing by Jang in their expansive recounting of his alleged crimes. ""The Jang group put under its control the fields and units which play an important role in the nation's economic development and the improvement of people's living in a crafty manner, making it impossible for the economic guidance organs including the Cabinet to perform their roles,"" the state news agency said in the official report announcing Jang's removal from his posts. It said he had sold off ""precious resources of the country at cheap prices."" Analysts have said that Jang, who was close to Chinese officials, was believed to have a more open mind about capitalist forms of economic development than hardline members of the regime. By discounting the theory of an outright power struggle between Kim and Jang for control of the regime, the South Korean intelligence agency said it believes Kim's position at the top is stable. The regime is still investigating many of the agencies under Jang's control, the NIS said, according to Jeong. It also said that it believed that images that showed Jang being dragged out of a large meeting were part of a choreographed event to demonstrate Kim's power.","South Korea's intelligence agency offers an analysis of Jang Song Thaek's execution .

"Former FBI agent Bob Levinson ""was not a U.S. government employee when he went missing in Iran,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday. And U.S. officials noted that they have no idea where he is. Carney made the comment amid reports that Levinson, 65, was working for the CIA in Iran, not conducting private business as officials have previously said. The State Department and Levinson's family have denied he was working for the U.S. government ever since he disappeared on a trip to Iran in 2007. Speaking to reporters, Carney said there's an investigation into the disappearance, but he wouldn't comment further on what Levinson ""may or may not have been doing in Iran."" ""I am not going to fact check every allegation made in the story you referenced, a story we believe it was highly irresponsible to publish and which we strongly urged the outlet not to publish out of concerns for Mr. Levinson's safety,"" he said. ""If there's somebody detained  overseas and it's published, true or false, that he is working for the CIA, I think it is dictated by logic that that very likely puts that person in greater danger. What I can  tell you is he wasn't a U.S. government employee when he made that trip."" The Associated Press and The Washington Post first reported the CIA angle on Thursday. Family attorney speaks . Levinson's family attorney, David McGee, told CNN's Susan Candiotti that records he found show ""without a shadow of a doubt""  that  Levinson was indeed a contract employee of the CIA on a rogue assignment in Iran for the agency when he disappeared. McGee and his paralegal managed to hack into Levinson's e-mails and found correspondence with a CIA analyst who had known Levinson for years. It wasn't until McGee, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Levinson years ago, found the e-mails  that the family learned about the relationship with the spy agency. At the time of his disappearance, the State Department said he was on a private business trip investigating cigarette smuggling and said he was not working for the government. Levinson had spied on Iran's nuclear program and Hezbollah's cigarette smuggling in the past, McGee said, but on this trip he was investigating corruption and money laundering in Iran's oil industry. McGee said Levinson's absence has been hard on his wife and seven children. ""It's been a difficult 6 ½ years for everybody that's dealt with this,"" McGee said. "" And the confrontations that we've had. With the agencies, with the Iranians, they've been very difficult. It's been quite a challenge.  And to watch the family go through that."" Don't know where he is . Carney said he was not ""going to say anything"" that might harm ""efforts to bring Mr. Levinson home,"" noting that it remained a priority and the government continues to pursue ""all investigative leads."" Separately, the United States doesn't know where Levinson is being held or who has him, senior U.S. officials told CNN. ""We honestly don't know where he is,"" one official said. The officials said a 2010 video of Levinson considered proof of life posed more questions than answers because it was sent from a cybercafé in Pakistan and had Pashtun music in the background. Unable to pinpoint Levinson's whereabouts, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton issued a statement saying the United States had evidence that he was being held ""somewhere in southwest Asia."" This implied he may not be in Iran, but could have been held in Afghanistan or Pakistan. With no sign of Levinson since, the officials said they have no way of knowing whether he is alive. Iran maintains it doesn't know where he is and has offered to help find him. The AP said it moved forward with publishing the sensitive story after holding off several times. ""The AP first confirmed Levinson's CIA ties in 2010 and continued reporting to uncover more details. It agreed three times to delay publishing the story because the U.S. government said it was pursuing promising leads to get him home,"" the news agency said in its report. ""The AP is reporting the story now because, nearly seven years after his disappearance, those efforts have repeatedly come up empty. The government has not received any sign of life in nearly three years. Top U.S. officials, meanwhile, say his captors almost certainly already know about his CIA association."" McGee said Levinson family did not want  the AP or Washington Post to publish the story. ""The publication of the story was not authorized by the family,"" McGee said. ""We did not give permission and we were not aware other than two hours in advance that the decision had been made. Having said that,  there are some advantages to this. Once it's out, you no longer have to lie.""","Reports surface Bob Levinson worked for the CIA in Iran when he disappeared in 2007 .

"Paul Walker's new film -- one of the last he completed -- was going to start a new chapter for the ""Fast and Furious"" actor, says its director. ""He had gushed to me about the new offers he was getting from people who'd seen his performance,"" says Eric Heisserer, the first-time director of ""Hours,"" which opens Friday. ""His career was finally going in a direction that he was excited about for the first time in many years."" The dramatic film, about a New Orleans man trying to keep his newborn alive in the face of Hurricane Katrina's chaos, marked a change of pace for Walker after making a name for himself in the ""Fast and Furious"" series. Walker's in practically every frame, agonizing over his baby, mourning his losses, willing himself to continue as his hospital is evacuated and the city is overwhelmed by floodwaters. Walker died November 30 in a horrific auto accident while riding in a friend's high-performance sports car. His death has inspired shock and sadness as ""Fast and Furious"" colleagues remembered his spirit and fans paid tribute to his charity and generosity. Video: Fans honor Paul Walker . Heisserer, too, was left in shock by Walker's death. The news reached him over the Thanksgiving holiday, which he was spending in Oklahoma with family. He remembers a ""kind and patient"" video-game fanatic who never pulled rank, even though he was the film's only name performer and one of its producers. ""He was just eager to do a great job, and that kind of inspired everybody else to step up their game and make sure they were committing the same way Paul was,"" Heisserer says. The ""Hours"" writer and director, his voice frequently quivering with emotion during a 20-minute phone interview, talked with CNN about working with Walker and the making of the film. The interview has been edited and condensed: . CNN: Where did the movie idea come from? Eric Heisserer: It started with (a) short story born out of my time in Houston. I knew plenty of people in New Orleans and Louisiana, many of whom who had to evacuate and who were refugees at the Astrodome in Houston. Some of my friends told me specific little horror stories about that time. And a friend told me about the fears he had as a father -- he was about to have a child -- and the story of (""Hours"" protagonist) Nolan and his daughter attached to all those personal anecdotes of Katrina and turned into the story. CNN: How did Walker get involved? Heisserer: He didn't get involved until we signed him on to play the lead, and that was after about nine months of searching for the right leading man. I knew after about 20 minutes into the meeting that he was the guy. He had a very personal connection to the character, and he felt he had something to prove -- if to no one else other than himself -- that he could work new muscles with this role. CNN: Walker is in almost every frame. How did he deal with that? Heisserer: It was a great risk doing this kind of movie for both of us, and it required an incredible amount of trust. Two months before, I flew down to New Orleans (to) prep; he and I agreed to meet two or three times a week and spend a few hours out of the day getting to know each other better. Sometimes we'd play video games or card games. Sometimes we'd get a bite to eat. It was just a case of getting used to each other's company and our back stories. CNN: Did you tap into his relationship with his daughter, Meadow? Heisserer: Yes, to the point I'd asked him to bring baby pictures of Meadow. During some of the scenes where there was just a monologue by him to give to the baby in the incubator, we set the baby photos in the incubator so he could connect with his daughter that way. It also meant a lot to him that his father was proud of him, and I knew those were sort of magic words I could tell him during a shoot. Those words of ""Your father will be proud of you for this moment, for this scene"" really elicited an emotional response from him, and I could tell it was because he'd always had that in the back of his mind. CNN: How was he to direct? Heisserer: He was a real honest performer in that there wasn't much of a difference between the character of Nolan and the person that Paul is in real life. I found that the more that I could shorten the distance between those two, the greater performance I got out of him. Paul was a very unique. ... He's a unique creature in that he was so kind and patient with everyone. He was the best kind of actor you could have in these circumstances. He never complained. He never got impatient with anyone. He knew all the names of my crew, and he worked to make sure that his part and his performance helped everybody else. CNN: Did he feel a weight on his shoulders? Heisserer: He never seemed to balk at that during the shoot. He confessed to me later that it did scare him many a night. He'd go home and worry that he wasn't doing enough. CNN: When was the last time you spoke to him? Heisserer: About a week before the death. We had had a press junket for the movie going into that weekend. CNN: How do you feel? Heisserer: (He lets out a long sigh and speaks slowly.) Well, Todd, the truth of it is, I'm angry. And I've been angry about this for a while. This movie was a real turning point for Paul. He had gushed to me about the new offers he was getting from people who'd seen his performance in ""Hours,"" and his career was finally going in a direction that he was excited about for the first time in many years. I told him at the time that that's what this movie was, that I was just warming him up for bigger and better things. It was a springboard. (He sighs again) So the fact that this is his swan song, it, I don't know -- it makes me mad. He doesn't get to benefit from all this hard work now. CNN: It's a loss. Heisserer: Yeah. CNN: It must be very trying to do this without him. Heisserer: It is. (Laughs in relief) But at the same time, I know he was so excited for people to see the movie, and I feel like if I shut that down and I don't make my best effort to help people to see him, then I'm kind of letting him down, and I can't stand that. I'm still very proud of the movie and proud of him and excited to have everybody see it, of course. So I can revel in that, and the rest of the time I have to steel my nerves and keep a tissue box handy. People we lost in 2013 .","Paul Walker's new movie, ""Hours,"" is due out Friday .

"A new court ruling could chill Royal Dutch Shell's plans to drill for oil off Alaska, finding that federal regulators used an ""arbitrary and capricious"" number to approve the project. The ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals comes as Shell is gearing up to resume its on-and-off oil exploration project in the Chukchi Sea. The project has caused widespread concern among environmentalists and native Alaskan communities, who have gone to court to stop the drilling. The judges found the federal government used ""an unrealistically low estimate"" of the amount of oil Shell might be able to produce when calculating the project's impact on the Arctic environment. Officials with what was then the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department agency that handled oil and gas leases, estimated the potential amount of recoverable oil at 1 billion barrels. But other estimates ranged much higher -- up to 12 billion barrels, according to the ruling. Wednesday's split decision by a three-judge federal panel sends the matter back to a lower court in Alaska for further review. ""Today's ruling is a victory for the Arctic Ocean,"" the plaintiffs said in a joint statement. ""The government has no business offering oil companies leases in the Chukchi Sea."" Shell had no immediate comment, with spokesman Curtis Smith telling CNN that it is still studying the decision. Niel Lawrence, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Obama administration ""can't in good conscience authorize Shell to do exploratory drilling under those leases."" ""The decision says the government has no idea what the real impact of leasing will be,"" Lawrence said Thursday. ""Until it knows those impacts, it can't decide whether to proceed with the leases, and it has no business letting Shell continue to operate under leases that the government is going to have to reconsider."" Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service had questioned the 1 billion figure before Shell's lease sale was approved in 2008, the decision states. Lawrence said Shell's authorization for the Arctic project ""was all predicated on a lowball estimate of production."" ""Sometimes courts do find legal technicalities that void something, but don't really change the underlying situation. That's not this case,"" Lawrence said. ""It's a really profound problem with the whole operation, and not the kind of thing you an paper over and fix on the quick,"" he added. The NRDC is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. The MMS was reorganized after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Its successor agency, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, had no comment on the decision. But in court, the agency argued that its 1 billion-barrel figure may be too high, because ""the remoteness of the area and the risk of economic failure"" may mean no oil gets produced at all. Shell has invested billions into its Arctic oil plans and began preparatory drilling in September 2012. But the project soon hit several high-profile snags, including the grounding of a drill barge that was being towed back to the Lower 48 at the end of the season. The company skipped any effort to drill in 2013, but has filed plans with BOEM to resume work again in July as the case winds through the courts. Shell's plans also were delayed by the Deepwater Horizon disaster, which killed 11 rig workers and unleashed an undersea gusher in the Gulf of Mexico that took three months to cap. Shell says it's working at far less depth and lower pressures than those involved in that accident. The shrinking of Arctic sea ice, which hit record summer lows in 2012, has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region. Climate researchers say that decrease is a symptom of a warming climate, caused largely by the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels like oil -- a conclusion that's politically controversial but accepted as fact by most scientists.","The U.S. ""has no business letting Shell continue"" after ruling, lawyer says .

"James Gandolfini, best known for his role as an anxiety-ridden mob boss on HBO's ""The Sopranos,"" died Wednesday while on vacation in Italy. He was 51. The exact cause of death is not known, but his managers said it was possibly a heart attack. His body is in a hospital morgue in Rome. Once the U.S. Embassy issues a death certificate, Gandolfini's remains can be returned to the United States. ""It is with immense sorrow that we report our client, James Gandolfini, passed away today while on holiday in Rome, Italy,"" managers Mark Armstrong and Nancy Sanders said in a joint statement. ""Our hearts are shattered and we will miss him deeply.  He and his family were part of our family for many years and we are all grieving."" The actor had been scheduled to make an appearance at the Taormina Film Fest in Sicily this week. Gandolfini won three Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Tony Soprano, the angst-wracked mob boss who visited a therapist and took Prozac while knocking off people. ""The Sopranos"" aired from 1999 to 2007. Share your memories . Edie Falco, the actress who played Tony's wife Carmela, said she was ""shocked and devastated"" by the news. ""He was a man of tremendous depth and sensitivity, with a kindness and generosity beyond words. I consider myself very lucky to have spent 10 years as his close colleague. My heart goes out to his family,""  Falco said in a statement Thursday. ""The love between Tony and Carmela was one of the greatest I've ever known."" ""Jimmy was the spiritual core of our Sopranos family, and I am stunned at this devastating loss,"" said Chris Albrecht, the former president of HBO who gave the green light to the show. ""He was a great talent, but an even better man. My thoughts are with his family."" HBO is owned by TimeWarner, which is also CNN's parent company. Actor Steve Van Zandt, who played Tony Soprano's confidant Silvio Dante, felt equally close to Gandolfini in real life.  ""I have lost a brother and a best friend,"" he posted on Twitter. ""The world has lost one of the greatest actors of all time."" Gandolfini was born September 18, 1961, in Westwood, New Jersey, according to Biography.com. He graduated from Rutgers University and, as the story goes, worked as a bartender and a bouncer in New York City until he went with a friend to an acting class. He got his start on Broadway, with a role in the 1992 revival of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" with Jessica Lange and Alec Baldwin. Entertainers, politicians mourn Gandolfini . Gandolfini's big screen debut came in the role of a heavy in the bloody ""True Romance"" in 1993. His breakthrough on the small screen came in 1999 with the role of Tony Soprano. ""He was a genius.  Anyone who saw him even in the smallest of his performances knows that,"" David Chase, who developed ""The Sopranos,"" said in a statement.  ""...A great deal of that genius resided in those sad eyes."" Gandolfini, who was notoriously press shy, had a reputation in the tabloids for being sometimes difficult. ""He wasn't easy sometimes. But he was my partner, he was my brother in ways I can't explain and never will be able to explain,"" Chase said. 'Sopranos,' Gandolfini left mark on N.J. businesses . While Gandolfini was known for sometimes ruthless, often imposing characters, those who worked with him described an actor who put his heart into a role. ""He was just so good at the emotion. A very passionate man and a very, very tender man,"" Matthew Warchus, who directed Gandolfini in the 2009 Broadway play ""God of Carnage,"" told CNN. ""I really loved him and admired him a great deal."" Larry King, who saw Gandolfini in Las Vegas just weeks ago, told CNN the actor was ""jovial and seemed happy."" ""He stamped himself in 'The Sopranos' so much, people have overlooked his many diversified roles he's performed,"" King said. ""He was a very diverse character actor, who became a star."" IReporter Shana O'Neil worked in an office, where Gandolfini was shooting in 1994. She remembers him as ""Jersey through and through"" with a great smile. ""I just always think of him as that guy."" His Sopranos fame, she said, changed nothing about the way she remembers him. Best quotes from the mouth of Tony Soprano . Gandolfini's acting credits included roles in ""The Last Castle"" with Robert Redford, ""The Mexican"" with Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, and ""Surviving Christmas"" with Ben Affleck.

Chris Christie described himself as a ""huge fan"" of Gandolfini. ""It's an awful shock. James Gandolfini was a fine actor, a Rutgers alum and a true Jersey guy,"" he said. If his managers are right, and he died of a heart attack, it struck much too early, said CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""(The) average age of someone having a first heart attack -- if this is in fact what we're talking about -- is usually in the mid-60s,"" he said. Risk factors such as smoking, lack of exercise, obesity and high cholesterol can lower the age range significantly, according to Gupta.

"In one of her last Twitter posts, Venezuelan beauty queen Monica Spear wished her fans peace, health and love. The 29-year-old soap opera star was gunned down by the side of a country road less than a week later. Spear and her ex-husband, Thomas Henry Berry, were driving in Venezuela's Carabobo state Monday night when their car broke down, officials said. Armed robbers opened fire, killing both of them. Their 5-year-old daughter survived Monday's shooting, authorities said, but was shot in the leg. ""It is presumed that the motive was robbery,"" Venezuelan Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres said. ""We are still investigating. There are five people detained who are being interrogated."" Spear was Miss Venezuela in 2004 and represented her country in the Miss Universe pageant the next year. Her popularity opened the door to acting roles in soap operas that eventually made her an international star. She worked in Colombia and more recently in the United States, where she made her home in Miami. She was vacationing in Venezuela with her family when she was killed. Hours before the shooting, she posted a video online showing scenic images of the countryside. Spear, who studied theater at the University of Central Florida before winning the Miss Venezuela crown, appeared on the Telemundo soap operas ""Flor Salvaje"" (Savage Flower) and ""Pasion Prohibida"" (Forbidden Passion). ""We are deeply impacted and saddened by the horrible crime that the beloved actress Monica Spear and her family suffered,"" the network said in a statement. ""Monica was not just a great professional, as she showed in the two soap operas that she worked on with us ... but also she was an excellent person, always enthusiastic and with great strength and determination."" Word of Spear's slaying spread quickly on social media and drew a massive response from fans in the South American nation and well beyond its borders. Movie stars, fellow soap opera actors, athletes and government officials expressed sorrow and condemned the attack. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called the killing a massacre and said more needed to be done to put a stop to violence. Venezuela is one of the world's most violent countries, according to a United Nations ranking. One person is killed roughly every 21 minutes in Venezuela. And there were 24,700 violent deaths last year in the oil-rich country of roughly 30 million people, according to the nonprofit Venezuelan Violence Observatory. ""This happens every day in Venezuela. ... If the victim had not been this actress, the person would simply be one more statistic,"" said Luis Izquiel, a lawyer and criminologist in Caracas. The observatory says the country's murder rate has soared to nearly 80 deaths per 100,000 people. Government statistics put the figure significantly lower, at 39 deaths per 100,000. Richard Linares, Spear's Venezuela-based personal trainer, said the slaying shows how little life is valued in his country. ""Life does not matter,"" he told CNN en Español on Tuesday. ""A life can be traded for some shoes."" ""It devastates me that there is a 5-year-old girl who is asleep, and when she wakes up she will ask how her parents are, and she no longer has any parents,"" Linares said. Venezuelan officials said they're committed to solving the problem. A meeting of the country's governors to discuss crime-fighting strategies is scheduled for Wednesday. ""It is painful, not only the death of this beloved Venezuelan actress and the wound her daughter received, but also the death of any Venezuelan who falls in the hands of violence,"" Rodriguez said. Authorities also said they had assigned two prosecutors to investigate Monday's slayings. Spear's father told CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13 that he learned the devastating news about his daughter's death Tuesday morning while watching a Venezuelan television network in their Orlando, Florida, home. ""There's no words to describe our pain. This is something that never should have happened,"" Rafael Spear said. After her successful stints in soap operas, he said, his daughter had planned to take her career toward roles in Hollywood movies and French films. ""She was a star,"" he said, ""and she was the star of the family."" The beauty queen's daughter is in stable condition at a Caracas hospital, he said. In an interview with The Huffington Post last year, Spear said she left Venezuela because of the country's security problems. But Spear was eager to visit her home country over the holidays, close friend and CNN Latino anchor Maria Alejandra Requena said. ""She wanted to spend Christmas and New Year's in Venezuela,"" Requena said, ""to travel around Venezuela, to let her little daughter know her country.""","Father: ""This is something that never should have happened""

"For the first time, newly unsealed court documents reveal police directly suggested that former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez may have pulled the trigger in an unsolved Boston double homicide in July 2012. ""There is ... probable cause to believe that Aaron Hernandez was operating the suspect vehicle used in the shooting homicides ... and may have been the shooter,"" a now-unsealed June 2013 warrant reads. The warrant was used to search a Toyota 4Runner linked to Hernandez that, according to court documents, was seen at the scene of the crime by witnesses the night of the murders. Victims Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado were fatally shot in a 2003 BMW. Two others in the car survived. The warrant granted permission to search the SUV for gun residue. The vehicle was recovered at Hernandez' uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut. The search warrant also granted permission to seize a bag of clothing with Hernandez's name on it that was found at that home. It's unclear what was found in the bag and no document detailing what was removed from the house has been released. Police are looking for clothing and jewelry worn by Hernandez the night of the double homicide, including a baseball hat, a T-shirt, sneakers and a beaded necklace. Hernandez is seen on a nightclub video surveillance camera wearing those same items, according to the search warrant, which is partially redacted. No charges have been filed and authorities have not commented publicly on the investigation. But as as CNN has previously reported, a grand jury has been looking into whether Hernandez played a role in the drive-by shooting, according to law enforcement sources. That 2012 shooting is separate from a 2013 killing in which Hernandez is charged and awaiting trial. Hernandez, 24, was indicted for first-degree murder and weapons charges by a different grand jury in August  2013, in the shooting death of his friend Odin Lloyd. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.","The revelation was contained within newly unsealed court documents .

"Trust me, the scandal-scarred former boy wonder said. No way, responded California's highest court. The state Supreme Court rejected former journalist Stephen Glass' request for admission to the bar on Monday, finding that he had not truly reformed in the 15 years since he made up facts in more than 40 magazine articles -- and then lied some more to cover up his misdeeds in one of the journalism world's most infamous scandals. The court found that Glass, who works as a paralegal at a Beverly Hills law firm, lacks ""the good moral character"" to be a lawyer. It simply doesn't buy the disgraced serial liar's arguments that he has changed. In a scathing 33-page opinion supporting its decision to deny Glass admission to the California State Bar, the court concluded that he failed to show genuine remorse and never fully came clean on all his fabrications and that his ""lack of integrity and forthrightness"" continued even during his hearings before the court. Lawyers and journalists aren't highly regarded, although they usually rank a notch above lobbyists, members of Congress and used-car salespeople in Gallup's annual Honesty and Ethics survey. Lawyer jokes to the contrary, the court insisted, ""A lawyer's good moral character is essential for the protection of clients and for the proper functioning of the judicial system itself."" Glass, who has declined to discuss the case publicly, could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Arthur Margolis, said he was disappointed by the court's decision. He said there would be no futher comment. Stephen Glass wants to be a lawyer . Glass, now 41, was a rising star at The New Republic when he was exposed as a serial fabulist in 1998. His editors investigated and learned that he had fabricated quotes and sources -- sometimes entire events -- in dozens of articles he wrote over three years for the magazine and other publications. The events of his rise and downfall became the basis of a movie, ""Shattered Glass."" Even while he was writing magazine pieces, Glass attended night classes at Georgetown's law school. He graduated in 2000 and passed the bar exams in New York and California. Richard Bradley, former editor of George magazine, said in 2011 that at least three pieces Glass wrote for the magazine contained fabrications. He added that Glass was good at ""figuring out people's blind spots."" Bradley said he forgave Glass long ago but added, ""Being a lawyer is a privilege, not a right. He can be a fully contributing, valuable member of society without being a lawyer."" Glass withdrew his application to the New York State Bar in 2003 when it became obvious he would be turned down. He applied to the California Bar in 2005 after he moved to Los Angeles. A bar review committee declined to find him morally fit to be a lawyer; Glass appealed, and the California Supreme Court added ""In Re Glass on Admission"" to its docket for 2012. The State Bar Court argued that the past was not the issue: it's Glass' moral character today. The bar examiners -- the lawyers who vet other lawyers -- argued that Glass' lies were so ""staggering"" he hadn't done enough to demonstrate he had reformed. ""Going to law school and living a normal life isn't enough,"" Rachel Grunberg, a lawyer for the bar court, said in 2011. The Supreme Court was not impressed with Glass' arguments that he was sorry for what he had done and that he had changed. Nor was it impressed that he had won over a long list of accomplished people. ""Our review of the record indicates hypocrisy and evasiveness in Glass' testimony at the California State Bar hearing,"" the court's opinion stated. ""We find it particularly disturbing that at the hearing Glass persisted in claiming that he had made a good faith effort to work with the magazines that published his works. He went through many verbal twists and turns at the hearing to avoid acknowledging the obvious fact that in his New York bar application he exaggerated his level of assistance to the magazines that published his fabrications."" Writing a book and appearing on the TV newsmagazine ""60 Minutes"" cannot be considered indicators of genuine remorse, the court observed. The court also noted that since Glass' journalism career crashed and burned, he seemed less motivated to help others and more inclined to ""advance his own career and financial and emotional well-being."" Even his volunteer legal work was not particularly charitable, since all lawyers are expected to perform pro bono work, the court noted.","Stephen Glass is denied admission to California Bar .

"The trial of a high-profile Chinese activist accused of organizing protests against official corruption wrapped up after a one-day hearing on Wednesday, his lawyer told CNN. Prosecutors alleged that Xu Zhiyong ""gathered a crowd to disturb public order"" after a series of small protests when demonstrators unfurled banners in Beijing calling for officials to publicly declare their assets, lawyer Zhang Qingfang said. Zhang added that said Xu could face up to five years in prison if he is found guilty. The lawyer did not know when the verdict would be announced but said he assumed his client would be found guilty because of the political nature of the case. Xu founded the New Citizens Movement, which calls for official transparency and rule of law. In court, Xu tried to read a prepared statement highlighting the goals of the movement and declaring his innocence but was interrupted by the judge when he spoke about wanting top leaders to be transparent about their assets, his lawyer said. ""Calling on officials to reveal their assets was our effort to promote the country's anti-graft system,"" Xu said before being removed from the courtroom, according to his lawyer. ""More than 137 countries and regions in the world have established such systems, why can't China? What are those 'people's servants' afraid of?"" The trial has attracted widespread attention and authorities have come down hard on international media covering the case. A CNN crew was prevented from approaching and filming the court house and CNN's Beijing correspondent, David McKenzie, was kicked, pushed and punched by Chinese security before being forced into a nearby van and driven away. Embarrassing revelations . Xu's trial began amid new and potentially embarrassing revelations about the wealth of China's elite. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported that close relatives of China's top leaders own offshore companies in international tax havens. The report said that confidential files showed that President Xi Jinping's brother-in-law and the son of former Premier Wen Jiabao had set up companies in the British Virgin Islands. While not illegal, the findings shed light on the wealth of the country's leaders at a time when President Xi is intensifying his campaign against high-level corruption, the report said. Groundbreaking causes . Xu was arrested on July 16 after spending more than three months under house arrest at his Beijing home. A former law lecturer at the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xu has a reputation for taking on groundbreaking legal causes. He has campaigned for death row inmates and families effected by a poisoned milk formula scandal in 2009. Searches for Xu's name and ""constitutional rule"" were blocked on Chinese microblogs and search engines. In December, John Kerry, U.S. Secretary of State, appealed for Xu's release and that of other activists.","NEW Trial of Chinese anti-corruption activist Xu Zhiyong wraps up .

"Hollywood is in full awards season mode.  This past weekend, the Producer's Guild granted its first tie for its best picture award, bestowing the honor on ""Gravity"" and ""12 Years a Slave.""  This weekend, the Director's Guild will hand out its awards, for which ""12 Years a Slave"" director Steve McQueen is a strong favorite. If McQueen takes home the Oscar at next month's Academy Awards, he will be the first black director to receive that honor — ever.  Which is a pathetic reflection of the far deeper and more enduring inequalities in American society today. It wasn't until 1991, the 64th presentation of the Academy Awards, that a black director was even nominated: John Singleton for ""Boyz in the Hood.""  Only one black director has been nominated since: Lee Daniels in 2009 for ""Precious."" Meanwhile, excluding Steve McQueen this year, only four black men have been nominated as producers for best picture: Quincy Jones for ""The Color Purple"" in 1985, Lee Daniels for ""Precious,"" Broderick Johnson for ""The Blind Side"" in 2009, and Reginald Hudlin for ""Django Unchained"" in 2012.  That's it.  None won.  And no black women have ever been nominated as either directors or producers. The record isn't much better for white women, incidentally. Before Kathryn Bigelow, who became the first woman to win the Oscar for best director -- in 2010 for ""The Hurt Locker"" -- only three women had ever been nominated: Lina Wertmüller for ""Seven Beauties"" in 1976, Jane Campion for ""The Piano"" in 1993 and Sofia Coppola for ""Lost In Translation"" in 2003.  And the bigger box office films, including many nominated for Academy Awards, tend not to include female producers. One might be forgiven for thinking the 86th annual Academy Awards are taking place in 1886.  As far as we've supposedly come as a society — a black president, more women in the workplace, the important legislative and cultural accomplishments of the civil rights movement and the women's movement — that's all?  Three black directors, four white female directors and a handful of executive producers between them?  Seriously? These discouraging patterns in the Oscar nominations and awards are a reminder that social progress can be disturbingly superficial.  Just like the world around us, our movie screens appear to be increasingly more diverse. Incredibly talented actors of color are at times portraying profound roles in plots that relate to the struggle for racial justice in America, usually through the lens of our past  -- from ""Driving Miss Daisy"" to ""Django Unchained"" -- rather than an uncomfortable and critical look at our present.  Yet Hollywood fails to regularly create, let alone celebrate, any near-significant number of critically and commercially successful films created by black directors and producers with as much power and pull in Hollywood as their white counterparts. When Chris Rock hosted the Oscars in 2005, he took a camera crew to a movie theater in Harlem in New York and asked audience members if they'd heard of that year's Academy Award-nominated films.  They hadn't.  Rock simply and powerfully illustrated the profound disconnect between black America and the Hollywood elite.  Rock was not invited to host the Oscars again. These observations no doubt lead to chicken-vs.-egg debates. After all, plenty of financially successful films each year are produced and directed by black men and women -- though mostly men.  So is it that these movies don't make it into the critical pantheon of the Academy Awards?  Or black producers and directors don't have the same opportunities to create films in the more elite genres?  Does the reason even matter or just the result?  By the same token, does Hollywood exclude women and people of color in powerful director and producer roles more than other facets of American business and society?  Probably not, but who cares?  That doesn't make the critique any less worth leveling. In 1939, Hattie McDaniel became the first African-American to win an Academy Award, for her role in ""Gone With The Wind.""  In 1968, Sidney Poitier became one of the first African-American actors to achieve major box office success in a leading role, with a string of hits that year, including ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner."" But both black actors, and most since, have been fictionally and literally in white men's houses; white men still very much disproportionately occupy the real seats of power in Hollywood and beyond. Kudos to Steve McQueen for challenging this tired script.  I hope his truly excellent film wins both best picture and best director.  But more important, here's hoping the behind-the-scenes levers of power in Hollywood start reflecting more inclusive plot lines appropriate for 21st century America.","Sally Kohn: If Steve McQueen wins, he will be the first black director to get an Oscar .
Kohn: No black women, only two other black men have been nominated for best director .

"Virgin Galactic, the space tourism company founded by British billionaire Richard Branson, has barred Chinese nationals from applying for spots on its first commercial flights. Cashed-up People's Republic of China passport holders have reportedly been willing to pay the $260,000 fare for a spot on the inaugural Virgin Galactic space flight scheduled for later this year, but have been turned down in order to comply with United States anti-espionage laws, the South China Morning Post reports. Rocket engines on the Virgin Galactic craft -- named SpaceShip Two and WhiteKnight Two -- are reportedly considered military grade technology under Cold War U.S. arms trafficking laws. The legislation was designed to prevent foreign powers, such as China, from getting hold of U.S. military tech secrets. ""Both SpaceShipTwo and WhiteKnight Two are U.S. technology and are therefore subject to U.S. regulations,"" said Winnie Chan, a spokesperson for a Virgin Galactic accredited partner in Asia. Chinese nationals with multiple passports or U.S. residency might be considered for a place on the space trips, Virgin Galactic said. Short -- but sweet? Virgin Galactic has already accrued almost $70 million in deposits for spots on its space flights, according to the SCMP, the first of which is due to take place later this year. A ticket gets you a 110-kilometer trip into the atmosphere and six minutes of weightlessness before returning to Earth. The cost of the tickets has been criticized as excessive for such relatively brief excursions. Virgin Galactic will be headquartered and launching its flights from Spaceport America, a planned epicenter of space tourism near the New Mexico town of Truth or Consequences.

"The struggle between communism and capitalism defined the second half of the 20th Century. The Cold War pitted east against west, pushing the world to the brink of nuclear war. Now, as we approach the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, which brought the era to a close, CNN International is again airing its 24-part series, The Cold War, which first aired in 1998. Giving unparalleled insight from those who lived and fought through the events that defined an era, The Cold War lets viewers see how the events of yesterday have shaped the world of today. The series was commissioned by CNN founder Ted Turner. Award-winning television director Jeremy Isaacs was the executive producer. The series was narrated by Academy Award nominated actor Sir Kenneth Branagh. The programs will air on CNN International every two weeks starting on January 4. Here is a summary of the first 12 episodes. 1 ""Comrades"" 1917--1945  (January 4 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and January 5 at 02:00 GMT) The Russian Revolution of 1917, followed by the Russian Civil War caused a rift between the Soviet Union and the United States. But when President Franklin Roosevelt took office in 1933, diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries resumed. The relationship was strained yet again after the USSR annexed the Baltic States and signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany. Despite their differences the Soviet Union and the United States found themselves allied after the German invasion of Russia in June 1941. As the war in Europe began to wind down and victory was in sight, the two countries had very different views as to what the post-war world would look like. At the Potsdam Conference, just before the atom bomb was dropped on Japan, it became clear that Stalin wanted to put Eastern Europe under the Soviet sphere of influence, setting the conditions for the Cold War to commence. Episode 1 includes interviews from George F. Kennan, Zoya Zarubina, Hugh Lunghi and George Elsey. 2 ""Iron Curtain"" 1945--1947 (January 18 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and January 19 at 02:00 GMT) As wartime turned to peacetime, a resurgent United States enjoys economic prosperity while Europe is left to recover from the ravages of war. In the Soviet Union, Stalin has resumed his feared purges and the country is gripped by famine. Germany is forced to cede some of its eastern territory to Poland, and the Germans living in that area are expelled from their homes. Stalin begins to increase his hold on Eastern Europe, installing communist regimes, but decides to stay out of the Greek Civil War. The United Kingdom, exhausted from the war, sees its once-powerful empire go into decline. As food shortages begin to threaten the stability of Europe, a more assertive United States begins to challenge the USSR's influence in both Turkey and Iran. Episode 2 includes interviews from Lord Annan, Sir Frank Roberts and Paul Nitze. 3 ""Marshall Plan"" 1947--1952  (February 1 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and February 2 at 02:00 GMT) For both selfless and selfish reasons, the United States institutes the Marshall Plan, giving massive amounts of aid to the war-ravaged countries of Europe. Suspicious of American intentions, Stalin prevents countries in the Soviet sphere from taking part in the plan. As a counter to the U.S. plan, Stalin established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. In Czechoslovakia, communists seize power in a 1948 coup. While Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito was originally allied with the Soviet Union, he decides to forge his own foreign policy path and accepts aid from the Marshall Plan. After the 1948 Italian elections, the CIA and Catholic Church conspire to push the communist party there from power. The Marshall Plan successfully modernizes Western Europe and strengthens its ties to the United States. Interviewees from episode 3 include Vladimir Yerofeyev, Gianni Agnelli and Giulio Andreotti. 4. ""Berlin"" 1948--1949 (February 15 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and February 16 at 02:00 GMT) Opposed by the USSR, the United States emphasizes the need to rebuild the German economy. With the introduction of the Deutsche Mark, the Soviets react by tightening checkpoints leading into the French, British, and American sectors of Berlin, ultimately leading to a ground blockade of the city. To keep the city from starvation, the western allies begin the Berlin Airlift, ferrying in supplies by plane. German Communists in Berlin successfully take over the city's municipal government, which causes both the city and country to be divided between east and west. Interviews in Episode 4 include Gail Halvorsen, Sir Freddie Laker and Clark Clifford. 5. ""Korea"" 1949--1953 (March 1 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and March 2 at 02:00 GMT) Korea was split between the United States and the Soviet Union at the end of World War Two. The Soviets install Kim Il-sung as the leader of the north, while the Americans place Syngman Rhee at the head of the south. In 1950, with the help of the Soviets, North Korea invades South Korea, pushing U.S. and South Korean forces to a city at the southern tip of the Korean peninsula, called Pusan. In response to the invasion, a United Nations force, led by the United States, regains the advantage, driving the communist forces towards the Chinese border. Feeling threatened, and at Stalin's behest, Chinese leader Mao Zedong attacks. This leads to a stalemate in the center of Korea. After protracted negotiations, an armistice is signed. Communism in Korea is contained, but the country is left divided. Interviews in Episode 5 include Lucius D. Battle, Paik Sun Yup and John Glenn. 6. ""Reds"" 1948--1953 (March 15 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and March 16 at 02:00 GMT) Fear of one another permeates the eastern and western leadership, trickling down to the citizenry. The House Committee on Un-American Activities in the United States begins investigating alleged communist infiltration in the entertainment industry and diplomatic corps. In the USSR, an increasing cult of personality is being built up around Stalin and a more repressive police state is taking hold. In response to Yugoslavia's independent foreign policy, the Soviet Union pushes a series of purges in Prague as a warning to other satellite countries that may stray from Soviet policy. Fear and repression in the USSR hits its zenith right before Stalin's sudden death in 1953. Interviews in Episode 6 include Arthur Kinoy, Ralph de Toledano and Boris Pokrovsky. 7. ""After Stalin"" 1953--1956 (March 29 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and March 30 at 02:00 GMT) After Stalin's sudden death, Nikita Khrushchev takes over the Soviet Union, reversing some of Stalin's oppressive policies. Khrushchev also reestablishes relations with Yugoslavia and in a secret speech given to the Soviet leadership he denounces Stalin's harsh policies. Meanwhile, West Germany begins to rearm, leading the USSR to establish the Warsaw Pact in response. Trying to maintain Soviet influence in Eastern Europe, Khrushchev sends troops into East Germany, Poland, and Hungary to put down revolts. Interviews in Episode 7 include Anatoly Dobrynin, Charles Wheeler and Sergei Khrushchev. 8. ""Sputnik"" 1949--1961 (April 5 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and April 6 at 02:00 GMT) Unbeknown to the United States, the Soviets had spied on the U.S. development of the atom bomb, and quickly created their own after the Second World War. This sparked a nuclear arms race between the two superpowers. With the successful Soviet launch of Sputnik, America responds by increasing its development of nuclear armed missiles. A fear takes hold in the United States that the nation is falling behind the Soviets in terms of technology. John F. Kennedy is elected President of the United States in 1960, as the Soviets seem to have a commanding head start in the space race. Interviews in Episode 8 include Joseph Rotblat, Boris Chertok, Andrew Goodpaster, Herbert York and Gherman Titov. 9. ""The Wall"" 1958--1963 (April 19 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and April 20 at 02:00 GMT) As West Germany and West Berlin become more affluent, East Germans begin to flee their country for their more prosperous neighbor. Khrushchev demands that the British, French, and Americans leave West Berlin, but they decline and the opportunity for a peaceful resolution is dashed when the Soviets walk out on the Paris Summit of 1960 because of the U-2 incident. On the night of August 12, 1962, East German security forces begin to build the Berlin Wall. In response, a tense standoff between U.S. and Soviet forces ensues. In 1963, President Kennedy delivers his famous ""I am a Berliner"" speech.  Interviews in Episode 9 include Anatoly Gribkov, Valentin Falin, Stefan Heym, Egon Bahr, Raymond L. Garthoff and Conrad Schumann. 10. ""Cuba"" 1959--1962 (May 3 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and May 4 at 02:00 GMT) Fidel Castro seizes power as a result of the Cuban Revolution and becomes an ally of the Soviet Union. He begins to nationalize American assets in Cuba, which leads to the United States introducing an economic boycott of the island nation. The United States sponsors a failed counter revolution on the island with the Bay of Pigs Invasion. The Soviet Union begins to move medium range nuclear missiles into Cuba which sparks the Cuban Missile Crisis. The crisis leads to a U.S. blockade of Cuba, and a near war with the Soviet Union. The crisis ends after secret negotiations between the United States and USSR lead to a deal to remove American missiles from Turkey and Soviet missiles from Cuba. Interviews in Episode 10 include Fidel Castro, Walter Cronkite, Pierre Salinger and Theodore Sorensen. 11. ""Vietnam"" 1954--1968 (May 17 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and May 18 at 02:00 GMT) Vietnam's former colonial ruler, France, was forced out of the country after losing the Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Refugees began to flood into South Vietnam from the north, after communists there began a strict land reform program. The Viet Cong, with Soviet help, tries to reunify the country through force. America, supporting South Vietnam, becomes more involved after the Gulf of Tonkin incident. As American casualties continue to grow, so does the unpopularity of a war that seems unlikely to be won. After the Tet Offensive, President Lyndon Johnson's clout is severely damaged. A policy of bombing North Vietnam, while also seeking to negotiate a peace, does not work. Interviews for Episode 11 include Robert Macnamara, William Westmoreland, Nguyen Vo Giap, Bui Diem, Jack Valenti and Clark Clifford. 12. ""MAD"" 1960--1972 (May 31 at 11:00 and 20:00 GMT and June 1 at 02:00 GMT) America's policy of targeting Soviet military bases as a deterrent to war is shown to be ineffective during the Cuban Missile Crisis. A new deterrent policy is thought up by U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, called MAD, or Mutually Assured Destruction. Both Americans and Soviets begin testing and building more nuclear weapons, including submarines that are able to strike should one side destroy the other. Adopting a defensive strategy, the Soviets create an anti-ballistic missile. The United States develops multiple independent warheads to counter this. The danger of the arms race is shown in the Palomares incident. Yet there is some hope of de-escalation after both sides sign the SALT Treaty. Interviews in Episode 12 include Russell E. Dougherty, William Kaufmann and Harold Brown.","CNN International is again airing its 24-part series, The Cold War, which first aired in 1998 .

"Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez used ""coded messages"" in jailhouse calls to discuss the killing of Odin Lloyd, Massachusetts prosecutors said in court papers. Hernandez, 24, is being held on first-degree murder and weapons charges in the shooting death last year of his friend Lloyd. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. In court papers filed Thursday, the Bristol County District Attorney's Office asked a state court to order the Sheriff's Office to turn over recordings of jailhouse calls and records of the people who visited Hernandez since the former tight end was arrested in Lloyd's killing in June. Prosecutors said Hernandez used coded messages when discussing with friends allegations that he planned the June 17 killing of Lloyd in a North Attleborough, Massachusetts, industrial park, where Lloyd was found shot to death. Hernandez's lawyers moved to quash the request, calling it a ""fishing expedition."" ""There is absolutely no basis to provide the Commonwealth with access to all of the defendant's recorded phone calls, past, present, and future,"" his attorneys, Michael Fee and Jamie Sultan, said in their court filing. Those who have visited Hernandez included his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, and cousin, Tanya Cummings Singleton, both of whom face charges in connection with the Lloyd homicide, the court papers said. ""Both of these co-defendants have been charged as accessories in the underlying offense of murder on the theory that they provided assistance to the defendant after the commission of that offense,"" Bristol Assistant District Attorney Roger L. Michel Jr. wrote in a court papers requesting the tapes and records. Michel wrote that in jailhouse phone conversations Hernandez discussed ""matters directly relevant to the circumstances surrounding the murder of Odin Lloyd; viz: the defendant's subjective belief about his criminal liability; his use of coded messages to communicate with persons outside of jail; related prior offenses; inculpatory denials of ownership of a vehicle connected with the investigation; the extent of his control over persons charged as accessories; other matters relating to his codefendants, including their whereabouts and likely criminal liability.'' Both detainees and people they call are warned by the jail that their conversations are recorded. Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death June 17. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later.","Defense attorneys move to block request for Aaron Hernandez's jailhouse calls .

"A first round of Syrian peace talks didn't go too well, and now the government delegation won't commit to a second round. Meanwhile, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime has failed to turn over its known chemical weapons stockpiles on time, causing U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to warn on Friday that all options remain available to force compliance. The dual developments showed the challenges facing efforts by the international community to halt the Syrian civil war through talks intended to set up a transitional government, and rid Syria of its chemical weapons that already have been used in the conflict. President Barack Obama threatened a military response last year when U.S. authorities determined the al-Assad regime attacked its own people with chemical weapons. However, Obama failed to secure backing from Congress or key ally Great Britain. Instead, Syrian ally Russia stepped in to persuade al-Assad to hand over the chemical weapons stockpiles to the international community in order to be destroyed. That process started on schedule, but the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that is overseeing Syria's handover of its stockpiles said Friday that Syrian officials need to speed things up. ""While the two shipments (of chemicals) this month represent a start, the need for the process to pick up pace is obvious,"" Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said. Kerry: Fresh barrel bomb attack shows Syrian regime's 'true colors' Kerry to Syria: all options on the table . In Germany, Kerry said al-Assad ""needs to understand that he agreed to an international U.N. Security Council Resolution which has reinforced a requirement that he remove all of those weapons and that he do so in a specific period of time."" ""Every indication we have is there is no legitimate reason that that is not happening now,"" Kerry said, noting that an international military response remained a possibility. ""And therefore, we call on Bashar al-Assad to live up to his obligations or we will join together with our friends and talk about which, if any, of the options we deem necessary at this point to proceed forward."" In Geneva, the initial talks involving al-Assad's government and the Syrian opposition came to a quiet close on Friday, a week after they started with much fanfare. ""This is a modest beginning, but it is a beginning on which we can build,"" U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi told reporters. He said the peace talks were scheduled to resume in Geneva on February 10. While the opposition has agreed to the date, the Syrian government delegation said it must first consult with Damascus, according to Brahimi. Noting that ""the gaps between the two sides remain wide; there's no use pretending otherwise,"" he said that ""nevertheless, during our discussions I observed a little bit of common ground -- perhaps more than the two sides themselves realize or recognize."" The more than two years of fighting have embittered both sides to the point that reconciliation seems unreachable, particularly involving the opposition demand -- backed by the United States -- that al-Assad can't be part of any future transitional leadership. ""We felt like we were drinking from a poisoned chalice while the criminal was killing our women, children, young men and women, and elderly,"" said a statement released Friday by Syrian National Coalition leader Ahmad Jarba after the close of the first round of talks. ""The only consolation that we had was that the regime which had been oppressing us for more than 50 years had arrived in Geneva to dig its own grave with its own hands."" Brahimi focuses on tiny steps forward . Emphasizing the positive, Brahimi said that over the past eight days, the two sides at least became used to being in the same room, and that moments occurred when one side acknowledged the concerns of the other. Both sides understand that Syria's civil war has caused immense suffering, recognize the urgent need to bring the violence to an end and are committed to discussing the full implementation of the so-called Geneva I communique to achieve a political solution, he said. They also understand the need to rapidly address the humanitarian situation in Syria, wherever that need exists in the country, Brahimi added. However, he acknowledged no breakthrough so far on delivering aid to the besieged city of Homs. ""Some good news came yesterday with the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the Yarmouk camp for Palestinian refugees,"" he said. ""But so much more is needed."" Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said the government was still ""hopeful"" and wanted to engage in dialogue, but that the differences between the two sides had been very apparent. ""They are not in touch at all with what is happening on the ground in Syria,"" he said, adding that Syria rejects outside interference in its affairs. Opposition spokesman Louay Saif said just starting the talks with the government represented progress in the fight. ""We believe the only way to stop violence and to ... end the work of any group that is part of a terrorist agenda is to start the transition,"" he said. A terror group too brutal for al Qaeda? A call for constructive engagement . The U.S. State Department was critical of the Syrian government's delay in confirming the date for the start of the next round of talks. ""The opposition has once again shown a seriousness of purpose in these negotiations by quickly committing to participate in the next round of talks, while the regime continues to play games,"" said Edgar Vasquez, a State Department spokesman. Heading to a security conference in Munich, Kerry described the Syrian conflict as a destabilizing factor in the region. The Munich Security Conference also will be attended by Brahimi, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif -- all major players in the Syrian situation. The Geneva I communique of June 2012 called for a transitional government and for al-Assad to step down. The government has said that is not an option. More than 100,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict, which has forced more than 2 million people to become refugees. Opposition groups have long called on the Syrian government to halt its relentless attacks on rebel-controlled areas. The government argues that it is fighting terrorism backed by outside parties. The conflict has also been mired by accusations that the Damascus government used chemical weapons and that the opposition includes al Qaeda-affiliated groups.","Secretary Kerry says Syria is failing to comply with chemical weapons deal .

"(CNN)There are many reasons why the Internal Revenue Service is perhaps the least-loved agency in America -- a tax code so complex that it seems like you need an advanced degree to understand it, the dreaded audit process and revelations that certain groups have been targeted based on their political beliefs. And now, a growing awareness of instances where the IRS seized the money or property of law-abiding citizens without due process is adding to the agency's menacing reputation. According to the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that investigates civil forfeiture practices, these seizures carried out by the IRS had increased from 114 in 2005 to 639 in 2012. Sounds unbelievable, but believe it. Under a federal structuring statute, banks are required to report all cash deposits of more than $10,000 to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Treasury. To prevent money laundering, deposits purposely ""structured"" to evade this reporting are illegal. Enter the IRS. In Michigan, the IRS suspected a local grocer, Terry Dehko, of money laundering. Without filing charges, it seized his $35,000 bank account. Dehko had to prove in court that his daily bank deposits were for insurance reasons and to reduce robbery at his store -- not a criminal enterprise. Fortunately, the Dehkos won their case, and the IRS returned their funds. Iowa native Carole Hinders has made an honest living owning and operating a restaurant, Mrs. Lady's, for 38 years. But in August 2013, everything she saved -- roughly $33,000 -- was seized. The IRS targeted Hinders because her restaurant only accepted cash or checks, which made regular bank deposits necessary. After 19 months and extensive national media exposure, Hinders finally got her money back. In Maryland, the IRS used suspicions of structuring to seize the operating accounts of locally owned South Mountain Creamery and forced owners Randy and Karen Sowers to prove their innocence. Fortunately, the Sowers settled their case by showing their deposits were legitimate but only after expending extensive time and energy. Recent announcements by the Justice and Treasury departments that they will end most forms of equitable sharing -- the practice of federal law enforcement coordinating with local and state law enforcement for the purpose of pursuing civil asset forfeiture cases -- are a start, but this only affects a fraction of overall seizures. In addition to the IRS, the Department of Justice and U.S. attorney's offices across the country have civil asset forfeiture authority. In fact, the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, run by Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch, has been an active seizure office. A disturbing example under her watch is the Bi-County Distributors case, where her prosecutors confiscated $446,651 from a small business run by Jeffrey, Richard and Mitch Hirsch. It took Lynch two years finally to drop the charges. In light of this case and her office's extensive practice of civil forfeiture -- more than 120 times during her tenure -- it was disappointing to hear her defend the current system during Wednesday's confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Beyond these specific examples of abuse, Congress must take a hard look at the underlying federal civil asset forfeiture policies. Ultimately, the Equitable Sharing Program must be eliminated through legislative action as part of a larger package of reforms to the entire practice of civil asset forfeiture. For this reason, we have combined our previous efforts to introduce the Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act, or FAIR Act, in both the House of Representatives and Senate. It would bolster protections for property and property owners by raising the level of proof necessary for the federal government to prove a civil asset forfeiture case -- requiring that the IRS and Department of Justice prove guilt, rather than the individual prove innocence. Moreover, the FAIR Act eliminates incentives for civil forfeiture by rerouting funds seized by the IRS to the general treasury rather than the unaccountable Asset Forfeiture Fund, which has little congressional oversight and has grown since its inception in 1986 to more than $2 billion in 2013. This fund is the depository for all forfeiture dollars seized by the IRS, Justice Department and equitable sharing partners -- such as local police forces -- at the state and local level. Lastly, the FAIR Act inserts protections by mandating the IRS prove individuals have knowingly violated the structuring statute instead of simply inferring guilt from the deposits themselves. Making cash deposits does not automatically put you under suspicion of criminal activity. The FAIR Act will ensure that federal government agencies, like the IRS and Department of Justice, no longer profit from taking the property of U.S. citizens without due process, while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds of crime. The FAIR Act intends to tilt the playing field back in favor of due process and property rights. We call on our colleagues in Congress to address this issue and join our efforts.","Rand Paul, Tim Walberg: IRS' civil asset forfeiture policies can ensnare the innocent .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Paleontologists have discovered a 50-foot ""dragon"" dinosaur species in China that may have roamed the earth 160 million years ago during the Late Jurassic period. The long skeleton was found in 2006 by farmers digging for a fish pond in Qijiang city in the southwestern Chongqing province. Lida Xing, a member of the research team from the University of Alberta who made the discovery, told CNN it was named Qijianglong, the ""dragon of Qijiang"" because farmers thought the bones resembled the shape of Chinese mythical dragons. ""We found the dinosaur's huge vertebrae with the skull and the tail, but couldn't find any bones from the hands or the legs. So the locals began to say the long body looked just like a dragon from ancient Chinese stories,"" said Xing. The findings, published earlier this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, show that the new species belongs to a group of dinosaurs called mamenchisaurids, known for their extremely long necks, which would measure up to half their body length. Most sauropods, or long-necked dinosaurs, such as those depicted in the popular animated series, ""The Land Before Time,"" have necks that span only one third of their body length. ""Qijianglong is a cool animal. If you imagine a big animal that is half neck, you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things,"" Tetsuto Miyashita, a PhD student at the University of Alberta, said in a press release. The dinosaur is the youngest addition to the mamenchisaurid group, which is only found in Asia. The discovery suggests that there may be other species of long-necks within the genus from different continents. ""Qijianglong shows that long-necked dinosaurs diversified in unique ways in Asia during Jurassic times -- something very special was going on in that continent,"" said Miyashita. ""Nowhere else we can find dinosaurs with longer necks than those in China. The new dinosaur tells us that these extreme species thrived in isolation from the rest of the world.""

"Birmingham, England (CNN)It's 4 o'clock in the morning. Most of Birmingham, the second most populated city in England, is fast asleep. But like a thief in the dead of night, a solitary figure slips through the city's deserted streets. Arriving at a derelict warehouse, he is brandishing what looks like a lightsaber as he makes his way to the roof. Using the resting metropolis as a backdrop, ""Sola"" draws swift shapes in the air with the light wand. Thirty seconds later, the camera shutter clicks and the light artist grabs his kit, disappearing once more into the night. Welcome to the elusive, magical world of ""lightbombing."" ""Sola"" is the street artist alter ego of 40-year-old photographer Peter Medlicott, who has been capturing the urban landscape of Birmingham streets since shortly after relocating there in 2000. Much of the city had become ex-industrial space and Sola recalls how upon first appearances, the city seemed somewhat run down. But a chance late-night shoot revealed the transformative nature of nightfall on the city. What were once dead spaces became a textural stage for the photographer to illuminate. Meeting in the heart of the city's creative quarter, Sola greets me warmly before grabbing a coffee and sitting down. Dressed casually in a sweatshirt, jeans and sneakers, his face lights up with enthusiasm as he begins to explain the art of lightbombing. ""I look like a complete nutter"" Lightbombing is long-exposure photography where the artist draws intricate designs, patterns or words using hand-held lights in front of a camera in pitch black darkness. While many artists around the world experiment with long-exposure photography and light art, Sola coined the term ""lightbombing."" ""It's me, the drunks and the burglars,"" he says grinning. ""To the average casual observer who just happens to come across me, I look like a complete nutter. I'm in the street waving a torch around. It's so dark you can't see my camera 90% of the time. And you're looking at this dude running around, thinking 'What the hell is going on?!'"" His technique borrows elements from graffiti, including ""bombing,"" where the artist gets to a location, does the work and is gone. Sola's physical process lasts mere seconds and leaves a continuous, fluctuating stroke on the final photograph as if by magic.. ""It's like drawing on the page and when I move the light in front of a camera, it leaves that mark. If you go faster, it leaves a thinner mark and if you go slower, it leaves a brighter mark,"" explains the artist. Then for just a brief moment, Sola's face becomes solemn. Although striking and entertaining to see, lightbombing isn't some frivolous hobby.  Explaining his vocation, Sola's voice is filled with passion for his work as he reiterates that what you see is what he shoots. He's adamant that the camera should capture the moment and only permits himself to edit the photographs in as much as a darkroom would allow. ""I never edit my photos. You should shoot it for real,"" he says. ""When I grew up with film, you had to make it in the camera. There was no messing around. You couldn't do much afterwards in post edit. Yet some of the most iconic imagery of all-time was shot on film and very little touches with a brush afterwards on the print. I think there is something important about that."" He adds: ""I very purposefully don't shoot under direct light. I don't hang around. I don't wear bright clothing. I wish I wore some crazy ninja Zentai suit or something."" ""I'm not going to get arrested"" Often he will spend weeks scouting the perfect location for his latest collection. And while he's always eager to find a new space, he says he has no desire to be arrested. ""As long as I don't break anything to get in, I'm not forcing entry. If there is a fence down, there's a fence down. I'm just wandering around. By and large, it is never my intention to trespass. I'm walking around and if there is a way into a space, I might use it."" The popularity of Sola's light art has offered the photographer some exciting opportunities in the last few years, including working with commercial partners such as Nike for ad campaigns and traveling to Dubai for a three-week collaboration with local artists. He has also shot scenes in the British countryside and during the Glastonbury annual music festival. Using the city as his playground, he never returns to the same location twice -- explaining that he thinks it helps keep his work ""fresh."" But just for once, tonight he has driven me to an abandoned car park he recently shot at. As he expertly unfurls his tripod and snaps his camera in to place, Sola claims anyone can duplicate his method -- all you need is a light source and a camera. ""The first few I did were with road safety maintenance lights that you have in your car. You can use anything, you could use your phone. You can use anything that has got a light. I use certain items --  I'm not a painter but they are my brushes and also my sculptor's tools as well. Different ones do different things. Different filters go onto them and to help me realize what I need that light form to do."" After a few test shots to check the light and angles of the moonlit rooftop, he turns on a meter-long light bar with what looks like purple transparency paper taped to one side and begins moving in front of the camera. ""I'm working out which strokes to make and where to put them in order to achieve what I want to do. So again there's little nuances. The perspectives of what you expect it to be are out (of sync),"" he says. ""By using angles and basically taking maximum advantage of the camera and tools at hand to shift the perspectives, I think that's when you start to take it away from being real. It takes (the light sculpture) into a sort of wonderful, mystical element."" Blink and you'll miss it . And how long does it take for Sola to create these dazzling light sculptures? Rather nonchalantly he replies: ""About six minutes. In, out, shoot. Get back in the car."" As he comes back to the camera to check each shot, Sola describes how it is quite meditative to work late into the night and how he often falls into a zen-like state while designing his pieces. But while he waxes lyrical about the metamorphic beauty of a deserted city, he's also quick to remind me of the ever-present danger. ""You're on your own from a safety perspective and it is an expensive camera bag that I'd quite like to keep hold of. It can lead to some hairy moments. I'm pretty much fast enough to get gone. I try to shoot, wherever possible, near to my car. ""Most of the time, when anyone even vaguely sketchy gets close enough, you show them what you're doing and they are so blown away by it that you diffuse the situation."" While he is open to sharing his techniques with the world, this masterful manipulator of light rarely features himself in his work preferring to let the photographs speak for themselves. ""I just want to inspire people with my work. If someone can look at a piece and be excited, inspired, moved in any way shape or form, then I'm happy, job done. Because there is not enough of that in life. And there's too much 'art.' ""This is why I strip away the 'arty' stuff. It's there and I could sit and wax about it but no one wants to hear that really. Everyone can get something different from it. It keeps it accessible to people."" Despite the near freezing temperatures out on city streets tonight, hours fly by as we move from location to location. Finally, after one last shot, Sola makes his way back to the camera, glances at the screen and concludes he's ready to call it a night. As he flips his tripod and pushes the legs back into the locked position, I ask him where he wants to take the moving art form next. ""A lot of my work is very abstract,"" he says. ""A lot of my work has that magical element that wondrous thing, but sometimes there is not enough tangibility to it. The Nike campaign was a starting point. But I'd like to up the game, essentially high-end fashion. Do beautiful work with more people in them. I love the abstract work but for my heart (I) need to shoot with people.""

"(CNN)A jury found Kendrick Johnson's parents and five other family members guilty of misdemeanor charges related to a 2013 protest, attorney Benjamin Crump said Wednesday. State Court Judge Mark Mitchell sentenced them to 12 months in jail and suspended the sentence, so they will spend no more time behind bars and will not be placed on probation. They won't be fined, either. Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson and five family members were convicted of interference with government property for blocking the entrance to the Lowndes County Courthouse in Valdosta, Georgia, and blocking access to the security checkpoint inside the building. The demonstration was planned after Johnson's parents became frustrated with the lack of information they had received from local investigators regarding their son, who was found dead inside a rolled-up gym mat at his south Georgia high school in January 2013, another defense attorney, Chevene King, said earlier this week. Footage published on YouTube shows authorities arresting family members who held hands, blocking a door to the courthouse. Another video posted to a Kendrick Johnson tribute page on Facebook shows family members later, inside the courthouse, joining hands in front of the checkpoint. The family and others can be heard chanting, ""No justice, no peace,"" as officers step in to arrest them. The relatives, who call themselves the ""KJ 7,"" were arrested and released on bond in the April 25, 2013, incident, King said. All seven had pleaded not guilty. Each of the seven family members faced the possibility of up to a year in prison, a $1,000 fine, or both. In May 2013, the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office announced it was closing its investigation into Johnson's death after determining that Johnson, 17, slipped into the mat while reaching for a shoe and got stuck. An autopsy completed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation concluded Johnson died of accidental positional asphyxia. Months later, a pathologist hired by the Johnsons conducted a second autopsy and found evidence of ""unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to the 17-year-old's neck. That pathologist concluded the death was a homicide. In October 2013, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched a federal investigation, which is ongoing.

"(CNN)A custody battle could be brewing over the Florida cat that was supposedly thought to be dead, buried and found alive several days later. The latest in the thickening plot line ripped from an animal version of ""The Walking Dead"": The executive director of the Tampa Humane Society announced the group would not be returning the cat to its owner. Bart, or ""Zombie Cat,"" as he has been called on social media, was discovered ""unresponsive"" by his owner last week lying in a pool of blood.  His body was cold and his face was severely disfigured, representatives from the Tampa Humane Society said. The cat's owner, Ellis Hutson, told the Humane Society that he buried his pet with the help of a neighbor. ""If we'd seen that cat on the road, we'd assumed he was dead,"" said Nash McCutchen, marketing coordinator with the Tampa Humane Society. Five days later, a different neighbor said she found Bart walking in her yard, presumably after he clawed his way out of the grave. The neighbor returned the cat to Hutson, who brought the cat, who was covered in open wounds and dehydrated, to the Humane Society for help. But remarkably, McCutchen said, the kitty had no internal injuries, and on Wednesday, Bart underwent surgery to remove his left eye and have his jaw wired shut.  He had a blood transfusion Thursday, according to the Tampa Humane Society's website. Since the attention Bart received after he allegedly ""rose from the dead,"" more information has surfaced about Bart's ""home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial,"" Sherry Silk, executive director of the Tampa Humane Society said in a release. According to Polk County, Florida, court documents, Hutson was arrested in 1998 and charged with cruelty to animals.  The nature of the charges is unclear, and the charges were later thrown out. A video of a man administering first aid to the cat, along with a Go Fund Me page set up by the neighbor despite the Humane Society's promise to pay for the cat's treatment, have raised doubts about whether Bart was injured the way his owner said. But Silk said she has no reason to believe the story she was told isn't true. ""All of Bart's injuries are consistent with him being hit by a car,"" Silk said.  Likewise, Humane Society veterinarians believe the feline was buried for a time. ""He had dirt in every orifice of his body, and maggots covering his open wounds,"" Silk said. Silk said she also believes that Bart was well taken care of before being injured, because he was a good weight and is a very friendly cat. ""He likes human beings and isn't skittish at all,"" Silk said. Still, after meeting with Bart's owner Thursday for about 40 minutes, Silk said she has to act in the best interest of the cat, which in her opinion means keeping the cat at the Humane Society.  Hutson, however, has refused to sign over his rights to the cat, she said. ""I believe [Hutson] cares about the cat,"" Silk said, but ""we are prepared to fight to keep the cat."" Calls to Hutson were not immediately returned.","Humane Society says it no longer plans to return ""Zombie Cat"" to his owner .

"Washington (CNN)In the end, as it always has been with Mitt Romney, it was about the data. Three weeks to the day since he informed a group of Republican financiers in New York that he was serious about a third presidential bid, Romney on Friday finally pulled the plug on his long and sometimes agonizing political career, telling supporters that he would not mount a third bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Mitt Romney will not run in 2016 . ""He decided he could be the nominee,"" said Tagg Romney, the oldest of Romney's five sons. ""The fear was that in order to get there it was going to be so hard fought that he could not emerge from a position of strength."" The family, he explained, ""all said we would support him, although none of us was looking forward to the process. But no one said we won't go through this."" Romney's decision to forgo a run, made over the weekend in consultation with his family, came on the heels of what associates described as ""frank"" and ""clinical"" strategy session with his closest advisers in Boston last Friday at the offices of Solamere Capital, the financial firm run by Tagg Romney and Spencer Zwick, Romney's top fundraiser. Romney's announcement also came two days after David Kochel, one of Romney's closest confidantes since his days as Massachusetts governor, announced that he would join the likely campaign of Jeb Bush, Romney's top rival for support in the Republican establishment. At the Boston meeting last week, Romney's brain trust gave him a clear-eyed assessment of his chances in 2016, with some aides chiming in via conference call. ""It wasn't pandering and persuasion,"" said one person on the call. ""It was, 'Here's the data.'"" Mitt Romney exit widens path for Jeb Bush . Ever since Romney trial-ballooned his campaign at the office of Republican bundler Woody Johnson earlier this month, his donor network had grown lukewarm to the idea, his former staffers had started accepting offers with other potential candidates, and the media consensus about ""Romney 3.0"" had teetered somewhere between skepticism and ridicule. Some of his closest longtime associates, including Boston-based advisers Eric Fehrnstrom and Peter Flaherty, were pushing him to run. His wife Ann was also supportive, sources told CNN, though anxious about putting themselves through the grueling process of a national campaign once again. And one source close to the family says that a donor — on his own — did some ""in-depth private polling and the results were shocking"" about how strong Romney was running. Others in his camp expressed wariness of another campaign against a much stronger field than the cast of gadflies, flameouts and polarizing conservatives that Romney faced in 2012. Romney was told that while his old grassroots supporters and field organizers in early states like Iowa and New Hampshire maintained deep respect for him, they were not enthused about a third campaign. Perhaps more frustrating for a businessman who prided himself on the formidable financial network he built in 2012, Romney learned that Bush, who had jumped into the presidential fray quickly in early January, was quickly siphoning away his support among top donors and was winning the early battle for GOP establishment money. In almost every big donor state, Bush was securing commitments from bundlers who once ponied up for Romney. Tagg Romney: I'm both 'sad and relieved' at dad's decision . Still, his team, ever loyal to the man they affectionately called ""the Guv,"" were in agreement that they would make it work if he wanted to gas up the Rambler for one more ride. ""The takeaway was, there is enough wood here to build a fire,"" said another close Romney adviser who joined the meeting. ""We thought it was was possible. But it would be hard. Last time we had all the winds at our back and this would have been difficult, but absolutely doable. Look, if people like Rick Santorum can get in, then it's a no brainer that the governor could have done it, and done it well."" Said the adviser: ""The polls had him up. That was residual name ID. But he can't carry that for a year. It would have been a fight."" At the Friday meeting, aides were given assignments to start pulling together operational plans. Advisers also concluded that it would be smart to launch some kind of political action committee to begin raising money and send a message to donors that his interest was more than just a Hamlet act. ""People said, 'We have to get ready to take the next step,'"" said one adviser. ""If he is not ready to run, we need to announce a committee, because we have to start raising money and sending a message to people."" But when there was no follow-up from Romney this week, people began to wonder if he might be pulling back. According to Tagg Romney, his father came to the conclusion that he was ""unlikely"" to enter the race that weekend, but wanted to sit on the decision for a few days. 3 clues from Romney's day in Mississippi that he wasn't going to run . Many of Romney's supporters say his decision to opt out by no means takes him out of the race entirely. Longtime Romney adviser Ron Kaufman said that Romney believes ""the best role for him is to help formulate the message and help the winner of the primary process deliver that message."" ""I think he came to the conclusion that while yes, he can win the primary, yes, he can raise the dough, perhaps he can beat Mrs. Clinton, there's an easier path to winning the presidency if Mitt doesn't get involved but stays above it as the most popular Republican in the country,"" Kaufman said. But Jim Merrill, Romney's top New Hampshire strategist, said the governor had arrived at the conclusion that it was time to step aside and let others take up the party mantle. ""I think having run before, he understands how grueling it is. He knows it would be a challenging primary. Knowing what we went through in 2012, I think he decided it was time for other voices to be heard."" Romney mentioned the need for other voices to be heard in the bowing-out statement he read to supporters on a conference call Friday. But implicit in his words was a critique of Bush, not exactly the new face Romney was describing as his preferred nominee. ""I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders, one who may not be as well known as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started, may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee,"" Romney said. ""In fact, I expect and hope that to be the case."" Romney and Bush have a cordial relationship but are not close. Romney's advisers have said that the 2012 nominee is skeptical that the mild-mannered Bush, who last ran for political office almost a decade ago, is ready for the grindhouse of a modern campaign and the media scrutiny that comes with it. Still, it was Bush who outmaneuvered Romney in the early stages of the so-called ""invisible primary,"" lining up donors and well-regarded staff talent with haste. His hire of David Kochel, formerly Romney's top strategist in Iowa, blindsided Romney this week. Bush's swift behind-the-scenes maneuvering, which his advisers have described as a ""shock and awe"" strategy, rattled Romney once he caught wind of it in early January. The Bush activity prompted Romney to announce his interest in the race three weeks ago and ""freeze"" donors in place as he thought through the practicalities of another campaign. But it became clear that many of his former financial supporters and staffers were not only moving to Bush, but also other candidates vying for mainstream Republican support, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Romney's decision to pull back on a campaign gives renewed life to all of them, said James McCray, a Republican fundraiser. ""With Romney out, the field is back open and it emboldens other candidates who are trying to be the anti-Jeb,"" he said. ""Who is going to be the alternative to Jeb Bush and Rand Paul on the right?""","Romney made decision not to run last Sunday .
He didn't inform many advisers until Thursday night ."

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)Before prosecutors wrapped up their case against him, Eddie Ray Routh's words were in the spotlight Tuesday. A chilling video shown in court showed police placing Routh into a squad car moments after authorities chased him down a Texas highway. Earlier that day in February 2013, authorities say he gunned down two men who were trying to help him at a firing range: Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film ""American Sniper,"" and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield. In the video, Routh is breathing heavily and teary-eyed. An officer asks if he's OK. Routh replies: ""I'm just so nervous about what's been happening in my life today. I don't know what's been happening. I've been so paranoid schizophrenic all day. I don't know what to even think of the world right now. I don't know if I'm insane or sane."" At times, Routh appears agitated in the video. He squirms around the back seat. Other times he rests his head with his eyes closed. The small arsenal of weapons Kyle brought to the range that day was shown to the jury, which included five long rifles and several handguns, including one of Kyle's rifles labeled ""American Sniper."" According to defense attorneys, Routh, in his psychotic state, thought he was walking into a showdown on the range . Another piece of evidence prosecutors presented Tuesday: a recording of a conversation Routh had while behind bars. From inside the jail where Routh has spent the last two years, he spoke with a writer from the New Yorker Magazine three months after the shootings . Routh can be heard saying he was annoyed at Kyle and Littlefield. ""So we're shooting pistols here huh? Hmmm, OK, Again, that's pretty much saying duel motherf*****."" Later in the interview, he's asked what sparked the killings. Routh blames Chad LIttlefield for not shooting with him. ""I was like what the f*** are you even doing here man? This isn't a spectator sport, it's a shooting sport, you shoot. And that's what got me all, you know, wired up."" He also said: ""I took care of business and then I got in the truck and left."" Routh's lawyer admits his client killed Kyle and Littlefield, but contends he was insane at the time. Prosecutors have described Routh as a troubled young man, but they argue he wasn't insane; they say these are the actions of a cold-blooded killer. Taking the stand for the defense, mother Jodi Routh painted a different picture, describing her son's history of mental health problems. After his time serving in the military, she said, ""he was no longer his happy-go-lucky self."" His first stay in a VA mental ward was for three days in 2011, she said. Then he returned again, against his will, and spent weeks in the facility. When he was released, she said, he was on nine different medications, including mood elevators, anti-psychotic medications and sleep aids. Jodi Routh said she had asked Kyle to help, telling him that her son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She told Kyle that her son had been hospitalized multiple times, but did not tell him that he'd also threatened to kill himself and his family. ""Do you regret not sharing that level of detail?"" prosecutor Jane Starnes asked. ""I just wanted to get help for my son,"" the mother replied. Routh's trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history, with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. ""American Sniper,"" directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, has grossed the most ever for a war movie. Kyle's autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. He had already risen to fame through his book when he died, and was involved in charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to the firing range as a kind of therapy. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated. A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","Eddie Ray Routh is on trial for the 2013 shooting deaths of Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield .

"(CNN)As a former football player with both an imposing physique and personality, few people have felt comfortable calling ""Suge"" Knight by his birth name, Marion. Even Suge is short for a family nickname that hardly seemed fitting for one of hip-hop's most feared impresarios: ""Sugar Bear."" Being known as big and cuddly is not how Knight rose to fame. Instead he is best known for helping promote West Coast rap in a field that had long been dominated by East Coast artists -- and elevating an East Coast/West Coast hip-hop feud to a level that many still hold accountable for the deaths of two of the genre's biggest stars. How the co-founder of Death Row Records -- who is being held in connection with one's man death in an alleged purposeful hit-and-run -- came to be considered such a tough guy is equal parts legend and rap sheet. Born in Compton, California, as the youngest of three children and the only son, Knight had sports ability and size, earning a  football scholarship to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. His former coach told the Las Vegas Sun in 1996 that Knight was a good kid. ""He wasn't a problem guy at all,"" said Wayne Nunnely, who was school's head coach in 1986 when Knight played there and who later went to work for the New Orleans Saints. ""You didn't really see that street roughness about him."" Knight briefly played as a defensive lineman for the Los Angeles Rams before becoming a bodyguard for singer Bobby Brown. That gig didn't last long but helped give him a larger glimpse into the music industry. Being from Compton, Knight had for years been friends with fellow native Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young, a member of the controversial rap group N.W.A. Its hard-core songs include ""F*** tha Police,"" which helped form the basis for what became known as ""gangsta rap."" The oft-repeated tale is that to get Young released from his contract with Ruthless Records owned by fellow N.W.A. member Eric ""Eazy- E"" Wright, Knight appeared at the label's offices with a group of men armed with pipes and baseball bats. ""I know you've heard all the stories,"" Knight told a New York Times Magazine writer in 1996 about the incident. ""But you have to realize one thing: results."" Young was eventually released  from his contract and became Knight's flagship artist when he co-founded Death Row Records in 1991. Another infamous story had Knight dangling rapper Vanilla Ice over a balcony to get the latter to share the profits from his hit song ""Ice Ice Baby."" The rapper,  whose legal name is Robert Van Winkle, has since said the incident has been exaggerated. ""I went to my hotel room and Suge was in there with several people,"" Van Winkle said during a 1999 VH1 ""Behind the Music"" episode about his career. ""He let me know he wanted to get some points off the record 'Ice Ice Baby.' Suge took me out on the balcony, started talking to me personally. He had me look over the edge, showing me how high I was up there. I needed to wear a diaper that day. I was an 'investor' in Death Row Records with no return on my money."" The rapper added, ""He didn't hang me off from any balcony, okay. The story's been kind of blown out of proportion and I want to clarify that Suge and I have no bad feelings towards each other."" Knight's roster of artists included several who were no strangers to violence and run-ins with the law, including Snoop Doggy Dogg (later known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. In 1994 Shakur accused producer Sean ""Puffy"" Combs and rapper Christopher ""Biggie Smalls"" Wallace with being involved in an incident at a New York studio in 1994 in which Shakur was shot. Both Combs (who over the years has also been known as ""Puff Daddy, ""Diddy"" and ""P. Diddy"") and Wallace denied the accusations. But the tensions intensified in 1995 after Knight gave a speech at the Source Awards, where he said, ""Any artist out there that want to be an artist and stay a star, and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the record, dancing ... come to Death Row!"" Many took the comments as a direct dig at Combs, who often appeared in his artists' music videos. The following month Jake Robles, a Death Row employee, was killed during a late-night party in Atlanta in which both Knight and Combs were present with their entourages. Those from Knight's camp blamed Combs' bodyguard, and the death brought public visibility to what was known as the East Coast/West Coast rap war. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. The following year Wallace was shot to death while riding in a caravan in Los Angles that included his friend and mentor Combs. There was speculation that both of the deaths were tied to the feud, though the slayings remain unsolved. In 1996, Knight was sent to prison for almost five years for assaulting a man in a Las Vegas hotel on the night Shakur was killed. In 2002, he was jailed for violating his probation by associating with known gang members and again the following year for punching a parking attendant outside a Hollywood nightclub. In 2005, Knight was shot in the right leg at a party in Miami held in honor of Kanye West's planned appearance before the MTV Video Music Awards. History repeated itself in August 2014 when Knight was shot six times at another pre-VMAs party, this one hosted by singer Chris Brown. In October, Knight and comedian Micah ""Katt"" Williams were arrested for allegedly stealing a photographer's camera. His legal issues and the departure of many of his top acts resulted in Knight's label filing for bankruptcy in 2006. In an interview with Rolling Stone in 2013 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Snoop's debut album, ""Doggystyle,"" Knight portrayed his label as a trailblazer. ""Death Row wasn't only a black-owned record label, Death Row was pretty much the only American-owned record label,"" he said. ""Everything else was either Sony or some other thing. ""It became the blueprint for any label that's out, including the majors,"" he said. ""I was the first person doing 360-degree deals with all the artists; the majors would tell the artists, 'It's the worst piece of s**t deal in the world, don't go for it.' And now they're doing it.""","Marion ""Suge"" Knight is a former football player .

"Washington (CNN)Mitt Romney's decision to pass on 2016 anoints Jeb Bush as the clear establishment favorite in the Republican presidential race and lays down a challenge to the party's divided conservatives. Though the first contests will not take place in early voting states for a year, Romney's swerve, announced on a conference call with supporters on Friday, is the most important moment yet in the nascent GOP contest. It removes the prospect of a bruising battle for big establishment donor cash and moderate, right of center, Republican primary voters between Romney, the 2012 nominee and Bush, heir to a dynastic political machine. ""I think it is hard to argue that today's news did not help Gov. Bush,"" said Matt Moore, chairman of the Republican Party in South Carolina, which holds one of the crucial early voting primaries next year. Bush sent the Republican race into overdrive with his sudden announcement last month that he was actively exploring a run for president. Since then, he has been flying around the nation in an apparent bid to put up a formidable ""shock and awe"" early fundraising number to  define the contest in his favor. Though Bush is seen as leading establishment Republicans, Romney's decision could improve New Jersey Gov. Christie's hopes of financing a long campaign. ""Today's news certainly does re-open the fight for donors. I know many donors had been frozen in recent weeks, taking a 'wait and see' approach,"" said Moore.  ""There's a finite amount of money that can be raised -- so every candidate benefits."" Kevin Madden, a one-time adviser to Romney who is now a CNN commentator, said his former boss's decision opened up an early trial of strength between Christie and Bush. ""This becomes the first big test between those candidates, which one of them can quickly move to lock down those donors. It is a very successful, very large fundraising network. It's going to be an important asset."" Some party insiders also believe conservative candidates who can also straddle the line with the establishment could benefit from Romney's departure. A top adviser to one potential Republican primary contender said in an interview that Romney's exit likely helps both Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who both have strong conservative support but have also been warmly received by some establishment-minded donors. ""They're acceptable to the establishment but they also have support within the various conservative bases — among economic conservatives, social conservatives and national security conservatives,"" the adviser said. Romney's decision not to run doesn't remove him from the 2016 calculus entirely — it sets him up to be a potential kingmaker in one of the most wide-open primary fields in recent memory. Though sources told CNN's Dana Bash not to expect a Romney endorsement of another candidate in the near future, contenders will be clamoring for his blessing. A top Rubio aide said ""any leading candidate would"" want Romney's support. Jim Merrill, Romney's top strategist in New Hampshire, said that his ""guess is [Romney] probably will"" endorse a candidate in the primary. Romney's statement, however,  made clear that he was not stepping aside in favor of Bush. In fact he appeared to take a veiled swipe at the 61-year-old former Florida governor. ""I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders, one who may not be as well known as I am today, one who has not yet taken their message across the country, one who is just getting started, may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee,"" Romney told his supporters. He appeared to be implying that the GOP would be best served by a younger candidate taking on Clinton, who will be 69 at the time of the general election in November 2016. Rubio, 43, quickly picked up on the idea of a generational shift, stressing repeatedly in a short statement praising Romney that he was close to the 2012 nominee. ""He certainly earned the right to consider running, so I deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to lead."" Walker, 47,  also picked up the signals, thanking Romney in a tweet for ""opening the door for fresh leadership in America."" Romney may also be making a point by sitting down for dinner on Friday night with Christie, 52, in New York. His exit will also shift the terrain more practically in the early states, where his former staffers can now join the campaign of their choice. Merrill said he's been receiving calls from former Romney operatives in the state — and interested candidates — wondering what's next, but he wasn't yet leaning toward any candidate in particular. ""[Romney's] not gonna be a candidate, so that means we are open for business,"" Merrill said. Reverberations are also being felt in Iowa, where voters will get the 2016 ball rolling next year and where Romney lost by only a handful of votes to Rick Santorum on the way to the GOP nomination in 2012. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll published Friday showed 57 percent of likely caucus goers had favorable feelings about Romney. But that figure was down from 65 percent in October. Romney may have calculated that he would have struggled to keep that level of support, fighting Bush and Christie for moderates and facing fresh faced conservatives like Walker and firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz. ""There a lot of people who had second thoughts about Romney,"" said Steffen Schmidt, an Iowa State University Professor who is an authority on the state's fabled caucuses. ""Mitt Romney would have had a much harder time in Iowa,"" in 2016, Schmidt said. Bush is basking in a second straight day of good news. On Thursday, he poached David Kochel, one of the state's most highly regarded political consultants for a possible post running his campaign. Kochel previously worked for Romney in Iowa, and his departure was seen as a serious blow to the former Massachusetts governor. The narrowing of the establishment field may hold a wake up call for conservatives who hoped a candidate preferred by the grass roots would emerge this cycle. But with candidates like Walker, Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Santorum and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul all tipped to appeal to certain sections of the conservative electorate, they face a familiar problem : the lack of a single right-wing favorite to take on the establishment's pick. Romney's announcement, which kept political pundits guessing until minutes before he spoke with supporters, was in keeping with the already rich drama of the 2016 race. Even a month ago, no one thought that Romney, who twice ran for president and lost, could find a rationale to underpin another shot. But in three frenzied weeks, Romney, apparently disdaining the quality of the crowded GOP race, and bumped into a swift decision by Bush's early move, appeared to be about to jump in. Bush had previously effectively forced out another possible establishment candidate Sen. Rob Portman, by getting into the race. Romney traveled to California to headline the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, and stoked speculation by consulting former staffers and party heavyweights about a possible run. For now, most of those close to Romney believe he will resume his role as the de-facto leader of the party until a nominee emerges,  speaking out on key issues. ""You'll see him do what he's already been doing post-2012 — be someone that stands up to President Obama, speaks the truth when the opportunity calls,"" Merrill said. CNN's Erin McPike contributed to this story .","Bush cements role as establishment favorite .

"(CNN)George Zimmerman was arrested, again, this month in the suspected aggravated assault of a girlfriend. And, again, a Florida prosecutor has opted not to press formal charges -- after the alleged victim backed off her claims. State Attorney Phil Archer, whose jurisdiction includes Brevard and Seminole counties, announced Friday that his office won't file charges against Zimmerman, who first came to the world's attention for his arrest and eventual acquittal in the 2012 shooting death of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin. Friday's announcement relates to the 31-year-old's arrest in Lake Mary, Florida, on January 9. ""While it clear that the officers had probable cause to arrest Mr. Zimmerman, which was affirmed by the circuit court judge at initial appearances, the subsequent recantation by the (alleged) victim of her initial statement along with new documents provided by the victim and her attorney precludes my office from proceeding further,"" Archer said. Zimmerman attorney Don West had told reporters that his client was accused of throwing a wine bottle at a girlfriend. Police learned about it days later after coming ""in contact with the (alleged) victim at a traffic stop,"" Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett said. The woman has since denied that Zimmerman threw a bottle or that she ever feared him, according to a statement Friday from Lake Mary police. ""She also made it clear that she did not want to proceed with the case,"" said police, noting that Lake Mary police Chief Steve Bracknell ""concurred with Archer's decision."" ""A lack of eyewitnesses or other corroborating evidence to dispute her version of the incident also contributed to the decision."" This is the latest instance since July 2013 -- when a jury found him not guilty of murder in Martin's death -- that Zimmerman has had a run-in with the law, only to have authorities decide not to push for a trial. About two weeks after the verdict, he was pulled over for speeding in northern Texas. Much bigger troubles came in November 2013, when Zimmerman was taken into custody at his then-girlfriend's Apopka, Florida, home after the two allegedly had a heated fight. He was arrested then on aggravated assault and misdemeanor counts of domestic violence battery and criminal mischief, accusations, posting $9,000 bail days later. But after the girlfriend asked that the issue be dropped, Archer announced that prosecutors would not press charges. Gillett has said the woman in the more recent instance ""is not the same (woman) as in 2013."" Also, in September 2014, Lake Mary police said that a man claimed Zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident saying ""I will ... kill you,"" and ""Do you know who I am?"" He was not arrested and has not been charged. Talking about the aggravated assault cases, West said earlier this month of his client: ""It's clear he hasn't been very lucky with the ladies the last few months."" The lawyer also said then that Zimmerman doesn't have a full-time job, implying that he's had his struggles since the Martin case -- which made him into a national lightning rod when it came to the merits of ""Stand Your Ground"" laws and matters of race. ""It's been a devastating experience that he's had that he's working through,"" the lawyer said. ""... I'm concerned, obviously."" CNN's Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","A Florida opts not file a formal aggravated assault charge against George Zimmerman .

"Jeddah, Saui Arabia (CNN)A planned flogging for a Saudi blogger was not carried out Friday -- the third straight week that a scheduled set of 50 lashes was postponed after he endured wounds in an initial set in the conservative kingdom -- his sister told CNN. The reason why Raif Badawi received another reprieve Friday wasn't immediately available, but previous postponements were made because doctors determined he was too badly injured in his first beating January 9 to withstand more, according to Amnesty International and his wife. The case of Badawi, who was sentenced last year to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes after a Jeddah court convicted him of insulting Islam, has garnered international headlines and global outrage. Badawi started a blog called ""Free Saudi Liberals"" in 2008 to encourage discussion about Islam, particularly the intrusion of the nation's religious police in Saudis' personal lives. He was officially charged with ""adopting liberal thought,"" ""founding a liberal website,"" and insulting Islam, and was convicted of the latter. Badawi received his first 50 lashes on January 9 and was taken back to prison. He wasn't flogged as scheduled in subsequent weeks, including this Friday, his sister, Samar Badawi, said. Said Boumedouha, deputy director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program, said last week that Saudi authorities should ""publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally,"" rather than assess his fitness to be flogged week by week. ""Raif Badawi is still at risk. There is no way of knowing whether the Saudi Arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead,"" Boumedouha said last week. CNN's Victoria Eastwood reported from Jeddah. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Previous postponements came after doctors found Raif Badawi hadn't recovered from his first beating .

"(WIRED)Here on Earth, it's easy to take things for granted. Drinking a cup of coffee, for example, is a shockingly simple act when you're affected by gravity, yet it's infinitely more difficult once you leave Earth's atmosphere. In space you don't sip, you suck, from a bag. That's a good thing. The typical coffee cup simply doesn't work in low gravity, unless you want scalding hot liquid floating through the air. It takes a special vessel to get liquid from an open container into an astronaut's mouth. It also takes a helluva lot of science, as seen by the cup designed by Portland State University researchers. For the past year, scientists there have been developing a mug designed specifically to allow astronauts to sip on espresso (or other warm and frothy drinks) in low-gravity environments. The cup's shape is odd—a little like a plastic baby boot—and was determined by mathematical models. Every curve and geometric shape is designed to encourage the controlled movement of liquid. You'll notice a pointed corner in the center of the cup; this strange bit of design is what makes it possible to drink liquids in low gravity. The corner essentially acts like a wick, using surface tension to guide liquid toward your mouth. 12 Most Ancient and Magnificent Trees From Around the World . As soon as an astronaut touches her mouth to the lip of the cup, a capillary connection is formed and the liquid travels up the vessel and forms sippable balls of coffee. It sounds simple enough, but designing a cup for space requires a deep understanding of how fluids move in low gravity. ""We're geeks, and we make spacecraft fluid systems,"" says Mark Weislogel, a professor of mechanical and mechanical engineering who is leading the research. ""It's like space plumbing."" On a day to day basis, this means Weislogel and his team solve problems like how to get rocket fuel to move on its own, or how to process urine using a device that has no moving parts. It turns out that all the data gleaned from capillary flow experiments aboard the International Space Station also is relevant in designing a low-gravity espresso cup. What Cities Would Look Like if Lit Only by the Stars . The project an evolution of Don Petit's low-gravity cup, which he designed on the ISS in 2008 as a means of drinking coffee in something approaching a normal fashion. It used the same principles employed by the espresso cup—an sharp interior corner angle that draws liquid upward—but was far less sustainable and scalable at that point. The Portland team began working on the problem after Italy announced it would send an espresso machine to the International Space Station later this year. No respectable espresso-drinking astronaut wants to sip brew out of a bag. The pleasure of drinking espresso comes from the inhaling the aroma and sipping the crema, the frothy, oily bubbles that sit at the top of your glass. That can't happen when you're drinking from plastic bags. In a field where efficiency is priced above comfort, it's fair to ask: Who really needs an open-top cup? But a reusable cup like this could actually be a boon for astronauts, especially now that the ISS has a 3-D printer on board. 21 Awesomely Well-Designed Products We're Dying to Own . Once refined, Weislogel believes a design like this could save valuable volume and weight on a spacecraft destined for a long haul. That won't be for a while. The cups are still in the testing stage, and they cost $500 to 3-D print in the transparent plastic. That's not exactly cheap, but Weislogel believes it's a relatively small price to pay when testing the same fluidic system theories would cost millions to test on rocket engines (he suspects they'll spend $100,000 before testing on the cup is complete). ""It's a fast way to get a bunch of engineering and science data,"" he says. ""Also it's fun.""

"(CNN)There's been a lot of buzz about the ""zen"" of the Seattle Seahawks. Some people are wondering whether their regular yoga and meditation sessions give them an edge over the competition. Fact is, many teams and individual players across the NFL have been practicing yoga for years. I worked with my first pro football players, two tight ends from the New England Patriots, back in 2006. NFL players, like weekend warriors, save their biggest events for the weekends (with the exception of Monday and Thursday-night football, of course). Therefore, they need to be smart all week about preparing their bodies and minds for the big game. For my football clients, yoga is an essential part of that preparation. Mobile midbacks and hips with stable cores and shoulder girdles are important for any athlete, but especially athletes that have to absorb impact. When mobility and stability are limited in any of these areas, the risk of knee, low-back and neck injuries increases dramatically. The same mentality applies to weekend warriors, who likely spend much of their week as desk jockeys then suddenly take part in strenuous activity. Unless they integrate mobility exercises into their everyday lives, they risk wrenched backs, sprained knees and dislocated shoulders during even the friendliest of touch football games. To avoid injury and work towards Super-Bowl shape, weekend warriors can use some of the same techniques and moves I teach in pro football. Here's a sample: . Quick-and-easy breathing meditation: . The mental game is no joke! Neither is a stiff ribcage that impedes movement. Not only can your breath relax and focus your mind by tapping into your parasympathetic nervous system, the quality of your breathing dictates your ribcage position, which affects your core strength and upper-body range of motion. Start and end your yoga practice with a minimum of two minutes of deep, diaphragmatic breathing with your eyes closed. Inhale through your nose into the bottom and back of your lungs. Exhale slowly and fully, releasing the ribcage downward by engaging core muscles to assist. Pausing briefly after exhalation stimulates a naturally deeper inhalation. Try breathing at this pace: 5-count inhalation. 5-count exhalation. 3-count pause. Practice 10-to-20 rounds of breath, focusing all of your attention on your breathing. Most people don't realize that meditation can be that quick and easy! Extended angle . Stabilizes and mobilizes hip joints, increase core strength and enhances midback rotation . From a deep lunge with your left foot forward, place your left hand on the mat or a block just inside of your left foot. Reach your right arm overhead, trying to match the angle of your side body and back right leg.  Engage your core for stability. Be sure the rotation of your chest and ribcage is coming from your midback. Hold the for three long, deep breaths. Repeat on the other side. Side plank variation with hip and leg lift . Lengthens abductors (outside of hip) and glutes; strengthens shoulder and obliques (side core) In side plank, with your feet stacked, be sure the shoulder of your supporting arm is behind your wrist. Step your top foot down to the floor in front of your pelvis. Press through your heel as you lift your hips and raise your top arm. Hold for three long, deep breaths. Switch to the other side. Standing straddle with twist . Lengthens abductors (groins) and hamstrings; enhances midback mobility . From a standing straddle with your toes pointed forward, hinge from your hips and fold down to place one hand on a block. Twist from your midback to reach your opposite arm skyward, trying to align your wrists vertically. Keep your lower back level and stable. Engage your core and press through the outer edges of your feet for stability. Hold for three long, deep breaths. Repeat with the other arm. Do the practice above several times a week for the best results. With just three moves and some breathing, you can easily start your day with it or even integrate it into the beginning or end of your workouts. Think yoga isn't cool? I know quite a few 280-pound NFL players who would disagree. You probably don't want to argue with them.","Many teams and individual players across the NFL have been practicing yoga for years .

"New York (CNN)Add Wall Streeters to the list of Republican power players uneasy about the prospect of another Mitt Romney bid for the White House. The corridors of high finance were the target of intense hostility during Romney's last presidential run. President Barack Obama's campaign successfully seized on the former Massachusetts governor's time at private equity firm Bain Capital to paint a picture of an industry that destroys middle-class jobs while wealthy executives reap generous profits -- often taxed at lower rates. Financial executives remember the attacks in 2012 all too well and, faced with the possibility of another Romney campaign, are wary of another round of negative attention. ""His formal entry will shine brighter light on some of the issues in the industry that people in the industry would rather not have a bright light on,"" said Jonathan Foster, managing director of the New York-based private equity firm Current Capital. Romney told supporters Friday he won't embark on another campaign. The Private Equity Growth Capital Council, a Washington trade group that spearheaded a campaign in 2012 to improve understanding about the industry, stood ready to beat back criticism if Romney went back on the campaign trail. PEGCC is ""prepared to engage and counter any mischaracterizations and attacks from the right or the left that could undermine the reputation of the private equity industry,"" Ken Spain, the group's vice president of public affairs, said in an email before Romney's Friday announcement. Romney faced widespread skepticism from plenty of fellow Republicans who questioned his conservatism and ability to bond with voters. Everyone from News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch to rank-and-file GOP members of Congress threw cold water on the idea of a third Romney campaign. That would have made make finance -- where Romney spent decades of his professional life -- even more important as he sought political and financial support. In a sign of the industry's significance, Romney made one of his first significant public acknowledgments that he is seriously considering another campaign to GOP donors in New York this month. If Romney ran again, the spotlight would have again shone most brightly on the private equity sector, which acquires companies and restructures them with the end goal of turning a profit. Scott Meadow, a private equity investor who has done business with the former governor, said one of the biggest challenges in 2012 was to get the media to portray fairly the kind of work that PE does and the range of organizations, such as pension funds and endowments, the industry supports. ""It really felt like it was not in the interest by the press to get out -- to really explain what the idiosyncrasies are and benefits are to private equity,"" Meadow said, adding that there's a prevailing sense among PE executives that it's ""a waste to go forward trying to defend the industry."" But there's no sign that the climate for Romney has improved since 2012. The wealth he accumulated during his years as a PE executive will still be scrutinized, as issues like income inequality and raising the minimum wage have become even more politically potent. The midterm elections in November demonstrated that private equity -- which had already become a better-known household phrase thanks to the 2012 elections -- remains a rich target for criticism. In several key statewide races across the country, politicians with PE backgrounds, including gubernatorial candidates Bruce Rauner in Illinois and Tom Foley in Connecticut, were targeted by their opponents for their work in private equity as well as their massive wealth. Rauner won his race, while Foley and other PE candidates, such as Senate hopeful Greg Orman in Kansas, were defeated. ""His opponent basically trashed the hell out of him and trashed the hell out of the fact that ... companies that he invested in killed old people or something like that,"" said Bill Daley, Obama's former chief of staff, who served as an adviser on Rauner's transition team. ""Those sort of stories are tailor-made out of the private equity industry.""","Private equity could be back in the spotlight if Mitt Romney runs for president .

"After 208 episodes, countless ""legendarys!"" and any number of pineapple incidents, slaps and slutty pumpkins, ""How I Met Your Mother"" came to an end Monday night. Throughout the final season, the show hinted at who the mother is. Still, the nine-year-long story that future Ted Mosby had been telling his kids ended with plenty of surprises. Now that we've said goodbye to Ted and his friends and the hit sitcom that often challenged the conventions (like, say, telling stories in chronological order), let's turn to the cast and the creators as they look back. Kids, here's how they'll remember ""How I Met Your Mother."" How they knew the show would last . Carter Bays (co-creator): When we first started making the show, we had this weird, naïve idea that it would run a long time. It was our first show and we didn't really know about how often shows get canceled, but there was always this special feeling about the show, that it would really last a while. Craig Thomas (co-creator): The cast were like, ""This is too fun, this is doomed to fail, we can't be allowed to do this for nine years."" And we were just stupidly optimistic. It could have failed a few times, but thank God it didn't. Pamela Fryman (director): The pilot was so special, getting to discover who these characters were to become. Whether it's a two-minute date or a song-and-dance number, everything has made me better. If you asked me before if I could do any of those things, I'd probably say no. Josh Radnor (Ted Mosby): I remember feeling that first episode with Ashley Williams, I remember Pam called us into watch that. I remember thinking, ""This is a really special show."" It does things differently than other shows. It uses so many different styles. We half-intentionally created something new and we hope it will stick around. How much impact guest stars had . Bays: Having Britney Spears here was pretty memorable. We were such a garage band show, we were doing OK in the ratings but weren't really on anyone's radar, then suddenly this international superstar parachutes into the set and it was a very bizarre week. Alyson Hannigan (Lily Aldrin): Jennifer Lopez was adorable. She called my little girl a coconut. How they made their favorite episodes . Neil Patrick Harris (Barney Stinson): Barney had a big musical number about suits on the 20th Century Fox lot, like an old Gene Kelly musical, I even swung around a lamppost. I loved that episode, plus I got to sing and dance. Cobie Smulders (Robin Scherbatsky): I loved our ""Two Minute Date"" with Josh and Sarah Chalke. I love anything that involves music. Carter and Craig are so musical. They were in a band together and I was really happy that they brought their musical talent to our show. Hannigan: There was one scene where I was pregnant with my first baby. Marshall was meeting me at the airport and had this marching band play for me and greet me at the airport. It was really awesome. Radnor: I love when you get to see what's in Ted's heart. When he's just really present with someone. I did some great stuff with Cobie this year. I've had a nice parade of co-stars, co-girlfriends for Ted. Everyone brings out something different from me. How they feel about the show's catchphrases . Hannigan: I really like ""you son of a bitch""... ""youuuu son of a beetch."" Harris: I like the way Barney uses ""legendary,"" because it's a very loaded word. No one should ever use the word ""legendary,"" because if you're talking in the present tense, you sound kind of pompous. Unless you're Barney Stinson, because he thinks every single thing he does is massive. ""This interview right now is legendary. This will be in the Smithsonian!"" How they spent nine years . Jason Segel (Marshall Eriksen): Watching my co-stars have their children was special. I didn't literally watch the act of giving birth, but it's been special watching them grow up. Smulders: A lot of these people have been here for the whole nine years. We have a family dynamic on our set and I will miss that. Hannigan: I went through both of my pregnancies on the show. Harris: I'm gonna miss ""It's Wednesday, we've gotta go to work."" Now it's Wednesday, I've gotta get a job. Thomas: We've worked so hard for nine years, we don't have any friends. These nine characters are our friends. Thank God we have each other. How they said goodbye . Smulders: We had our last table read and I cried puddles of tears. It's such a good group of people, such a great show. I get to play such a wonderful character. I'm so blessed and I'm sad to say goodbye, but we've been blessed to be on the air for nine years which doesn't happen anymore. Thomas: We're five seconds from crying at any given moment. Segel: I don't want to go out on a limb, but I will. This is potentially the best finale of any show ever ... with the possible exception of the second ""Newhart"" series.","'How I Met Your Mother' ended Monday after nine seasons .

"(CNN)When you were young, what did you dream of being ""when you grew up""? Is it what you've ended up doing? You may dismiss those childhood aspirations as unrealistic now you're an adult with responsibilities and bills to pay, but that role reflected what you enjoyed doing and who you were at that time. ""The dream jobs we aspire to as children are a window into our passions and talents,"" says LinkedIn's career expert Nicole Williams. ""Identifying and understanding those passions are key to improving our performance and enjoyment of the jobs we currently do, even if they aren't specific to the careers we dreamed of as kids."" So, what influences our childhood aspirations? ""When we're small most of us have a limited idea of what's out there,"" explains career coach Meredith Haberfeld. ""It is shaped by the exposure we have -- the people that have a big impact on us and the standards and social expectations around us"". Our families greatly influence our outlook on life. If we look up to one family member in particular, we tend to be drawn to their careers as we want to be like them. Indeed, when Meredith was a little girl, she wanted to be a librarian because her grandmother, who she admired, was one. And it's not just our relatives' roles at work that can influence children's aspirations. The gender roles that our parents take on at home can also dramatically impact our childhood career choices. A study by Alyssa Croft, of the University of British Columbia, found that the division of labor at home had implications for how girls' identities developed in gender roles. Croft told CNN that fathers' behavior around the house seems to be ""predicting their daughter's career aspirations"" beyond what they ""might be publicly endorsing or specifically saying about gender roles."" She found that if fathers talked about supporting gender equality but didn't take on an equal role in domestic tasks then this sent conflicting signals to their daughters, which led to daughters placing more weight on their father's actions, rather than his words. By contrast, where fathers demonstrated their beliefs in gender equality by taking on an equal distribution of domestic tasks then their daughters would select roles ""that are more gender neutral or even sort of male-stereotypic like being a scientist or athlete,"" Croft says. And that could have a major impact on our pay check down the line. Research by the London School of Economics, published in the journal Social Forces, found that girls who aspired to traditionally female-dominated occupations were far more likely to earn lower wages in their first job, since stereotypically ""female"" jobs tend to pay less. ""Stereotypically 'male' or 'female' preferences that children exhibit during childhood continue into, and affect, their adult lives,"" says Lucinda Platt, Professor of Social Policy and Sociology at LSE. Our early experiences can also have a bearing on what we see as our ""dream job"" -- a positive experience linked to a potential career can be hugely inspiring. ""I went through an intense marine biologist phase fueled by a life-changing snorkeling expedition when I was seven years old,"" reveals Hayley Barna, co-founder and co-CEO of beauty start-up Birchbox. And inspiration can also strike at school, if we learn about a career that resonates with us. ""When I was in the 4th grade [aged 9-10] I learned about lobbyists. I thought it would be amazing job to try and influence important issues,"" says Joanne Bradford, head of partnerships at Pinterest. When we are young, our aspirations are a response to our circumstances; but Haberfeld says that when the time comes to start ""designing"" our careers we begin tuning in to what we feel ""compelled to express"" about ourselves. Clara Shih, founder of Hearsay Social, started out with a long and varied list of possible careers -- she went through phases of wanting to be a teacher (like her mother), a police officer, an astronaut and an attorney. ""Only in high school when I began programming computers, did I become interested in tech and start-ups, which led me to attend Stanford and major in Computer Science,"" she says. While many of us turn our backs on our childhood ambitions when faced with the realities of life as a ""grown-up,"" some really do end up in their dream jobs. A survey of the childhood career aspirations of more than 8,000 professionals from around the world, carried out for social networking site LinkedIn, found that 30.3% of the site's members were either currently in the job they had always dreamed of, or in a career linked to those plans. Creator and presenter of Digital Futures Shivvy Jervis is one of those living out her early dreams. ""Even as an eight-year-old, swinging ponytails et al, I would wave around my plastic mic and scrawl little 'scripts' to deliver to a pretend audience!"" she says. ""When I was fifteen, I announced with assured clarity to my family that my 'dream job' was to be a producer and TV journalist."" Sometimes our careers begin at such an early age that there's little to think about. Four-time Paralympic champion Ellie Simmonds OBE started swimming when she was five; by the time she was eight she was competing against able-bodied children. ""I'm not sure I thought too much on what career I was interested in when I was a child,"" she says. ""I always just wanted to have a farm and work with horses when I was very young, though the thought of working with children is something I've thought about since. ""I'm very fortunate that my swimming career took off when I was very young, so it was never really a question."" But no matter how early we step on to that treadmill, it's never too late to change tack; thinking back to our childhood ambitions can help us work out which aspects of our current job we love. After Hayley Barna's marine biologist phase passed, she says, ""I never had a single career in mind. I always pictured myself being able to do many things at once: engineer, President of the United States, investment banker, professional skier, magazine editor... ""I haven't checked the box on any of those specifically, [but] I feel lucky that my current role blends a lot of different disciplines."" When we were children, our aspirations were limitless and anything seemed possible; by recapturing that excitement and allowing it to inform your research and networking, 2015 could be the year you find your dream job.

"(CNN)Haven't you had enough for a week, Old Man Winter? Apparently not, in New England at least, where even more snow fell -- or is expected to fall -- Friday, on top of the several feet that socked some places a few days ago. Wait, that's not all. After receiving up to 6 more inches of snow, bitter cold wind chills and strong winds into Saturday morning, the Boston area could see another snowstorm Sunday night into Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Granted, none of it will compare with the blizzard that blew through New England from Monday through Wednesday. Few communities were spared, with some getting buried under about 3 feet of snow. Others, such as the Massachusetts island of Nantucket, got hit by especially severe winds that knocked out power. And there was Marshfield, Massachusetts, which had blizzard conditions -- meaning a whiteout with heavy snow and regular winds of 35 mph or more -- for 14 hours and powerful storm surges that crumbled a seawall and significantly damaged 11 homes. The latest weather event isn't a blizzard, but rather a ""clipper"" storm swooping down from western Canada to the east. It gets its name from clipper ships, sailing vessels known for their cutting speed, the weather service says. This time around, Maine is in the bull's-eye. Snow had already begun falling before dawn Friday in Portland, and it's expected to add up to as much as 10 inches by the time it's over Saturday afternoon. That is not a lot for winter in Maine. But it could be a problem, considering that crews were still rushing Friday morning to clear out some of the 27 or so inches that fell from the earlier storm. ""Particularly after the storm we had Tuesday, which was a monster storm, the cleanup really takes a little bit longer. And to have this back-to-back storm, it just makes it much more difficult for us,"" Portland Mayor Michael Brennan told CNN. Some areas of Maine -- all of which is under a winter storm warning through Saturday -- will get hit even harder than Portland, with 2 more feet of snow possible in the northern part of the state. ""Clean up, clear out and stay safe,"" the Maine Emergency Management Agency advised residents. Some of that system will affect areas farther south such as Massachusetts, where daytime high temperatures should peak around or just above the freezing mark. That will seem practically tropical compared with the temps once the sun goes down, when wind chills will fall below freezing and wind gusts could top 43 mph. It won't get much warmer anytime soon. The forecast for Boston doesn't have temps getting beyond the 20s through Thursday, at least. That's not beach weather, but it's not surprising either. Speaking for Mainers, Portland's mayor expressed confidence that people will get through this latest wave of winter just fine. ""We really do have some practice at this,"" Brennan said. ""And this is winter in ... New England."" CNN's Sara Ganim reported from Portland, Maine.","Portland, Maine, mayor says back-to-back storms pose a cleanup challenge .

"Sprint tumbled to last place in this year's Consumer Reports rankings for U.S. wireless service providers, based on a survey of users. Although it trailed only first-place Verizon in overall customer satisfaction among major carriers, Sprint got what Consumer Reports called ""dismal marks"" for value, voice, text and 4G reliability. ""Our latest cell service satisfaction survey revealed a somewhat precipitous decline by Sprint that shuffled the rankings of the major standard service providers,"" said Glenn Derene, electronics content development team leader for Consumer Reports. ""And smaller, no-frills, no-contract and prepaid service providers continue to do a better job of satisfying customers, and provide an increasingly viable alternative to some of the expensive, long-term contracts that many consumers find themselves locked into."" The rankings, released Thursday, were based on a survey of 58,399 wireless subscribers. Sprint said the slip likely is due to improvements the company is making to its network. ""We've asked customers during the past year to 'pardon our dust' as we build out and upgrade our network,"" Sprint said in a statement. ""We're working to deliver an advanced wireless network that we believe over time will deliver unmatched speed and performance to our customers."" NFL lagging on stadium Wi-Fi . The statement said that, in markets where the work is complete, the company is seeing higher customer satisfaction. It noted an American Customer Satisfaction Index report this year that ranked Sprint as the most-improved company across 47 industries during the past five years. ""The findings in the Consumer Reports' survey indicate we still have work to do and only serve to make us even more committed to providing outstanding wireless service to our customers,"" the statement said. Small providers scored well with Consumer Reports, beating out the nation's major players. Consumer Cellular was the overall leader, gaining high scores across the board even though, as Consumer Reports pointed out, it uses the same network as  AT&T, which ranked lower. Many small carriers offer no-contract and prepaid plans that some consumers prefer. AT&T, which along with T-Mobile finished in the middle of the field among major carriers, was the only company to receive the highest ranking for the reliability of its 4G service. T-Mobile lets customers upgrade phones twice a year . According to the Consumer Reports survey, 38% of respondents who had data plans that set limits on usage used only half, or less, of their monthly allotment. That, the group said, may mean many customers paid for wireless service they didn't need. More detailed survey results are expected to be posted Thursday on the Consumer Reports website.

"The director of the VA hospital in Augusta, Georgia, has publicly apologized for the deaths of three veterans at the facility that were caused by delays in care. The rare public apology from an official at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs was prompted by a CNN exclusive investigation on Tuesday that detailed the deaths at the Augusta facility, and also other deaths and delays at other VA hospitals. ""All of us at the Charlie Norwood VA Medical Center are deeply saddened by the loss of any veteran at our facility, "" said director Robert Hamilton. ""We offer our sincerest condolences to veterans affected by delays in GI care and families who have lost a loved one."" The CNN investigation revealed that military veterans are dying needlessly because of long waits and delayed care at U.S. veterans hospitals. The investigation found that the situation has been especially dire at the Williams Jennings Bryan Dorn Veterans Medical Center in Columbia, South Carolina. There, veterans waiting months for simple gastrointestinal procedures -- such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy -- have been dying because their cancers aren't caught in time. The VA confirmed to CNN that there have been six deaths at the Dorn facility tied to delays. But sources close to the investigation there told CNN the number of veterans dead or dying of cancer because they had to wait too long for diagnosis or treatment at that facility could be more than 20. CNN learned from documents and interviews that other VA facilities have been under scrutiny by officials over possible delays in treatment or diagnoses. Shortly before CNN published its report Tuesday, the VA acknowledged that there have been concerns about delay of care at some of its other facilities. At the Augusta medical center, the VA confirmed Tuesday to CNN that three veterans died as a result of delayed care. Internal documents at that facility showed a waiting list of 4,500 patients. The VA also acknowledged Tuesday that it investigated delays at facilities in Atlanta, northern Texas and Jackson, Mississippi. The VA said no ""adverse outcomes"" because of delays were found at the centers in Texas and Mississippi. But the VA denied CNN's repeated requests for interviews with either local facilities or officials in Washington, DC. Then, on Thursday,  the chief of the Norwood facility met with reporters to answer questions about the CNN story. Hamilton only became director in mid-2012, after much of the delays there had already been ongoing. In an  interview Thursday with CNN, Hamilton said the hospital had looked back at dozens of patients records out of concern for possible delays in care or treatment. ""We reviewed a total of 80 cases, and after careful review of both internally and externally into our organization we found that seven were related to a delay in care,"" he said.  The facility sent notifications, or ""institutional disclosures,"" to those seven veterans or their families about the delays in care. Asked whether  there might be more veterans dead or dying as a result of the delays in care at Norwood, Hamilton said:  ""We've had no additional fatalities at this point, and we are not aware of any additional requirements for any institutionalized disclosures based on the evidence."" Hamilton said by mid-2012 the delays in the gastrointestinal section of the hospital had grown to large numbers. ""We were looking back at a potential delay in GI consults of about 5,100 total,"" he said. On Tuesday, the VA  said in a statement to CNN, ""The Department of Veterans Affairs is committed to providing the best quality, safe and effective health care our Veterans have earned and deserve. We take seriously any issue that occurs at one of the more than 1,700 health care facilities across the country. The consult delay at Dorn VAMC has been resolved."" The statement added that cases are now tracked daily, and additional staff members were hired. But sources at Dorn -- both patients and medical staff -- tell CNN that's just not true. The problems continue, and veterans are still facing delays that could be killing them.","America's war veterans are dying because of long waits and delayed care, CNN has found .

"Jerusalem (CNN)The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah has said that it wants to de-escalate hostilities on the Israeli-Lebanon border, a day after fighting left two Israeli soldiers and a Spanish peacekeeper dead, Israel's defense minister said Thursday. Hezbollah sent the message through intermediaries, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israel's Army Radio. ""There are nonofficial channels between us and Lebanon to communicate through UNIFIL (United Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon), and indeed a message like that was received from Lebanon,"" Yaalon said. On Wednesday, Hezbollah fired five antitank missiles at Israeli military vehicles in the disputed Shebaa Farms area, killing an officer and a soldier, the Israeli military said. Sgt. Dor Chaim Nini was 20; Capt. Yochai Kalangel was 25, Israel Defense Forces said. The attack took place near Shebaa Farms, also known as Har Dov, a disputed strip of land between Lebanon and Syria adjoining the Golan Heights, under Israeli control. Seven Israeli soldiers were injured, two of them moderately, the Israeli military said. Hezbollah claimed responsibility for the attack. Yaalon accused Iran and Hezbollah of planning an attack from Syria on the Golan area, which is under Israeli control. ""This reflects a general picture that Iran and Hezbollah are trying to heat up the region and Golan Heights area because it is easy for them to operate in."" He warned against such attacks, saying: . ""The IDF is ready and we will not allow any terror parties to act against us. And the hosts behind those terror groups we will not allow to attack IDF or civilians. We must protect civilians both offensively and defensively."" The Spanish service member, Cpl. Francisco Javier Soria Toledo, was serving with UNIFIL, the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon. He was killed ""during the incidents that happened between Hezbollah and the Israeli military"" Wednesday, the Spanish government said. UNIFIL said that its personnel ""observed six rockets launched toward Israel"" Wednesday morning, and that the IDF ""returned artillery fire in the same general area."" It was unknown whether the peacekeeper, 36, was killed by Israeli or Hezbollah fire. The Israeli military told CNN it is investigating. CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Two Israeli soldiers killed, seven wounded in a Hezbollah missile attack Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Jane Fraser is the CEO of U.S. Consumer and Commercial Banking and CitiMortgage and is often cited as one of the most powerful women in banking. She tells CNN's Poppy Harlow how women lead differently from their male counterparts. CNN: Do women run banks, or businesses differently? JF: We do, and it's not just a gender thing. If you're from Asia you run it differently than an American -- it's just true diversity. In the private bank I worked in, a third of the leadership team was female, you then had a slight shift in the way the team worked. I often put women into roles where they're thinking about the broad franchise, they have this awareness of collateral damage and can be more nurturing. They really build the team, they want to win as much as the men, they just don't need all the badges. Being qualified . CNN: Do you sometimes take a job before you feel ready? And believe that if you are being chosen for it, you will learn on the job? JF: I've moved into three businesses that I didn't know anything about. It's all about the team you get, you have to get very comfortable choosing people who work with you and who are going to be better than you. Your job is to lead, not to have all the answers. CNN: When you took the job at CitiMortgage, 90 percent of people said to you that you were crazy. Why? JF: I'd been running a private bank at Citi, which is a joyous franchise because you get an opportunity to meet some of the most successful business men and women in the world. A lot of your day is spent talking to clients, it's truly a privilege. To do that and then move to a business that was at the beginning of a very negative cycle -- it's not an obvious move from a business that's in good shape. But I love the opportunity to turn something around, to try and make a difference. Being balanced . CNN: How did you balance your work and home life? JF: My husband was running a bank, over in Europe, we sat down in 2008 and said; 'one of us has to stop for family'. He's a decade older than me and he said, ""Okay, I'll be the one who will go and do something different."" There was no way we could carry on. That was the peak of the (financial) crisis.

"(CNN)Lindsey Vonn is back on a podium. True, Vonn has barely been away from one. Just ask Tiger Woods, who lost a tooth when a camera hit him in the face while cheering Vonn onto the podium in Italy last month. But Tuesday's podium was special. It marked the ski superstar's first medal at a World Championships in four years. The 30-year-old came to this year's World Championships, in Beaver Creek, Colorado, having just set the all-time record for wins on the regular, season-long women's World Cup circuit. And she maintained some of that momentum to finish third in Tuesday's super-G, her opening event, behind Slovenia's Tina Maze and victorious Austrian Anna Fenninger. Fenninger won with a time of 1:10.29 in windy conditions, becoming the first woman to win back-to-back Olympic and world super-G titles. Before Fenninger's run, Vonn had temporarily led the field with 1:10.44. Not that Vonn celebrated her return to a major podium too wildly. ""I thought I skied pretty well,"" said the bronze medalist. ""I'm happy with the result. I just wish the weather was a little bit better."" Golfer Woods, undaunted by his dental disaster last month, once again turned up to support Vonn. His girlfriend last won a world medal in 2011 -- downhill silver in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany -- and previously won both the super-G and downhill world titles in 2009. She also took Olympic downhill gold and super-G bronze at the Vancouver 2010 Games. However, Vonn missed Sochi 2014 through injury. She crashed and tore ligaments racing in the super-G at the 2013 Worlds, then re-injured her knee in a training accident later that year. ""Sometimes good skiing is enough to overcome the weather,"" she added following this year's third-place finish. ""Sometimes it's not. Today, it wasn't enough. ""But I have to say, Anna Fenninger skied exceptionally well. She definitely deserved to win the gold medal today."" Vonn remains the favorite for Friday's downhill. Meanwhile, 37-year-old compatriot Bode Miller is set to race in Wednesday's men's super-G, despite only having completed training runs since undergoing back surgery three months ago.","Anna Fenninger wins super-G world title with Lindsey Vonn third .

"While immigration reform is stalled in Congress, some members are calling on President Barack Obama to take the matter into his own hands, urging him to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants. Thirty Democratic members of Congress wrote in a letter that he has the authority to pause deportations of undocumented immigrants, urging ""the sensible and moral step of stopping deportations."" Read the letter . ""In fact, taking a strong step toward granting relief would move us in the direction of where the immigration debate rightfully should start, with the legalization of eleven million men and women who call the United States their home,"" the letter states. The lawmakers are the most prominent of a growing chorus calling on Obama to use his executive authority to exercise ""prosecutorial discretion"" to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants. The issue catapulted to prominence last week when an audience member, Ju Hong, shouted at the President during an event in San Francisco, demanding that he stop deportations. The President immediately rejected Hong's demand, saying he doesn't have the authority. Now, some members of Congress say he does. Obama said he can't stop deportations of immigrants, but maybe he can . ""Mr. President, you do have the power to stop what's going on,"" Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York, said at a news conference on Thursday. In their letter, the members point to executive action in 201,2 when Obama exercised his discretion to suspend deportations of children of undocumented immigrants, known as Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals. ""Please, Mr. President, do something,"" said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois. ""We need you to take the kinds of positive action to help our families."" Although Obama has used his discretion to save some from deportation, he has aggressively expanded the program. He has expelled more people than any other president: For instance, 410,000 people were deported in 2012, compared with 116,000 in 2001. In their letter, the lawmakers say that 1,100 people are deported every day. Obama has shifted the type of immigrants targeted for deportation. While the administration of President George W. Bush targeted working immigrants by raiding workplaces, Obama is focusing on convicted criminals and ""egregious"" immigration violators, including recent border-crossers and illegal re-entrants. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says its efforts are effective, pointing out that 55% of people deported last year were convicted criminals. ""Criminalizing American families or giving local law enforcement the responsibility to choose who stays and who goes is not the right option,"" the letter reads. 4 ways immigration reform could still happen - or not . The Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform this year, including a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the United States. The legislation has been stalled in the House and is unlikely to be taken up before the end of the year.","Some lawmakers call on President Obama to suspend deportations .

"(CNN)A gas truck driver and two assistants were arrested Friday in connection with a deadly gas explosion that leveled part of a maternity hospital in Mexico City, killing at least three people and injuring dozens, authorities said. The blast occurred at about 7 a.m. Thursday with more than 100 people inside Cuajimalpa Maternal Hospital -- minutes after a hose burst on a truck supplying gas to the building. Rescuers rushed from the rubble with babies in their arms. Paramedics hauled bloodied victims on stretchers. The truck operator was identified as Julio César Martínez and his two assistants as Carlos Chavez and Salvador Alatorre, according to Rodolfo Rios Garza, a local attorney. The charges against them were not immediately available. Two of men in custody are hospitalized, and a third, with less serious injuries, was checked at a hospital. Ivonne Lugo Durantes told CNNMexico she spent 10 minutes trapped under rubble before rescuers reached her. The supervising nurse called her husband, Mario Angeles Sanchez, after the blast. As she described what was happening, he heard people in the background screaming for help. ""I am still a little bit in shock. It was a nightmare,"" she said, describing how hospital workers tried to rescue babies from a nursery as flames engulfed the building. A nurse and two babies were killed by the blast, Mexico City Health Secretary Armando Ahued told CNN affiliate FOROtv. At least 73 people were injured, he said, including about 20 newborns. Outside the hospital, frantic family members searched for word of loved ones they feared were inside. Searching continued Thursday evening at the site, though officials said it appeared everyone had been accounted for. Jose Eduardo was relieved to learn his wife and son, who was born Wednesday, had survived the blast. He heard about the explosion on the news from his home, where he'd gone to rest after the baby was born. He rushed to the hospital to be by his wife's side. ""She told me that it started to smell like gas and the ceiling started to fall on everyone,"" he told CNNMexico. ""She covered up the baby and ran."" His wife was barefoot when she escaped, he said. Others were naked. ""We started pulling babies from the debris who were alive,"" Ignacio, a volunteer at the scene, told CNN. ""We pulled out, fortunately, I think we pulled out seven. We would've wanted to pull out more."" Witnesses said the explosion shook the neighborhood. ""We heard something, and it smelled so much like gas, really a lot. And then two minutes, three seconds later, we saw an explosion that made everything fly in the air,"" witness Teresa Ramirez told CNNMexico. ""It threw me to the ground."" Virginia Gonzalez, who lives near the hospital, said her patio was covered with broken glass from blown-out windows. After the explosion, Mexicans eager to help lined up at hospitals where victims were being treated, offering to donate blood and bringing bottled water and diapers for survivors. Lugo, the nurse who was inside the hospital during the explosion, told CNNMexico she is suffering from first-degree burns but feels lucky to be alive. ""I feel grateful to have another chance to keep living,"" she said, ""to keep working as a nurse."" First, calls came into firefighters reporting a gas leak at the hospital, a facility on the southwest outskirts of Mexico City that is part of the government health system. Hospital workers had already started evacuating the building when the explosion happened minutes later, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told reporters. One of the city's publicly accessible webcams captured the blast, showing a plume of smoke rising from the direction of the hospital. A truck was supplying gas to the hospital when apparently a hose burst and the resulting leak caused an explosion, Mancera said. The gas in question is known as liquefied petroleum gas, a mix that could be mostly propane or mostly butane. These propane/butane mixes are commonly used in Mexico for heating, cooking and other fuel applications. Gas Express Nieto, the company that owned the truck, has operated in Mexico City since 2007 and has a contract to supply gas to hospitals run by the Mexico City government, the mayor said. The hospital is 70% collapsed, Mancera said, although some walls and steel columns are still standing. Journalists James Fredrick and Sheila A. Sanchez Fermin and CNN's Krupskaia Alis and Fidel Gutierrez contributed to this report from Mexico City. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Mayra Cuevas contributed from Atlanta.","Three men arrested in connection with the blast at hospital .

"A recent search of the home of George Zimmerman's girlfriend uncovered five weapons, including an AR-15, and more than 100 rounds of ammunition, court documents filed Monday show. Zimmerman, acquitted in the death of Trayvon Martin this year, was arrested last week at the home, which he shares with his girlfriend, on suspicion of his having pointed a shotgun at her. He was released on bail and has entered a plea of not guilty. A search of the home turned up three handguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, a rifle and 106 rounds of ammunition, including two AR-15 magazines, according to a search warrant. Three handgun holsters, a pack of gum, a religious pendant, a flashlight, a pocket knife, sanitizing wipe, a soft-sided gun case and a combination lock were also recovered during the search. At the time of his arrest, Zimmerman had two cell phones. An affidavit, filed Monday, says he told authorities he recorded the altercation with his girlfriend on his cell phone. The Florida judge that set his bail put numerous conditions on it: . -- Zimmerman cannot go to two Florida addresses.-- He cannot have contact with the accuser, Samantha Scheibe.-- He cannot possess weapons.-- He must wear a monitoring device.-- He cannot travel outside Florida. Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the Sanford neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin's father lived in February 2012. Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, had a confrontation with the unarmed African-American teen after calling police to report a suspicious person and he said he shot Martin, 17, in self-defense. Zimmerman was acquitted by a six-person jury in July on second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. The high-profile case sparked a heated nationwide discussion of race as well as debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law.","Authorities search the home Zimmerman shared with his girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe .

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a breakthrough drug Friday to treat chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) is the first drug that has been shown to safely and effectively treat certain types of hepatitis C infection without a need for interferon, the FDA said. Hepatitis C is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver, which can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. About 3.2 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Sovaldi is the second drug that the FDA has approved in the past two weeks to treat chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Olysio (simeprevir) was approved on November 22. Dr. John Ward, director of the Division of Viral Hepatitis at the CDC, in a statement called this a ""landmark advance in the treatment of hepatitis C, opening up new opportunities to stop the spread of this virus and the ravages of this disease."" But new therapies only work if people actually receive treatment, he added. ""The potential of these and other treatment advances hinges entirely on our ability to get more people screened and into care,"" he said. ""Right now, most Americans with hepatitis C don't access treatment because they have no idea they're infected."" Chronic hepatitis C infection can lead to long-term health problems and even death, according to the CDC. The virus is spread primarily when individuals have contact with the blood of someone who is infected. Sharing needles or equipment to inject drugs is how most people who become infected acquire the disease. The disease can also be spread through sexual contact, but the risk is believed to be low, according to the CDC. Sharing personal items such as razors or toothbrushes, which may have had contact with the blood of someone who is infected, is another less common risk. It may take several years for symptoms to become apparent to individuals infected with hepatitis C. Most people with the disease have no symptoms until liver damage becomes apparent. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, dark urine, clay-colored bowel movements, joint pain and jaundice, according to the CDC. The disease is the most common cause of cirrhosis and liver cancer, and the leading reason for liver transplantation in the country, according to the CDC. Hepatitis C causes about 15,000 deaths each year in the United States. The CDC urges all U.S. baby boomers, and others at risk, to get tested for hepatitis C. ""Widespread screening, together with new cures, promises to slash the burden of hepatitis C in this country and save thousands of lives,"" Ward said.","Sovaldi has been approved to treat chronic hepatitis C .

"(CNN)It's a story that could have borrowed some of its plot from a Bollywood movie, but audiences might have scoffed at the improbable ending Krishna Poonia achieved in real life. A script containing some classic storytelling themes -- poor rural upbringing, family tragedy, arranged marriages and political ambitions -- was afforded its defining element when Poonia put in an historic performance at the Commonwealth Games held in 2010. In the entire 80-year history of the quadrennial sporting jamboree, no Indian female had ever claimed gold in a track and field event until Poonia snatched a momentous victory in the women's discus. Her winning throw of 61.51 meters led an Indian clean sweep in the event (compatriots Harwant Kaur and Seema Antil took silver and bronze respectively) and also ensured India's first win in the athletics stadium since the runner Milkha Singh, known as ""The Flying Sikh,"" dashed to gold in the men's 440 yards at the Games held in Cardiff, Wales way back in 1958. ""I can never forget that moment when I won the gold medal and when I took the victory lap with the flag,"" Poonia told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""For four years I was seeing the moment in my dreams and now I was finally seeing it in reality,"" she added wiping away tears from her eyes. Poonia could be forgiven for welling up given her journey from provincial backwater to a packed stadium in New Delhi. Born in the small town of Agroha in the state of Haryana, Poonia was brought up in by her father and grandmother after her mother died when she was just nine years old. Living among the Jat people -- a traditional agricultural community in northern India -- Poonia recalls a childhood where physical fitness was honed working the land not at play on a sports field. ""Most people are agriculturalist and their routine is to get up early and feed the livestock and after breakfast they leave for the fields,"" she explains. ""My family had a milk dairy and we had around 70-80 buffalo. The work of the milking was only done by the family ... and when I was (15-16 years old) I would help, milking seven to eight buffaloes in one go."" School afforded something of a respite from this routine as well as providing an outlet for her growing interest in sport which was exercised further as she continued her formal education. ""When I got to college I used to compete with the other girls. My height and strength was good -- I could throw well,"" she explains. It was during this time that she got married, but rather than strangling her sporting ambitions, wedlock set them free. ""In our community we mostly have arranged marriages, but by the grace of god or luck my husband was a sportsman,"" she said. Virender Singh had been a promising junior hammer thrower who had won medals at Asian Youth Games before injury forced him into early retirement. But when he married Poonia his sporting energies were revitalized as he applied himself to the role of husband and coach. ""After getting married to Virender, I got to learn a lot -- he knew about the Asian Games, the Olympics and knew what it meant to win medals ..."" she said. ""When he told me about it I thought that I should be a part of it as well."" With his knowledge and his unflinching support -- ""he had 100% belief in me,"" she says -- Poonia set about trying to achieve her newly-discovered sporting goals. There were setbacks along the way -- a back injury in 2000 almost finished her career and the birth of a son the following year meant she had to juggle parental responsibilities alongside training - but her commitment paid off in the long run. Bronze medals at the 2006 and 2010 Asian Games preceded her historic gold medal performance at the Commonwealth Games. More records were broken two years later at the London Olympics when Poonia became the first Indian woman ever to reach the Olympic discus final, eventually finishing a creditable sixth. The 32-year-old has since used her sporting fame to good effect away from the discus circle helping the Rajasthan state Health Ministry in their campaigns to curb the ongoing curse of female foeticide. The selective abortion of female fetuses is a continuing problem in India, and is particularly prevalent in Haryana where Poonia grew up, according to UNICEF. She has also been actively involved in trying to improve sporting facilities for children in Jaipur, where she lives with husband and their 13-year-old son, and across the country. ""If you see the schools we have in India there is no ground or fields for the kids to play in. Physical (education) isn't given much importance. It is said that childhood grows as you play and that's how sport starts,"" she says. ""I came from a village. If I can reach (the top) level then why can't other girls from villages do that,"" she says. Poonia's attentions have switched to politics in recent years, joining the center-left Congress party -- headed by Sonia Ghandi -- in 2013 and it looks like the final chapters of her sporting script may be being penned now, although she's keen to compete at the Rio Olympics next year. But the narrative that seeks to re-write traditional attitudes towards women in wider Indian society is only just beginning. ""For a very long time, the culture of our country has been a very male dominating one and the male child has been given a lot of importance,"" she says. ""Until the time we are not able to abolish the discrimination of a boy and a girl within the family this thing will continue -- (a child's) thinking develops from this situation."" Poonia also advocates that dowries -- which are officially banned in India, though gifts to grooms and his family are still common -- should be put towards a girl's education so ""she is able to stand on her own two feet,"" she says. ""They say the first teacher is the mother. If she is educated she will give good virtues to her children she can change the atmosphere of her house. The base of our society starts from there."" Few would argue with that assertion.","Krishna Poonia became first Indian woman to win Commonwealth Games gold in track and field .

"A compromise federal budget plan that would remove the threat of a government shutdown for two years won easy approval Thursday from the Republican-controlled U.S. House. The deal worked out by House Budget Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray passed on a 332-94 vote and now goes to the Democratic-led Senate, which is expected to approve it next week in a very close vote. It represented rare convergence between the two parties on government spending after two years of bitter debate and political brinksmanship that included the 16-day shutdown in October. A White House statement said the measure does not include everything President Barack Obama called for, but ""it marks an important moment of bipartisan cooperation and shows Washington can and should stop governing by crisis and both sides can work together to get things done."" Public anger over the Washington dysfunction, especially with conservative Republicans who triggered the shutdown by trying to link federal spending to their efforts to dismantle Obamacare, motivated GOP leaders to shrug off far right opposition to the budget compromise. A small step . House Speaker John Boehner acknowledged the measure amounted to only a small step toward the GOP goal of deficit reduction and balancing the budget, but he rejected opposition by some conservatives in his caucus as well as outside groups on the political right. ""Is it perfect? Does it go far enough? No, not at all,"" Boehner said in urging his colleagues to back the plan, noting it resulted from ""doing what the American people expect us to do -- coming together and finding common ground."" Ryan noted that Washington politicians have ""been at each other's throats for a long time"" over budget issues, and Republicans must first win some elections in order to get all the deficit reduction and spending cuts they want. Democrats also hailed the budget proposal as a ""small positive step forward,"" in the words of Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. He and other Democrats called for Congress to also extend long-term unemployment benefits for more than 1 million Americans set to expire after Christmas, but their support for the budget plan showed they dropped any demand to link the issues in Thursday's vote. In the House vote, 169 Republicans voted for the spending plan while 62 opposed it, with 163 Democrats in favor and 32 against. While most Republicans supported the plan, Boehner needed help from Democrats to get the 217-vote threshold needed for passage. Top GOP Senate aides said they expect the budget to pass the Senate but it could be by a razor thin margin. This could also change if momentum against the bill grows. GOP conservatives including Ted Cruz of Texas, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, said they will oppose the measure, which would need some Republican support for Democrats to overcome an expected filibuster. ""The new budget deal moves in the wrong direction: it spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare,"" Cruz said. ""I cannot support it."" Graham and Ayotte said they opposed cuts to pension benefits for some military veterans under the spending plan. Escalated criticism . Boehner earlier escalated his criticism of such opposition from conservative colleagues and outside groups in a rare public display of a longstanding rift between the GOP tea party wing and less extreme establishment Republicans. To Boehner, groups such as Americans for Prosperity lost credibility by rejecting the plan before it was announced, he told reporters. He also blamed the influential outside groups for pushing GOP legislators into the politically disastrous government shutdown in October. ""The day before the government re-opened, one of these groups stood up and said 'well, we never really thought it would work,'"" he told reporters before animatedly asking: ""Are you kidding me?"" The agreement reached by Ryan of Wisconsin and Murray of Washington would extend government spending into 2015 to remove the threat of another shutdown before next year's congressional elections. It sets government spending at $1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year that runs through September, and $1.014 trillion.  Overall, it proposes to save $85 billion and would reduce the deficit by more than $20 billion. Conservative complaints . Some conservatives complain the total is more than the level called for in the Budget Control Act that followed brinksmanship negotiations two years ago over raising the federal borrowing limit. That 2011 deal imposed unpopular forced spending cuts known as sequestration on the military and other government programs. The new compromise would eliminate $45 billion from the next round of the sequester cuts that are set to hit in January, as well as another $18 billion scheduled for 2015. Boehner noted it achieves more deficit reduction than the Budget Control Act, asserting it adhered to conservative principles of shrinking government and federal debt. ""I'm as conservative as anybody around this place,"" he said in defending his attacks on the outside groups, adding that ""all the things we've done in the three years I've been Speaker have not violated any conservative principles, not once."" Asked why he spoke out now against the outside groups, Boehner said they crossed a line, adding that ""when you criticize something and you have no idea what you're criticizing, it undermines your credibility."" White House support . The White House supports the compromise, but factions on both sides still pushed for change as the issue moved closer to decisive votes. Liberal Democrats insist the budget plan should extend long-term unemployment benefits set to expire at the end of the year. However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said the issue would be considered separately in 2014. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Congress should take up the unemployment insurance extension but did not insist that it be part of the budget package. ""We want them both and we think Congress ought to pass them both,"" Carney said. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel praised the agreement Thursday, saying provided certainty for military planning after the harmful sequester cuts and constant showdowns over spending. ""This agreement does not solve all (Department of Defense) budget problems but it helps address readiness especially in 2014 with putting more money back in training, in particular, and procurement,"" Hagel said. However, right-wing groups escalated their criticism of the plan. ""Time and again, Congress has claimed that cost-saving measures were permanent, only to later renege on these promises,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots. She took particular aim at Republican leaders such as Boehner, saying the deal ""also exposes the true colors of several in the GOP establishment when it comes to protecting conservative principles."" Diminishing influence? Boehner's comments to reporters were aimed at some of the same organizations that have effectively pressured House Republicans to resist compromising on budget issues in the past two years. They include Americans for Prosperity, Club for Growth, Freedom Works, Heritage Action and the Koch brothers, GOP campaign financiers. He made similar comments questioning the motives of some of the groups at a closed-door meeting this week with House Republicans. The Speaker told members that ""no one controls your voting card but you,"" according to a GOP source in the meeting. Strong GOP backing for the budget compromise showed that conservatives and the outside groups that back them have diminished influence. Rep. John Fleming, a conservative from Louisiana, said outside groups won't be able to sway as many conservatives because legislators like the idea of returning Congress to what's known as regular order -- deliberating and passing bills the way they're supposed to be done, instead of backroom deals reached amid crises. However, GOP Rep Raul Labrador of Idaho, a critic of the budget plan, wondered what had changed among fellow Republicans who now rejected the thinking of the outside conservative groups. Keeping score . The conservative groups keep scorecards on the voting records of legislators and back candidates who follow their policy stances with key campaign contributions. Such support can carry enhanced influence with congressional elections coming up next year. Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action, didn't back down from his criticism of the budget deal. ""Over the next few days, lawmakers will have to explain to their constituents, many of whom are our members, what they've achieved by increasing spending, increasing taxes and offering up another round of promises waiting to be broken. That will be a really tough sell back home,"" Holler said in a statement to CNN. Fresh partisan warfare in the Senate .

"Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has apologized for a massive e-mail outage last week, calling the days-long glitch ""unacceptable"" and a ""massive inconvenience."" ""This has been a very frustrating week for our users and we are very sorry,"" Mayer wrote Friday on Yahoo-owned Tumblr as the company was cleaning up the last of a problem that began December 9 for some users. The problem was a hardware outage in one of Yahoo's storage centers. Mayer said it affected about 1% of Yahoo e-mail's users. While teams began working around the clock on the problem immediately, it was ""a particularly rare one"" in which different users were affected in different ways. That caused it to take longer to fix, she said. Service was restored to more than 99% of affected users by Saturday, although Yahoo's engineers were still working on the problem Sunday. ""The engineering team has been working over the weekend and making steady progress on restoring access to messages for affected users. This includes folders as well as inbox state (like whether you've read a message or starred it),"" said a post on Yahoo's help page Sunday night. Mayer took the helm at Yahoo last year and has been credited with the first steps of what may be a turnaround for the troubled Web giant. She promised improvements to Yahoo's e-mail service, which is the Web's second- or third-most popular, depending upon which analysis you believe. ""Above all else, we're going to be working hard on improvements to prevent issues like this in the future,"" she wrote. ""While our overall uptime is well above 99.9%, even accounting for this incident, we really let you down this week. ""We can, and we will, do better in the future."" Mayer made revamping e-mail a key part of her effort to kick-start Yahoo, but it's been a rocky process. Announced in December 2012, the first e-mail overhaul rolled out to all users (whether they wanted it or not) in June. So lukewarm was the reception that it got a largely cosmetic redesign again in October. The result? More outrage. Yahoo e-mail has suffered from other limited outages since October, although none as bad as last week's.","Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer admits, ""It's been a very frustrating week""

"When Nailah Winkfield took her daughter to Children's Hospital & Research Center in Oakland, California, for a tonsillectomy, she thought it would be a short stay. ""When I walked her into that hospital, she was perfectly fine,"" Winkfield told CNN's Piers Morgan. ""There was nothing wrong with her. She had no health problems."" After the December 9 surgery, Jahi McMath, 13, woke up and asked her mother for a popsicle. But a short time later, the teen started bleeding from her mouth and nose. Winkfield watched in horror as Jahi went into cardiac arrest. Doctors later declared Jahi brain-dead and told Winkfield they were going to take her off life support. Her parents are fighting the hospital's decision, asking for just a little more time. ""The big question is, 'How in the world did this happen?' "" said CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen. ""You're talking about a tonsillectomy, right?"" Tonsillectomy is the third most common surgical procedure performed on children in the United States, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology, after circumcision and ear tubes. While not as common in adults, tonsillectomy joins the list of other common surgical procedures, such as appendectomy, cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) and cesarean section. But just because these surgeries are routine doesn't mean they're 100% safe. There's a reason the consent form you sign at the hospital is so detailed. While your surgeon may have successfully performed this particular procedure thousands of times, each patient is different. Your risk doesn't change because the person who was on the operating table before you survived. ""The complications are very rare,"" said Dr. Albert Wu, director of the Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. But ""uncontrollable bleeding can happen in almost any surgery. In extreme cases, you can bleed out."" In general, Wu said, the most common post-surgery complications are bleeding, infection and damage to nearby tissue. During a tonsillectomy, for example, surgeons are removing the tonsils, two oval-shaped pads, near the back of the throat. To do so, they must cut or burn away the tonsils, which could lead to a small artery being nicked. Usually surgeons will stop the bleeding by cauterizing it, Wu said, but some people don't clot well. A 2003 study of more than 14,000 tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy patients in Germany examined the post-operative complications for these surgeries. (An adenoidectomy removes the patients' adenoids and is commonly done alongside a tonsillectomy.) Bleeding occurred in about 3% of the patients; five needed a blood transfusion. Another study done in Europe in 2004 that included more than 33,000 tonsillectomy patients found about 1.3% were delayed in being discharged or returned to the hospital in the 28 days after surgery. Eight patients received a blood transfusion. One death was reported during the study period. The statistics are slightly higher for other common surgical procedures. A study of 1,254 laparoscopic cholecystectomies done in the Netherlands found complications in 12% of the patients. Yet the risk of death is still low; a 1996 meta-analysis found the mortality rate for gallbladder removal was between .086% and .74%. Certain patients are at greater risk during general surgery than others, Wu said. Patients with pre-existing conditions such as heart, lung or liver problems are more likely to suffer from complications or die. ""The stress of surgery can be too much for you to be able to maintain (your body's) equilibrium,"" Wu said. Obese patients are also at greater risk. A small study published in 2012 showed severely obese children undergoing tonsillectomies had an increased risk of complications during their surgeries. But what if the patient's body isn't at fault? What if it's the surgeon who messes up? Medical errors kill more than 200,000 people every year in the United States, according to a study published in September. Add them all up and ""you have probably the third leading cause of death"" in the country, Dr. Peter Pronovost, senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Hospital, told CNN during a 2012 investigation into common medical mistakes. 10 shocking medical mistakes . Wu said patients should tell their surgeons ""everything that they know about themselves,"" including their past experiences with surgery and anesthesia, whether they have any allergies, and if they're prone to bruising or heavy bleeding. ""The question people should always ask is, 'Do I need this surgery?' "" Wu said. ""In some cases not having surgery is riskier than having the surgery ... but for many, many things, the surgery is quite discretionary. You have a choice.""","Jahi McMath, 13, was declared brain-dead after a tonsillectomy .

"A man dressed as Santa Claus and giving away gifts to needy children in Washington was shot by a pellet gun Tuesday in the midst of his rounds, according to police. ""Somebody just shot me! My back! Someone shot me with a pellet gun,"" the man, later identified as Xavier Hawkins, said in video recorded by CNN affiliate WJLA, before he knelt in obvious pain. Paramedics took the man to a hospital for treatment but the wound wasn't serious and he was later released. Santa was right about what happened, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said, adding that the preliminary investigation suggests the assailant did use a pellet gun in the attack. WJLA reported Santa wanted to continue with the toy giveaway, as many boys and girls still hadn't received their gifts, but paramedics insisted he go to the hospital. Standing nearby, the Grinch (or someone dressed like him, anyway), continued the giveaway while Santa was taken away. ""I just thank God that I'm alive,"" Hawkins told WJLA after his release from the hospital. ""I'm very grateful no one else got hit, especially the kids."" Police were investigating the incident Tuesday afternoon and didn't say whether any suspects had been identified. WJLA also reported Hawkins is planning to participate in the toy giveaway again next year and said he has already forgiven the attacker.","""Santa,"" identified as Xavier Hawkins, was not seriously hurt .

"Call it a pre-emptive strike. Hours ahead of her appearance Wednesday before a House subcommittee certain to grill her on the botched launch of the Obamacare website, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced an internal review of what happened and why. Then her department released the latest enrollment figures for President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms, showing a big increase in November after the site's problem-plagued rollout on October 1. Obamacare sign-ups hit 365,000; still a long way to go . The moves appeared timed to blunt criticism by the Republican-led House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health of the reforms known as Obamacare and Sebelius, the Cabinet Secretary in charge of implementing them. A chorus of GOP critics have called for her to be fired over the failure of the website, and she sparred with several Republicans at Wednesday's hearing over complaints about HealthCare.gov and the overall reforms. While little new information emerged, Sebelius told the panel the government has contracted to pay $677 million for the Obamacare website and actually paid $319 million of that total so far. Website gets $47 million price hike . Let's have a look . In a blog post Wednesday, Sebelius said that Dan Levinson, the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services, would review what happened with the ""flawed and simply unacceptable"" launch of the HealthCare.gov website. ""I believe strongly in the need for accountability, and in the importance of being good stewards of taxpayer dollars,"" she said, adding that ""we need a thorough review of the contractor performance and program management structure that resulted in the flawed launch of the website."" In particular, Levinson will ""review the acquisition process, overall program management, and contractor performance and payment issues related to the development and management"" of the website, her blog post said. ""We will take action to address the Inspector General's findings,"" she added. In addition to that review, Sebelius also said a new position would be created in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that implements Obamacare to minimize risks from major policy initiatives. A third step called for better training for CMS employees on ""best practices"" for hiring and working with contractors. A few days earlier than planned, the Obama administration announced Wednesday that nearly 365,000 people signed up for health coverage under new exchanges created by Obamacare in the first two months of enrollment. The figure was a big increase over the 106,000 who signed up the first month, when the computer problems undermined enrollment, but still well below the needed pace to reach the target of 7 million by a March 31 deadline to get coverage for 2014. At Wednesday's hearing, Republicans challenged the new figures by pointing out they didn't reflect people who had actually paid for new policies under Obamacare. In a particularly  combative exchange, GOP Rep. John Shimkus of Illinois called the new enrollment figure ""fraudulent because it's not those who have purchased plans yet."" Sebelius shot back that health insurance under Obamacare remained private policies, requiring people to pay up before they get a card from the insurance company proving they were covered. That didn't satisfy Shimkus, who cut her off by saying ""you're telling us those who shopped are enrolled."" Administration officials say traffic has increased even more since they completed upgrades to the website at the end of last month. Through November, just over 137,200 Americans obtained an insurance policy through HealthCare.gov and nearly 227,500 through the 14 state-run exchanges, according to the new federal figures. An additional 1.94 million people have started the process but had yet to pick a policy. Consumers must purchase health insurance by December 23 and pay the first premium by the end of the year for coverage to begin January 1. Sign-ups vary widely by state. More than 107,000 Californians have picked plans, compared to only 44 Oregonians. Florida leads the way in the federal exchange, with nearly 18,000 people picking plans, while North Dakota has only 265 enrollees. GOP attacks . Led by conservative Republicans, critics continue to attack Obamacare as an example of big government run amok, and Wednesday's hearing included fresh salvos aimed at Sebelius and Obama. While some GOP legislators focused on specific provisions or problems with the reforms, others made clear their unhappiness dated back to the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 with no Republican support. ""A lot of this is about the way it was passed,"" said Rep. Ed Whifield of Kentucky, noting that the Democratic House leadership at the time permitted no amendments. ""There are very deep feelings about this still."" Rep. Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee, said misinformation by the administration about the health care reforms had eroded public trust. ""Every major promise the administration made about the ACA, from being able to keep your health plan if you like it, to being able to keep your doctor if you want to, the very premise of health reform in the first place, that the Affordable Care Act would make health coverage more affordable, has proven to be wrong,"" Pitts said. ""My constituents have repeatedly expressed to me that they feel they were lied to by the administration about the real effects of this law."" Democrats lampooned the Republican criticism as overheated rhetoric, with Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey saying that ""sometimes I think they're living on Mars rather than here on Earth."" ""It just boggles my mind to hear these Republican comments about a world turned upside down when Obamacare is working,"" he said. The blog post by Sebelius amounted to a sneak preview of her remarks to the committee, emphasizing steps she was taking to find out what happened with the rollout and prevent future problems. Some Republicans were concerned about problems with the ""back-end"" operations of the HealthCare.gov website, such as transmitting correct enrollment information to insurance companies. Sebelius said such issues were being addressed, including efforts to contact people who enrolled online to make sure they follow up with the company they chose to confirm their policies and pay for them. Your Obamacare form might have errors . She was unable to provide details of how many of the more than 360,000 enrollees so far had paid, adding that they would likely wait until the year-end deadline. ""I think most Americans will not pay until the money is actually owed,"" she said. Obamacare: You're not insured until you pay .","Sebelius spars with GOP legislators over longstanding criticisms .

"Everyone was all smiles when Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan -- sporting a black coat with a big red ribbon on its lapel -- took center stage at an AIDS event in Beijing last month, posing with young volunteers working with awareness groups around the nation. Peng, a famous folk singer who has been compared to Michelle Obama, is the glamorous public face of China's fight against AIDS. But campaigners say the photo ops and lofty words offered by Peng and other public figures do little to improve the lot of the almost half a million people living with HIV or AIDS in China. In 2011, the same year Peng was appointed as a U.N. goodwill ambassador for AIDS, Hao Yang tested positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, when he was trying to donate blood as a young military officer. After the discovery, he says his army bosses ordered him home ""to rest."" ""I worked so hard to get where I was,"" he recalled of his promising career in the People's Liberation Army, which had sent him to a military academy for graduate studies. ""Then all of a sudden they just wanted me out because of my HIV status."" Although he still receives a monthly salary from the army, Hao Yang -- a pseudonym he uses to protect his identity -- feels his life is in limbo. He is no longer welcome in the military but can't be transferred to civilian work either. Former officers normally become civil servants -- a dead end for Hao as a physical examination that includes HIV screening is mandatory for government job applicants and HIV-positive candidates are disqualified. ""If the government itself still discriminates against us, how can it expect the rest of society not to?"" asked the 28-year old who now volunteers with a Beijing-based HIV/AIDS advocacy group. Inconsistency . Some 430,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS in China, according to the latest count by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Chinese laws and regulations prohibit discrimination against people with HIV, but activists cite myriad of real-life examples -- including the exclusion from public sector jobs -- as evidence of inconsistency in the official policy. Their most recent outcry was triggered by a Commerce Ministry proposal that would bar people with HIV from entering bathhouses, including those offering spa and massage services. Failure to comply would result in fines for the businesses. Announced in mid-October, the draft regulation appeared to be backed by the public. A poll of 10,000 people on a popular Twitter-like site showed more than 70% of the respondents supported the ban. But it drew immediate fire from many experts and activists who blasted the ministry for lacking basic health knowledge as well as reinforcing public ignorance and prejudice on the issue. ""HIV transmission in a bathhouse or spa setting is not possible, and the use of such facilities by people living with HIV poses absolutely no risk from a public health perspective,"" the China office of UNAIDS said in a statement. ""Addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination is a critical component of a successful response to HIV."" Protests . Liu Shi, an activist who is HIV-positive, became so incensed by the proposal that he staged a brief protest outside the ministry shortly after the announcement. Under the watchful eyes of police and soldiers, Liu -- donning a white bathrobe -- held up a sign that asked: ""Mr. Commerce Minister, can we go to your house to take a bath?"" ""Even people knowledgeable of HIV's transmission still feel scared because of many half-truths reported by the media,"" said the former sound mixer, 22, still fuming over the proposal's negative impact on his cause. ""This government proposal would only make things worse."" Amid the controversy, the Commerce Ministry pledged to consult experts and review the draft. For HIV carriers, though, the fight against discrimination remains an uphill battle. Liu and Hao both recounted their difficulty in accessing medical care as many public hospitals still turn away HIV-positive patients when they seek treatment for other illnesses. Some have tried to redress their grievances through the courts. In 2010, a young man in Anhui Province sued the local educational authority after his application for a teacher's position was rejected because of his HIV status. He lost the case. Last month, another HIV-positive man in Jiangsu Province sued local officials, when he was denied a government job despite scoring the highest among all applicants. The case is pending. Concerted effort . In recent years, China's top leaders have made a concerted effort in recognizing and addressing the country's growing HIV/AIDS problem. Although the total number of cases seems low for a population of 1.3 billion, the government has acknowledged an alarming trend among young people. In 2012, 1,700 Chinese students were found to be HIV-positive, a 25% jump over the previous year and mostly attributable to same-sex contact, state news agency Xinhua reported. Last year, President Xi Jinping visited sufferers at a Beijing clinic and called them ""our brothers and sisters whose lives should be brightened with love from the whole society."" ""HIV/AIDS isn't terrible in itself,"" Xi said at the time. ""What's really dreadful is the ignorance on HIV/AIDS and the prejudice against AIDS patients."" Heartened by the president's words, many activists nevertheless caution that the challenge is translating the leadership's gesture into government actions. They agree that one top priority should be revamping the country's inadequate sex education, which they blame for the sharp rise of HIV infections among young people as well as the continued public  prejudice against sufferers. ""We have brought the topic of HIV/AIDS into schools but we only talk about the harm caused by the disease,"" said Meng Lin, who tested positive for the virus some 20 years ago and now runs the China Alliance for People Living with HIV/AIDS. ""Students are taught that only gay or immoral people with multiple sexual partners get infected. Linking the disease to morality further stigmatizes it -- and that really is the problem.""","Laws prohibit discrimination against the 430,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in China .

"A dramatic shootout between authorities and suspected cartel gunmen at a Mexican seaside resort this month has ties to a botched U.S. gun operation. A U.S. official said Tuesday that investigators have traced at least one firearm recovered at a December 18 gunfight in Puerto Peñasco, across from the Arizona border, to Operation Fast and Furious. That's the disastrous operation run by agents in the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Agents allowed suspected gun smugglers to buy about 2,000 firearms with the goal of trying to find and prosecute high-level traffickers. They couldn't track the firearms and most are believed to have ended up with cartels and gangsters in Mexico. Many have turned up at crime scenes in Mexico and the United States, including at a shooting that killed a U.S. border agent in 2010. The shootout in Puerto Peñasco, also called Rocky Point by Arizona tourists, two weeks ago left at least five suspected cartel gunmen dead, including possibly a high level Sinaloa cartel chief, according to Mexican authorities. Witnesses reported hours of shooting and grenade explosions, with Mexican authorities using helicopters to attack fleeing suspected cartel gunmen on the ground. Guns recovered at such scenes are routinely checked with the ATF's tracing lab to try to determine their origin. At least one AK-47 style firearm was found, and U.S. investigators identified it as one that was allowed to be sold to suspected traffickers as part of Fast and Furious, according to the U.S. official. The ATF, in a statement, said: ""ATF has accepted responsibility for the mistakes made in the Fast and Furious investigation and at the attorney general's direction we have taken appropriate and decisive action to ensure that these errors will not be repeated. And we acknowledge that, regrettably, firearms related to the Fast and Furious investigation will likely continue to be recovered at future crime scenes."" Guns from Fast and Furious have turned up at other high-profile killings in Mexico, including those of the brother of a Mexican state prosecutor and of a beauty queen. The Fast and Furious operation gave rise to more than a year of political controversy for the Justice Department. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, and Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, led a congressional probe to determine how it came to be approved. Eventually, House Republicans sanctioned Attorney General Eric Holder for contempt of Congress in a legal dispute over the White House's refusal to turn over documents. Holder has said tactics used in Fast and Furious never should have been allowed. A Justice Department inspector general report cleared Holder of wrongdoing and placed most blame on officials at the ATF and the Phoenix U.S. attorney's office for failing to properly oversee the agents running the operation. Grassley, in a statement Tuesday, said: ""In Operation Fast and Furious, the Mexican drug cartels found an easy way to supplement their own illegal ways. Worse yet, the Obama administration has yet to publicly hold anyone accountable for this disastrous policy. Unfortunately, guns from Fast and Furious will be found in operations like this for years to come.""","Sen. Grassley says no one has been held accountable .

"North Korea sent a fax to South Korea on Thursday, threatening to ""strike mercilessly without notice"" after protests against the secretive regime this week in Seoul. The message warned that North Korea would strike if ""the provocation against our highest dignity is to be repeated in the downtown of Seoul."" Earlier this week, on the second anniversary of the death of former North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, conservative protesters rallied in Seoul, burning effigies of the country's leaders as well as its flag. Such protests are common during North Korean festivals and anniversaries. The South Korea's Ministry of National Defense said it sent a response. ""The reply was sent through wired message and in the fax message, we warned that if North Korea is to carry out provocation, we will firmly retaliate,"" said Kim Min-seok, the spokesman for South Korea's Ministry of National Defense. He added that there have been no significant military movements in North Korea. Pyongyang routinely threatens to retaliate after what it considers ""provocations"" including protests or balloon launches to the north by South Korean groups. Relations between the Koreas have seesawed this year, verging on hostile earlier this year amid a nuclear test in February. This month, the execution of Jang Song Thaek, an advisor and uncle of North Korea's current leader, Kim Jong Un unsettled its neighbors, prompting speculation about instability in the country's leadership.","North Korea's fax to South Korea: Will ""strike mercilessly without notice""

"Christmas was the favorite holiday for Marlise Munoz's family. She, her brother and parents would open presents, go to the movies and shoot fireworks they had saved from July. But this holiday season, says Munoz's mother, Lynne Machado, has been ""a living hell."" Munoz, 33, has been brain dead since her husband, Erick Munoz, discovered her unconscious at home on November 26, Machado said. The family says she is being kept alive on a ventilator at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, even though she would not want her life prolonged by a machine. Texas state law says life-sustaining treatment cannot be withheld from a pregnant patient, regardless of her wishes or the age of the fetus. And Munoz was 14 weeks pregnant when she became hospitalized; now she's at 18 weeks. Munoz's family wants to see that law rewritten or repealed. ""I can't imagine their intent would be for someone so young in pregnancy, at 14 weeks, to have them on life support until mid-May,"" Machado said. Machado hopes to go before the Texas legislature to argue that when it comes to cases like this, ""one size does not fit all,"" she said. But the family is not yet at the point of hiring a lawyer to pursue that, she said. ""We're frankly waiting to see how long this lasts,"" she said. ""There's so much energy just trying to cope with what we see every time we go into ICU. And knowing our daughter is not there, but her body is being kept alive, is hard to see."" Husband of pregnant woman wants her off life support . Unknowns about the fetus . Machado saw her daughter no more than five hours before she fell unconscious on the kitchen floor at her home. Doctors won't know for sure the cause of death until Munoz has an autopsy, but they suspect she had a pulmonary embolism, Machado said. Machado fears that oxygen deprivation could have damaged the fetus. Doctors told the family it has a heartbeat in a normal range, Erick Munoz told WFAA, and at 24 weeks they may know more about its viability. ""We still have about a month to go before we have more answers to questions about what's going to happen next,"" Machado said. Although there are tests at the fetal stage that can pick up on problems, they cannot provide certainty about normal development, experts say. ""We don't have very precise measurements of fetal wellbeing,"" Dr. Edmund LaGamma, neonatologist at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York, who is not involved with the case. Based on the available facts, LaGamma said, there is a possibility of a good outcome for a fetus born to a woman in Munoz's situation. Doctors will likely examine the appearance of the fetus, looking for indications of developmental issues, he said. For example, microcephaly, often indicated by abnormal growth of the fetus's head, can be a sign of developmental issues. It's a lot easier to predict bad outcomes than good, LaGamma said. The tests that doctors could perform, including an MRI of the fetal brain, can't assure normal development later. ""It's like photograph of a baseball player,"" he said. ""You can see how they stand. They look muscular. They've got great position, hold the bat well. But until you put them in action, until you test that function of the brain, you can't tell whether it's going to work well."" A law to protect unborn children . The larger situation is a complicated one, involving competing interests and personal choices of individuals, state and federal regulations, as well as the right to life of the mother and child, LaGamma said. Munoz never filled out an advance directive stating what she would want to happen medically in a situation like this, if she could not express her own wishes. But Machado said Munoz had spoken several times to her parents and husband about it. ""We talked about it. We're both paramedics,"" Eric Munoz told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""We've seen things out in the field. We both knew that we both didn't want to be on life support."" Even if she had signed such a document, though, Texas law would override her wishes because she is pregnant. ""The state has a compelling interest in preserving the life of its unborn citizens,"" criminal defense attorney Danny Cevallos told CNN's New Day. ""And that interest is superior to even the interest of the remaining family that might be charged with raising an ill child."" The hospital that is treating Munoz says it is adhering to the law. ""At all times, we will follow the law as it is applicable to health care in the state of Texas. And state law here says you cannot withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient,"" J.R. Labbe, vice president of communications and community affairs for JPS Health Network, said. ""It's that clear."" Arthur Caplan, director of the Division of Bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center, told CNN's New Day that he finds the law too restrictive. ""Given these variables, I think the Texas law doesn't give enough room to have this discussion we're having, which is: Are you sure that's what she would want, are you sure the fetus could live, are you sure the fetus hasn't been harmed?"" he said. A difficult Christmas . Munoz's brother unexpectedly died four years ago, at age 22. Machado and her husband suddenly find themselves without children of their own. They have been taking care of Munoz's 14-month-old son Mateo for the last week. While out shopping for milk for the boy on Monday, Machado broke down in tears when she came across marshmallows -- one of her daughter's beloved treats. ""I thought, normally, I'd pick up a bag for her,"" Machado said, crying. ""It was hard to see something as simple as a bag of marshmallows."" Mateo loves marshmallows, too.

"Five people were killed and scores of others were injured across Egypt on Friday as demonstrators supporting the Muslim Brotherhood clashed with police, the semiofficial Ahram Online news outlet reported. The demonstrations are just the latest by the Islamist group, which has regularly protested Egypt's interim government since the Brotherhood-backed President Mohamed Morsy was ousted in a coup in July. The Muslim Brotherhood also has focused its ire on Egypt's January 14-15 referendum on a new constitution that would ban religious parties and put more power in the hands of the military. At least some of those who died Friday were protesters, Ahram Online reported. The outlet didn't say who caused the deaths. One protester was killed in Cairo's Nasr City district, where demonstrators threw rocks and fireworks at police, who responded by firing tear gas, according to Ahram Online. Two protesters were fatally shot in clashes in the northern Egyptian city of Ismailia, about 125 kilometers (78 miles) northeast of the capital, Cairo, Ahram Online reported. One person was killed in Fayoum, southwest of Cairo, and another was killed in Alexandria, the news outlet reported. In Alexandria -- Egypt's second-largest city, 175 kilometers (109 miles) northwest of Cairo -- police intervened after Muslim Brotherhood supporters clashed with civilian opponents, Ahram Online reported. The deaths come two days after the country's Interior Ministry said at least two demonstrators were killed in Wednesday clashes with security forces in Alexandria. Muslim Brotherhood members have continued their protests even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. The government has threatened to arrest anyone who attends Muslim Brotherhood protests or provides financial support to the organization. Supporters of the organization demand the reinstatement of Morsy, who became the country's first democratically elected president in 2012, and the full restoration of their political and social rights. The interim government blames the group for a series of coordinated attacks, including a recent bombing on a police headquarters that left 16 dead and more than 100 injured. The military ousted Morsy on July 3 after he was accused of pursuing an Islamist agenda and excluding other factions from the government. Morsy's supporters say that the deposed president wasn't given a fair chance and that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. On the Muslim Brotherhood's website, a Brotherhood-supported group called for ""million-man"" marches against the government Friday and next Wednesday, the day that a trial against Morsy is expected to resume. In that trial, Morsy and others face charges stemming from December 2012 protests over a constitution he shepherded into effect. Egyptian authorities have accused Morsy and his staff of ordering supporters to attack protesters after guards and members of the Interior Ministry refused to do it. Morsy and four others are charged with inciting violence, but they are not accused of using force. Eleven others are charged with killing three men, torturing 54 people, using force and possessing weapons. Morsy says he doesn't recognize the court's authority, claiming he still is Egypt's legitimate president. Last month, Morsy and 35 other members of the Muslim Brotherhood also were ordered to stand trial on accusations of collaborating with foreign organizations to commit terrorist acts and revealing defense secrets, according to the semiofficial al-Ahram newspaper. In that case, Morsy is accused of spying for the Palestinian group Hamas, which the United States classifies as a terrorist organization, and assisting in acts of terror inside Egypt, judicial sources told al-Ahram. Additionally, Morsy will face trial on suspicion of escaping from prison in 2011, state media reported.","Muslim Brotherhood focusing ire on Egypt's January referendum on new constitution .

"The Obama administration has framed its defense of the controversial bulk collection of all American phone records as necessary to prevent a future 9/11. During a House Intelligence Committee hearing on June 18, NSA director Gen. Keith Alexander said, ""Let me start by saying that I would much rather be here today debating this point than trying to explain how we failed to prevent another 9/11."" This closely mirrors talking points by the National Security Agency about how to defend the program. In the talking points, NSA officials are encouraged to use ""sound bites that resonate,"" specifically, ""I much prefer to be here today explain these programs, than explaining another 9/11 event that we were not able to prevent."" On Friday in New York, Judge William H. Pauley III ruled that NSA's bulk collection of American telephone records is lawful. He cited Alexander's testimony and quoted him saying, ""We couldn't connect the dots because we didn't have the dots."" But is it really the case that the U.S. intelligence community didn't have the dots in the lead up to 9/11? Hardly. In fact, the intelligence community provided repeated strategic warning in the summer of 9/11 that al Qaeda was planning a large-scale attacks on American interests. Here is a representative sampling of the CIA threat reporting that was distributed to Bush administration officials during the spring and summer of 2001: . -- CIA, ""Bin Ladin Planning Multiple Operations,"" April 20-- CIA, ""Bin Ladin Attacks May Be Imminent,"" June 23-- CIA, ""Planning for Bin Ladin Attacks Continues, Despite Delays,"" July 2-- CIA, ""Threat of Impending al Qaeda Attack to Continue Indefinitely,"" August 3 . The failure to respond adequately to these warnings was a policy failure by the Bush administration, not an intelligence failure by the U.S. intelligence community. A case of missed opportunities . The CIA itself also had its own spectacular failure in the run up to 9/11, which wasn't a failure to collect intelligence, but a failure of information sharing. The CIA had quite a bit of information about two of the hijackers and their presence in the United States before 9/11, which the agency didn't share with other government agencies until it was too late to do anything about it. The government missed multiple opportunities to catch al Qaeda hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar when he was living in San Diego for a year and a half in the run up to 9/11, not because it lacked access to all Americans phone records but because it didn't share the information it already possessed about the soon-to-be hijacker within other branches of the government. The missed opportunities in the al-Mihdhar case are well-documented. The CIA failed to ""watch-list"" al-Mihdhar and another suspected al Qaeda terrorist, Nawaf al-Hazmi, whom the agency had been tracking since they attended an al Qaeda summit in Malaysia on January 5, 2000. The failure to put Mihdhar and Hamzi on a watch list meant that immigration and law enforcement authorities were not alerted to their presence when they entered the United States under their real names. Ten days after the meeting in Malaysia, on January 15, 2000, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar flew into Los Angeles. The CIA also did not alert the FBI about the identities of the suspected terrorists so that the bureau could look for them once they were inside the United States. An investigation by the CIA inspector general -- published in unclassified form in 2007 -- found that this was not the oversight of a couple of agency employees but rather that a large number of CIA officers and analysts had dropped the ball. Some 50 to 60 agency employees read cables about the two al Qaeda suspects without taking any action. Some of those officers knew that one of the al Qaeda suspects had a visa for the United States, and by March 2001, some knew that the other suspect had flown to Los Angeles. The soon-to-be hijackers would not have been difficult to find in California if their names had been known to law enforcement. Under their real names, they rented an apartment, got driver's licenses, opened bank accounts, purchased a car and took flight lessons. Al-Mihdhar even listed his name in the local phone directory. It was only on August 24, 2001, as a result of questions raised by a CIA officer on assignment at the FBI, that the two al Qaeda suspects were watch-listed and their names communicated to the bureau. Even then, the FBI sent out only a ""routine"" notice requesting an investigation of al-Mihdhar. Nothing substantive came of this request. A month later, al-Hamzi and al-Mihdhar were two of the hijackers on American Airlines Flight 77 that plunged into the Pentagon, killing 189 people. The CIA inspector general's report concluded that ""informing the FBI and good operational follow-through by CIA and FBI might have resulted in surveillance of both al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi. Surveillance, in turn, would have had the potential to yield information on flight training, financing, and links to others who were complicit in the 9/11 attacks."" It's about the sharing . These multiple missed opportunities challenge the administration's claims that the NSA's bulk phone data surveillance program could have prevented the 9/11 attacks. The key problem was one of information sharing, not the lack of information. Obama administration officials who defend the NSA bulk collection of phone records program cite the failure to detect al-Mihdhar's presence in San Diego before 9/11 as a reason to justify the program. Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller argued before the House Judiciary Committee on June 13 that bulk collection of telephone records might have prevented 9/11. ""Before 9/11, there was an individual by the name of Khalid al-Mihdhar, who came to be one of the principal hijackers. He was being tracked by the intelligence agencies in the Far East. They lost track of him. At the same time, the intelligence agencies had identified an al Qaeda safe house in Yemen. ""They understood that that al Qaeda safe house had a telephone number, but they could not know who was calling into that particular safe house. We came to find out afterwards that the person who had called into that safe house was al-Mihdhar, who was in the United States in San Diego. If we had had this program in place at the time, we would have been able to identify that particular telephone number in San Diego."" As documented above, however, the government missed multiple opportunities to catch al-Mihdhar, and the failure was one of information sharing inside the U.S. intelligence community. Since we can't run history backward, all we can say with certainty is that it is an indisputable fact that the proper sharing of intelligence by the CIA with other agencies about al-Mihdhar may well have derailed the 9/11 plot. And it is merely an untestable hypothesis that if the NSA bulk phone collection program had been in place at the time that it might have helped to find the soon-to-be-hijackers in San Diego. Indeed, the overall problem for U.S. counterterrorism officials is not that they don't gather enough information from the bulk surveillance of American phone data but that they don't sufficiently understand or widely share the information they already possess that is derived from conventional law enforcement and intelligence techniques. An unfortunate pattern of cases . What was true of the two 9/11 hijackers living in San Diego was also the unfortunate pattern we have seen in several other significant terrorism cases: . -- Chicago resident David Coleman Headley was central to the planning of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai that killed 166 people. Yet, following the 9/11 attacks, U.S. authorities received plausible tips regarding Headley's associations with militant groups at least five times from his family members, friends and acquaintances. These multiple tips were never followed up in an effective fashion. -- Maj. Nidal Hasan, a military psychiatrist, killed 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. Yet intelligence agencies had intercepted multiple e-mails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric living in Yemen who was notorious for his ties to militants. The e-mails included a discussion of the permissibility in Islam of killing U.S. soldiers. Counterterrorism investigators didn't follow up on these e-mails, believing they were somehow consistent with Hasan's job as a military psychiatrist. -- Carlos Bledsoe, a convert to Islam, fatally shot a soldier at a Little Rock, Arkansas, military recruiting office in 2009. Shortly before the attack, Bledsoe had traveled to Yemen. As a result, Bledsoe was under investigation by the FBI yet he was still able to buy the weapons he needed for his deadly attack when he was back in the United States. -- Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab attempted to blow up Northwest Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009 with an ""underwear bomb."" Luckily, the bomb failed to explode. Yet, a few weeks before the botched attack, AbdulMutallab's father contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria with concerns that his son had become radicalized and might be planning something. This information wasn't further investigated. AbdulMutallab had been recruited by al Qaeda's branch in Yemen for the mission. The White House's review of the underwear bomb plot concluded that there was sufficient information known to the U.S. government to determine that AbdulMutallab was likely working for al Qaeda in Yemen and that the group was looking to expand its attacks beyond Yemen. Yet AbdulMutallab was allowed to board a plane bound for the United States without any question. All of these serious terrorism cases argue not for the gathering of ever vaster troves of information but simply for a better understanding of the information the government has already collected and that are derived from conventional law enforcement and intelligence methods.","NSA and defenders say its bulk surveillance could prevent another 9/11 .

"If predictions hold true, Florida may soon overtake New York as the nation's third-most populous state. Pointing to the states' growth rates, demographers say it's not a question of if, but when. ""If it doesn't happen this year -- it probably will -- but if not, probably next year,"" said Thomas Boswell, a University of Miami geography professor who studies population. ""It doesn't surprise demographers,"" Boswell said, ""we have seen it coming for a long time."" On Monday, the U.S. Census Bureau releases its latest population estimates. Stan Smith, population program director at the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR), agreed with Boswell that Florida likely will overtake New York at some point in 2014 or 2015. From April 2010 to July 2012, Florida's population grew 2.7%, according to census data. In the same period, New York's grew 1%. The national average was 1.7%. Last year's census estimate had the two states virtually neck and neck: New York's population was just under 19.6 million, only about 250,000 higher than Florida's. ""The really, really simple thing is that Florida and New York are growing, but Florida is growing faster,"" said Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York. While New York City and its surrounding suburbs, the Albany area, and Ithaca are all growing, much of upstate New York is experiencing declines in population, Beveridge said. Manufacturing jobs have diminished in northern New York cities like Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse. Florida, on the other hand, is seeing jump in tourism, real estate, construction, medicine and finance, Boswell said. But immigration is also an important factor in explaining Florida's rise. ""Florida's growth for many years has been due primarily to migration,"" Smith said. ""Typically, 80 to 90% of growth in the state has to do with people moving in."" The spike in immigration includes people moving from other states as well as from abroad, Smith said. Based on responses to BEBR surveys, Smith said, most people moving to Florida do so for job-related reasons. The state also draws retirees seeking a warmer climate. If Florida surpasses New York in population, it likely will end up with more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2010, after the release of new census data, New York lost two seats and Florida gained two. Both states now have 27 House members. California, with an estimated population of 38 million in 2012, and Texas (26 million) are the nation's two most populous states.","New York could soon trail Florida in population .

"""Full House"" star Candace Cameron Bure has written a book that is sure to get women talking -- though perhaps not in the way she anticipated. ""Balancing It All: My Story of Juggling Priorities and Purpose,"" is all about her life as a working wife and mom. But she also includes some information about her marriage to professional hockey player Val Bure. The couple have been married for 17 years and have three children. ""I am not a passive person, but I chose to fall into a more submissive role in our relationship because I wanted to do everything in my power to make my marriage and family work,"" the actress writes in her book. During a recent interview with The Huffington Post, Cameron Bure explained what she meant. ""The definition I'm using with the word 'submissive' is the biblical definition of that,"" she said. ""So, it is meekness, it is not weakness. It is strength under control, it is bridled strength."" ""And, listen, I love that my man is a leader,"" she said. ""I want him to lead and be the head of our family. And those major decisions do fall on him. ... It doesn't mean I don't voice my opinion. It doesn't mean I don't have an opinion. I absolutely do, but it is very difficult to have two heads of authority.""

"Capt. Francesco Schettino abandoned the cruise liner Costa Concordia after it wrecked in 2012 while hundreds were still on board, according to testimony and recorded phone calls played in a court in Grosetto, Italy, on Monday. Gregorio Di Falco of the Livorno Port Authority, the man who repeatedly ordered Schettino to get back on board, told the court he initiated rescue efforts on his own after distressed passengers called police. He didn't wait for a distress signal from Schettino, whose information was inconsistent, he said. In phone calls played in court, Schettino said from a life boat that only a dozen people were still on board the ship, when the coast guard had reported hundreds. Schettino later adjusted his numbers saying it was indeed 200 to 300. Schettino faces charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. He denies wrongdoing. The cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea in January 2012, killing 32 of the 4,200 people on board.

"""Yes, I identify as black or African-American, but I am not a Negro,"" said a 25-year-old teacher from New York City. On Monday, when Raeana Roberson took the day off from work to report for jury selection, she was not prepared for what she called an offensive and disgusting experience. The juror information card all prospective jurors have to fill out included a race category that included, ""Black, African-American, or Negro."" ""Are you kidding me? What year is this?"" Roberson thought when she read the form. When Roberson looked around, no one else in the room was apparently concerned by this, she told CNN on Friday. Since the words ""Black, African-American, or Negro"" appeared as a part of a single category, Roberson crossed out the word ""Negro"" and wrote next to it, ""offensive! It's 2014!"" She then snapped a picture of the form and posted it on her Facebook page. Roberson returned the form to a court employee, hoping for some sort of reaction, but there was none, she said. With grandparents from North Carolina who lived through the Jim Crow laws of racial segregation, Roberson said she is especially offended by the contemporary use of the word ""Negro."" It is outdated and has a negative connotation, Roberson said. ""I don't think it was malicious,"" said Jeffrey Sammons, a professor of history at New York University. ""Negro"" has been used from the late 1900s all the way to the Harlem Renaissance and beyond, Sammons explained. There were times when the word was used to describe educated and empowered African-Americans, he said. There have been various terms that have been embraced by different generations of African-Americans, Sammons said, and ""Negro"" was one of them. The term lost popularity with the arrival of the baby boomers and the black pride movement, according to Sammons. ""I believe there are many black people who still prefer that term,"" said Sammons. ""It is a generational issue."" It would be a problem if the word ""Negro"" appeared on the form by itself, he said Friday. Race categories for New York courts come from the U.S. Census Bureau, according to Arlene Hackel, a spokeswoman for the New York State Office of Court Administration. The courts are required to collect demographic information about prospective jurors, per Judicial Statue Section 528. As of September 13, 2010, every person who appears for jury service in any city in New York must complete a scannable data card, which includes specification of race, according to the statute. However, the statute only uses the word ""black"" when referring to blacks or African-Americans. According to a 2010 blog post by then director of the U.S. Census Bureau, Robert Groves, the word ""Negro"" was used in the 2000 census as a result of research in the late 1990s that showed approximately 56,000 people wrote in the word ""Negro"" under the ""some other race"" category. More than half of these individuals were under the age of 45 in 2000. In the 2010 census, many respondents found the use of the word ""Negro"" outdated and offensive, according to a press release by the bureau. Groves apologized to those who were offended. ""I am confident that the intent of my colleagues in using the same wording as Census 2000 was to make sure as many people as possible saw words that matched their self-identities. Full inclusiveness was the goal,"" Groves wrote. Following the negative feedback, the Census Bureau conducted research on race and Hispanic origin using what it called the Alternative Questionnaire Experiment, according to the press release. The study found that removing the term ""Negro"" does not have an impact on data quality and therefore recommended removing the term for future data collection. The Census Bureau, which follows the Office of Management and Budget for definitions of race and ethnicity, discontinued use of the word ""Negro"" at the beginning of 2014, according to a press release. New York courts will be following suit and discontinuing the use of the word soon, according to Hackel. ""Collecting demographic data is really important; however, they may have had a technical hiccup in their choice of language,"" said analyst Greg Hurley of the National Center for State Courts. Not all states collect demographic information from prospective juror, Hurley told CNN. It is a good thing that New York courts do this in order to ensure a fair cross-section of the community, he explained. The National Center for State Courts created its own form for prospective jurors, which does not include the word ""Negro."" According to Hackel, this is the first time officials have heard of anyone being offended as a result of the race categories on juror information cards. The story was first reported by The Huffington Post.","""Negro"" used as part of race category by New York courts .

"Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger was reunited Wednesday with both survivors and rescuers at the scene of the remarkable emergency landing of U.S. Airways flight 1549 five years ago on the Hudson River. To mark the anniversary, Sullenberger, First Officer Jeffrey Skiles and several passengers of the 150 who were on the plane were reunited with members of the ferry crews who rescued them on January 15, 2009. ""Much was saved that day,"" Sullenberger said at a news conference. ""And it's the efforts not only of the crew, the rescuers, and the first responders, that everyone survived."" ""Had even one person not survived,"" he added, ""I personally couldn't have celebrated any of this."" Five years ago, the aircraft left LaGuardia Airport and ran into a flock of geese that damaged both engines, forcing the crew to land in the frigid waters of the Hudson. Within four minutes of landing, multiple New York Waterway ferry boats, aided by the U.S. Coast Guard and police from New York and New Jersey, descended on the scene to rescue the 155 people on board. The complicated maneuver, which was called an ""amazing piece of airmanship"" by a former National Transportation Safety Board director, resulted in only a few minor injuries and made heroes of the crew. Passengers at the news conference thanked the rescue teams. ""Without these people, my children would not have had a father, my mom wouldn't have had a son,"" Barry Leonard said. After the news conference, the group of survivors and rescuers boarded a boat on the Hudson River to celebrate. ""We're going to toast to life,"" Leonard said. Sullenberger took time off to write a book and speak about aviation issues before returning to the cockpit in fall 2009. He also joined the airline's flight operations safety management team. After his last flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Charlotte, North Carolina, in March 2010, Sullenberger said he was ""chosen by circumstance"" to be a spokesman for the aviation industry and plans to work independently in that role.","Survivors mark the five-year anniversary of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" landing .

"For the first time in what seems like ages, Congress has passed a government spending plan without resorting to last-minute brinkmanship such as midnight negotiations to prevent an imminent government shutdown. The Senate voted 64-36 on Wednesday to send the compromise federal budget framework to President Barack Obama, who has signaled his support. Last week, the budget plan easily passed the House on a 332-94 vote, with solid majorities of both parties supporting it. While Wednesday's Senate vote was closer, nine Republicans joined the majority Democrats to provide the required majority of at least 51 votes to pass. The plan guides government spending into 2015, defusing the chances of a shutdown like the one in October that generated public anger against Congress, particularly conservative Republicans blamed for the impasse. Budget deal: Winners and losers . Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the budget committee leaders in both chambers, negotiated the deal that eliminates some forced spending cuts known as sequestration that both sides disliked while reducing the deficit by more than $20 billion in coming years. Mixed opinions . An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday showed that 50% of respondents supported the budget plan while 35% opposed it. According to the survey, a majority of Democrats and independents backed the proposal, while only 39% of Republicans liked it. Some Senate Republicans have said the most important issue at the moment was to lower the budget deficit, even if only by a small percentage, and avoid another damaging scenario like the 16-day government shutdown in October. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he wanted ""to make sure we avoid any additional government shutdowns."" ""The federal government does enough harm to our economy,"" Johnson said. ""We don't need to add additional harm by this crisis management."" Poll: Congress neck-and-neck with car salespeople, lobbyists for least honest . Conservative GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said in a statement that ""sometimes the answer has to be yes."" ""Ultimately, his agreement upholds the principles conservatives stand for and, with Democrats controlling the White House and the Senate, it is the best we can hope for,"" he said of the plan. Other Republicans who voted ""yes"" on Wednesday were Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio. Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said his side dislikes some elements of the agreement, but that's life in divided government when the Senate and House are controlled by different parties. ""We need to get some certainty, and that's what this does,"" he said Tuesday night on CNN, adding: ""Nothing's going to be perfect in this world. It's called compromise."" Budget compromise . Final congressional approval was a rare example of budget bipartisanship after two years of seemingly endless confrontation and acrimony reflecting the differing ideologies of the two sides. Republicans, especially the conservative tea party wing that emerged in 2010, want to drastically shrink the government as the main tool for reducing federal deficits and debt. Democrats insist on protecting the social safety net for the most vulnerable Americans, such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. With midterm elections next year, the Washington dysfunction has spawned public disgust reflected by polls showing support for Congress around record low levels. Obama called the deal ""a good first step away from the shortsighted, crisis-driven decision-making that has only served to act as a drag on our economy."" The plan . The budget agreement, which was months in the making, eases spending caps while softening the impact of the sequestration cuts on defense and non-defense programs. It sets overall spending figures through fiscal year 2014, which started on October 1, as well as fiscal year 2015, with the intent of putting off any further congressional budget stalemate until after the November election. The strong vote in the sharply divided House last week brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters, who initially thought it would sail through the Senate, where bipartisanship has been more the norm. However, some Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill. ""I'd really like to stay within the (spending) caps,"" complained GOP Sen. John Boozman of Arkansas. ""This busts the caps, and as a result, I'll vote against it."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and others complained that the plan reduces some military pension benefits. He called for Obama to hold the bill until a bipartisan fix can be found. Other senators from both parties called for going back later to replace the $6 billion in cuts to future cost-of-living increases in military pensions with reductions elsewhere. ""These heroes lay their lives on the line for us and they deserve us to fix this provision,"" Isakson said before voting for the budget agreement. Three leading tea party-backed senators with 2016 presidential aspirations -- Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, and Marco Rubio of Florida -- also have come out against the budget compromise for similar reasons. Democrats wary, too . While Democrats support the bill, many had concerns. More liberal senators -- like Tom Harkin of Iowa -- complained that an unemployment benefit extension was not included in the deal. ""There's over a million people now who cannot find a job, out of work, and right at this time of year their unemployment insurance is being cut off,"" he told Radio Iowa last week. ""It's really unconscionable."" Don't expect Boehner to totally change his tune .","Nine Senate Republicans join Democrats in backing the budget plan .

"The Supreme Court waded cautiously back into the larger debate over abortion on Wednesday. A number of justices raised concerns about a Massachusetts state law preventing activists from crossing a 35-foot buffer zone around reproductive health clinics. During an intense hour of oral arguments, Massachusetts officials said the issue was more about public safety and pedestrian access on local sidewalks.  Anti-abortion supporters countered their free speech rights were being violated. What the high court decides in coming months could affect a broader range of free speech arenas -- over issues such as war, taxes, corporate bailouts and elections -- where the location of the message is often key. ""There was a considerable history of disturbances and blocking the [clinic] entrance,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Massachusetts case. ""So the state is trying to say: We want to make sure that the entrance is not blocked, and the only way we can do that is to have a rule that applies to everyone. We can't screen people to know who will be well behaved and who will be disruptive."" But Justice Samuel Alito said the law was not content-neutral, since clinic workers can talk to patients inside the marked boundary, but not the protesters. ""This statute says that there is an exemption for employees of the facility if they are operating within the scope of their employment,"" he told the state's attorney. ""And surely coming out and saying this is a safe facility [to enter] is within the scope of their employment. So how do you justify that? Forget about the conduct now, focus on the speech that's allowed. One can speak and say it's safe. The other cannot speak and say it is not safe."" Eleven such women's health clinics across Massachusetts are covered by the fixed buffer zones. The current state law strengthened earlier restrictions that had created a floating 6-foot protective bubble around clinic patrons approaching the facility. Abortion rights supporters said it was ineffective, since they claimed it led to blocked entrances and a gauntlet of protesters surrounding patients and staff. Some past anti-abortion protests have turned violent in the United States. The state's 2007 revised ""selective exclusion law"" makes it a crime for speakers other than clinic ""employees or agents ... acting within the scope of their employment"" to ""enter or remain on a public way or sidewalk"" within 35 feet of ""a reproductive health care facility."" Anti-abortion activists say the law has kept them from effectively talking with patients approaching the clinic entrances. At the Greater Boston Health Center, a clear yellow semicircle on the sidewalk surrounds the front entrance. One of the regular activists -- and lead plaintiff in the appeal -- is Eleanor McCullen, is a lifelong Catholic who generally spends mornings two days a week peacefully spreading her anti-abortion message. With a large cross around her neck, the 77-year-old grandmother often uses a baby stroller as a prop, along with a portable DVD player with images of a fetal ultrasound. On a recent day, she was seen standing at the edge of the buffer, handing out pamphlets and carrying a baby's knit cap. Yet on Wednesday, McCullen was inside the courtroom to witness the pointed debate from the bench. Her lawyer, Mark Rienzi, told the court: ""A law that makes it illegal to even engage in consensual conversation, quiet conversation, on a public sidewalk, an act that makes that a criminal act for which Mrs. McCullen can go to prison, I think, is not permissible under the First Amendment."" Echoing the state's position, Justice Elena Kagan asked: ""It's a little bit too hard to figure out what and what does not disrupt peace and order, so we're just going to say 25 feet around a funeral, or 25 feet around any facility, that that's never permissible?"" Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer pointed out the high court's 2011 near-unanimous opinion favoring the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to loudly protest at the funerals of military service members killed in war, however hateful and disgusting their speech may be. The court said even there, reasonable access regulations were necessary. ""I thought it was pretty important that the demonstrators were behind a hill somewhere and the police restricted where they could go,"" said Breyer, not too close to the funeral. ""Many states have enacted similar laws, and I thought that's important."" Some justices worried the Massachusetts buffer was too large, and that other less restrictive means might be available and still ensure public safety. ""I'm a little bit hung up on why you need so much space,"" Kagan told state attorney Jennifer Grace Miller. ""You know, 35 feet is a ways. ... That's a lot of space."" ""Surely you could have a law against screaming and shouting within 35 feet or protesting within 35 feet. Isn't that more narrowly tailored?"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""What these people want to do is to speak quietly and in a friendly manner, not in a hostile manner, because that would frustrate their purpose, with the people going into the clinic."" Scalia called the buffer a ""dead speech zone."" Justice Anthony Kennedy was especially animated, sharply questioning the views of the state and of the federal government in support of the buffer zones. ""Do you want me to write an opinion and say there's no free speech right to quietly converse on an issue of public importance?"" he asked at one point. ""In speech cases, when you address one problem,"" like public safety, ""you have a duty to protect speech that's lawful."" Handicapping the outcome may be hard in this case because Chief Justice John Roberts-- generally an active questioner-- remained silent during the entire argument, and thus not revealing his views. Justice Clarence Thomas-- who generally sides with the conservative bloc-- also said nothing Wednesday, as was his custom. After arguments Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley said the state law would apply ""in other areas like in voting or in protest areas where the interests in making sure that we have public safety, we have an orderly ability for people to go about their business has been balanced, just the way we did it in this statute."" But McCullen told CNN her ability to counsel women who are walking inside the clinic was being impeded. ""I only get so far-- and they are listening because they don't really want to go in,"" she said. ""They need somebody to care for them and I care. I truly care. But then when we get to the buffer zone I have to stop, and then they keep going and I lose. And one person lost-- one mother and one father that I cannot help-- is one too many."" Demonstrators have appeared regularly at clinics in Boston, Springfield, and Worcester and say they are unfairly singled out for exclusion on public property. The last time the high court took a close look at the issue was in 2000, upholding Colorado's broad ""no approach zone"" regulations. Similar to the earlier Massachusetts law, protesters were kept at least eight feet from anyone within 100 feet of any health care facility. Municipalities in Montana, Florida, California and elsewhere have since enacted similar ""fixed"" and ""floating"" buffer zone laws for clinics. The justices last month heard arguments in a separate appeal involving a longtime anti-war protester kept from spreading his message along a public right-of-way at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

And next week's 41st anniversary of the Roe v. Wade high court ruling legalizing abortion will attract thousands of marchers on both sides of the issue outside the court, just across the street from the Capitol.

"After 10 days stranded far from home, all 52 passengers from a ship stuck in Antarctic ice have now been transferred by helicopter to an Australian icebreaker. ""It's 100% we're off! A huge thanks to all,"" tweeted Chris Turney, an Australian professor among the group of scientists, journalists and tourists marooned on the ship. A helicopter from a nearby Chinese icebreaker ferried passengers Thursday to the Australian icebreaker, the Aurora Australis. The rescue is the latest chapter in a saga that began Christmas Eve after the Russian-flagged MV Akademik Shokalskiy got stuck in unusually thick ice. Officials abandoned a succession of other rescue attempts in recent days because of the treacherous conditions in the region. Earlier Thursday, Australian authorities had said a plan involving the helicopter and a barge was put on hold because of shifting ice conditions. But the new approach, which skipped the use of the barge, got under way later in the day. Turney posted videos showing the helicopter arriving on a makeshift helipad on the ice near the trapped ship and taking off into the crisp blue sky. Robert Darvill, chief mate on the Aurora Australis, told CNN that the 52 new passengers on board were very happy to be there and kept thanking the icebreaker's crew for their efforts. ""They are on their second dinner of the night right now,"" he said. Long journey ahead . It will still be weeks before the research team makes it to the Australian port of Hobart, said John Young of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. ""Mid-January is our best guess,"" Young told reporters on a conference call. The Aurora Australis is still expected to complete a resupply mission to Casey Station, an Australian base in Antarctica, before making its way to Hobart. Darvill said that now all the passengers are on the Aurora Australis, the vessel will try to move out of the heavy pack ice and into more open water. But, he said, they will not set off toward Casey Station until the Rescue Coordination Center of Australia gives them the green light. Darvill also thanked the captain of the Chinese icebreaker whose help made the rescue possible. ""Thank you very much for your cooperation. Your crew has done the lion's share of the work and made Australia and much of the world proud,"" he said. Meanwhile, the master of the Akademik Shokalskiy has decided to keep the 22 Russian crew members on board the stranded ship until the pack ice eventually breaks up and allows it to move again, Young said. The vessel has enough supplies to keep the crew going for ""a very long time,"" he said. The helicopter rescue followed a failed attempt by the Chinese icebreaker, the Xue Long, which made it 6 nautical miles from the trapped vessel before being stopped by especially thick ice. That was followed by an effort by the Australian icebreaker, which was forced Monday to suspend efforts to reach the expedition because of bad weather. The Aurora Australis got within 10 nautical miles of the ship before it turned back. Over the weekend, the maritime agency called off an effort by the French icebreaker Astrolabe. Viral sensations . The exploits of the research crew have gone viral, thanks in large part to Twitter and YouTube posts by those aboard the stranded vessel. Turney, the leader of a research expedition on the Akademik Shokalskiy, has tweeted photos of the stranded ship, the crew and penguins, which have stopped by to check out their new neighbors. The group even managed to ring in 2014 with good cheer. ""We're the A, A, E who have traveled far, having fun doing science in Antarctica!"" a dozen or so of them sang in a video posted on YouTube. ""Lots of snow and lots of ice, lots of penguins, which are very, very nice! ""Really good food and company, but a bloody great shame we are still stuck here! Ice core, cha cha cha! Ice core, cha cha cha!"" The expedition . Turney's expedition to gauge the effects of climate change on the region began on November 27. The second and current leg of the trip started on December 8 and was scheduled to conclude with a return to New Zealand on Saturday. The vessel got stuck in the ice 15 days after setting out on the second leg. Turney, a climate change professor at the University of New South Wales, has said the ship was surrounded by ice up to nearly 10 feet (3 meters) thick.","Chief mate: Passengers are very happy now to be on the Australian icebreaker .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- The slaughter of bottlenose dolphins in an infamous Japanese cove took place on Tuesday. About 500 dolphins were driven into the cove this year, a larger number than usual, according to the local Taiji fishermen's union. A fisherman who is a union board member, and who did not want to be named, told CNN that the total number of dolphins to be captured or slaughtered was less than 100, and that the rest would be released. The yearly event is a focal point of the Taiji community's dolphin hunting season, which many in the community in southwest Japan view as a long-held tradition. The annual hunting season begins in September and runs through March, according to animal rights activists. But the hunt is heavily scrutinized by environmental activists, who have been monitoring activities and livestreaming and tweeting about the latest developments. In recent days, environmentalist group the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has provided livestreams showing bottlenose dolphins splashing frantically as they tried to escape their human captors. Dolphins separated by nets into smaller partitions bobbed up and down, trying to reach other members of their pod. The group said that the dolphins appeared bloodied, and had had nothing to eat since their capture in Taiji Cove four days ago. The union representative said that the fishermen had introduced what they considered a ""more humane"" method of slaughtering the dolphins, cutting their spines on the beach to kill the animals more swiftly and cause them less pain. Defending tradition . Although the hunting of dolphins is widely condemned in the West, many in Japan defend the practice as a local custom -- and say it is no different to the slaughter of other animals for meat. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters at a news conference Monday that marine mammals including dolphins were ""very important water resources."" ""Dolphin fishing is one of traditional fishing forms of our country and is carried out appropriately in accordance with the law. Dolphin is not covered by the International Whaling Commission control and it's controlled under responsibility of each country."" Taiji mayor Kazutaka Sangen echoed the sentiments. ""We have fishermen in our community and they are exercising their fishing rights,"" he said. ""We feel that we need to protect our residents against the criticisms."" He accused the Sea Shepherd of using the issue of dolphin hunting to raise funds and attract attention. The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society has been live-streaming video of events in the cove and posting frequent updates on Twitter. The Wakayama Prefectural Government, where Taiji is located, gives an annual ""catching quota."" This year, the government allows for the hunting of 2,026 small porpoises and dolphins (557 are for bottlenose dolphins). The dolphin hunt has seen some changes, Sangen said. The town wants to create a whale/porpoise study with the aim of bringing a marine park to the city. And the method of hunting has been changing, becoming less crude, he added. On Monday, the fishermen focused on selecting dolphins to be sold into captivity at marine parks and aquariums in Japan and overseas, the conservation group said. Trainers marked the dolphins deemed unsuitable for captivity, which would be either killed or driven back out to the ocean, according to the Sea Shepherd group. Kennedy's tweet met with criticism in Japan . Caroline Kennedy, the recently installed U.S. ambassador to Japan, tweeted that she is ""deeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing."" ""I understand her statement as an expression of her concern on this debate,"" said Sangen. ""There always are the people who say it's wrong and it's right, but what we have to see is if fishermen are hunting endangered species or not. They don't. We are fishing under the permission just like the U.S. does."" While Japanese media did not cover the dolphin hunt, several outlets reported on Kennedy's comments. On social media, Japanese users blasted Kennedy for commenting on what many consider a tradition. One user, named @simaya tweeted: ""She refers to humanitarian treatment to animals. What about the atomic bombing, Agent Orange and missiles falling on civilians in the Middle East?"" Masayhisa Sato, a Japanese lawmaker tweeted: ""The dolphin hunt is also a traditional fishing culture. I wonder whether it's appropriate for ambassador to comment on this."" Captivity, death or freedom . On the days leading to the killing, divers and boats drove the dolphins into increasingly small segments of the water to select the ones that will be held in captivity. In the days leading up to the dolphin hunting, 40 to 60 local fishermen worked with nets to divide up the dolphin pod. ""They tighten up the nets to bring each sub-group together then the skiffs push them toward the tarps. Under the tarps in the shallows is where the trainers work with the killers to select the 'prettiest' dolphins which will sell and make the best pay day for the hunters,"" said the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. Dozens of men circled around dolphins pinning them against a boat and hoisting them into black nets by pulling on their dorsal fin. When men successfully captured the dolphins into the net, they cheered ""Yay!"" The Cove Guardians counted 51 bottlenose dolphins taken in the last few days, but the fishermen's union did not disclose the number of dolphins captured or killed. Japan at center of controversy . A 2009 Oscar-nominated documentary film, ""The Cove,"" brought the issue of dolphin hunting in Taiji to the fore with bloody scenes of dolphin slaughter. The prefecture government has condemned the film in an online response as distorted, biased and unfair to the fishermen. ""'The Cove' filmed secretly the scenes of dying dolphins, and depicted their death in a manner designed to excite outrage,"" according to the Wakayama Prefecture statement. ""The Taiji dolphin fishery has been a target of repeated psychological harassment and interference by aggressive foreign animal protection organizations,"" it said. The Japanese practice of whale hunting has also put it in conflict with the views of much of the world. Earlier this year, Sea Shepherd said it had chased Japan's whalers out of Antarctic waters. Japan's fleet carries out an annual whale hunt despite a worldwide moratorium, taking advantage of a loophole in the law that permits the killing of the mammals for scientific research. Whale meat is commonly available for consumption in Japan. CNN's Junko Ogura and Laura Smith-Spark contributed to this report. Madison Park reported and wrote from Hong Kong. Yoko Wakatsuki reported from Tokyo.","Local fisherman: Dolphin slaughter took place in cove in Taiji, Japan .

"The U.S. military has obtained new video apparently made by those holding the lone American prisoner of war, Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. A U.S. military official told CNN the clip shows the Wood River Valley, Idaho, native in diminished health from the effects of close to five years in captivity. He was seized in Afghanistan in June 2009 and is believed held by the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network in Pakistan, the official said. The so-called proof-of-life video, the first of him in nearly three years, has a reference to December 14, 2013. CNN has not seen the video. U.S. efforts to free Bergdahl, including negotiating for his release, have so far failed. ""Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has been gone far too long, and we continue to call for and work toward his safe and immediate release,"" a Pentagon spokesman said. Bergdahl strong, well-rounded and easy to talk to, friends say . ""We cannot discuss all the details of our efforts, but there should be no doubt that on a daily basis -- using our military, intelligence and diplomatic tools -- we work to see Sgt. Bergdahl returned home safely,"" the spokesman said. His family, who received a letter from him last year via the Red Cross, issued a statement in response to the latest video. ""As we have done so many times over the past 4 and a half years, we request his captors to release him safely so that our only son can be reunited with his mother and father,"" the statement reads. ""BOWE - If see this, continue to remain strong through patience. Your endurance will carry you to the finish line. Breathe!"" Bergdahl was 23 when he was captured after finishing a guard shift at a combat outpost in southeastern Paktika province. The U.S. government acknowledged in May 2012 that it was engaged in talks with the Taliban to free Bergdahl. The discussions moved in fits and starts because of U.S. concerns that any Taliban prisoners swapped for Bergdahl might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight. Later that year, however, the White House announced it was willing to send five Taliban prisoners to Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl.

"New York Mayor Bill de Blasio Thursday announced a settlement in the long legal battle over the police department's controversial stop-and-frisk policies, which a federal judge ruled violated the rights of minority residents. In addition to dropping its appeal of the ruling, the city will implement reforms aimed at improving strained relations between police and the community. De Blasio, who targeted the policing practice during his mayoral campaign to succeed Michael Bloomberg, called the settlement ending the Floyd vs. City of New York case ""historic"" and said it closes the years-long legal fight that found the overuse of stop-and-frisk unconstitutional. De Blasio said 90% of the people who were stopped and frisked were innocent of any crimes. ""We're here today to turn the page on one of the most divisive problems in our city,"" he told reporters. ""We believe in ending the overuse of stop-and-frisk that has unfairly targeted young African-American and Latino men. ... We believe in one city where everyone rises together, respecting every New Yorker's rights regardless of what neighborhood they live in or the color of their skin."" In August 2013, a federal judge ruled that stop-and-frisk violated the Constitution and ordered the city to develop remedies. The ruling stemmed from a class-action lawsuit representing potentially hundreds of thousands of people that never asked for monetary damages. They instead sued to have the policy changed. ""We have been in negotiations with the city since the new administration came into office... so it wasn't a surprise,"" Darius Charney, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, told CNN. ""But we still obviously consider today to be a very important step along a long struggle that goes back a decade."" Charney and others will now enter a new phase of talks with city officials in a collaborative attempt to reform the policy that dictates how and when police officers can stop and question someone on the street. ""We are definitely cautiously optimistic that this can be a collaborative effort and we will work with them, but we also will remain vigilant throughout the process to hold them accountable to their promises,"" he said. The much-criticized method, in which police stopped and searched those they considered suspicious, had been used to deter crime, the police department said. But it has also resulted in a slew of lawsuits by residents complaining of unlawful stops. ""We will not break the law to enforce the law,"" said the new police commissioner, Bill Bratton. ""That's my solemn promise to every New Yorker, regardless of where they were born, where they live or what they look like."" Bratton stopped short of calling the previous administration's stop-and-frisk activity a quota system, but said it was ""quite clear officers were strongly encouraged, were expected to produce activity."" ""The officers themselves were asking why more,"" he said. ""They were being pushed to do more. I think that's clearly understood."" Last year, then-Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said the department did not engage in racial profiling. Under the agreement with plaintiffs who sued the city over the practice, a court-appointed monitor will oversee the New York Police Department's reforms of the policy for three years. The monitor will report to a federal court on the city's progress. The city will also take part in a process with community members ""to ensure people affected by stop-and-frisk play an active role in shaping reform,"" de Blasio said in a statement. Police department figures showed that nearly nine out of 10 people ""stopped and frisked"" in 2011 were African-American or Hispanic. The data showed that of the 685,724 stops made by police that year, 53% of those questioned were black, 34% were Latino, 9% were white and 3% were Asian. The citywide population in 2011 was 23.4% black, 29.4% Hispanic, 12.9% Asian and 34.3% non-Hispanic white, according to the report. One of the subjects of the stops appeared with de Blasio at Thursday's press conference. The first time Nicholas Peart, who is black,  was stopped and frisked by police officers he was celebrating his 18th birthday. It happened three more times in the years since, despite having never committed a crime, he said. It prompted him to become a plaintiff the lawsuit. ""We have made some significant steps,"" said Peart, now 25. ""This is a small part of a larger battle that we have.""","90% of those who were stopped and frisked were innocent, mayor says .

"One month before the Winter Olympics begin in the Russian resort town of Sochi -- and in the shadow of last month's deadly bombings in Volgograd -- a huge security operation has swung into gear. A special exclusion zone went into force Tuesday under which only Sochi-marked vehicles, emergency or specially accredited intelligence service cars will be allowed into the wider Sochi area. Air traffic and sea access will be restricted, and everyone going into the zone will have to go through heavy security and identity checks. Russia is pouring huge resources into ensuring that the Games, seen as a flagship project of President Vladimir Putin, go off without incident. Two bombings in 24 hours last month in Volgograd, one targeting the city's main train station and the second a trolley bus, raised concerns of a potential  threat to the Sochi event. No group has to date claimed responsibility for the attacks, but suspicion has fallen on Chechen separatist groups. A bitter battle for an independent Chechnya, lasting almost two decades, spawned an insurgency that has spilled into neighboring republics in the North Caucasus region, including Dagestan. Chechen warlord Doku Umarov, leader of the Islamist Caucasus Emirate group, last summer called on his followers to do what they can to disrupt the Games. He claims they will be held on the graves of Muslim occupants of Sochi, who he says were driven out by Russian imperial forces in the 19th century. Despite the shockwaves of the Volgograd attack, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said he was confident that Russia would keep the Winter Olympics safe. And, of course, Russia is not alone in suffering a terror attack a short time before hosting an Olympic event. The United States was still reeling from the September 11, 2001, attacks when it hosted the Salt Lake City Games in 2002. Bombings in Russia's Volgograd: What might be behind the attacks? Lone suicide bombers . The bombings in Volgograd, which lies about 400 miles (650 kilometers) from Sochi but is a major rail hub for passengers traveling to the Black Sea resort, were not the first such attacks Russia has faced. In 2002, Chechen militants took 900 theatergoers hostage at the Dubrovka Theater in Moscow. Russian security forces stormed the building, killing all the rebels, but 130 hostages also lost their lives. In May 2004, a bomb planted months earlier during construction ripped through a stadium in the Chechen capital of Grozny, killing the republic's president, Akhmad Kadyrov. A horrifying attack by militants on a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, came only four months later. When the siege ended, more than 330 people had died, half of them children. More recently, Umarov's group claimed responsibility for the deadly 2011 bombing of Domodedovo Airport in Moscow, the 2010 bombings of the capital's subway and the 2009 bombing of the high-speed Nevsky Express train. Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist who specializes in the Russian intelligence services, told CNN he believes Russia's militants no longer have the freedom of movement for this kind of large-scale terror attack -- but he's not confident the intelligence services are prepared for the threat of lone suicide bombers. ""My basic explanation is that they're still inspired by the Olympic Games in Moscow in 1980,"" he said. ""They seem to be obsessed with the idea of controlling everything and everybody, but I don't think that's the same thing as what you need to prevent a terror attack."" Retired police Col. Sergei Advienko has more faith in the abilities of his former intelligence counterparts. ""When the tactics of terrorists are changing, the anti-terrorist units have to change their tactics as well. And the utmost means in this field is intelligence, first of all,"" he said. ""It's not that easy to penetrate those cells, but still -- it is possible, it is done, it is done daily."" Bombings raise questions about Olympics security . Soft targets? What alarms many security analysts is not so much the threat to Sochi but that posed to softer targets farther afield. Matthew Clements, editor of IHS Jane's Intelligence Review and a Russia expert, said the Olympic park, venues and infrastructure, such as the new rail link built to connect the Black Sea resort with the mountain venues, will be enormously well protected. ""That would be a prime target, but the extraordinarily high level of security put in place means that it would be very difficult for the militants to undertake a successful attack for one of these sites,"" he said. There is a slightly higher risk of attack on softer targets in the wider Sochi area, Clements said. These could include train stations, hotels and major public squares. An attack on such a target ""could again cause major disruption to the Games,"" he said. However, it would still be difficult for militants to travel into this security zone. Clements sees the greatest risk as being outside the immediate Sochi area, particularly softer targets such as transport infrastructure not directly linked to the Games. While such an attack would not directly disrupt the Games, it ""would have a significant psychological impact and would to a certain extent overshadow them,"" he said. In the wake of the Volgograd attacks, Russian officials said they did not intend to change their security plans for Sochi -- since they were already so developed -- but vigilance will likely be stepped up elsewhere. All in all, Russia plans to deploy some 37,000 security personnel, according to the Ministry of the Interior. By comparison, 12,000 police and security personnel were deployed for the 2012 London Olympics, with 18,000 troops on standby, Clements said. ""It's a smaller Games, and it's got twice as many personnel,"" Clements said of Sochi. ""It's obviously a very, very significant deployment there."" Putin visits victims of Volgograd blasts . Jihadist threat . Dmitri Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, agrees that ""Sochi is perhaps the best protected area in Russia"" and will be difficult for militants to penetrate. But he said Russia faces an ""ever-present"" threat despite some lulls between attacks. ""Essentially Russia has been living under the threat of terrorist attacks since the 1990s,"" he said. This was initially linked to the war in Chechnya, he said, but since then has morphed from a separatist movement into a ""threat which is of a civilizational nature"" from people who reject modern Russia and want to pursue a jihadist agenda. ""That unfortunately remains and will continue to be part of everyday life in Russia for, I think, the foreseeable future,"" he said. Trenin, who formerly served in the Soviet and Russian armed forces, sees the threat as greatest in southern Russia cities such as Volgograd, which are relatively close to Sochi but not as well protected as Moscow and St. Petersburg. ""Southern Russia is very much accessible to the jihadists, but they can strike anywhere on the Volga River, on central Russia,"" he said. The twin bombings in Volgograd caused grief and disbelief in Russia, he said, especially after the second attack -- staged when security had been stepped up. But the Games are still a great source of pride for many Russians as only the second Olympics held on Russian soil, he said, and there has been no call for people to stay away. ""It reminds me of the Boston Marathon bombing,"" he said. ""In the wake of that attack, a lot of people came out and said, 'We will run in the marathon, we will come out in the street to demonstrate to the terrorists that they cannot intimidate us.' ""I felt some of that in the reaction around the world to the Volgograd bombings."" 'It's better to lose money than to lose our lives' It's not yet clear what impact the security concerns will have on the number of foreign visitors to Sochi. But Jose Coira, 24, from Houston, is one person who has canceled his trip to the Winter Olympics in the wake of the Volgograd attacks. He and his boyfriend, both keen to see the ice skating and snowboarding, had been planning the trip for a long time, Coira said. But the shock of the bombings, plus Coira's disquiet over Russia's position on gay rights following the passage of a controversial ""anti-gay propaganda"" law last year, led them to make the difficult decision to cancel. ""With these attacks, I felt it was another sign we should not go for our safety, not just for us being LGBT but for our safety in general,"" Coira told CNN. He was able to get a refund on his Sochi hotel booking but stands to lose the $4,000 he spent on flights and event tickets for himself and his partner. Coira, who runs an underwear business, also had a business meeting scheduled in Moscow to coincide with the Sochi trip but will lose out on the chance to launch his product in Russia for the moment. Coira said he might consider traveling to Russia in the future, but only if he feels safe there and if its stance toward the lesbian, gay and transgender community changes. ""How we feel is, it's better to lose that money than to lose our lives,"" he said. ""It's very sad, we would love to go, but everything surrounding Russia right now doesn't look very well.""","An exclusion zone goes into force in Sochi with one month to go before the Winter Olympics .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Two soldiers were killed and 14 others were injured Tuesday when a bomb planted under a military bus exploded in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, authorities said. The soldiers were on their way to work from another district of the capital. Three of the injured are in critical condition, authorities said. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Violence continues on a daily basis in Sanaa, with thousands of troops still stationed on the streets. ""Security has deteriorated over the last two months, and people are worried. Troops are in the streets, but in the wrong place in the wrong time,"" said Ahmed Bahri, a senior official in the opposition Haq Party. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network. Al Qaeda has stood behind a string of attacks on government troops but denied responsibility for a bus explosion that killed five soldiers last year. Tuesday's bus blast is the latest incident to rock the Yemeni capital in less than a week. On Sunday, two powerful explosions shook Sanaa, with one blast near the French embassy and the other near the Defense Ministry. Nearby houses were damaged and four civilians were injured. The Supreme Security Committee said Monday that the explosions were caused by rockets launched from rural areas surrounding the capital. Two Westerners, a German and a Briton, have been kidnapped in Sanaa in the past three days. The government says it has no information on their whereabouts. Neither embassy concerned has commented on the kidnapping incidents. The German was studying Arabic at a language center in the old city of Sanaa, while the Briton worked in the development sector in Yemen, Interior and Foreign Ministry officials said. Yemen has witnessed unrest since early 2011, when mass protests first broke out. Former President Ali Abdullah Saleh was forced out of power a year later, after 33 years in office. Journalist Hakim Almasmari reported from Sanaa; CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","Two soldiers are killed and 14 injured when a bomb explodes under a military bus .

"U.S. officials reacted angrily Tuesday to comments attributed to Israel's defense minister criticizing Secretary of State John Kerry's efforts to broker a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinians. The derisive remarks appeared in a popular daily Israeli newspaper, Yedioth Ahronot, and reflect Moshe Yaalon's skepticism of the Kerry-led U.S. efforts ""both in private conversations in Israel and in the U.S."" ""American Secretary of State John Kerry, who turned up here determined and acting out of misplaced obsession and messianic fervor, cannot teach me anything about the conflict with the Palestinians,"" Yaalon said, according to the paper. Yaalon later issued an apology in a written statement sent to media from the Defense Ministry. ""Israel and the United States share a common goal to advance the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians led by Secretary Kerry. We appreciate Secretary Kerry's many efforts towards that end,"" the release said. ""The defense minister had no intention to cause any offense to the secretary, and he apologizes if the secretary was offended by words attributed to the minister."" Earlier, the U.S. State Department issued a harsh rebuke. Spokeswoman Marie Harf said it was shocking that a close ally would question Kerry's motives. ""If these comments are accurate, we find the remarks of the defense minister to be offensive and inappropriate, especially given all that the United States has done to support Israel's security needs and will continue to do,"" she said at a regular media briefing. ""Secretary Kerry and his team, including Gen. (John)  Allen, have been working day and  night to try to promote a secure peace for Israel because of the secretary's deep concern for Israel's future."" President Barack Obama's press secretary Jay Carney said much the same thing to reporters at the daily news conference at the White House. He added that Kerry met Sunday in Paris with Arab leaders to discuss peace initiatives, efforts that will continue. ""We're pressing forward with both the Israelis and the Palestinians on this process and hope that it bears fruit,"" he said. Kerry recently visited Jerusalem where he met multiple times with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He declined to share details of the conversations with reporters but told them that progress was being made during the trip, his ninth to the region since becoming secretary about a year ago. ""We're at the table today because of the determination to try to resolve this issue, and both of them have made the tough choices to stay at that table,"" he said January 5. ""We are now at a point where the choices narrow down and the choices are obviously real and difficult. And so we -- the United States, President Obama, myself -- will do everything in our power to help the parties be able to see the road ahead in ways that will meet the interests of both of their peoples."" Kerry has floated a proposal based on five months of intensive consultations with Israelis and Palestinians since the resumption of the peace process last summer. Yaalon was quoted Tuesday as saying: ""The American security plan presented to us is not worth the paper it's written on. It contains no peace and no security."" Sa'eb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator and a member of the executive committee of the PLO, told CNN the comments were another indication that the Israeli government was trying to sabotage Kerry's efforts. Israel wants to dictate terms, not negotiate, he told CNN. ""This is absolutely inappropriate and extremely despicable statements, because Mr. Kerry is exerting every possible human effort for the sake of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and he should not be rewarded with such statements from Yaalon or somebody else,"" he said.","Israeli defense minister says he had no intention to offend Kerry .

""After I reviewed the case I found that a crime almost certainly did take place,"" District Attorney Jon David told reporters Tuesday. ""It was a 'bad shoot.' A grand jury has agreed."" CNN affiliate WECT reported that an attorney for Vassey indicated he planned to issue a statement on Tuesday or Wednesday. Last month, Vassey, through his lawyer W. James Payne, claimed to CNN that he feared one of the other responding officers was in danger. Keith Vidal, 18, was killed January 5 at his family's home in the eastern North Carolina town of Boiling Springs Lakes. Three law enforcement officers from three different agencies answered a 911 call asking for police to help in dealing with a schizophrenic man armed with a screwdriver and asking to fight his mother. Family members said the first two were able to calm the situation, but things quickly devolved after Vassey arrived. Within a few minutes, Vidal was dead. None of the officers was injured in the incident. CNN first learned of the shooting through an iReport sent by a family friend.","Bryon Vassey was given until Wednesday to surrender .

"Armed men attacked the Tripoli headquarters of a privately owned Libyan television channel early Wednesday, causing extensive damage to the building, al-Asema TV reported. At least seven masked men attacked the station just after midnight with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades, causing heavy damage to the building and broadcasting equipment and setting part of it on fire, the station reported. The gunmen made the staff leave the building first, the station said. Al-Asema TV is a privately owned channel affiliated with Mahmoud Jibril, the country's interim Prime Minister during the 2011 revolution, and his National Front Alliance (NFA), the liberal political bloc in the General National Congress, Libya's parliament. The channel is viewed as critical of Islamist parties in Libya especially now, during a time of heightened political polarization in the country. The attack was the latest in a wave of violence targeting Libyan media. Earlier this month, an armed attack on Libya al-Ahrar TV in the eastern city of Benghazi damaged the building and broadcast equipment. And this week, four Libyan journalists were kidnapped in two separate incidents in Tripoli, said Reporters Without Borders (RSF). One, the editor of a state-owned newspaper, was released on Tuesday. He had been abducted from outside a cafe in central Tripoli a day earlier. The other three -- all of them state television employees -- remain missing. It's not clear who is behind the kidnappings. In a statement Wednesday, RSF condemned what it described at ""the steadily mounting violence against media personnel in Libya."" ""Reporters Without Borders is extremely worried by the situation in Libya three years after the start of the uprising against the Gadhafi dictatorship and urges the authorities to do everything possible to improve the environment in which the country's journalists work,"" the group said. ""It is in every Libyan's interest to ensure that media personnel can work safely, without fear of being threatened, attacked, kidnapped or murdered."" The security situation has been deteriorating in the North African country, with Libya's weak central government unable to rein in militia groups with different regional, tribal, ideological and political loyalties. The government has been struggling with its plans to build an army and police. According to RSF's 2014 Press Freedom Index, Libya dropped six places and is now ranked 137th out of 180 countries. ""In Libya, freedom of information is under threat from the violence that continues to rock the country,"" the group said. ""Working as a journalist is still very arduous nearly three years after the February 2011 uprising against the Gadhafi regime, which used strict media control to hold on to power for more than four decades. The enthusiasm generated by the Libyan 'media spring' is running out of steam.""

"Police killed a suspected militant leader in a shootout in Russia's restive republic of Dagestan, state media said Tuesday, amid increasing security concerns ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. It's also emerged that Russian authorities are hunting two more 'black widow' suspects -- a notorious type of terrorist that's emerged in Russia's clashes with Chechen separatists. The latest incidents have fueled debate over security at Sochi, despite assurances from Russian President Vladimir Putin that Russia will do its utmost to keep the Games secure. There have been years of unrest linked to an Islamist insurgency in Dagestan and the North Caucasus region, and Islamist militants have vowed to strike at the Games. Russian terrorism officials named the suspected militant killed Tuesday in Dagestan as Eldar Magato, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Earlier, the news agency said Russian special forces were engaged in two operations in Dagestan, which lies about a 12-hour drive from Sochi on the other side of the Caucasus Mountains. Security forces killed three more suspected militants in Dagestan on Monday, it reported. 'Black widows' Meanwhile, a flier handed out by security forces to hotels in Rostov-on-Don, southeast Russia, names three women it says could carry out a suicide attack planned by militant groups between January 21 and 24, during the Olympic Torch Relay. One of the three, Zaira Nizamudinovna Alieva, was killed in a gun battle over the weekend in Dagestan in which seven militants reportedly died. She had been trained to be a suicide bomber, RIA Novosti cited terrorism officials as saying. The other two are named as Djannet Kurbanismailovna Tcakhaeva and Oksana Albertovna Aslanova. The pictures on the flier show two of the three women in Islamic headgear. But its text warns that the women may not be dressed that way. ""Suspected terrorists may use regularly clothing without any Islamic elements, e.g. no long dresses, no hijab, which makes it easier to blend into a crowd, and makes it easier to get access to large gatherings without being noticed,"" it says. Sochi suspect . Police have also handed out fliers at Sochi area hotels warning of a woman they believe could be a terrorist and who now may be in the Black Sea resort town. One flier seen by CNN asks workers to be on the lookout for Ruzanna ""Salima"" Ibragimova, described as the widow of a member of a militant group from the Caucasus region. The woman, according to the flier, may be involved in organizing ""a terrorist act within the 2014 Olympic region."" CNN obtained a copy of the flier, which is dated January 15, from security staff at a hotel in Sochi. The flier says authorities have received information about Ibragimova's possible arrival in the region last week. Photos of Ibragimova have flooded television and social media reports from Sochi, and some describe her as a ""black widow."" Many of them are widows of insurgents killed by government forces, and they've been blamed for high-profile suicide bombings. Security experts stressed Monday that Ibragimova was probably one of many suspects that authorities are trying to find. ""I guarantee, they're talking about this one black widow,"" former CIA officer Mike Baker said, ""but there are others that they're also worried about."" In a video that surfaced Sunday, two young men believed to have been suicide bombers in last month's back-to-back bombings in the Russian city of Volgograd made an ominous promise. ""We've prepared a present for you and all tourists who'll come over,"" the video says. ""If you will hold the Olympics, you'll get a present from us for the Muslim blood that's been spilled."" The U.S. military has contingency plans in place for an evacuation of U.S. citizens in case of a major incident in Sochi.","Militant leader killed in police shootout in Dagestan, state media reports .

"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford admitted to drinking again after a video posted on social media showed him babbling about the city's police chief Monday night while he was at a fast food restaurant. The mayor, who had pledged to refrain from alcohol, stopped briefly to talk to reporters Tuesday when he was asked about the video that shows him incoherently talking to customers at a Steak Queen in Rexdale. ""I was with some friends and what I do with my personal life, and with my personal friends, that's up to me,"" he said. The mayor said he only had a little bit to drink and didn't do drugs Monday. In the video, which lasts 66 seconds, Ford speaks at times in Creole with a Jamaican accent. He is dressed in a suit and tie, with his back to the counter. He uses a profanity at the beginning of the clip to describe Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair. It's the latest embarrassment for Ford, infamous for admitting he smoked crack and drank too much. Ford has denied being an addict. Documents: Criminal suspects claimed Rob Ford tried to buy damaging video . Ford's saga began in May, when allegations emerged that he appeared to be smoking crack cocaine on a pipe on cell phone video taken months earlier, in winter 2012. After initially denying that he had smoked the drug, he admitted in November that he did. The city council later voted to strip him of most of his power as mayor, reducing him to primarily a figurehead. Ford has ignored calls for him to resign or enter rehab and has said he will run for re-election in October.

"""Smart"" TVs have failed because they've always assumed more is better. Instead of evolving the television experience, TV makers have simply added to it, heaping more streams, more services, and more content onto our sets without rethinking the interfaces for accessing them. The same problem plagues the services that power those smart TVs. Netflix offers thousands of options for what to watch, but instead of giving you a chance to skip through and sample them, it makes you evaluate each one, like a title on a video-store shelf. In both cases, the experience has become more about selecting a piece of content than simply watching TV. The result? More ends up feeling like a lot less. That's the central problem plaguing both set-top boxes like Roku and Apple TV and content services like Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. Instead of letting you lean back and soak up content, these new challengers require decisions -- a careful cost-benefit analysis of thousands of different options. If the traditional TV experience is about letting viewers surf channels, today's on-demand video is like giving them a speedboat and forcing them choose a destination before they can even get in the water. It's the fundamental reason smart TV and streaming video user interfaces pale in comparison to regular TV for so much of our daily viewing. And it's a shame. The channels we've always known are the perfect interface for TV. For some reason, we seem hell-bent on abandoning them. The simple joy of channel surfing . Channel surfing sounds like a '90s relic, something we did when we were a nation of mindless couch potatoes, not yet graced with on-demand content and our sophisticated second screens. Here's the thing, though: We're still couch potatoes! According to the U.S. labor department, Americans on average watch nearly three hours of TV a day. Nielsen pegs it even higher, at 42 hours a week, with only three of those hours happening on laptops or mobile devices. How a math genius hacked OkCupid to find true love . It's hard to find data that breaks down what we're watching, but I'll bet only a fraction is spent digesting hour-long cable dramas. That daily figure isn't so high because we're tuning in to must-see TV—rather, it's the opposite. We get home and we flip on the set. We change into comfortable clothes, drink a glass of wine, make dinner, surf the web a little bit from a couch. In between all those things we click around from channel to channel to find something to fill the air. It doesn't have to be riveting. Often times, it's better if it's not. What regular TV really offers is low-stakes, ambient entertainment. That's something that's utterly missing from Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Roku, and Apple TV. Consider, for example, a strange paradox of the streaming video age: You'll totally watch an hour of ""Ghostbusters"" on TNT, but you'd never in a million years start it up from the top on Netflix, even though it's always right there, just a dozen clicks away. Facebook's greatest innovations: The first decade . That example gets to the heart of what makes channel surfing so great. It's a zero-commitment affair. It's a fundamentally passive way to consume media, whereas today's streaming video libraries demand agency on the part of the viewer. Netflix is great when you want to watch something, but it's terrible when you want to watch anything. Set-top boxes take too many clicks . Consider how much friction there is in using today's streaming services, purely on a nuts-and-bolts level. With regular TV, you press one button and something's on your screen. Mash on the remote again and there's another show in front of you. Channel surfing is beautifully elegant in terms of input and output: a pure one-to-one relationship between tactile action and visual stimulus. Compare that to Apple TV. One click on the slippery little remote to wake it up; several more to navigate the grid-based UI to the ""channel"" of your choice. Even with the fistful of live TV apps now available on the device, the experience has none of the fluidity of real TV. Say you want to see what's on Watch ESPN. You have to click its icon, then navigate a sub-menu of ESPN's various channels. It doesn't show you what's on any of them. You just have to click into ESPN, see what's on, click back, then click ESPN 2, and so forth. It's maddening. Netflix needs to be a stream, not just a library . When compared to the rest of our media diet, though, the bigger problems with streaming services such as Netflix quickly come into focus. As we've heard again and again, the dominant model for organizing digital content throughout the last half-decade has been the stream. It's everywhere -- any site or service that presents content in the familiar, endlessly scrolling chronological list. Blogs are streams. Facebook's a stream. Twitter's a stream on steroids. You know what else is a stream? Live TV! It comes with the very same qualities that exist in and enliven all the examples above. It's immediate. It's constant. It's always-on, always-there, always-new. You don't have to do a damn thing except show up. How the NSA almost killed the Internet . While synonymous with the age of streaming video, Netflix is less like a stream and more like a colossal vending machine. It offers a plentitude of carefully wrapped choices, each requiring careful consideration. Infinite choice is exhausting. Ask anyone who's spent 30 minutes trying to pick a movie, only to give up and see what's on TV. Nate Giraitis, Associate Director, Insights & Strategy at Smart Design, points out that Netflix is very much defined by its origins. In its earliest incarnation, Netflix wasn't competing with TV; it was competing with Blockbuster. ""Netflix was a video rental store,"" he explains. ""And its original website was a rental shelf."" That's what gave birth to Netflix's UI, and countless streaming video services have followed its example. As he puts it, with Netflix ""you're not watching. You're shopping."" There are signs that Netflix is trying to do better. It recently tweaked its UI so that the next episode of a TV series starts automatically after you finish one, simulating the always-something-on-next effect of regular TV. Felix Salmon recently argued that Netflix's new super-specific, algorithmically suggested microgenres are an effort to make itself more TV-like, an attempt to serve up something from its vast archive of second-tier content that you'll consent to watch, even if you're not enthralled by it. Gimme channels . But for Netflix and its ilk to begin eating into those three hours of nightly TV time, it needs proper channels. Think: A dozen programmed line-ups and an interface to match, so that with one click you can be in the middle of something random from Netflix's catalog -- something that's perfectly suited for the ambient entertainment we crave. If that's too radical, just think of it as Pandora-mode. It doesn't have to replace Netflix's library entirely. But it should be offered as a complement to it. 11 must-watch Netflix movies to stream in 2014 . The same goes for Roku TV. The company's newest product -- a flatscreen built from the ground up around Roku -- offers 1,200 ""channels,"" from real stations like PBS and ESPN, to services like Pandora and Netflix and lesser-known entities like Crackle and ""The Daily Burn."" There's one big problem. They're not really channels at all. Instead, they're just apps by another name. Make them into real, instantaneous video streams, and then you've got something. There might be some dumb reason we can't have this. Perhaps there's a clause in licensing agreements that forbids Netflix from packaging this sort of programming; maybe most viewers don't yet have the bandwidth necessary for these services to simulate some sort of channel surfing experience. Nevertheless, if Netflix truly wants to make itself an indispensable eight-bucks-a-month expense -- or if Roku wants to build the standalone TV that can finally break cable's hegemony -- giving couch potatoes some true channels to dip into is the way to do it. I could be wrong, but I suspect there are a lot of people like me out there. I never have time for ""Ghostbusters,"" but I always have time for the last 30 minutes of it. You can build this open-source car in an hour .","Today's streaming services like Netflix don't offer a passive TV experience .

But we're still a culture of channel surfers .

"In ""Stand Your Ground"" Florida, Michael Dunn said he felt threatened by a car full of teens playing loud music and pumped about 10 rounds from his 9 mm pistol into their SUV, killing 17-year-old Jordan Davis.  There were, of course, no return shots, because the teens were unarmed.  Dunn is white, and all the teens in the car were black.  He didn't bother to call the police afterward. Dunn, 47, is on trial, charged with murder. He took the stand Monday, detailing how he was pulled up at a gas station when he asked the teens to turn down the music -- ""rap crap"" he called it.  Through the teenagers' tinted windows he saw menace, someone reaching for something. ""You're not going to kill me, you son of a b***h,"" Dunn recalled saying as he reached for his loaded gun in his glove box. And he only ""stopped firing when it appeared the threat was over."" Under Florida's ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which could be used in this case, you are granted immunity from criminal and civil charges -- even if you didn't first try to retreat -- if you can show you had a reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm or death. And reasonable is up to interpretation. A 2012 study by The Urban Institute found that in the ""Stand Your Ground"" states, when white shooters kill black people, ""34% of the resulting homicides are deemed justifiable. Only 3% of deaths are ruled justifiable when the shooter is black and the victim is white.""  And Dunn feels justified. ""I am NOT a murderer,"" Dunn has said.  Instead, he has taken on the mantle of victimhood and claimed, ""I am a survivor."" Dunn saw black and Dunn saw ""threat.""  And he still does. He wrote, while awaiting trial, ""This jail is full of blacks, and they all act like thugs. ... This may sound a bit radical, but if more people would arm themselves and kill these **** idiots when they're threatening you, eventually they may take the hint and change their behavior."" But it's not just the vigilantes.  In January, Philadelphia police determined that a group of African American teens wearing hats and scarves in 13 degree weather looked ""suspicious.""  The resulting stop and frisk led to the crushed testicles of a straight-A student who was simply on his way to a high school basketball game. He is now in a wheelchair. Recently, researchers at Stanford University conducted studies where police and others, cued with an image of a black person, quickly deciphered very blurred images often associated with crime, such as a gun. White people see an African American, and they're immediately looking for something illegal. They almost instantly see a threat. Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride, Jonathan Ferrell and the scores of other unarmed African Americans gunned down because the killers felt threatened make that clear. Still, there's another story.  The toll that the assumption of white innocence has on public safety is rarely examined. For example, years ago in Wisconsin, one of Jeffrey Dahmer's young victims ran naked, bleeding and screaming into the arms of Milwaukee's finest. But the serial killer's blond hair worked like pixie dust: The officers ignored the pleas of several African American women, who begged the police to protect the child and get him to safety. Instead, the cops took Dahmer's word that this frail 14-year-old Asian American boy was really a consenting adult and handed the child back over to the cannibal. For most Americans, danger doesn't look like Jeffrey Dahmer. The second part of the same study at Stanford affirmed it. Researchers found when they flashed pictures of whites to police and others, subsequent fuzzy images linked to crime remained a blur for a lot longer.   In the Rorschach psyche of America, the words ""white"" and ""crime"" are not synonymous. This means that authorities are slow to recognize the threat even of serial killers and certainly by gun-toting shooters in neighborhoods, malls, schools, and airports -- if they're white. The ability of white skin to mask a threat was evident in Atlanta last year. In October, a white man pulled up to an elementary school and breezed through an elaborate security system while packing multiple guns, including an AK-47, and nearly 500 rounds of ammunition.  Eight hundred children scrambled out of the building and a SWAT team set up outside. Then, Michael Brandon Hill pointed his gun out the school window and started shooting. As dramatic as the shootings may be, the assumption of white innocence has a more widespread, corrosive effect on the criminal justice system and society. The New York Police Department has documented evidence that the relatively small number of whites who were stopped and frisked accounted for nearly twice as many illegal firearms and one-third more contraband than blacks or Latinos. Still, Deputy Inspector Christopher McCormick instructed his officers to target African Americans. ""I don't have any trouble telling you this,"" he said, ""male blacks 14 to 20, 21."" In other words, where the presumption of white innocence is concerned, facts carry much less weight than perception. Similarly, whites and Hispanics are two-thirds of all crack users in the United States; yet, the U.S. Sentencing Commission found that 79% of sentenced crack offenders in 2009 were black.  As journalist Saki Knafo noted, ""When it comes to illegal drug use, white America does the crime, black America gets the time."" Law professor Jonathan Simon wrote about the ways that the American obsession with crime has created ""a culture of fear.""  Yet, any sense of real safety and security will continue to elude this nation as long black is the default threat setting in America.","Michael Dunn says he was justified in killing black teen because he felt threatened .

"Forget about the big screen, the small screen and even the second screen. A headset due to be released this year promises to beam movies, video games or even video calls directly into your eyeballs. Yes. The Glyph headset, from Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Avegant, will create visuals that don't need a screen -- just your retinas and your brain. If that conjures up exciting images of living like ""Star Trek's"" Geordi La Forge or Cyclops from ""The X Men,"" you're not alone. A Kickstarter campaign was launched last month and set out to raise $250,000 to bankroll the project. It blew past that mark with ease and, with half a month left, was on the verge of breaking the $1 million mark Wednesday. ""We knew we had something really cool and that we'd do well on Kickstarter, but nobody thought we'd hit our goal in less than four hours,"" said Edward Tang, Avegant's CEO. ""It's like ordering flowers for your girlfriend and they show up with a whole truck full of flowers."" The technology that powers the Glyph centers around a set of 2 million microscopic mirrors -- 1 million per eye -- that reflect visuals, including 3-D, into the user's eye. Unlike some entries into the emerging wearable tech field, the Glyph won't be limited to a set of specially designed apps. Tang said the headset, which donors can receive for a $499 ""donation"" to the campaign, is designed to plug into just about anything you own that has a screen -- be it a smartphone, laptop, television or gaming console. Users would play the video content on their mobile or entertainment device but watch it on the Glyph instead of their device's screen. The Glyph has a battery life of about three hours, Tang said. ""I think Google Glass is really interesting ... (but) I think it's a couple years away,"" he said. ""If you ask people what they're doing with their devices today, they're streaming Netflix, they're playing video games and they're listening to music. We created a device that really focused on those aspects."" The startup also wanted to avoid the ""Glasshole"" effect. Google promises Glass will be stylish when it's released to the public, but the look of early test versions has been distracting to some and downright jarring to others. Glyph, on the other hand, looks like a pair of headphones sitting on the user's head when not in use. In fact, it doubles as a pair of high-end headphones with noise canceling that compares with some of the leading brands on the market, according to Avegant. To add visuals, the user flips down the band over their head, making it an eyepiece. The company has opened the headset to outside developers, who they hope will find unexpected uses for its features, which include head-tracking technology. ""By giving developers this brand new tool box, they start to think of amazing applications that we couldn't in our wildest dreams come up with,"" Tang said. But, wait. Mom always said not to sit too close to the TV set. And we all know that bleary-eyed feeling we get from staring at a smartphone or tablet for too long. Won't this be worse? Quite the opposite, Tang said. He said eye fatigue comes from staring at the artificial, pixelated light from our screens. Remove the screen, remove the problem. ""We agree with the moms of the world,"" he said. ""What we're doing is mimicking the actual light around you ... . It's the kind of light that your eyes have been conditioned to see, have evolved to see."" It's all so magically futuristic sounding. Which raises an obvious question: Is Glyph all hype? Folks who have taken an early look don't think so. At January's International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Glyph was one of 40 products chosen for the Editor's Choice Award. More than 3,200 exhibitors attended the show. ""What I could tell was that the projected image, just like my last time with Avegant's virtual retinal display tech, was exceedingly bright and vivid, lacking any sense of pixelation,"" CNET's Scott Stein wrote from CES.  ""A deep-sea 3-D movie looked like it was projected in a tiny little movie theater in front of my eyes."" David Pierce wrote for The Verge: "" 'Life of Pi' displayed perfectly in 3-D without any tweaking, and I played 'Call of Duty: Ghosts' right off a PlayStation 3. All you need to do is to tune the glasses — you focus each eye individually, then set the two eyeholes the right distance apart so they create a single picture. From then on, content just works."" The Kickstarter campaign runs through February 21. Avegant plans to ship units to donors by the end of the year and says the model that will ship will be smaller and lighter than the test models on display. Avegant is based in the heart of Michigan's manufacturing region and hopes to manufacture the Glyph as much as possible in the United States, Tang said.","Avegant Glyph promises to project images directly into the user's eyes, brain .
The headset has raised nearly $1 million on Kickstarter .
It's compatible with smartphones, TVs, gaming consoles and most anything with a screen .

"(CNN) -- Justin Bieber was under the influence of alcohol, pot and Xanax when police stopped him for drag racing in Miami Beach last week, police documents allege. ""Yeah, we were smoking all night at the studio,"" the singer told a police officer who told him he ""reeked of marijuana,"" according to documents released Thursday. Bieber was ""excited,"" ""talkative,"" ""insulting"" and ""cocky"" and ""used profanity,"" according to a intoxication evaluation conducted by police in the Florida city. His speech was mumbled, his pupils dilated, his face flushed and his eyes bloodshot, the assessment said. The lab test results and details of Bieber's sobriety tests were released just hours after the 19-year-old singer was booked on an assault charge in Canada, accused of hitting his limousine driver in Toronto a month ago. Bieber, who will turn 20 in four weeks, apparently sought refuge Wednesday night in Stratford, the Canadian town where he grew up before becoming a pop star. His father tweeted a photo of Bieber asleep in a bed with Justin's younger half brother, Jaxon. The Twitter message posted by @JeremyBieber read: ""Safe and sound #homesweethome"" Earlier Wednesday, Bieber's lawyer entered a ""not guilty"" plea to the Florida charges of DUI, resisting arrest and driving with an expired license, according to court records. The prospect of a third criminal arrest for Bieber hangs on a decision expected as soon as next week, after detectives investigating an alleged egg attack on his California neighbor meet again with a Los Angeles prosecutor. Bieber told police in Miami Beach that he had taken ""medications for anxiety"" that night but that he did not know what it was or whether he had a prescription for it. ""Well, my mom takes care of all that stuff for me,"" the police report quoted him as saying. The preliminary toxicology report on Bieber's urine sample said it tested positive for ""metabolite of THC,"" which indicates marijuana use, and alprazolam, the generic name for the prescription sedative Xanax. At the police station, Bieber failed a series of sobriety tests, including ""horizontal gaze,"" ""Romberg balance,"" ""walk and turn,"" ""finger to nose"" and ""one-leg stand"" tests, the police report said. When Bieber was asked to estimate when 30 seconds passed, he failed by thinking a half-minute was over in 17 seconds, the report said. He had ""great difficulty"" completing the Breathalyzer test, the officer wrote. He ""continuously forgot basic instructions."" Bieber told the officer ""that he was blowing as hard as he could, and told me to look at how red his face was,"" he wrote. ""He advised he was blowing into the hose like he blows into his trumpet."" When he was finally successful, he blew .011 and .014 in two Breathalyzer tests, the report said. Florida's legal limit for drivers under the drinking age of 21 is .02. Bieber was briefly jailed in Miami Beach on January 23 after he was stopped by a police officer who said he was drag racing in a Lambourghini on a residential street. Opinion: Money and Justin Bieber's teenage brain . Toronto assault charge . Bieber arrived at a Toronto police station for booking Wednesday evening amid a chaotic scene as determined photographers, reporters, screaming fans and the curious converged around his SUV. About a dozen Toronto police officers shoved their way through the crowd to escort Bieber, getting him through the door only after a struggle. The alleged incident happened after the limo driver picked up a group of six people outside a Toronto nightclub just before 3 a.m. December 30, according to a police statement. ""While driving the group to a hotel, an altercation occurred between one of the passengers and the driver of the limousine,"" the police statement said. ""In the course of the altercation, a man struck the limousine driver on the back of the head several times. The driver stopped the limousine, exited the vehicle and called police."" The singer attended a Toronto Maple Leafs hockey game at the Air Canada Centre earlier in the evening, according to the CBC. Bieber left the Toronto police station through a rear exit after about two hours inside Wednesday night. He is set to appear in a Toronto court on March 10, police said. Bieber's Los Angeles lawyer said the charge was ""the equivalent of a misdemeanor in the United States."" ""Our position is that Mr. Bieber is innocent,"" attorney Howard Wietzman said. ""As the matter is now before the court, it would be inappropriate to address the specifics of either the allegation or of our defense at this time."" Bieber's manager, Scooter Braun, posted messages on Twitter that appear to be related to Wednesday's arrest: . ""for all those asking @JeremyBieber and @pattiemallette love their son.

The neighbor accused Bieber of tossing eggs over a fence and onto the mansion next door on January 9, causing an estimated $20,000 in damage. A dozen Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies raided Bieber's $6.5 million home in the exclusive Oaks community in Calabasas, California, two weeks ago, taking the security video system as evidence. A prosecutor reviewed the security video Monday and asked detectives to do more investigation before a decision is made about charging the pop star with felony vandalism, according to Lt. David Thompson. Detectives will probably meet again with prosecutors in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office next week, Thompson said.

"""Alaska has an epidemic,"" Gov. Sean Parnell told me. It's not bear attacks or deadly roads. It's rape and violence against women. Reported rape is more common in Alaska than any other state, according to 2012 FBI crime estimates. The per capita rate is about three times the national average. In America's ""Last Frontier"" state, nearly 80 incidences of rape are reported per 100,000 people, the data show. Nationally, the rate is 27 per 100,000. The rapist next door . I recently spent more than two weeks in Alaska reporting on the state's high rape rate. You voted for me to cover this topic as part of CNN's Change the List project. Below, I'll leave you with the full list of states. Rape is least frequent (or is least frequently reported) in New Jersey. The state with the second-highest rate of reported rape, behind Alaska, is South Dakota, with a rate of 70 per 100,000. The lawless 'end of the land' The FBI cautions against comparing crime rates across states without considering factors like demographics, climate, culture, economics and law enforcement capabilities. And rape is notoriously underreported nationwide, so take these numbers as estimates. The FBI only counts reported incidents of rape. 5 ways to help end rape in Alaska . But Alaska can't use those caveats as an excuse. A 2010 survey shows 59% of adult women in Alaska experience intimate partner violence, including threats, and/or sexual assault. And 37% suffer from rape or sexual violence. So, with that in mind, here's the list of states and Washington, D.C., starting with those where rape is least frequently reported -- and ending with Alaska.

"Denying services to same-sex couples may soon become legal in Kansas. House Bill 2453 explicitly protects religious individuals, groups and businesses that refuse services to same-sex couples, particularly  those looking to tie the knot. It passed the state's Republican-dominated House on Wednesday with a vote of 72-49, and has gone to the Senate for a vote. Such a law may seem unnecessary in a state where same-sex marriage is banned, but some Kansas lawmakers think different. They want to prevent religious individuals and organizations from getting sued, or otherwise punished, for not providing goods or services to gay couples -- or for not recognizing their marriages or committed relationship as valid. This includes employees of the state. The politics . The law claims to protect the rights of religious people, but gender rights advocates such as Equality Kansas are dismayed. ""Kansans across the state are rightly appalled that legislators are spending their efforts to pass yet another piece of legislation that seeks to enshrine discrimination against gay and lesbian people into law,"" state chairwoman Sandra Meade said. ""HB 2453 is a blatant attempt to maintain second-class citizen status for taxpaying gay and lesbian Kansans."" Despite the blowback, its chances of passing seem pretty good. Republicans dominate the state's Senate and Gov. Sam Brownback is a conservative Christian known for taking a public stand against same-sex marriage. Brownback has already praised the bill in an interview with a local newspaper. ""Americans have constitutional rights, among them the right to exercise their religious beliefs and the right for every human life to be treated with respect and dignity,"" he told The Topeka Capital-Journal. The details . HB 2453 is titled ""An act concerning religious freedoms with respect to marriage"" and covers many bases. It reads, in part: ""No individual or religious entity shall be required by any governmental entity to do any of the following, if it would be contrary to the sincerely held religious beliefs of the individual or religious entity regarding sex or gender: . ""Provide any services, accommodations, advantages, facilities, goods, or privileges; provide counseling, adoption, foster care and other social services; or provide employment or employment benefits, related to, or related to the celebration of, any marriage, domestic partnership, civil union or similar arrangement."" Anyone who turns away a gay couple not only can't face a civil suit, but if anyone tries to sue, they could get nailed with the other side's legal fees. There are some small concession in the bill to gay couples. If an employee at a nonreligious or government business refuses to serve a gay or lesbian couple for religious reasons, the manager is obligated to find another employee who will oblige. It also explicitly says that the law does not authorize discrimination against anyone, including clergy, who performs or supports same-sex unions. The trend . The Kansas bill would seem to buck the trend. Laws approving same-sex marriage have recently passed in many parts of the United States, bringing the total number of states where it is legal to 17. Add to that the District of Columbia. Worldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) also have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of the nations are in Europe and South America. Judge rules Kentucky must recognize same-sex marriages . Nevada stops defending ban against same-sex marriage .","Gay and lesbian couples in Kansas may be refused service more often .

"Fifty years ago this week, the House of Representatives passed the Civil Rights Act, which made it illegal to discriminate against individuals on the basis of race, national origin, religion or gender. We've come a long way since then, according to a report issued last week by the Council on Contemporary Families. Yet troubling inequalities persist. Gone are the days when segregationists in Congress proudly declared they would resist ""social equality"" and racial ""intermingling"" to ""the bitter end,"" and when the head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission flatly refused to enforce the act's provisions against gender discrimination. In 1964, fewer than 5% of Americans approved of interracial marriage. Today, 77% do, according to a Gallup poll. In 1970, a majority of Americans still opposed efforts to end gender inequality. By 2010, 97% of Americans supported equal rights for women, according to the Pew Research Center. The number of elected black officials in the country has soared, growing from 103 in 1964  to more than 10,000 today.  Since 1990, there have been two African-American secretaries of state, and an African-American president is now in his second term. Before passage of the Civil Rights Act, fewer than 3% of all lawyers and fewer than 1% of all federal judges were female. Today, women account for almost one-third of attorneys and three of the nine Supreme Court justices. Fifty years ago, women working full-time earned just 59 cents for every dollar their male counterparts made. Today, women workers, as a group, earn 77% of what men earn, as a group. Women run 23 of the Fortune 500 companies, and a woman heads the most powerful financial institution in the country, the Federal Reserve Bank. Despite these huge improvements, the historical legacy of racial and gender discrimination has not gone away. Although one in 10 black households now earns more than $100,000 a year, the median net worth of black households is 14 times lower than that of white households. The black unemployment rate remains twice that of whites. Black poverty rates are almost three times as high. These ratios have hardly budged over the past 50 years. Ta-Nehisi Coates, a writer for The Atlantic, recently called attention to a disturbing graph showing that  almost one-third of African-Americans born between 1985 and 2000 live in neighborhoods where 30% of the residents are poor, compared with  only 1% of whites. Living in areas of such concentrated poverty multiplies the barriers to getting a decent education or job. And after declining in the 1970s, racial segregation in schools has increased again over the past 30 years, especially in districts that were released from court-ordered desegregation plans. This trend underscores the need for continuing federal oversight and enforcement of equal rights laws. Women also face ongoing barriers to reaching full equality. Despite the high-profile positions of female executives such as Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and Yahoo's Melissa Mayer, working-class jobs are as gender-segregated today as they were in 1964. Most women continue to work in traditionally female occupations, which typically pay less than traditionally male jobs requiring comparable skills.  Sixty-two percent of minimum-wage workers -- and the majority of poor Americans -- are female. In the decades since the Civil Rights Act outlawed barefaced discrimination on the basis of race and gender, many particularly talented or fortunate women, blacks, and Hispanics have acquired a degree of wealth, power and social admiration that would have been unimaginable in 1964. But the majority are still handicapped by their historic disadvantages, as well as by racial and gender prejudices that controlled experiments reveal to be stubbornly persistent. Such prejudices are especially virulent when they interact with the growing income polarization occurring in America today. Commentators continue to blame poverty on the irresponsibility of single mothers and to impugn the sexual mores of women who want insurance coverage for birth control. According to an experiment published in American Sociological Review, white applicants in low-income communities are twice as likely to get a job offer as equally qualified blacks. White applicants just out of prison have as good a chance of being hired as black or Latino applicants with no criminal record! The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once imagined a world where ""the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood."" Had he given the speech a few years later, he would certainly have added daughters to the mix. But as author Ellis Cose has observed, it would be a tragedy if we arrived at that point only to discover that while the wealthiest black, Latino, Asian and white men and women are welcome at the head table, the poor of all races are relegated to eating leftovers in the kitchen. The recent recession has demoted many Americans of all races to the poverty table. Yet blacks, Latinos and women remain over-represented in that group. The civil rights challenge for the next 50 years will be to find ways to work simultaneously for socioeconomic justice along with racial and gender equity.","Stephanie Coontz: 50 years ago, the House passed Civil Rights Act, making discrimination illegal .
Women, blacks, other minorities have gained since then, but still suffer from inequality, she says .

"In a split second and without warning, the plane began shaking violently in the sky. Passengers panicked and screamed. One woman called out for her baby. Another, they said, hit the ceiling so hard that she cracked the panel above her head. United Airlines Flight 1676, carrying 114 passengers and five crew members, was headed from Denver to Billings, Montana. Just as it was about to land, turbulence struck. The plane started convulsing. ""There was a lot of screaming, a lot of hollering,"" Bill Dahlin told CNN affiliate KTVQ. Three crew members and two passengers were taken to local hospitals. All were treated and released except one flight attendant, the airline said. Dahlin said the turbulence apparently took the flight crew by surprise. ""I think they were trying to assess things themselves, so they really didn't offer any explanation because of what happened so quickly,"" he told KTVQ. Another passenger, Laurel Linde, told CNN the sudden turbulence felt like a fall. ""It almost felt like an impact from below the plane. It was so sharp, and then things and people were flying everywhere,"" she said. Some folks weren't strapped into their seats, like a man sitting just a row or two in front of Linde. ""He flew up out of his seat, hit the roof of the plane and ended up on the other side of the aisle on top of a woman on that side,"" she said.

"Egypt will elect a president before voting on a parliament, interim President Adly Mansour said Sunday, amending a road map laid down last summer. Parliamentary elections were supposed to be held first under a timetable agreed to after Egypt's army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July following mass protests against his rule. Voters in the Arab world's most populous nation this month overwhelmingly approved a new constitution with 98.1% in favor, the Electoral Commission said. ""I had previously held a series of sessions for dialogue with some of the major political stakeholders and representatives of the different political groups which indicated a majority in favor of holding presidential elections first,"" Mansour said in a televised address. ""In this light, I have taken the decision to amend the road map for the future, so that presidential elections are held first, and are followed by parliamentary elections."" Mansour did not give dates for the elections. Egypt's army chief Gen. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has said he would run for president if the Egyptian people wanted him to, state media reported recently. The country has seen months of political turmoil since its first democratically elected president, Morsy of the Muslim Brotherhood, was deposed by the military and an interim, military-backed government was installed in his place. Supporters of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood boycotted the constitution referendum in response to a continuing government crackdown. Deadly blasts in Cairo condemned . Mansour also condemned last week's ""terrorist attacks"" -- deadly blasts that rocked the capital, Cairo. ""We are adamant -- state and people -- to eradicate terrorism and implement the 'road map for the future,'"" he said. A terrorist group claimed responsibility Saturday for four blasts that killed at least six people in and around the city on Friday. The organization Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, said in a statement that it was targeting Cairo's security headquarters and security forces. In a statement posted on several al Qaeda-linked websites, the same group claimed responsibility for shooting down a military helicopter in Egypt's Sinai peninsula Saturday. Egypt's military said five crew members were killed when a military helicopter crashed in the Sinai during operations targeting militants, but did not comment on what caused the crash. At least 49 dead as throngs commemorate revolution . At least 49 people were killed and 247 wounded in violence Saturday marking the third anniversary of the January 25 revolution that brought down longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak, Egyptian state media said. Dozens more people were wounded in clashes throughout the country on Saturday between anti-government protesters and security forces. The casualty figures came from the Ministry of Health, state media said. Activists behind bars on uprising's anniversary . Sinai attack kills 3 soldiers . On Sunday, three Egyptian soldiers were killed and 11 others wounded when unknown armed men attacked their bus in the Sinai, a military official told Egyptian state news agency MENA. Since Morsy's ouster, Egypt's political scene has become extremely polarized between the former president's Islamist supporters and those who back the military. Morsy's supporters have held held near-daily protests since his ouster, demanding he be reinstated. The protests have often devolved into violence. Mansour also said he appealed to prosecutors to review the cases of detainees held without charges from protests, including university students, to ensure that those held for no reason are released.

"Former NFL star Darren Sharper was charged in California on Friday in the alleged drugging and rape of two women, one in October and the other last month, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said. The five-time Pro Bowl player who became an NFL Network analyst is charged with two counts of rape by use of drugs, four counts of furnishing a controlled substance and one count of possession of a controlled substance, all felonies, the prosecutor's office said. Sharper, 38, who played defensive back for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints during his 14-year career, appeared Friday in a Los Angeles County court, but his arraignment was postponed until Thursday, said spokesman Ricardo Santiago of the district attorney's office. Sharper was arrested January 17 and released on $200,000 bail, but prosecutors will seek next Thursday to raise his bail to $10 million, Santiago said. The alleged controlled substances were morphine and zolpidem, another name for the prescription sleep aid Ambien. On October 30, Sharper met two women at a West Hollywood nightclub -- Bootsy Bellows on the Sunset Strip -- and invited them to a party, authorities allege. Sharper, who lives in Miami Beach, Florida, allegedly told them he had to stop by his Los Angeles hotel room to pick up something, and he invited them to the room. While there, he allegedly gave each woman a drink in the form of shot, and the women then passed out, prosecutors said. The first woman woke up naked hours later as Sharper allegedly was sexually assaulting her, prosecutors said. The other woman awakened and ""interrupted his actions,"" according to court papers cited by prosecutors. The two women gathered their belongings and left the hotel, authorities said. On January 14, Sharper met two women at the same West Hollywood nightclub and also invited them to a party, prosecutors said. A similar series of events allegedly unfolded: Sharper made a stop by his hotel room, invited the women in and allegedly offer them a shot, which caused them to pass out, prosecutors said. When they woke up hours later on January 15, one woman believed she was sexually assaulted, and both women left the hotel and sought medical treatment, prosecutors said. If convicted of the Los Angeles County charges, Sharper would face more than 30 years in state prison, prosecutors said. A Los Angeles attorney representing Sharper told CNN on Friday that she was looking forward to ""the true facts in this matter being revealed. ""And we are very hopeful that at the end of day that Mr. Sharper will be fully exonerated,"" added attorney Blair Berk. Los Angeles County prosecutors allege in court papers that Sharper also is suspected of rape in Tempe, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; and New Orleans, Louisiana. ""I believe that the defendant is involved in seven acts of rape and eleven acts of furnishing a controlled substance"" in those three communities and the Los Angeles area between last September and January, Los Angeles police investigator John Macchiarella stated in papers requesting an increase in Sharper's bail to $10 million. In Nevada, Sharper is a suspect in an ongoing rape investigation, Las Vegas police Officer Jose Hernandez told CNN. ""We do have an active and ongoing investigation and at the conclusion of this investigation, it will be submitted to the DA's office for consideration of charges,"" Hernandez said. He didn't elaborate. Macchiarella said in court papers that Sharper allegedly invited to his Las Vegas hotel room two women and a man he met in a Las Vegas nightclub. The three guests ""blacked out"" after Sharper allegedly served them shots, Macchiarella wrote. One woman claimed she found injuries to her face when she woke up and alleged Sharper served her another unknown beverage and ""the next thing she remembered was defendant Sharper sexually assaulting her,"" Macchiarella stated in court papers. The other woman awoke and believed she had been sexually assaulted, wrote Macchiarella, who reviewed the Nevada police reports. The man awoke sitting alone at the bar inside of the hotel, without any memory of how he arrived there, Macchiarella said in the papers. New Orleans police are also investigating Sharper after a 25-year-old woman accused him of sexual assault in September, New Orleans police spokeswoman Cherie Guggenheim confirmed to CNN. The woman told police she consumed a large amount of alcohol last September 23 and met Sharper at one of the bars she visited, a police report said. Sharper allegedly took the victim to his apartment and raped her, according to the police report and to Guggenheim. The woman told police she didn't consent to any sexual encounter. Sharper hasn't been charged and the investigation is ongoing, according to the report and to Guggenheim. In Arizona, Sharper accompanied two women to a nightclub in Scottsdale and then joined them at the apartment of one of the women, according to the police report from the incident. While in the apartment, Sharper allegedly served one woman a shot and she then blacked out, wrote Macchiarella, who reviewed police reports from Arizona. During the time Sharper and the women were in the apartment, a female roommate who shared the apartment joined the group. Sharper also allegedly served the roommate a drink in the form of a shot, and as the roommate became disoriented and went to the bathroom, she allegedly saw Sharper on top of one of the other women with his buttocks exposed, Macchiarella said. The two women who had accompanied Sharper to the apartment later underwent sexual assault exams, Macchiarella wrote. A crime lab test later found zolpidem in the cup that Sharper allegedly used as he served shots, Macchiarella said. After Sharper was arrested in Los Angeles last month, the NFL Network suspended him without pay, a spokesman said. Sharper's pro football career began as a second-round draft choice by the Green Bay Packers in 1997. After eight seasons with the Packers, including a loss to Denver in Super Bowl XXXII, he moved to the Minnesota Vikings for four years. He signed as a free agent with the New Orleans Saints in 2009, which led to a Super Bowl ring that first season. Injuries hampered his second year with the Saints, which led to his retirement in 2011. The Los Angeles arrest report states Sharper is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 210 pounds.","Sharper is also under probe in 5 alleged rapes in 3 other states, LA police say .

"Iran is rolling back parts of its nuclear program and getting relief from sanctions in return as an interim agreement aimed at gauging Tehran's willingness to curb its nuclear ambitions appears to be working with global powers gearing up for talks on Tuesday to forge a long-term pact. ""So far everyone, both Iran and all of the rest of us who provided some very limited, targeted sanctions relief have kept their commitments,"" Wendy Sherman, a senior State Department official and lead negotiator for the United States on the Iran deal, told Wolf Blitzer on Monday in an interview on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" Sherman, the under secretary for political affairs, spoke from Vienna where talks on a comprehensive accord between Iran, the United States, Germany and other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are due to begin on Tuesday. The six-month deal was reached in November and took effect in January. The Vienna talks ""will build on that first step, because we don't want it to be the only step,"" Sherman said. ""We go into this negotiation very clear eyed, very sober,"" she said. ""It's going to be very tough."" Her comments came as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, said his country would not ""renege"" on the talks, but predicted they ""will not lead anywhere."" ""What I care about is what Iran does much more than what Iran says,"" Sherman said. She added that any final deal will be contingent on Iran taking ""concrete"" verifiable steps that prevent it from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon. The United States and its allies believe Iran is aiming to develop a nuclear weapon, while Tehran has said it's atomic efforts are peaceful. Sherman said she had seen recent Iranian reports that Russia has offered to build a nuclear reactor inside Iran in exchange for oil shipments, but did not offer a comment on whether or not that was a good idea. Iran touts launch of new missiles; U.S. says it's watching closely . North Korea camps . Sherman, who served as a top official on North Korea during the Clinton administration, also spoke of the ""horror"" of Pyongyang's labor and prison camp system on the same day the United Nations released a report about the secretive country's dismal record on human rights. ""We know a whole generation of children is growing up (in North Korea) with stunted growth and stunted intellect,"" Sherman said with many of its people subsisting on twigs and plants due to a chronic food shortage. ""As I have always said North Korea is not a place any of us would want to live in, and I give the United Nations credit for highlighting the horrible human rights abuses that are going on in North Korea."" Sherman added the United States is involved in ""constant efforts"" to free Kenneth Bae, an American currently being held in North Korea who was said to have recently been moved to a labor camp.

"A pharmacy tech who makes $12 an hour but drives a Mercedes. A rumor that a pharmacist may be trading sex for drugs. A prescription note with handwriting that's a little too easy to read. The Drug Enforcement Administration in Atlanta says all of these scenarios should leave pharmacy workers suspicious of illegal activity at their store. And they hope pharmacy employees -- or anyone, for that matter -- will report such activity to its new prescription drug abuse tip line. The agency launched an initiative, TIP411, this week to allow the public to quickly and anonymously report suspicious activity. Tipsters can text TIP411, or 847-411, and then use the keyword PILLTIP. The message will be forwarded to a DEA agent who will investigate. Georgia is one of the first states in the country to try the texting effort. The city of Philadelphia is also experimenting with the program. Agents hope it will become a successful weapon to fight the war on prescription drug abuse, a war they feel they are losing. ""It really is out of control here,"" said Rick Allen, director of the Georgia Drug and Narcotics Agency. Prescription drug abuse is a national epidemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Overdose rates in the United States have more than tripled since 1990, and prescription drugs are to blame for a number of those deaths. The rise in overdoses parallels a 300% increase in the sale of strong opioid painkillers since 1999. In 2008, prescription pain pills actually killed more people than all those who died from taking cocaine or heroin. The pain pills, unlike cocaine or heroin, are often bought legally -- at least at first. Very few come from someone robbing a pharmacy. Most abusers get the pills from a friend or family member who had the initial prescription. Only 2.3% say they bought them from a drug dealer or stranger, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which used 2010 data. ""The illegal prescription drug market and relative ease of which pharmaceutical substances can be obtained has resulted in a sharp increase in prescription drug abuse,"" said Harry Sommers, special agent in charge of the DEA's Atlanta division. The issue can become an even bigger problem when the friend or family member runs out of the pills, according to Sommers.  Then, often, people will either forge prescriptions from doctors or -- if they can't get access to legal drugs -- turn to another opioid like heroin, which is sometimes even easier to get. With the announcement of the tip line, the DEA said it is sending education materials to 1,200 pharmacies in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The packet includes tip line information and a guide that points out suspicious signs to monitor. The guide, a pamphlet, suggests that people get these drugs illegally by stealing doctors' prescription pads or altering a legitimate prescription with a different callback number that can ring to an accomplice that would verify the prescription. Other tricks include people calling the pharmacy masquerading as doctors. The pamphlet warns pharmacists to watch for customers who come back a little too regularly or people who come in with a prescription for a stimulant and a depressant at the same time. Often, abusers will seek both ""uppers"" and ""downers"" when they are addicted to prescription painkillers. A prescription with all the words spelled out or with perfect handwriting is also suspicious, according to the DEA. Most doctors are in such a hurry, they will use abbreviations, and doctors are not typically known for neat handwriting. The CDC suggests that pharmacists talk with patients about safely using, storing and disposing of prescription painkillers. It also recommends that health professionals consult their state's prescription drug monitoring programs. Sommers said he doesn't think his agency will get a ton of tips through the new tip line, but he believes the tips it does get will yield good results.","DEA creates a tip line to fight prescription drug abuse .

"A restaurant manager died and one of his employees remained hospitalized after inhaling carbon monoxide at a Long Island mall, authorities said Sunday. Another 26 people were treated and released after the incident, according to hospitals. Police and emergency crews rushed to Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York, on Saturday night after reports that a woman had collapsed in the basement of Legal Sea Foods. Once they arrived, they felt dizzy as well and determined that the cause was carbon monoxide poisoning, said police in Suffolk County, New York. ""Police evacuated the restaurant and found the manager, Steven Nelson, 55, of Copiague, unconscious in the basement,"" a statement said. ""He was transported to Huntington Hospital where he was pronounced dead."" A sign on the restaurant's door Sunday said the building has been condemned as being unsafe and unfit for human habitation. Investigators found a leak in the flue pipe of the water heater, said A.J. Carter, a spokesman for the town of Huntington. Authorities sent the restaurant a summons for faulty equipment, which carries a fine of up to $2,000, Carter said. Colorless, odorless carbon monoxide is produced by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas. The restaurant didn't have a carbon monoxide detector. State fire codes require them only in establishments where people sleep, Carter said. Legal Sea Foods is subject to annual inspection, and there were no issues when a town official inspected the restaurant in March. The restaurant was scheduled for another inspection at the end of next month. The restaurant and surrounding businesses were evacuated as a precaution Saturday, but authorities said the carbon monoxide appeared limited to the basement of the restaurant. National Grid, the restaurant's natural gas provider, shut off a gas line shared by Panera Bread and Legal Sea Foods as a precaution, Carter said. Before either restaurant can reopen, he said, they'll have to get plumbers to check for leaks and receive certification from the town's plumbing inspector. Boston-based Legal Sea Foods offered its condolences to Nelson's family and said it planned to check safety at all of its restaurants as a result of the incident. ""The terrible tragedy highlights the inadequacy of the codes for carbon monoxide detectors in commercial spaces. In the wake of Saturday night's tragic events, I have instructed our operations team to conduct an exhaustive safety check at all our restaurants. This includes not only ensuring that we meet local codes as we did in Huntington, but putting a plan in place to exceed them in order to safeguard everyone,"" Legal Sea Foods CEO Roger Berkowitz said in a written statement. ""Stronger safety measures must be put in place, and I pledge to be at the forefront of this effort."" Grief counselors will be meeting with the restaurant's associates, and their family and friends, Berkowitz said. ""Steve's tragic death is a shock to all of us at Legal Sea Foods,"" he said. ""He was one of the finest people we've ever had the pleasure of working with.""","Legal Sea Foods CEO: ""Stronger safety measures must be put in place""

"Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was acquitted in New York on Friday of charges of driving under the influence of a drug. A jury deliberated for an hour and 10 minutes following a four-day trial that featured Kennedy's turn on the witness stand. After jurors left the courtroom, Kennedy friends and family members, including her 85-year-old mother, Ethel Kennedy, applauded. Kennedy hugged lawyers, William Aronwald and Gerald Lefcourt, and, in an unusual move, shook the hands of the prosecutors. As people filed out of courtroom, Kennedy told reporters she was not angry with the prosecutors who brought the case. The 54-year-old former wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced a charge of driving while impaired after swerving off the road in her Lexus SUV and careening into a tractor-trailer on a New York interstate in morning rush-hour traffic in July 2012. Outside court, Kennedy said she was ""unbelievably grateful."" Lefcourt suggested that the prosecution pursued the case because of her name. ""You've got to wonder why an ill-advised prosecution like this was brought,"" the attorney said. ""Is it because of who the defendant is?  They concede that it was an accident and nevertheless they brought this case. I find this very depressing."" In a statement Friday, the Westchester County District Attorney's office said: ""We prosecute 2,500 impaired driving cases annually in Westchester County. This case was treated no differently from any of the others. The jury heard all the evidence in this case and we respect their verdict."" Kennedy testified this week that she grabbed the wrong prescription bottle from her kitchen counter that morning and swallowed 10 milligrams of zolpidem, a sleep aid also known by the brand name Ambien. Neither she nor prosecutors disputed the fact that she drove erratically after taking the medication and sideswiped a tractor-trailer in Westchester County before she was found, slumped over her steering wheel, her car stalled. ""I now know thanks to the tox lab that I must have taken the sleeping medication by mistake,"" said Kennedy, looking at the jury as she testified. Kennedy said she made cappuccino, had some carrots, prepared bags for the gym and office and had no problem leaving her apartment and getting to her vehicle the morning of the accident. Her memory from that morning ends just before she entered the highway, Kennedy said. The next thing she recalls is a knock on the window of her SUV, and a man she thought was a police officer asking if she was OK. ""I was confused by that because I thought I was fine,"" she said on the stand. During a contentious cross examination, Kennedy insisted that she would not have stayed behind the wheel if she'd felt the effects of the medication. ""If I'd realized I was impaired, I would have pulled over,"" she told prosecutor Doreen Lloyd, and also said she doesn't know what the side effects of zolpidem might feel like. ""You've taken this pill for 10 years and you can't tell me whether or not it makes you feel tired after you take it?"" Lloyd asked. ""I guess I don't really think about how I'm feeling when I take it,"" Kennedy replied. ""I take it, and then I'm asleep."" In closing arguments, the prosecution accused Kennedy of lying to police and the public to protect her legacy. ""She had a lot on her mind that morning. And she took the wrong pill by mistake,"" prosecutor Doreen Lloyd told jurors. ""However, it also makes no sense whatsoever that at no point did she realize or feel tired or dizzy or drowsy. That makes no sense,"" she said. ""She is responsible for the chain of events that happened after that."" Lloyd told jurors that Kennedy had a responsibility to pull off the road safely when she felt the effect of the drug. Her inconsistent statements about the incident, including the claim that her doctors said she'd had a seizure, were meant as a smokescreen, Lloyd said. ""She knew. She knew right away that she had taken the wrong pill. She felt it. And I submit she was looking for an excuse, to avoid responsibility ... to control her public image."" Lefcourt told jurors there's no disputing that Kennedy ingested zolpidem and was ""out of it"" the morning of the crash. ""The dispute is this: Whether the prosecution has proved to you beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Kennedy operated her vehicle while she was aware that she had ingested zolpidem and, after becoming aware, she continued intentionally to drive. That's what this case is all about."" The jury of two women and four men began its deliberations Thursday afternoon. They stopped for the day without reaching a verdict before resuming deliberations Friday morning. Kennedy faced up to a year in jail if convicted.","Defense attorney suggests prosecution pursued case because of Kennedy name .

"The U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday that it will not pursue federal criminal civil rights charges against Michigan police officers who shot and killed a knife-wielding homeless man in July 2012. Authorities said there was insufficient ""evidence of willful misconduct"" to warrant a federal criminal prosecution of the Saginaw Police Department officers who fired 46 bullets at Milton Hall, 49, during an argument. Hall was hit 11 times. The incident occurred July 1, 2012, in a parking lot next to a shuttered Chinese restaurant, in full view of passing motorists. A video of the incident was obtained exclusively by CNN weeks later. The Saginaw County prosecutor and the Michigan attorney general had declined to prosecute the officers. ""After a careful review of all of the evidence, experienced prosecutors from the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan have determined that the evidence in this case is insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the SPD officers willfully shot Hall for an unlawful purpose, rather than for their stated purpose of preventing Hall from harming SPD staff,"" the Justice Department said in a statement. The statement continued: ""Even if the officers were mistaken in their assessment of the threat posed by Hall, this would not establish that the officers acted willfully, or with an unlawful intent, when using deadly force against Hall."" Hall's family said he had a history of mental illness. At the time of the shooting, then-Saginaw Police Chief Gerald Cliff said Hall was ""known to be an assaultive person"" with ""a long history"" of contacts with law enforcement, ""not only with police from our department, but with the county."" In the video purchased by CNN, shot by a motorist from across the street, Hall was seen arguing with a half dozen officers. For more than three minutes he walks back and forth, and at one time appears to crouch in a ""karate stance,"" according to the man who captured the scene. Police said Hall had just had a run-in with a convenience store clerk. On the video, he tells police, ""My name is Milton Hall, I just called 911. My name is Milton, and I'm p---ed off."" When an officer tells him to put the knife down, he responds, ""I ain't putting s--t down."" He appears unimpressed by a police dog, telling officers, ""Let him go. Let the motherf---ing dog go."" Finally, Hall turns to the left of the frame, where another officer had moved out of view a short time earlier. That's when the police open fire with a reported 46 shots in a five-second hail of bullets. The on-site police supervisor was demoted to patrolman, police said afterward. Two others were disciplined for violating department policies in connection with the shooting. Three of their five dash-cam video cameras were not working properly. In a statement, Jewel Hall, Milton's mother, said she was not surprised by Tuesday's development. ""However, that decision does not negate the civil litigation that we can  pursue and the standards in that matter are less stringent and we believe justice will prevail."" The family filed a wrongful death lawsuit last year against the police department and the officers involved in the shooting after conducting its own investigation and consulting two nationally known experts in police practices, lawyers for the family said.","Mother of Milton Hall releases statement .

"The U.S. government's long-stated position is that it won't negotiate with terrorists. But are there exceptions? U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, an American prisoner of war, is believed to be held in Pakistan by the Haqqani group. The Haqqani group is part of the larger Taliban network and has engaged in a range of attacks on civilian targets in Afghanistan, such as the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Earlier this month, the U.S. Treasury Department named three of the Haqqani group's leaders as ""Specially Designated Global Terrorists,"" and noted that the organization ""poses a grave threat to U.S. civilians, military personnel, and our broader interests in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region."" Two years ago, the U.S. State Department also formally listed the Haqqani network as a foreign terrorist organization. Yet on Monday, The Washington Post quoted U.S. officials who said the government was going to resume talks with the Afghan Taliban and offer to trade five Taliban prisoners held at the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay for Bergdahl, who has been held since 2009. Does that mean the United States is negotiating with a terrorist group? In fact, the Haqqanis are part of the larger Afghan Taliban network, but the Afghan Taliban itself is not listed by the U.S. State Department as a foreign terrorist organization, which enables the United States to have direct talks with the Afghan Taliban, which it has been doing for years secretly, according to multiple U.S. officials familiar with the talks. This means that discussions about the release of Bergdahl with the Afghan Taliban are not directly with a terrorist organization per se, but instead with an insurgent group that has a terrorist wing. For some this may seem to be a distinction without a difference, but as a matter of U.S. policy this is a very important distinction. Consider the case of another American who is held hostage in Pakistan, Warren Weinstein, a contractor for the U.S. Agency of International Development who was kidnapped by al Qaeda in Lahore, Pakistan, more than two years ago. In December, a proof-of-life video was released to international media outlets, in which Weinstein called on President Obama to negotiate for his release. As with Bergdahl, the release of Guantanamo detainees was among his captors' conditions. U.S. officials have called for Weinstein's release. But the United States has never negotiated with al Qaeda  and would not want to encourage the group to kidnap other Americans living in Pakistan, so it seems out of the question that U.S. officials would negotiate with al Qaeda for Weinstein's release. That said, U.S. officials will certainly be working behind the scenes to put pressure on the Pakistan government to try to secure Weinstein's release. The fact that Bergdahl is being held by the Haqqanis does raise another issue, however, which is: Even if you get a deal with the Afghan Taliban for Bergdahl's release, would the Haqqani network, which operates quite independently from the Afghan Taliban, go along with it? The consensus among Taliban experts is, likely, yes. Anand Gopal, a fellow at the New America Foundation who has interviewed multiple members of the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network, says the Haqqanis would honor such a deal because ""they take great pains to present themselves as part of the mainstream Taliban movement -- even if in practice they are independent -- and not going along would be an affront to the Taliban, possibly damaging relations."" According to the Washington Post report, the U.S. government has not yet made a formal offer for Bergdahl, who has spent almost five years in captivity. But the political situation around Bergdahl's release may be shifting slightly in favor of a resolution. In 2103, the Obama administration quietly released 11 prisoners from Guantanamo and it didn't generate much criticism from opponents of the administration. Two months ago, Congress also eased up on some of the restrictions that had previously prevented prisoners being released from Guantanamo. Also,  U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan are pulling out at the end of December, which is, of course, a key Taliban demand. This means, as both a practical and legal matter, that the United States will then no longer be at war in Afghanistan, although there will likely be some residual force of U.S. soldiers in an advisory role post-2014. When wars are over, the warring parties traditionally exchange their prisoners of war. With all U.S. combat soldiers returning home from Afghanistan during the course of this year, it is high time for Bergdahl to be one of them.","Peter Bergen: The U.S. won't negotiate with terrorists, but will it make an exception?

"A public fight this week between the CIA and the Democratic head of the Senate Intelligence Committee is the latest act in a years-long drama over waterboarding. It involves substantive issues such as CIA spying on Congress and the power of the legislative branch to oversee the executive branch. At the core, the matter focuses on how much history to reveal about the way America detained and interrogated terror suspects in response to the 9/11 al Qaeda attacks. Here are answers to some of the basic questions about the dispute: . 1)What is all the yelling about? More than five years after President Barack Obama ended the controversial interrogation program started during the George W. Bush administration, security chiefs and politicians are still battling over how much official information should be made public. A 6,300-page report on the program by the Senate Intelligence Committee remains classified amid discussions between Congress and the spy agency on what to reveal. When researching the report, committee staffers got hold of a separate, internal CIA review of the information made available to Senate investigators. Alarmed by outside access to the secret document, the CIA then searched computers used by committee staffers and then sought a Justice Department investigation. On Tuesday, Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein of California publicly accused the CIA of effectively spying on the committee and raised the possibility that the agency impeded the probe and perhaps broke laws in the process. CIA Director John Brennan responded with a flat-out denial of any wrongdoing. 2)What's really going on? This is Washington, so there must be a political angle, though other considerations also come into play. For example, participants in the detention/interrogation program could face lawsuits at home and abroad over their role in torture such as waterboarding. Some cases are pending and rights groups continue to press for more information for possible further challenges by current and former detainees. In comments Tuesday to the Council on Foreign Relations, Brennan cited the importance of getting the report right, saying Americans ""owe it to the women and men who faithfully did their duty in executing this program to try to make sure that any historical record of it is a balanced and accurate one."" ""I will protect sources and methods, you know, in terms of the tremendous investment that this country has made in some of, you know, the very sensitive collection systems that help to keep this country safe,"" he said. The purely political explanation has Democrats seeking full exposure of the Republican roots of the detention and interrogation program described by Feinstein as ""un-American"" and ""brutal."" She described how the committee's investigation that started in full force in 2009 followed revelations that ""the interrogations and the conditions of confinement at the CIA detentions sites were far different and far more harsh than the way the CIA had described them to us."" 3)Who spied on who? Spies spy, especially when they think they're being spied on. Brennan informed Feinstein in January the CIA had looked at the computers used by Intelligence Committee staff to figure out how they got hold of the internal review ordered by former CIA Director Leon Panetta. ""The CIA's search may well have violated the separation of powers principle embodied in the United States Constitution, including the speech and debate clause,"" Feinstein said Tuesday. ""It may have undermined the constitutional framework essential to effective congressional oversight of intelligence activities or any other government function."" However, the CIA has asked the Justice Department to look into whether committee staffers did anything wrong in accessing the so-called Panetta review, which was supposed to be an internal deliberative document and therefore unavailable. Feinstein insisted her committee workers simply used the access provided them by the CIA, and she called the agency's tactics and response an attempt at intimidation. ""I have asked for an apology and a recognition that this CIA search of computers used by its oversight committee was inappropriate,"" she said. ""I have received neither."" 4)What happens now? More accusations, counter-claims and political wrangling as both sides seek some kind of agreement on what parts of the committee's report can be made public. While legal ramifications including criminal charges are possible, the back-and-forth so far appears to be more about pressure tactics and brinksmanship. Republicans have kept mostly silent about the dispute, though Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN that any wrongdoing should be punished if proven. Brennan said he's awaiting a request from Congress to declassify portions of the committee report. Asked about the issue on Wednesday, Obama told reporters that he's ""committed to declassifying"" the information once the report is completed. However, Obama said he would not weigh in on the explosive accusation that the CIA overreached and spied on the Senate. House intel chair warns of penalty if CIA searched Senate computers .","Sen.

"As Russia continues its military occupation of the Crimean district of Ukraine, as Putin enunciates a doctrine of military intervention in support of ethnic brethren, and the West ponders what might be done, Europeans begin to think again about the 1930s and the origins of World War II. The Russian historian Andrei Zubov, for example, has published a sophisticated comparison between Putin's seizure of Crimea and Adolf Hitler's annexation of Austria, seeing both as the beginning of a chain of events with fatal consequences not just for the subjects of the aggression but for the aggressors themselves. In Vienna, where I live, one also hears constant mentions of 1938. Austrians and other citizens of European Union countries are beginning to consider what the end of Ukraine might mean for their own European system. The point is not that Putin is like Hitler; the point is that the removal of a state from Europe has consequences for the continent. When we consider any state in isolation from the system, it can seem fragile, new, perhaps unnecessary. Ukraine today, like Austria in the 1930s, is a creation of a dramatic change in the world order. Austria as an independent republic owed its existence to World War I, just as Ukraine as an independent republic owes its existence to the unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union. Independent Austria lasted for two decades; independent Ukraine has existed for only slightly longer. For some, an artificial creation that had no right to exist; for others home to a people indistinguishable from Germans, Austria had few friends in 1938. Ukraine finds itself in much the same position today. Just as most European leaders were happy to accept the German idea that Austria had no right to exist, many people around the West seem ready to forget about Ukraine or to believe the Kremlin's propaganda that half of the country is Russian. Ukraine towns: Apricot trees and vanished graves . Yet the reasons why states are supposed to exist are general, transcending their particular histories. The principles of international law are not subject to particular claims about identities. As with Putin today in Ukraine, Hitler in 1938 in Austria based his claim on the need to protect fellow ethnics. It is easy to criticize Putin's arguments in some important details. He claims to be defending Russian citizens. But since dual citizenship in Ukraine is illegal, the most visible of Russian citizens in Ukraine are (1) the Russian soldiers and sailors based in Sevastopol, (2) the Russian soldiers who have just invaded southern Ukraine and (3) Ukrainian riot police who are being given Russian citizenship at the Russian consulate in Simferopol to reward them for beating Ukrainian protesters. Putin claims to be defending ""compatriots,"" but that is a category that has no meaning. The suggestion is that anyone who speaks Russian needs a Russian invasion; that would mean that since I am writing in English I need an English invasion. But the real problem goes much deeper. In both cases the claim of a right of protection of ethnic brethren was only one element of a larger worldview. Hitler in fact cared little for ethnic Germans in Austria or for Austria itself. Its destruction of Austria was meant to show, as it did, that all standards of the European system were subject to corruption if a single man took a single risk. What Europeans decide to see in the Ukrainian revolution might in the end define Europe. The interwar European system was based on the principle of state sovereignty. No doubt this was an imperfect and incomplete moral and legal basis for international relations. And yet its violation meant the end of the system itself. When Europe's leaders abandoned Austria in 1938, they were conceding to Hitler the right to define the new rules of the new order. The immediate consequences were clear enough. Without the protection of a state, Austria's Jewish minority was subject to anti-Semitic violence. Once Austria had been abandoned, European leaders had little trouble betraying a country that truly deserved their support, democratic Czechoslovakia. Its dismemberment began later that same year. Once Europeans had the experience of allowing states to die they could do so again. By the time the great powers came to their senses in 1939 it was too late. The European system of today is based on the principle of state sovereignty, combined with the robust international cooperation of the European Union, and legitimated by a historically new attention to human rights. The European Union is based on the premise of learning from history. National Socialism and Stalinism are seen as experiences from which Europeans have learned and extremes to which European politics must be restrained. This system, like the interwar system, is vulnerable to challenge. Russia has now proposed an alternative, in which Russian culture is historically unique and demanding of protection, European fascism and Stalinism are a trove of constructive ideas, and human rights are nothing more than a facade for western imperialism. Russian propaganda assigns a particular importance to sexual minorities, with many prominent commentators claiming for example that many in the EU are part of an international gay conspiracy. The Russian invasion of southern Ukraine is a threat above all to the citizens of Ukraine. As Professor Zubov has argued, it has threatening implications also for Russians. This was a courageous argument for him to make -- he says he was immediately fired from his position. Europeans who face fewer risks can continue the argument. The seizure of Crimea was meant as a challenge to the European Union. It is meant to prove that European values cannot defend themselves. Can they?","Ukraine crisis is making Europeans think again about '30s and origins of World War II, says Timothy Snyder .

"Seven years ago Sunday, American Bob Levinson disappeared after traveling to Iran. He's now one of the longest-held American citizens in history. Recently, the 65-year-old's family has said publicly that he worked for the CIA. Their decision to speak out came after news stories published in 2013 said Levinson worked for the spy agency. For years the family kept it quiet that Levinson was working for the CIA, because the United States government had warned them that revealing it would put Levinson in more jeopardy, they said. On Saturday, Levinson's son Dan Levinson talked in person with CNN in Abu Dhabi. ""I am here in Abu Dhabi. Without getting in specifics, I think the important thing is to show that we are not giving up,"" he said. He told CNN he was back in the region doing all he could to find his father. He stressed that the family wants his father to remain part of ongoing discussions between Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., over Tehran's nuclear program. ""There is a lot of opportunity in the next few months before that expires to continue discussions between the officials of our government and the Iranian government,"" he said. ""And we think that is a prime opportunity, because these kinds of discussions have never -- have not really taken place for decades."" He said Monday would be his father's 66th birthday. The case gained renewed urgency in December, when The Associated Press and The Washington Post reported that Bob Levinson was working as an independent CIA contractor when he disappeared. According to the news reports, Levinson had gone to Iran on a mission to investigate corruption involving Iranian officials, according to an e-mail obtained by the family. Levinson disappeared shortly after arriving at Kish Island and has not been heard from since a 2010 video. Of the news reports that prompted the family to talk about what they say are Levinson's ties to the CIA, Dan Levinson said, ""We didn't decide to come forward with it, but it did happen. If anything, we are hoping to use this and ensure that it speeds up the process of getting my dad home."" The FBI, White House and CIA have not  publicly acknowledged any connection between the CIA and Levinson. In January, Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN, ""I have not seen anything that could prove that (Levinson) was ever in Iran."" ""In fact, we have seen evidence ... he was last seen alive outside Iran, with pictures showing that he was outside Iran when he was last seen. It's a very unfortunate case,"" Zarif said. ""We've said clearly that we have no knowledge of his whereabouts. ... We need the United States to explain for Iran what a CIA operative was doing, if he was ever in Iranian territory, what was he doing in Iranian territory."" In a statement released Sunday, Secretary of State John Kerry said the U.S. ""remains committed to the safe return of Mr. Levinson to his family."" ""We appreciate the support and assistance from our international partners as we work to end this awful separation,"" Kerry said. ""Given Mr. Levinson's health, age, and length of time in captivity, we mark this anniversary with a special sense of urgency."" FBI chief meets with Levinson's wife, son . ""We respectfully ask"" the Iranian government to ""work cooperatively with us"" on the Levinson investigation, Kerry said. Kerry called for anyone with information about the case to contact the FBI, which is offering a $1 million reward for any information that leads to Levinson's safe return. Levinson retired as a special agent of the FBI in 1998, the agency said in a written statement Friday. The statement said that Levinson traveled to Kish Island as a private investigator. ""He went missing the next day,"" the statement reads. ""The FBI is responsible for investigating crimes committed against U.S. citizens abroad and has been conducting an investigation"" to find Levinson, the statement says. ""Bob's absence over the past seven years has exacted an enormous toll on his family, and we will not waver in our commitment to bringing him home safely to his loved ones and his country,"" said FBI Director James B. Comey. ""We continue to request the assistance of our international partners as well as the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we continue to ask anyone with information regarding Bob's disappearance to contact the FBI."" About 20,000 former and current FBI agents observed a moment of silence Friday to mark the anniversary of Levinson's disappearance. For the Levinson family, the pain continues. ""Bob's continued imprisonment defies the humanity in all of us,"" the family said in a written statement Friday. ""After seven years, we have almost no words left to describe our life without Bob. We miss his face, his voice, his laughter, his wisdom and his embrace. We miss everything about Bob. No matter where we turn, Bob is absent. ""Bob, if you are able to see or hear this message, we urge you to be strong."" Missing American not 'abandoned' in Iran, Kerry says .","Bob Levinson will turn 66 on Monday, his son told CNN .

"Hillary Clinton raised eyebrows this month when she compared Vladimir Putin's tactics in Ukraine to those of the Nazis. She was right, but there is an even more ominous similarity between the actions of Iran and those of pre-war Germany. On May 21, 1935, Adolf Hitler delivered his infamous ""peace"" speech. In his masterful history of Nazi Germany, ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,"" William L. Shirer quotes the Fuhrer's remarks at length: . ""Germany needs peace and desires peace.""""Germany has solemnly recognized and guaranteed France her frontiers.""""Germany has concluded a non-aggression pact with Poland."" Shirer, a CBS Radio correspondent, called the address ""one of the cleverest and most misleading of his Reichstag orations this writer, who sat through most of them, ever heard him make."" He observed the West seemed beguiled by the speech, noting the Times of London welcomed Hitler's words ""with almost hysterical joy."" ""The speech turns out to be reasonable, straightforward, and comprehensive,"" stated the Times editorial. ""No one who reads it with an impartial mind can doubt that the points of policy laid down by Herr Hitler may fairly constitute the basis of a complete settlement with Germany."" Yet Hitler was lying to buy time. He would not bring peace, but a horrific war, annexing Austria, invading France and Poland, and ordering the extermination of six million Jews. Indeed, Hitler's lies were apparent less than a year after the speech. On March 7, 1936, the Nazis marched into the Rhineland, the demilitarized zone between Germany and France, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. If the West had confronted Hitler then, it could have forced him out of the Rhineland with a limited application of military force. Such history is worth noting in today's showdown with Iran. Many in the West seem beguiled by the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani. But are they truly interested in peace, or buying time to build the Bomb? ""Let me say loud and clear that peace is within reach,"" Rouhani told the U.N. General Assembly last September. ""Nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction have no place in Iran's security and defense doctrine, and contradict our fundamental religious and ethical convictions,"" Rouhani added. President Barack Obama praised Rouhani's ""more moderate course,"" and The New York Times called Rouhani ""charming."" By November 24, Iran had successfully negotiated an interim nuclear deal with the P5+1. The deal was widely lauded, especially by Iran. The ""Geneva deal means the surrender of big powers before the great nation of Iran,"" Rouhani said in January. No wonder the Iranians were so happy:-- Sanctions were eased, and ""Iran was given access to $550 million of its assets that are frozen overseas,"" noted Iran Watch. ""This is the first tranche of the $4.2 billion that Iran has been promised.""-- The interim deal does not require Iran to dismantle a single centrifuge or stop enriching uranium to 3.5%.-- Tehran has 18,000 centrifuges to enrich uranium, and some operate 15 times faster than older models.-- After years of work and massive financial investment, Iran currently has only enough enriched uranium to run its Bushehr Reactor for three months, notes Valerie Lincy of the Wisconsin Project On Nuclear Arms Control.-- Yet Iran now has enough enriched uranium to build six or seven nuclear warheads, Lincy adds. Americans want diplomacy to work -- as do we all -- but they worry that if the mullahs obtain a nuclear arsenal, it will be used to kill many. In January, we engaged polling firm McLaughlin & Associates to ask a series of questions of 1,000 likely U.S. voters. Among them: ""Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: 'If the world does not take decisive action, and the Iranian regime is permitted to build nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, the Iranian regime will one day attempt to annihilate the State of Israel and bring about a Second Holocaust'?"" A stunning 80% of Americans agreed. Only 16% disagreed. The world is at a critical moment. President Obama must insist on a final deal that requires Iran to fully dismantle its illegal uranium enrichment capabilities, its heavy water plutonium facility in Arak, and its nuclear weapons development efforts. The President -- who never should have agreed to ease sanctions -- should also support congressional efforts and declare that if Iran refuses to truly give up its nuclear ambitions, then he will sign aggressive new sanctions to be imposed the moment the six-month period of the interim deal is complete. What's more, he should significantly beef up U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf, and abandon efforts to slash our Army to pre-World War II levels. Right now, the mullahs do not take Obama seriously. They do not believe a serious U.S. military option is really ""on the table."" The President must make them believe it and restore American credibility. ""Now you know how you get [an] agreement with Iran?"" asked Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently.  ""Not by relieving pressure but by adding pressure. Pressure is what brought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, and only more pressure will get [them] to abandon their nuclear weapons program. Greater pressure on Iran will not make war more likely; it will make war less likely -- because the greater the pressure on Iran and more credible the threat of force on Iran, the smaller the chance that force will ever have to be used."" We cannot say force won't be needed. But Netanyahu is right that our last best chance for a peaceful outcome is increased American pressure and resolve. The stakes are too high for anything less.

"First lady Michelle Obama is in China for an official visit to expand Sino-American relations, but she will refrain from talking about political differences. Mrs. Obama, who flew Wednesday from Washington, D.C., is making a week-long trip to three Chinese cities and will speak with children at several schools about the importance of education and youth empowerment. The U.S. first lady has several activities and events scheduled Friday with Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan. ""Her visit and her agenda sends a message that the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples,"" said Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes. ""That's critically important, given the roles that our two countries are going to play in the 21st century, that we maintain the very regular contacts that we have at the leader-to-leader level, but that we're also reaching out and building relationships with people, particularly young people."" President Barack Obama is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping next week during the Nuclear Security Summit at The Hague. White House officials told reporters on a conference call that issues on which the U.S. and China differ, such as human rights and trade, will be discussed directly between the two leaders and other representatives of the governments. ""We don't expect the people of China to agree with all of our policy positions at any given moment, but the more they understand the United States, the more they understand the President and the first lady and their values and their priorities, we think the better it is for both of our countries,"" Rhodes added. Mrs. Obama plans to visit the cities of Beijing and Chengdu, where she will speak to students and discuss cultural exchanges and the benefits of studying abroad. China is the fifth most popular country for American students studying abroad, and more students from China study in the United States than from any other country. Beyond her message on education, Mrs. Obama will join Madame Peng in a tour of the Forbidden City and the Great Wall. Mrs. Obama will then travel to Xi'an to see the Terra Cotta Warriors. In Chengdu, she will tour the Chengdu Panda Base, which houses approximately 50 pandas. The first lady will be accompanied by her mother, Marian Robinson, and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, something that White House officials believe will resonate with the Chinese people. ""I think they understand the significance as well of family and of three generations of family traveling together, which I think the Chinese will appreciate, and will appreciate the ties and the bonds that the Obama family have with one another across generations,"" said the first lady's chief of staff, Tina Tchen. ""This is a great opportunity for the Obama family to experience that, and I think for the Chinese to see that as well in an American family.""","The U.S. first lady will meet with Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan on Friday .

"The emerging process of 3-D printing, which uses computer-created digital models to create real-world objects, has produced everything from toys to jewelry to food. Soon, however, 3-D printers may be spitting out something far more complex, and controversial: human organs. For years now, medical researchers have been reproducing human cells in laboratories by hand to create blood vessels, urine tubes, skin tissue and other living body parts. But engineering full organs, with their complicated cell structures, is much more difficult. Enter 3-D printers, which because of their precise process can reproduce the vascular systems required to make organs viable. Scientists are already using the machines to print tiny strips of organ tissue. And while printing whole human organs for surgical transplants is still years away, the technology is rapidly developing. ""The mechanical process isn't all that complicated. The tricky part is the materials, which are biological in nature,"" said Mike Titsch, editor-in-chief of 3D Printer World, which covers the industry. ""It isn't like 3-D printing plastic or metal. Plastic doesn't die if you leave it sitting on an open-air shelf at room temperature for too long."" The idea of printing a human kidney or liver in a lab may seem incomprehensible, even creepy. But to many scientists in the field, bioprinting holds great promise. Authentic printed organs could be used for drug or vaccine testing, freeing researchers from less accurate methods such as tests on animals or on synthetic models. Then there's the hope that 3-D printers could someday produce much-needed organs for transplants. Americans are living longer, and as we get deeper into old age our organs are failing more. Some 18 people die in the United States each day waiting in vain for transplants because of a shortage of donated organs -- a problem that Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine and a pioneer in bioprinting, calls ""a major health crisis."" An 'exciting new area of medicine' Bioprinting works like this: Scientists harvest human cells from biopsies or stem cells, then allow them to multiply in a petri dish. The resulting mixture, a sort of biological ink, is fed into a 3-D printer, which is programmed to arrange different cell types, along with other materials, into a precise three-dimensional shape. Doctors hope that when placed in the body, these 3-D-printed cells will integrate with existing tissues. The process already is seeing some success. Last year a 2-year-old girl in Illinois, born without a trachea, received a windpipe built with her own stem cells. The U.S. government has funded a university-led ""body on a chip"" project that prints tissue samples that mimic the functions of the heart, liver, lungs and other organs. The samples are placed on a microchip and connected with a blood substitute to keep the cells alive, allowing doctors to test specific treatments and monitor their effectiveness. ""This is an exciting new area of medicine. It has the potential for being a very important breakthrough,"" said Dr. Jorge Rakela, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and a member of the American Liver Foundation's medical advisory committee. ""Three-D printing allows you to be closer to what is happening in real life, where you have multiple layers of cells,"" he said. With current 2-D models, ""if you grow more than one or two layers, the cells at the bottom suffocate from lack of oxygen."" To accelerate the development of bioprinted organs, a Virginia foundation that supports regenerative medicine research announced in December it will award a $1 million prize for the first organization to print a fully functioning liver. One early contender for the prize is Organovo, a California start-up that has been a leader in bioprinting human body parts for commercial purposes. Using cells from donated tissue or stem cells, Organovo is developing what it hopes will be authentic models of human organs, primarily livers, for drug testing. The company has printed strips of human liver tissue in its labs, although they are still very small: four by four by one millimeter, or about one-fourth the size of a dime. Each strip takes about 45 minutes to print, and it takes another two days for the cells to grow and mature, said Organovo CEO Keith Murphy. The models can then survive for about 40 days. Organovo has also built models of human kidneys, bone, cartilage, muscle, blood vessels and lung tissue, he said. ""Basically what it allows you to do is build tissue the way you assemble something with Legos,"" Murphy said. ""So you can put the right cells in the right places. You can't just pour them into a mold."" Ethical concerns . Not everyone is comfortable with this bold new future of lab-built body parts, however. A research director at Gartner Inc., the information-technology research and advisory firm, believes 3-D bioprinting is advancing so quickly that it will spark a major ethical debate by 2016. ""Three-D bioprinting facilities with the ability to print human organs and tissue will advance far faster than general understanding and acceptance of the ramifications of this technology,"" Pete Basiliere said in a recent report. ""These initiatives are well-intentioned, but raise a number of questions that remain unanswered,"" Basiliere added. ""What happens when complex 'enhanced' organs involving nonhuman cells are made? Who will control the ability to produce them? Who will ensure the quality of the resulting organs?"" Bioprinted organs are also likely to be expensive, which could put them out of reach of all but the wealthiest patients. Murphy said Organovo only uses human cells in creating tissues, and doesn't see any ethical problems with what his company is doing. ""People used to worry about doing research on cadavers ... and that dissipated very quickly,"" he said. ""We don't think there's any controversy if you're producing good data and helping people with health conditions."" Most experts, including Wake Forest's Atala, don't think we'll see complex 3-D-printed organs, suitable for transplants, for years if not decades. Instead, they believe the next step will be printing strips of tissue, or patches, that could be used to repair livers and other damaged organs. ""We are very eager to put pieces of tissue to work for surgical transplants,"" said Organovo's Murphy, who hopes his company will be ready to begin clinical trials within five years. Of course, any use of 3-D-printed tissue in surgical procedures would require approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. That review process could take up to a decade. By then, the notion of a surgeon putting a 3-D-printed kidney into a patient may not seem so bizarre. Then again, this swiftly evolving technology may create new moral conundrums. ""The ethical questions are bound to be the same concerns we have seen in the past.  Many major medical breakthroughs have suffered moral resistance, from organ transplants to stem cells,"" said Titsch of 3D Printer World. ""Will only the rich be able to afford it?  Are we playing God?  In the end, saving lives tends to trump all objections.""","3-D printers may someday be producing complex -- and controversial -- human organs .

"Tensions are mounting as Russian troops step up their presence in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula and world leaders push for a diplomatic solution to the escalating crisis. As ideological battle lines are drawn around the world over the situation, leaders are painting vastly different pictures of the realities on the ground. Here are some of the questions at play, with a look at how key players are weighing in: . Who's in charge of Ukraine? Russia's take: Viktor Yanukovych remains Ukraine's elected leader, and Ukraine's new government is illegitimate. Russian United Nations envoy Vitaly Churkin called it an ""armed takeover by radical extremists."" Ukraine's take: Ukraine has a legitimate government and is set to have new presidential elections on May 25. ""Let's give an opportunity for that to work,"" Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.N. Yuriy Sergeyev said. United States' take: Yanukovych abandoned his post last month, fled the country and was then voted out of office by Ukraine's democratically elected parliament. How many Russian troops are inside Ukraine? Russia's take: Russia hasn't said how many troops it's sent into Ukraine. Ukraine's take: Russia has sent military ships, helicopters and cargo planes to deploy 16,000 troops into Crimea since February 24, Sergeyev told the United Nations on Monday. United States' take: Russian forces ""have complete operational control of the Crimean peninsula,"" a senior U.S. administration official told CNN on Sunday, with estimates of 6,000 Russian ground and naval forces in the region . Do Russian troops have a right to be in Crimea? Russia's take: Yes. A treaty between the neighboring nations allows Russia to have up to 25,000 troops in Crimea, Russia's U.N. envoy said Monday, adding that Yanukovych requested that Russia send military forces. Ukraine's take: No. Russian troops amassing in Crimea and near the border with Ukraine are an ""act of aggression."" United States' take: No, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is playing a dangerous game. The consequences of military action ""could be devastating,"" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power said Monday. Why is the tense standoff unfolding now? Russia's take: Russia has said its parliament approved Putin's use of military force to protect Russian citizens in the Crimean peninsula. Ukraine's take: There's no evidence of any threat to Russians inside Ukraine. Russia wants to annex Crimea. United States' take: Russia is responding to its own historic sensitivities about Ukraine, Crimea and their place in Moscow's sphere of influence, a senior White House official told CNN Monday. Russia fears that Ukraine is falling under European or Western influence, the official said.","Key questions are in dispute over the crisis in Ukraine .

"""7-Eleven killed the minibar."" The sentiments of one hotel manager in Hong Kong could well extend to hotels around the world. The hotel minibar, loved and cursed at by millions of desperate midnight snackers/drinkers, is on the decline. Hilton Hong Kong installed the world's first hotel minibar in 1974 by stocking liquors and fridges in each of its 840 rooms. The move reportedly led to a 500% increase in room-service drink sales and a 5% boost to the company's net income that year. Soon, the minibar became a near-universal industry standard. But Hilton recently started backtracking in some of its properties, removing the booze and leaving the fridges in its rooms, for guests to fill themselves. Other hotel giants, including the Grand Hyatt, Starwood and Marriott brands, are also phasing out this once ubiquitous in-room feature from some of their properties. It's because we just don't seem to enjoy them as much as we once did. TripAdvisor recently released a survey that found the minibar ranked least popular among all hotel amenities -- just 21% of respondents found the room fridge an important feature compared with 89% that wanted a free wireless connection. PKF Hospitality Research found that in the United States, revenue from minibars, which represents just 1% of total hotel revenue, fell 28% from 2007 to 2012. Robert Mandelbaum, the firm's director of research information services, says properties in the United States have adapted their food and beverage offerings, installing food outlets that resemble ""grab and go"" mini-markets. The trend for ""convenience eating"" is also contributing to a decline in the traditional hotel restaurant that serves three meals a day, he says. They're being replaced with casual food outlets offering items such as pre-packaged salads. It's all part of what Mandelbaum calls the ""Starbucks phenomenon,"" a property design and management philosophy that enables and encourages interaction between strangers. Combine this with the emergence of sociable ""millennials"" who prefer to mingle in the hotel lobby than order room service, and you have an industry and consumer move away from imbibing in the room. Is this such a bad thing? For those who think inflated prices on items like tiny bags of macadamia nuts and mediocre chocolate bars are offensive, especially when nearby convenience stores offer the same stuff for a fraction of the price, the stocked in-room bar has always been an irritant. Simon Dell, vice president of operations of Thailand-based ONYX Hospitality Group, agrees. ""We don't want to sell mini-macadamia nuts for $8.50. It's not what people want,"" he says. What's more, by eliminating minibars from rooms, hotels can actually save costs, says Dell. ""When (we) remove any content from the minibar it takes a considerable number of tasks out of every (housekeeper's) day, so there's time saved, headcount saved, therefore money saved, which is reflected in the overall price (of rooms),"" he says. Better for a property to focus on amenities guests prioritize, such as Internet access. ""Connectivity is as ubiquitous as the telephone 20 years ago, when it had to be in the room, or like your own shower or bathroom has to be in the room."" $10 Coke 'not right' Others think the minibar simply needs to evolve to changing needs of guests. ""We can't just give hot and cold running water,"" says Dean Winter, area director of operations of Hong Kong Hotels & China Projects at Swire Hotels. Take the example of Swire's Hong Kong property, Upper House -- each room features a complimentary selection (beer, soda, healthy juices, coconut water and snacks) and a separate, chargeable wine fridge. ""We wanted to differentiate ourselves to appeal to discerning business and leisure travelers without following the traditional routes of five-star hospitality,"" explains Winter. He thinks ""charging $5-10 for Coke is not the right thing to do,"" as people remain price conscious. ""People appreciate a complimentary minibar or Wi-Fi or movies, and paying a rate and not all these add-ons,"" he says. Less hard booze . Today there's far less hard liquor, complimentary or not. Ten years ago, JW Marriott yanked the petite bottles of liquor out of its chargeable minibars in its Hong Kong hotel, citing low consumption. At The Mira Hong Kong, miniature spirits were phased out in 2011. According to the property, ""the hard liquor was removed as we prefer to tempt our guests with drinks and entertainment at our open air lounge bar Vibes, and cocktail bar Room One with a live band."" Only corporate or high-paying guests get the fully complimentary minibar. Cheap trumps convenient . The minibar is also increasingly part of an all-inclusive package. At Hong Kong's Ovolo Hotel, the complimentary scheme is extensive: guests get a free minibar, breakfasts, plus two-hours free booze daily at its O Lounge, including all spirits and wine. Removing the prices has also helped remove the headache of arguing with guests over what exactly they did or did not consume, says the hotel manager in Ovolo's Aberdeen branch, Chum Roa. ""It was a source of many disputes in hotels,"" he says. ""If the customer persists they had nothing, often hotels absorb the cost to not ruin guest relations over minibar items."" Now, he doesn't have to deal with that. Roa imagines a future in which the traditional minibar is extinct. ""The competitor of the minibar isn't nearby hotels but the 24-hour stores where one can get everything you need a few blocks away,"" he says. The convenience of having a cold drink in your room isn't quite enough if you have to pay three times as much for it, it seems. Will you miss minibars in hotel rooms or say good riddance to shockingly priced beer and M&M's? Leave a comment.","Many hotel giants are phasing out minibars in rooms .

"Afghans will go to the polls on Saturday to elect their second president since the overthrow of the Taliban in the winter of 2001. You might be wondering: Why bother? After all, doom and gloom are supposedly the order of the day in Afghanistan. A Pew/USA Today poll in January found that slightly more than half of Americans believe the United States has mostly failed to achieve its goals in Afghanistan. A month earlier, a CNN poll found that the Afghan War might well be the most unpopular war in American history. An overwhelming 82% of Americans are now opposed to the war. (At the start of 2014, the United States had 38,000 troops in Afghanistan.) Dire predictions of a civil war breaking out after the withdrawal of U.S. and other NATO combat troops from Afghanistan at the end of 2014 have been a staple in the American media for years, including in quite sensible publications such as the New Yorker. But a surprisingly under-reported set of developments has been taking place over the past several weeks in Afghanistan ahead of Saturday's presidential election. It shows that Afghans are not preparing for another civil war and instead a large majority of Afghans are planning to participate in the first democratic transition of power in Afghan history, while the presidential candidates are engaged in the kind of campaigning and deal-making that would gladden the heart of Bill Clinton. Despite the entirely predictable efforts of the Taliban to disrupt the run up to the election, there is still likely to be a big turn out on Election Day.  A suicide bomber wearing a military uniform, for instance, killed six police officers on Wednesday inside the Interior Ministry, which is both well protected and in the heart of downtown Kabul. Even with the Taliban violence, recent polling by the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan found that 75% of Afghans said they wanted to vote. That is essentially the same finding of a separate poll taken almost a year ago that found that 76% of Afghans planned to vote. Even allowing for some drop-off on Election Day, most Afghan experts I have talked to believe the turnout will likely be in the 60% to 70% range. Turnout in the previous presidential election in 2009 was only around 30%. By contrast, the last time a U.S. presidential election had a 60% turnout was in 1968, and the last time it was above 70% was in 1900. The high voter turnout estimates are based on the great excitement the Afghan elections have engendered. There have been substantive televised debates between the leading candidates, an astonishing development when you recall that under the Taliban it was only 13 years ago that television was banned entirely. Indeed, under the Taliban there was no media to speak of beyond Radio Shariat, which dispensed grim Taliban propaganda. Afghanistan's now-vibrant media -- today there 75 television channels and 175 radio stations, as well as hundreds of print publications -- is giving the presidential campaign wall-to-wall coverage. Meanwhile, the presidential candidates are addressing vast rallies across the country. There has also has been real Chicago-style political horse-trading during the campaign. Candidates with little public support, such as Qayum Karzai, President Hamid Karzai's brother (and in another life, a restaurateur in Baltimore), recently ended his presidential bid and threw his support to another candidate, a former foreign minister, Zalmai Rassoul. Despite much fretting that President Karzai would publicly endorse one of the eight candidates still in the running, he hasn't done so and his supposedly preferred candidate, Rassoul, came in a distant third in a poll released over the weekend. Most impressively, the two campaigns that are consistently leading in the several polls taken during the past weeks have crossed ethnic lines to form their tickets. Top presidential contender Ashraf Ghani, who earned his Ph.D. at Columbia, is from the Pashtun ethnic group and he is running with Abdul Rashid Dostum as his No. 2, a leader of the Uzbek ethnic group. The other front-runner is Dr. Abdullah Abdullah who is identified with the Tajik ethnic group (despite the fact that his parents are Tajik and Pashtun). Abdullah is partnered with Mohammad Mohaqeq, a leader of the Hazara ethnic group, and he also has a Pashtun on the ticket, Mohammad Khan, who is affiliated with Hezb-i-Islami, a splinter group of the Taliban. Importantly, neither of the front-runners is an old school warlord. Indeed, they are both impressive technocrats.  Abdullah is an eye doctor by training who became Afghanistan's most capable foreign minister under President Karzai.  Ghani was the country's most able finance minister, also under President Karzai. Both these candidates can credibly promise sorely needed good governance in Afghanistan should they assume the presidency. Of course, there are caveats to all this. The 2009 presidential election was marred by massive fraud. Could this happen again? This is much less likely for several reasons: There is considerably more local media attention about this issue than was the case five years ago; there have been several nationwide polls in the run-up to this election that establish quite firmly that Ghani and Abdullah are the front-runners, so fraudulently fixing some other candidate to take the lead would be hard to accomplish, and all the major candidates will have their representatives at the thousands of polling stations across the country, according to a senior Afghan official. Could Taliban violence keep voters away on Election Day? Maybe in some places, but U.S., NATO and Afghan forces have long planned for this day, so expect to see a comprehensive security plan in place. According to the senior Afghan official, Afghanistan's borders with neighboring Pakistan will be sealed to the extent possible on polling day so as to prevent any Taliban insurgents or suicide bombers crossing over from Pakistan into Afghanistan. The official says Kabul International Airport will also be closed. A wild card that could upset the election process would be violence against one of the well-guarded leading contenders. Abdullah's motorcade was attacked by unknown assailants in February. He escaped unhurt. Afghan election law requires the winning presidential candidate to obtain more than 50% of the votes to win. Given that there are eight candidates still in the field, such an outcome seems unlikely. That means the two top candidates from Saturday's voting will go to a runoff election. According to the senior Afghan official, the runoff will likely take place on June 20. All the major candidates have said they will sign the Bilateral Security Agreement, or BSA, with the United States that would allow American troops to be based in Afghanistan in an advisory capacity for many years after the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops at the end of 2014. Karzai has famously refused to sign the agreement. Most Afghans want the BSA, because they see even a relatively small presence of U.S. soldiers and other NATO allies as a guarantor of the country's stability. As one senior Afghan official put it to me when discussing the hoped-for long-term presence of U.S. troops, ""We can either be Somalia or we can be South Korea."" It's obvious that most Afghans prefer the latter outcome. Under a U.S. security umbrella, over the past several decades South Korea went from being one of the poorest countries in the world to one of the richest. Though Karzai has been criticized by President Obama and members of Congress for not signing the BSA, in fact he has actually done the long-term relationship between Afghanistan and the United States a distinct favor, because the BSA will now be signed by the winner of the presidential election, a politician who will have a substantial mandate from the Afghan people, rather than by Karzai, who is at this point the lamest of ducks. What of the Taliban? Well, they regard elections as against Islam, so they will write themselves out of this historic event and will only be seen by most Afghans as spoilers who will try to interrupt the election. And in a significant turn of events, the Pakistani military is preparing a large-scale military operation along the Afghan-Pakistan border into the Pakistani tribal area of North Waziristan, which has long been a sanctuary for the most virulent branch of the Taliban, the Haqqani Network. According to two U.S. officials who closely follow Pakistan, the Pakistani military is geared up for this operation in a manner that is unprecedented, and it is only the civilian political leadership that is dithering about whether to pull the trigger. The United States made a fundamental error when it conceived that real peace in Afghanistan, which has been wracked by three decades of war, centered on doing some kind of deal with the Taliban. As a result, well-intentioned U.S. officials put a great deal of diplomatic effort into trying to negotiate some kind of peace deal with the Taliban. Absolutely nothing has come of this multiyear effort, which was always a pipe dream, as I predicted in this space three years ago. The negotiations with the Taliban were known in Washington circles as ""the reconciliation process."" In fact, the real reconciliation process is what you will see in Afghanistan on Saturday: Huge turnout by voters across the country voting across ethnic lines for seasoned politicians who have partnered with leaders of other ethnic groups. This isn't the predicted civil war; it's more like a civics love fest. If only we could try to import some of this spirit into the U.S. Congress.","Americans are dubious about the Afghanistan war, questioning what it achieved .

"President Barack Obama announced Friday that he will nominate Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who currently directs the White House budget office, to be the next health secretary, the Cabinet official who's ultimately responsible for overseeing Obamacare. Obama praised the outgoing secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, saying at a Rose Garden ceremony that she would ""go down in history"" for serving when the United States ""finally declared that quality, affordable health care"" would be a right for every U.S. citizen. ""I will miss her advice. I will miss her friendship,"" Obama said. ""I will miss her wit."" Her departure is not without controversy although her tenure will conclude more positively with the Obama administration riding high over the initial enrollment success of the politically charged health law. Obama acknowledged the early problems with the government's HealthCare.gov website last fall, which was an enormously tumultuous period for Sebelius. But Obama followed up by saying that ""her team"" turned the corner and ""got it fixed, got the job done"" in carrying out the sign-up period from October through March. ""The final score speaks for itself,"" Obama said with 7.5 million people signed up for health coverage. The Affordable Care Act, Obama's signature domestic achievement, aims to provide insurance for millions of Americans without it. Burwell is also no stranger to making tough calls. As director of the Office of Management and Budget for the past year, Burwell was at the center of last fall's budget drama during which she was responsible for sending out the shutdown order for federal agencies. During the ceremony, Obama touted Burwell skills as someone who can handle tough challenges. ""Sylvia is a proven manager, and she knows how to deliver results,"" he said. ""And she'll need to be a proven manager because these are tough tasks, big challenges."" She also has a history in Washington circles that extends beyond her current position. She was a budget and campaign official for Bill Clinton. At the Department of Health and Human Services, she inherits an agency heavily criticized for implementing the health law. Sebelius' tenure coincided with passage of the 2010 law with no Republican support. The political turmoil around its passage and its rocky rollout has become a rallying cry for the GOP heading into next fall's midterms where control of the Senate is at stake. But the website's performance did improve significantly as the year turned, quieting early calls from Republicans for her to step down. This month, in a letter to department employees, Sebelius reflected on Obamacare sign ups exceeding its target of 7 million as evidence of ""the progress we've made, together,"" while stating that ""our work is far from over."" ""I know that this law has been at the center of much debate and discourse in Washington, but what this enrollment demonstrates is that the Affordable Care Act is working and much needed,"" she said in the note. Obamacare hits 7.5 million sign-ups, Sebelius says . Burwell, 48, has already been through Senate confirmation for her job at the White House, but will need to go through that again for the health appointment. Her nomination will likely face tough questions from Republicans. ""You can expect a robust discussion, both at the hearing and on the floor, on Obamacare and its consequences,"" said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. She came to the White House from her spot atop the Walmart Foundation, the giant retail chain's charitable organization that, according to its website, donated nearly $1 billion to causes worldwide in 2011. Before that, Burwell worked for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In the Clinton administration, she worked under then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.

"The United States talked tough Wednesday about trying to halt escalating political violence in Ukraine, but analysts warned there was little that outside pressure could do, especially if the Ukrainian military gets involved on the side of the government cracking down on protesters. President Barack Obama condemned the unrest that killed 26 people on Tuesday and began spreading Wednesday beyond Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, with reports of protesters taking over government buildings in the nation's western region. Obama said the United States expected the Ukrainian government to show restraint against peaceful protesters, and he warned there would be unspecified consequences for excessive action. He made a point of saying the Ukrainian military should stay out of it, as it has so far. Later in the day -- after Ukraine's president and opposition leaders agreed to a truce and to fresh talks -- Obama said he hoped this development will ""provide space for the sides to resolve their disagreements peacefully."" Insisting that Ukraine isn't a pawn on some ""Cold War chessboard"" with Russia, Obama said that he hopes a unity government will be formed to pave the way for ""fair and free elections."" ""The situation that happened in Ukraine has to do with whether or not the people ... can determine their own destiny,"" he said. Visa ban . Later, the United States issued a visa ban for 20 senior members of the Ukrainian government and others responsible for the violent crackdown in Kiev, a senior State Department official told reporters on a conference call. However, Council on Foreign Relations President Richard Haass told CNN that the United States and its European allies have limited options for impacting the situation on the ground in Ukraine. ""My own hunch is this is going to continue to escalate,"" Haass said, adding that the main question was whether the military would side with the government by getting involved or back the protesters by remaining in barracks. In what the senior State Department official called ""a glimmer of hope,"" the Ukrainian government and the opposition announced a truce Wednesday night to allow for negotiations to restart with the aim at stabilizing the situation. Earlier, Obama said while attending talks in Mexico with the leaders of Canada and the host country that ""we're going to be watching closely and we expect the Ukrainian government to show restraint, to not resort to violence in dealing with peaceful protesters."" Ukraine's military a focus . Thousands of demonstrators have packed Independence Square in Kiev since November, when President Viktor Yanukovych reversed a decision to sign a trade deal with the European Union and instead turned toward Russia. The unrest intensified after an anti-protest law went into effect. On Tuesday, the street clashes escalated dramatically, leaving 26 people dead and buildings on fire. Vice President Joe Biden spoke to Yanukovych on Tuesday night to express ""grave concern"" over the crisis. A readout of the conversation released by the White House said Biden told the Ukrainian leader that ""the United States condemns violence by any side, but that the government bears special responsibility to de-escalate the situation."" Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated Biden's message on Wednesday, saying Yanukovych can choose either dialogue and compromise or violence and mayhem. ""It is in his hands to decide what the future of the Ukraine and the future hopes of his people will be, and we hope very much that violence will be avoided and compromise will be found,"" Kerry said. Wednesday night, Ukraine military forces moved into defensive positions around military bases and weapons depots across the country, according to a U.S. defense official familiar with the latest intelligence. The move was considered as defensive to secure facilities and weapons, and so far only involved military personnel rather than any widespread movement of armored vehicles, according to the defense official who spoke on condition of not being identified. ""We are encouraged the Ukraine military has not been brought into this crisis and we urge them to remain on the sidelines,"" said Pentagon spokesman Col.  Steve Warren. If the Ukraine military got involved in the fighting, ""that would have consequences for our defense relationship,"" Warren added. Ukraine cites terrorists for trouble . While Yanukovych's government  has received most of the blame, Ukrainian officials blamed protesters for the escalating unrest. Security chief Oleksander Yakimenko accused protesters of looting weapons and ammunition from government offices and announced a nationwide ""anti-terrorist operation."" According to senior U.S. administration officials, such language by Ukraine signals a hardening government position against the protesters. In a later conference call with reporters, the senior State Department official -- who spoke on condition of not being identified -- expressed concern over the replacement of Ukraine's military armed forces chief. No reason was given for the dismissal of Col. Gen. Volodymyr Zamana. Russia, which has major historical and economic ties to the former Soviet territory, accuses the United States of playing a role in the widespread protests. The senior State Department official denied that on Wednesday, saying ""we completely reject their notion that we have been interfering."" The visa bans announced Wednesday followed an earlier move in January when existing visas of some Ukrainians were revoked over previous unrest, the State Department official said. This time, the 20 Ukrainians -- none of them from the military -- now banned from getting new U.S. visas ""represent the full chain of command that we consider responsible for ordering security forces to move against"" protesters on Tuesday, the official added. Sanctions talk . Other sanctions in coordination with the European Union also could occur, according to the official, who declined to provide further details. France also has threatened sanctions against Ukraine over the government's crackdown, with President Francois Hollande calling the protest violence ""unspeakable, unacceptable, intolerable acts."" The Obama administration has come under increasing criticism for its foreign policy as talks have faltered on halting Syria's civil war, which left nearly 5,000 people dead in the last three weeks in a particularly violent stretch of the almost three-year conflict. On Sunday, veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona called the U.S. policy in Syria an ""abysmal failure and a disgraceful one.""

"(CNN) -- A change in tactics among Chechnya's militants is threatening to bring their nationalist fight to the heart of Russia's cities, terrorism analysts fear. The warning came as Russian investigators said they believed Chechen rebels were responsible for Monday's twin suicide bombings in Moscow's subway network that killed at least 39 people. The Russia-Chechnya conflict dates back nearly 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced from the fighting. The area is located in the North Caucasus region of Russia between the Black and Caspian seas. Read how Chechen rebels threaten Russian stability . For the last five years the war has been largely fought in the Caucasus but, according to terrorism analyst Chris Hunter, the tide has been turning against the rebels. ""They don't have the same sort of supply chain they used to have,"" he said, adding that pressure from the Russian military had taken its toll. Now there are suspicions that Doku Umarov, the 45-year-old self-styled emir of the Russian North Caucasus, is taking the battle into Russia itself. Until now Umarov, a veteran of Chechnya's nationalist fight with Russia, has been against killing civilians. He was critical of the Beslan attack in which Chechen rebels took 1,200 people as hostages at a school in Beslan in 2004. In the ensuing gun battles between the rebels and Russian forces, 334 hostages were killed, more than 100 of them schoolchildren. Only one militant survived. Russian authorities however say Umarov played a lead role in the Beslan attack and that he has been responsible for bombings on mainline trains and markets. While he has not claimed responsibility for Monday's subway bombings, if he is behind them, it would demonstrate a change in tactics due partly, analysts suspect, to a reliance on funding to continue the fight from radical Islamists such as al Qaeda. ""It's got to the stage where the Chechens in particular are potentially looking out to the global jihad for that level of support,"" said Hunter. ""By aligning himself to al Qaeda or other members of global jihad it would certainly be one source of securing that funding."" A possible key weapon at Umarov's disposal as he wages war on Russia are female suicide bombers, the so-called ""Black Widows"" who are believed to be behind Monday's coordinated blasts, typical of an al Qaeda attack. ""Suicide is much more considered traditional for women rather than for men,"" explains Russian security analyst Irina Isakova, ""in Chechen culture it's a different perception of suicide bombing than we have in the Middle East."" The Black Widows are believed to be made up of women whose husbands, brothers, fathers or other relatives have been killed in the conflict. The women are often dressed head-to-toe in black and wear the so-called ""martyr's belt"" filled with explosives. Female suicide bombers have been involved in several attacks in Russia and first came to prominence in 2002 when 18 women were among a group of separatists who threatened to blow up a Moscow theater seized in the middle of a musical. In the rescue attempt by Russian special forces, 115 hostages and 50 Chechen separatists were killed. ""The majority of them have been recruited because they've someone close to them because they lost a husband, a brother, a cousin ... and all of them indoctrinated, brainwashed,"" said Hunter. ""They are very much exploited. In 2002 we saw between 40 and 50 gunmen storm the Moscow theater ... not a single one of them was suicide bombers ... all the suicide bombers were females."" Black Widows were also among the 32-strong group of heavily-armed Chechen rebels who took approximately 1,200 people as hostages in Beslan in 2004. Moscow subway attacks bear mark of 'Black Widows' If Umarov has as many women at his disposal now, Moscow may indeed be facing in Umarov's words a ""war unleashed on its streets.""","Change in tactics among Chechen militants may bring fight to Russia's cities, analysts fear .

"Months after accepting asylum in Russia, fugitive U.S. intelligence leaker Edward Snowden on Thursday asked Russian President Vladimir Putin about Moscow's own surveillance practices. ""Does Russia intercept, store or analyze in any way the communications of millions of individuals?"" Snowden asked in English via a video link during Putin's annual question-and-answer program, which was broadcast on state television. ""And do you believe that simply increasing the effectiveness of intelligence or law enforcement investigations can justify placing societies, rather than their subjects, under surveillance?"" Putin responded that Russia has a special service that bugs telephone conversations and Internet communications to fight crimes, including terrorism, but only with court permission and only ""for specific citizens."" ""So, the mass character is something we do not have and cannot have,"" Putin said in Russian. ""On such a mass scale ... we do not allow ourselves to do this, and we will never allow this. We do not have the money or the means to do that,"" he said. Putin, a former intelligence agent, noted that his questioner, a former National Security Agency contractor, shares that background. ""So, we can speak in professional language,"" he said. Snowden last year disclosed details of the vast U.S. surveillance network put in place after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, including the government's record keeping on billions of phone calls. Anticipating legal consequences, he fled to Moscow. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property. Last month, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told National Public Radio that U.S. officials must plan for the possibility that Russia has access to American battle plans and other secrets. ""If I'm concerned about anything, I'm concerned about defense capabilities that he may have stolen from where he worked, and does that knowledge then get into the hands of our adversaries -- in this case, of course, Russia,"" Flynn said. He cited intelligence capabilities, operational capabilities, technology and weapons systems as potential subjects that Snowden -- and now Russia -- may have. ""We have to assume the worst case and then begin to make some recommendations to our leadership about how do we mitigate some of the risks that may come from what may have been compromised,"" Flynn said. Last October, Lon Snowden visited Moscow, where he told reporters that his 30-year-old son told him he had had no contact with Russian security or intelligence. In January, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Snowden leaks caused serious damage to U.S. security. ""What Snowden has stolen and exposed has gone way, way beyond his professed concerns with so-called domestic surveillance programs,"" Clapper said then. ""As a result, we've lost critical foreign intelligence collection sources, including some shared with us by valued partners."" The nation's adversaries were ""going to school on U.S. intelligence sources' methods and trade craft, and the insights that they are gaining are making our job much, much harder,"" he told the committee.","Russian President Vladimir Putin says his country's surveillance isn't as broad as that in the U.S.
""We do not have the money or the means to do that,"" he tells the fugitive intelligence leaker .

"First, the bad news: Even if the economy improves, middle-class career paths will continue to disappear as globalization and technological innovation render more jobs obsolete. Now, the good news: The fear, stress and humiliation caused by unemployment (and underemployment) can be alleviated with a simple solution. And now, the even-better news: This simple solution is starting to find backers on both sides of the political spectrum. A monthly cash payment to every American, no questions asked, would solve several of our most daunting challenges. It's called a basic income, and it's cheaper and much more effective than our current malfunctioning safety net, which costs nearly $1 trillion per year. The idea of a basic income, sometimes called a guaranteed minimum income or a negative income tax, has been discussed for decades by notable economists like Milton Friedman. In the late 1960s and 1970s, the idea had bipartisan backing before losing steam. Recently, in the face of a sputtering economy, a weak job market and rising income inequality, it has been gathering supporters at an ever-quickening pace. In fact, just last month, former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich called a basic income guarantee ""almost inevitable."" The concept of a basic income is not entirely abstract. Several countries, such as Brazil, have achieved notable success with their programs, lifting many people out of poverty. In countries like India, nongovernmental organizations are experimenting with pilot programs in specific areas, with promising results so far. The United States is already experimenting with a variation of basic income, even though most people don't realize it. Alaska has a small version, called a Permanent Fund Dividend, which is incredibly popular and made the state one of the most economically equal places in America. Importantly, Alaskans don't consider it ""redistribution,"" but rather ""joint ownership."" The benefits of a basic income on a national scale would be wide-ranging. First, there's the lift to the overall economy if everyone has money to spend. Next, there are the obvious psychological benefits of knowing you can always afford food and shelter. Then there's the societal stability factor: If people's basic economic needs are being met—no matter what the unpredictable job market is doing—we don't have to worry about the potential for civil unrest as a result of mass unemployment. Economist Gar Alperovitz told me that a guaranteed minimum income would not only defuse the political crisis posed by worsening long-term unemployment, but would also open up the possibility of a reduction in the length of the work week. Due partly to technological innovation, we already have a situation where less work is spread among more people, and this phenomenon will increase in the future. With a basic income, this development is nothing to fear. ""Once people have the freedom to elect to work less, their capacity to engage in the work of rebuilding community and democracy can increase far beyond what is possible in today's precariously overworked society,"" Alperovitz said. At the moment, the idea of a guaranteed minimum income might be more popular with liberals than conservatives. But lately, conservative thinkers have become more outspoken in their support of the concept. Philosopher Matt Zwolinski has made a libertarian case for a basic income. ""Conservatives care about limiting the power of government and increasing personal responsibility. ... Compared to our current welfare state, a basic income does both. Instead of a vast bureaucracy of over 120 different antipoverty programs at the federal level, you've got a program so simple it could be administered by a piece of software."" Furthermore, he said, instead of subjecting the poor to a host of invasive, paternalistic and degrading requirements designed to make sure they're behaving in ways the government approves of, a basic income gives them cash, and asks them to take responsibility for spending that money to improve their own condition. Of course, all government programs have imperfections, and the basic income idea has an obvious one: There will still be people incapable of functioning in daily life—people who will spend their money before paying for basic necessities. What should be done about these ""moochers""? My answer is that housing shelters and soup kitchens could continue to exist, helping people who cannot be helped in any other way. But the cost of these programs is just a tiny fraction of the overall safety net, and in cities with strong religious and philanthropic support, they would not need to be financed by the government at all. No one needs to sleep on the street. Another objection: What if people want to work more, not less? No problem. Want multiple jobs? Go right ahead and take them. As advocates of a basic income point out, nothing would keep people from working and earning as much as they want. The global economy will experience big and small changes in the coming decades. We must do something to avoid a future of high unemployment and misery. A guaranteed minimal income is a way to start.","David Wheeler: U.S. should provide a monthly cash payment to every American .
Wheeler: A guaranteed minimum income can address unemployment issue .
He says it would be a psychological benefit, lift the economy, and create stability .
Wheeler: It is also cheaper than our current malfunctioning safety net ."
"More than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico over the past six years as violence surged and the country's government cracked down on drug cartels. Mexico's Interior Ministry announced the staggering statistic on Tuesday but noted that authorities don't have data about how many of the disappearances are connected with organized crime. The 26,121 disappearances occurred during former President Felipe Calderon's six-year administration, which ended on December 1 when Enrique Pena Nieto assumed the presidency. Pena Nieto's government has formed a special working group to focus on finding the missing, said Lia Limon, deputy secretary of legal matters and human rights for Mexico's Interior Ministry. Locating people ""is a priority for this government,"" Limon told reporters. The release of the government statistics Tuesday comes several days after a report from Human Rights Watch said Mexican security forces were connected with the disappearances of at least 149 people during Calderon's tenure. ""President Pena Nieto has inherited one of worst crises of disappearances in the history of Latin America,"" Jose Miguel Vivanco, the organization's Americas director, said in a statement. In the northern Mexican state of Coahuila alone, officials reported nearly 2,000 disappearances between 2006 and 2012, Human Rights Watch said. Rights groups and activists have long said that forced disappearances are among the most troubling problems Mexico faces and have cautioned that reliable statistics are hard to come by because many such cases are unreported. The human toll of Mexico's drug war . Limon said Tuesday that the data federal authorities have don't specify what caused the disappearances. She said the list could include people who have emigrated out of the country or fled because of family conflicts, in addition to people who were kidnapped. Authorities will need several weeks to release data about the number of disappearances since Pena Nieto took office, she said, due to ""inconsistencies"" in the data. Critics have accused Mexico's government of not doing enough to find the missing and punish those responsible. In many instances, families frustrated with a sluggish response from authorities have searched themselves for missing loved ones. Read more: The 'open wounds' of Mexico's drug war . In October 2011, Calderon said the ""very high"" number of missing people was a growing concern. He listed them among the victims of violence that he described as ""open wounds"" in Mexican society. ""We don't know the size of the problem,"" the president said during a speech inaugurating a new prosecutor's office aimed at helping victims. Human Rights Watch said last week that it sees a ray of hope in the new administration. ""The Pena Nieto government has been very open so far about acknowledging the scale of the problem and the work that remains for them,"" said Nik Steinberg, a Mexico researcher for the organization.

"President Barack Obama gave Pope Francis a box of seeds as a gift, a fitting token as their first-ever meeting provided a fresh start of sorts between the administration and Catholic leadership after years of strained relations. ""These, I think, are carrots,"" Obama told the Pontiff, showing him a pouch from the box, which was made from timber from the first cathedral to open in the United States, in Baltimore. The Pope gave the President two medallions -- one symbolizing the need for peace and solidarity between the two hemispheres -- and a copy of ""Evangelii Gaudium,"" or ""The Joy of the Gospel.""  The book was penned by the Pope and calls for a new era of evangelization and a renewed focus on the poor. The tokens of goodwill underscored the goal of the meeting: Focus on areas where two of the world's most influential men agree, and gently tread ground where they differ. The two men greeted each other with a smile and a handshake and posed for pictures before sitting down across a table from each other. They spoke privately for nearly an hour. When they emerged from the meeting, the President and the Vatican had slightly different takes on the tenor of their discussions, especially when it came to issues that have frayed the relationship between the Obama administration and American Catholic leaders. ""... (I)t was hoped that, in areas of conflict, there would be respect for humanitarian and international law and a negotiated solution between the parties involved,"" the Vatican said in a statement. ""In the context of bilateral relations and cooperation between Church and State, there was a discussion on questions of particular relevance for the Church in that country, such as the exercise of the rights to religious freedom, life and conscientious objection. ..."" Obama, in a news conference that followed, told reporters that such issues were ""not a topic of conversation"" with the Pope and instead were discussed with Vatican Secretary of State Pietro Parolin. According to the Vatican, the two men also discussed the issue of immigration reform and ""stated their common commitment to the eradication of human trafficking throughout the world."" On this point, the President and the Pope were simpatico. ""I was grateful to have the opportunity to speak with him about the responsibilities that we all share to care for the least of these, the poor, the excluded,"" Obama told reporters after the meeting. ""And I was extremely moved by his insights about the importance of us all having a moral perspective on world problems and not simply thinking in terms of our own narrow self-interests."" The meeting took place two days after the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments on a contraception mandate included in the President's signature health care reform law. The law exempts churches and houses of worship from the requirement, but nonprofit, religiously affiliated groups are required either to provide contraception coverage to their employees directly or through a third-party insurer. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has been vocal in its opposition to the provision, said Sister Mary Ann Walsh, a spokeswoman for the organization. ""Religious liberties and right-to-life issues are a concern,"" she said of the tension between American Catholic leadership and the administration. However, ""the U.S. bishops have appreciated the administration's cooperation on issues of mutual concern."" 5 things you didn't know about popes and presidents . Those areas of ""mutual concern"" include immigration and poverty -- issues on which the President and the Pope could find common ground. In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, Obama pointed to the Pope's concern for income inequality, saying, ""Given his great moral authority, when the Pope speaks it carries enormous weight."" Continuing to focus on income inequality, Obama said, ""And it isn't just an economic issue, it's a moral issue. I think the Pope was speaking to the danger that over time we grow accustomed to this kind of inequality and accept it as normal. But we can't."" The President said he admires the Pope's courage to speak out on economic and social issues. ""It doesn't mean we agree on every issue, but his voice is one that I think the world needs to hear. He challenges us,"" Obama told the newspaper. ""He implores us to remember the people, especially the poor, who are affected by the economic decisions we make."" Immigration issues . Francis underscored his commitment to the plight of immigrants during a trip last year to the Italian island of Lampedusa, a place where thousands of African migrants desperately fleeing political upheaval and poverty pour onto European shores. Many die in the attempt to cross. Next month, a group of American Catholic leaders, including Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the archbishop of Boston, will follow suit and travel to the U.S.-Mexico border to highlight immigration concerns. On Wednesday, the administration renewed its public call for immigration reform by backing an effort by House Democrats to force a vote on the matter. ""Immigration reform is the right thing to do for our economy, our security, and our future,"" the White House said in a statement. Barack Obama and Pope Francis: Unlikely comrades? Tensions between the administration and many leaders in the American Catholic community began early in the President's tenure over his support for abortion rights. A number of bishops criticized the University of Notre Dame's decision in 2009 to award Obama an honorary law degree and invite him to give the commencement address. Relations frayed further over the contraception coverage requirement in Obamacare, leading the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to pan the law. ""It was a very tough year,"" said Christopher Hale, a senior fellow with Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good who helped lead national Catholic outreach for Obama's 2012 re-election campaign. ""It was hard to find any reasonable Catholic who thought the Health and Human Services mandate was handled well."" Differences over same sex-marriage only added to the strained relationship. Seeking unity, approval . Religious experts said Francis would not have been likely to wade into politically charged conversations during the meeting. ""The Vatican has to be very careful to not create a gap between what they're saying and the bishops are saying,"" said Steve Schneck, director of the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America. ""They will be very careful not to undercut the American bishops in that regard."" Pope accepts resignation of German 'Bling Bishop' The meeting with Francis, whose approval ratings are in the high 80s, might also boost Obama in that regard. His standing with the public has hovered in the low 40s. After all, the Pope's name and quotes have been invoked in everything from discussions over unemployment insurance, the minimum wage and the bigger issue of income inequality. ""If I was advising President Obama, I would say the No. 1 spokesperson on American immigration reform should be Pope Francis,"" Hale said. ""He has so much capital in this city. You have Catholics, Jews and atheists on the Hill quoting him."" House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican and a Catholic, recently invited the Pope to address a joint session of Congress. ""Everybody on the planet would like to have their picture taken with the Pope these days,"" Schneck said. ""One of the things that would delight Obama is if some of that popularity would rub off. Given the President's current low numbers, he is hoping for a bit of a boost.""","The meeting is called a step toward smoothing tensions with Catholics .

"The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 resumed Friday in the southern Indian Ocean with long-range reconnaissance aircraft looking for possible debris from the jetliner in one of the most remote locations on Earth. Aircraft from Australia and the United States have staggered departures to an area roughly 1,500 miles southwest of Perth, where two objects were captured on satellite and described as possible pieces of the plane, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The first plane, an Australian air force P3 Orion, arrived in the search area early afternoon local time, the authority said. Given the distance from Australia to where the objects were spotted by a commercial satellite, the aircraft will only have between two and three hours to traverse the search area before having to start the return journey, the maritime authority said. Calling it the best lead so far to the whereabouts of the airliner that vanished 14 days ago with 239 passengers and crew, Malaysia interim Transportation Secretary Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters the find ""gives us hope."" ""As long as there's hope, we will continue,"" he said. Along with the aircraft, a motley collection of merchant ships are heading to the search area, where they will join a massive Norwegian cargo ship diverted to the area Thursday at the request of Australia. The sailors aboard the Norwegian ship worked throughout the night looking for the objects, said Erik Gierchsky, a spokesman for the Norwegian Shipowners Association. ""All men are on deck to continue the search,"" he told CNN. ""They are using lights and binoculars."" Authorities were hoping for better results after poor weather hindered Thursday's search for the debris. Even before suspending the search Thursday night, authorities cautioned the objects could be something other than plane wreckage, such as shipping containers that had fallen off a passing vessel. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the news to the world in a statement in parliament. Officials then gave more details in a briefing closely watched by relatives of some of the missing. For the loved ones of the passengers and crew aboard the flight, the news of the possible find first announced by Australian was met with mixed reactions. ""It strikes me as just one more lead that may or may not come true,"" Sarah Bajc, whose fiance, American Philip Wood, was aboard the plane, told CNN. ""So it's enough to make us all anxious again after a couple of days of quiet, but, you know, I'm cautiously pessimistic that it's not a piece of the plane. "" New theories about disappearance . The objects . Satellites captured images of the objects about 14 miles (23 kilometers) from each other and about 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) southwest of Australia's west coast. The area is a remote, rarely traveled expanse of ocean far from commercial shipping lanes. The commercial satellite images, taken Sunday, show two indistinct objects of ""reasonable size,"" with the largest about 24 meters (79 feet) across, said John Young, general manager of emergency response for the Australian maritime agency. They appear to be ""awash with water and bobbing up and down,"" Young said at the news briefing Thursday. The objects could be from the plane, but they could be also something else -- like a shipping container -- caught in swirling currents known for creating garbage patches in the open ocean, he said. ""It is probably the best lead we have right now,"" Young said. ""But we need to get there, find them, see them, assess them to know whether it's really meaningful or not."" It took four days for the images to reach the authority ""due to the volume of imagery being searched, and the detailed process of analysis that followed,"" the agency said in a prepared statement. The size of the objects concerned David Gallo, one of the leaders of the search for Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. ""It's a big piece of aircraft to have survived something like this,"" he said, adding that if it is from the aircraft, it could be part of the tail. The tail height of a Boeing 777, the model of the missing Malaysian plane, is 60 feet. Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said she believes the Australian Prime Minister would not have announced the find if officials weren't fairly sure of what they had discovered. ""There have been so many false leads and so many starts and changes and then backtracking in the investigation,"" she said. ""He wouldn't have come forward and said if they weren't fairly certain."" Although the overall search area spans a huge expanse of 3 million square miles, U.S. officials have been insistent in recent days that the aircraft is likely to be found somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean. If this is debris, what happens next? Wide search continues . Until searchers make a confirmed find of debris from the aircraft, the search and rescue operation will continue throughout the search zone, Hishammuddin said. Even as the focus shifted to the southern Indian Ocean, Hishammuddin said Malaysia was sending two aircraft to search Kazakhstan in  central Asia. That's one of the locations along a northern corridor described as a possible location for the aircraft based on satellite pings sent by the plane after air traffic controllers lost contact with it in the early hours of March 8. Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and China were searching their territories, Hishammuddin said. India said Thursday it is searching in the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea, sending four warships and three aircraft to scour the region. That area is far north of the region where Australian forces were leading the search for the photographed objects, but in an area previously identified as a possible crash site for the plane. Meanwhile, 18 ships, 29 aircraft and six helicopters were taking part in the search in the southern corridor, where search efforts were intensifying in the area around the Australian satellite find. In addition to the Norwegian car carrier Höegh St. Petersburg, which arrived in the area Thursday afternoon, a second merchant ship was expected to arrive Friday night. The Australian naval vessel HMAS Success is steaming to the site but remains ""some days away,"" Hishammuddin said. China plans to send its icebreaker and research vessel Xue Long, or Snow Dragon, which is currently anchored in Perth, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The icebreaker will take four or five days to reach the search zone, according to the news agency. Malaysia's navy has six ships with three helicopters heading to the southern Indian Ocean to take part in the search, a Malaysian government official said. Other angles . Although much attention was focused on the ocean search, investigators continue to follow other leads in the plane's disappearance. Among the many theories put forth since the plane's disappearance is that one or both of the pilots were responsible in some way for the aircraft's disappearance, especially in light of revelations that appear to show that a sharp, unplanned turn in the flight path had been programmed into the plane's flight management system before one of the pilots gave a routine sign-off to Malaysian air traffic controllers. On Thursday, a U.S. official familiar with the investigation told CNN that an FBI team is confident that it will be able to retrieve at least some files deleted from the hard drive of a flight simulator owned by Flight 370 Capt. Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Investigators will also analyze websites that Zaharie and co-pilot Fariq Ab Hamid may have visited recently, the official said on the condition of anonymity.

"U.S. officials Thursday denounced what one called a ""grotesque"" leaflet ordering Jews in one eastern Ukrainian city to register with a government office, but the Jewish community there dismissed it as a ""provocation."" The fliers were handed out by masked men in front the main synagogue in Donetsk, where pro-Russian protesters have declared a ""People's Republic,"" Jewish leaders there said. The document warned the city's Jews to register and document their property or face deportation, according to a CNN translation of one of the leaflets. Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that a respected Jewish leader in Ukraine showed him a photograph of one of the leaflets. He called the document ""chilling."" And in Geneva, where diplomats held emergency talks on the Ukrainian crisis, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the leaflets ""grotesque"" and ""beyond unacceptable."" But the Jewish community statement said relations between the Jews of Donetsk and their neighbors were amicable, and the self-proclaimed head of the ""People's Republic,"" Denis Pushilin, denied any connection to the fliers. Pushilin told CNN the handwriting on the flier wasn't his, and the title attached to his name was not one he uses. It wasn't clear who had distributed the leaflets, but the chief rabbi of nearby Dnipropetrovsk said, ""Everything must be done to catch them."" ""It's important for everyone to know its not true,"" said the rabbi, Shmuel Kaminezki. ""The Jews of Donetsk will not do what the letter says."" The reports come as Ukraine's Western-backed interim government has been struggling to contain uprisings by pro-Russian political movements in several eastern cities, with both sides invoking the historical horror of Nazism in their disputes. Pyatt told CNN that radical groups may be trying to stir up historic fears or create a provocation to justify further violence. ""It's chilling. I was disgusted by these leaflets,"" Pyatt said. ""Especially in Ukraine, a country that suffered so terribly under the Nazis, that was one of the sites of the worst violence of the Holocaust. To drag up this kind of rhetoric is almost beyond belief."" The leaflets were handed out on Tuesday, during the Jewish holiday of Passover, the Jewish community statement said. They stated that registration was required because Jewish leaders had supported the ""nationalists and bandits"" in Kiev, where a popular revolt ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych in February. ""All citizens of Jewish nationality over age of 16, living on territories of Donetsk People's Republic, have to register with DPR commissioner of nationality before May 3rd, 2014 at the Donetsk Regional Administration, room 514, registration fee is $50,"" read a photographed copy of the leaflet translated by CNN. ""Must have in person $50 cash, passport, all available IDs, and documentation of ownership of real estate and transportation."" The men also hung posters with the same message, it said. ""Who is behind this is an open question,"" Rabbi Pinkhas Vishedski said in the statement. But he said the act was a provocation ""and should be treated accordingly ... full stop and end of topic."" Provocation or not, the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League condemned their distribution and what it called their ""cynical and politically manipulative"" exploitation of anti-Semitism. ""We are skeptical about the flier's authenticity, but the instructions clearly recall the Nazi era and have the effect of intimidating the local Jewish community,"" ADL Director Abraham Foxman said in a written statement. Pyatt said that in Kiev, where the Jewish community is a vital part of political life, there is ""no sympathy for this approach."" ""It's almost inconceivable that this kind of thing could be happening in the 21st century,"" Pyatt said. And Kerry said all parties at the Geneva talks unanimously condemned anti-Semitism and other forms of religious intolerance. ""Any of the people who engage in these kinds of activities -- from whatever party or whatever ideology or whatever place they crawl out of -- there is no place for that,"" he said.","""It's important for everyone to know its not true,"" Ukrainian rabbi says .

"The previous night we'd been turned away by stern-looking border guards. A categorical ""no entry"" to Transnistria. Trans-where? Transnistria is a breakaway state, recognized by no sovereign nation. It's a sliver of land sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine and only a little larger than Rhode Island, the smallest state in the United States. ""You can't come in. Right now there is no permission for foreigners and no permission for journalists,"" said the Transnistrian border guard, clad in an oversized peaked cap with Soviet-style hat-badge. It was past midnight and we were too tired to argue. To be honest, we had expected as much. A week earlier, Transnistrian authorities had fast-tracked our request for a journalist visa to report inside their territory. Instead of waiting the normal 10 days' processing time, officials had responded within 36 hours. It was a speedy ""no."" Transnistria split from the former Soviet republic of Moldova following a two-year war (1990-1992) that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed. The Russians stepped in to back Transnistria -- located on the right bank of the River Dniestr -- but never recognized it as an independent state. It became a land in limbo. More than a decade later, and after Russian troops marched into Ukraine's Crimea region, NATO's top military commander Gen. Philip Breedlove warned Moscow may be eyeing other targets. Western intelligence has shown tens of thousands more Russian troops massed on Ukraine's eastern border. 'Frozen conflict' Breedlove suggested the force -- backed by tanks and attack helicopters -- was large enough to roll right through Ukraine from east to west and into Transnistria. The general described this as one of Russia's ""frozen conflicts"" -- an unresolved political and territorial dispute -- which Moscow could reignite at any time in a bid to expand its influence across the region. Like the generals in Moscow and Washington, we pored over our map, tracking backroads and alternate routes into the self-declared country. We decided to try to visit as tourists; our target was the ""Equator"" a top nightclub in the Transnistrian border town of Bender. Attempting our approach this time from Moldova, we sloshed a half bottle of local brandy on the floor of our minivan to give it a party smell. Maybe they got bored of our incoherent fast-talk or perhaps bought the idea that Transnistrian nightlife was a big draw for international partygoers.  After a long wait, we were waved through. As we rolled past decaying heavy industry and tumbledown Soviet-era apartment blocks, it was clear Transnistria needed more than a fancy nightclub to give it a touch of glamor. At the doors of the ""Equator"", we were informed that the night's planned event was body painting and a contest to win free cocktails. The rules did not seem entirely clear. We headed instead for an early night in the capital Tiraspol. My last foray into cocktail drinking in former Soviet states had ended badly. A week earlier, up on the Ukraine's northeast frontier with Russia, a Ukrainian tank commander had cracked open a jar of pickled tomatoes, offered up some raw eggs and uncorked home-made vodka. When the fruit vodka ran out -- we ended the chilly night, in a foxhole, drinking shots of a cloudy liquid from a plastic bottle. Before he passed out, the gunner explained it was the cleaning fluid for the tank's electronics. No desire to repeat that in Transnistria. Trapped in time . As we headed early Sunday into downtown Tiraspol, it was easy to see Transnistria is a place trapped in time. The hammer and sickle is still proudly emblazoned on the Transnistrian flag. A Soviet star is perched atop the city council building and a few blocks down, a towering statue of Lenin rises like a guardian angel. The roads are named after revolutionary icons: Marx, Engels, Lenin. There's also just plain ""Communist Street."" At a flea market, old men traded Soviet army cap badges and shoulder flashes. Many here still hanker after the glory days of the Cold War. ""Of course it was good with the Soviet Union. We wanted to be with Russia and still want to be with Russia,"" one elderly lady told me. She wrapped her arms around herself as she explained how she had felt protected by the old U.S.S.R. Viktor, one of the men selling old Soviet military mementos added: ""It was good in those days but we know we cannot turn back time. But we want to join Russia now and set up a free-trade zone."" ""We don't want to be part of Moldova. They only grab money for their own pockets,"" he added. Pro-Russian . Talking to people here, it's hard to fathom why NATO chiefs would warn of an impending Russian invasion of Transnistria. The doors seem to be wide open and the welcome mat is out. ""Let them come. Here people are all for it. If the Russian military comes everybody will shout 'hooray,'"" a chatty blonde woman said. Transnistrians have repeatedly called to be allowed to join the Russian Federation. Moscow has so far failed to recognize Transnistria's independence -- insisting that it should first resolve its dispute with Moldova. After its annexation of Crimea, some political and military analysts believe Russia may be readying to redraw some of Eastern Europe's borders without further consultation. Away from the flea market, stands ""La Dolce Vita,"" an Italian-style pavement café that serves only instant coffee and dozens of varieties of sugary cakes. Law student Katya and boyfriend Sergey, an IT student, were consumed in a very public show of affection. Their minds were more focused on love not war. But they paused briefly for questions. ""If the Russians come in it wouldn't be a tragedy at all. The Russian military is already here,"" Sergey said. The couple added that they intended to go to Russia once they'd graduated to look for well-paid work there. They said good jobs were hard to find in Transnistria. When the Soviet star waned, a new star rose over Transnistria -- that of Wild West economics. An ex-KGB agent and former president appears to be one of the biggest businessmen in town. He goes under the brand name ""Sheriff"" and has a chain of supermarkets, gas stations and even Tiraspol's top soccer club. Other businesses here may not be so mainstream. International economists often describe Transnistria as a state whose fortunes are built on smuggling booze and tobacco and selling old Soviet weapons. Out in the countryside, Anna Ivanna has no head for shady dealings. I find her hoeing weeds from her small vineyard. She says her land is perfect for growing organic grapes. Some of it goes to produce Kvint -- a Transnistrian cognac. She believes becoming part of Russia would bring greater economic benefits like cheaper energy, especially Russian natural gas for heating her home and powering local industry. She's also heard Russian pensions are four times higher than in Transnistria. ""Why do we need Europe? It's good for us to be part of Russia. Maybe Europe is OK for the young people,"" she said. Russian soldiers never left Transnistria, after its 1990-1992 independence war with Moldova. A contingent of around 1,200 occupies bases and highway checkpoints here -- another indication Russian President Vladimir Putin would not need to invade since his troops are already here. On the outskirts of the capital, we venture into another Soviet-era apartment complex. On a wall, there's a starkly poetic line of graffiti scrawled in English. It could be the lament of star-crossed lovers or perhaps a sign of the political times. ""I love you. But why I love you?...I never know."" A message from Transnistria. To Russia with love.","People on a sliver of land caught in a Soviet time warp long to be part of Russia .
Transnistria is part of Moldova and an unrecognized self-declared country .
They see Russia as a protecting force and a place to work and trade .

"For Thailand's Queen Sirikit, the 2007 attack on a minibus in southern Thailand's Yala province -- in which suspected Muslim militants shot eight Buddhists through the head in broad daylight -- was simply further proof of what she'd been saying for more than three years. ""We have to help people there to survive. If they need to be trained, train them. If they need to be armed, arm them,"" she was quoted as saying by one of her military staff, according to media reports. Meanwhile, Thailand was convulsed by demonstrations condemning the attack. Her response was to boost her support for the Or Ror Bor or Village Protection Force, the militia the Royal Aide-de-Camp department, under Queen Sirikit's direction, established in 2004. Unlike other militia in the strife-torn region, whose make up reflects the local demographic, the Or Ror Bor is exclusively Buddhist, is often stationed near temple compounds and is tasked with protecting Buddhist communities. While Buddhism is associated in the Western mind with pacifism, Buddhist nations such as Thailand, Myanmar and Sri Lanka have been engaged in vicious conflicts. In Thailand, state security is now locked in an increasingly bloody civil war with the Muslim minority near its border with Malaysia, in Myanmar civil strife looms between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine State and Sri Lanka has just concluded a protracted civil war with its Tamil minority. Cycle of birth and death . Buddhism, with its emphasis on karma and samsara -- the idea that the cycle of birth and death is driven by the actions of an individual -- is traditionally deeply averse to killing, believing it creates negative karma that will be revisited on a person in their own lifetime or in subsequent reincarnations. So how do the largely Buddhist state security in these countries square their beliefs with the need to fight? Michael Jerryson, Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at Florida's Eckerd College and co-editor of the book Buddhist Warfare, says that warfare is part of the human condition irrespective of religion. ""The first thing to remember is that people have a penchant for violence, it just so happens that every religion has people in it,"" Jerryson told CNN. History of conflicts . He said that while Buddhism has a 1,600-year well-documented history of monastic-led rebellions and conflicts, the association of Buddhism in the Western mind is with pacifism. ""Buddhism certainly has a lot within its precepts about pacifism. In fact, almost every global religion does,"" he said. However, Buddhism differs in that the act of killing is less the focus than the ""intention"" behind the killing, he said. ""When there are Buddhist monks traveling with soldiers in Sri Lanka and chanting with them and blessing them, their perspective is that they are not trying to support the violence but ... it's better to have soldiers with a cool, calm, clear head, with good intentions, than those that are hot headed,"" Jerryson said. Self-immolations . He said Tibet's Dalai Lama spoke of the same focus on ""intention"" when asked about the recent spate of self-immolations in Tibet. ""He pointed out that these people are not on drugs, they don't seem insane but they're doing it for a cause - the intention seems to be clear,"" he said. ""This is often used to rationalize violence within Buddhist circles but as we're seeing now with Myanmar and Thailand, cool heads are not prevailing now."" He said Buddhist states often mesh nationalism with Buddhism, justifying war on the grounds that a fracture in the nation state is a tear in the sacred fabric of a land which represents the well-spring of their belief. ""Sri Lanka often speaks about 'the little teardrop island' as the last true vestige of true Buddhism. So when the LTTE, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, tried to separate a portion of that 'teardrop island' it was analogous to attacking the mother,"" Jerryson said. Political rhetoric . As with most countries that use violence to solve disputes, Jerryson says the political rhetoric will begin to assume that the means justifies the ends. ""The rhetoric of violence as a defense, and this is not unique to Buddhism, is the idea of violence for the sake of peace,"" he said. ""That although this is an infraction, although we are gaining negative karma, it's for the greater good -- prima facie anyway."" Buddhist nation states have historically sought to use Buddhist doctrine to justify war. During the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s, for instance, soldiers were told not only that they were defending Buddhism but that emptiness in Buddhism is the only true reality, therefore, in the end, nobody was being killed, Jerryson said. Ultimately,added Jerryson, Buddhist countries battling insurgencies will find that their root problems are economic rather than sectarian. ""How many strong Buddhists states are we looking at in the world? How many of them are economically strong? Because with economic strength and vitality comes less likelihood of civil insurrections and wars. ""Of course, we see a lot violence with Islamic countries now, but we also see a lot of poverty with them too."" Identity crisis . For Thailand-based security analyst Don Pathan the problems in Thailand's south have less to do with religion than with identity. EXPLAINER: Thailand's deadly southern insurgency . ""The fact that the Or Ror Bor is exclusively Buddhist, doesn't say anything about Buddhism in ethical terms; it's just something that sets them apart from other security units,"" Pathan told CNN. ""The issue is not about religion."" He said that while there were many factors influencing the insurgency -- economic, historical and the fact, he says, that the violence has migrated from rural areas to the cities -- he had also noticed a generational dimension to the problems. ""My experience with the older generation is that I still sense a strong fabric of society that still gets along together -- people are still friends whether they are Muslim or Buddhist. ""But I don't get that sense very strongly with the younger generation."" He said that while older Buddhists generally speak functional Malay to communicate with their neighbors, younger people have little interest in learning the language, regarding it as something only their grandparents do. The state emphasis on speaking Thai at schools has created problems, he said, reinforcing differences between the two communities. ""And it's not just Thai, but Central Thai -- that's how ethnocentric the Thai nation state can be. But they don't seem to understand that's a problem; that we need to accommodate the local identity,"" Pathan said. He said the confusion between culture and religion was one of the driving forces behind the violence. ""It's like (groups) that say they practice correct Islam, but what is correct Islam? Islam is a religion not a culture,"" he said. ""The problem (in southern Thailand) is that they don't separate these things; for them it's two sides of the same coin.""","Buddhism is strongly associated in the Western mind with pacifism .
Despite this, increasingly Buddhist countries are mired in insurgent violence .
In Sri Lanka to Myanmar and southern Thailand, Buddhists have been urged to take up arms .
Analysts say, as with many religions, Buddhism is seen as a part of a national identity ."
"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush swung back at critics of Common Core on Thursday, challenging those who refuse to adopt the controversial testing standards, which have made him a target by conservatives, to come up with something better. ""For those states that are choosing a path other than Common Core, I say this: That's fine, except you should be aiming even higher and be bolder and raise standards and ask more for our students and our system,"" he said at a summit in Washington hosted by his education group, Foundation for Excellence in Education, a major backer of Common Core standards. His speech underscored a need for further education reform, a message likely to be a key part of his platform should he decide to run for president. As the potential GOP presidential field awaits his decision on a White House bid, Bush has said he'll make up his mind by the end of the year. His push for Common Core has made him a target for conservative ire. Some Republicans, backed up by polling that indicates the program struggles in popularity, complain that the program interferes with local government control, by infusing more Washington bureaucracy in education. The standards were developed by the bipartisan National Governors Association, state governments and nonprofit groups. But if states want a share of President Barack Obama's Race to the Top education grants, one of the ways to get it is by adopting Common Core. In that sense, the government created incentives for states to embrace the standards. Bush stressed that the struggles faced by students in low-income schools is a ""civil rights crisis,"" further arguing that ""fixing our schools"" must be one of the nation's most ""urgent priorities."" On Common Core, Bush squarely hit back at critics who say the testing standards are too high. ""Let's get real about this,"" he said, ticking off statistics about poor performance among high school students preparing to go to college. ""The rigor of the Common Core state standards must be the new minimum in classrooms,"" â€‹he added, stressing the need to embrace challenging standards. Some of the most vocal opponents of the program include Bush's potential GOP presidential rivals, like Sen. Rand Paul, who took a subtle jab at Bush last month over the issue, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, whose state sued the Obama administration. Bush argued the debate has been ""troubling"" but said he believed ""nobody in this debate has a bad motive."" Bush, who's also been an advocate for immigration reform, made no mention of Obama's plan to announce executive action on the issue Thursday night.","Former Florida Gov.

"A new trial has been ordered for Mississippi death row inmate Michelle Byrom, according to a state Supreme Court opinion issued Monday. Byrom's capital murder conviction was reversed, and the case has been remanded to the circuit court for a new trial, the opinion said. ""We are very grateful that the Mississippi Supreme Court has granted Michelle Byrom's request for relief from her death sentence,"" said Byrom's attorney, David Calder. ""This was a team effort on the part of the attorneys currently representing Michelle, and we believe that the court reached a just and fair result under the facts presented in this case.""​ . Byrom has been on death row since her 2000 conviction for capital murder. The 57-year-old woman was convicted of being the mastermind of a murder-for-hire plot to kill her allegedly abusive husband, a killing her son had admitted to committing in several jailhouse letters and, according to court documents, in an interview with a court-appointed psychologist. He recanted when he was put on the stand, according to court records. Attorney General Jim Hood, who had requested Byrom's execution, said Monday his office would seek the court's reasoning for the reversal. ""While we respect the Mississippi Supreme Court's decision, it is important that the trial court know and understand the specific errors that were found by the justices so that the lower court knows the best way to proceed,"" he said. ""Our citizens can once again take comfort in the fact that we have a legal system that works for all parties involved."" The Supreme Court opinion noted that the decision ""is extraordinary and extremely rare in the context of a petition for leave to pursue post-conviction relief."" Oliver Diaz, the former presiding justice of the Supreme Court, called the opinion ""actually kinda amazing,"" from the order for a new trial to the ruling's release on a Monday instead of a Thursday, as usual. ""The lawyers filed a last ditch motion for additional post conviction relief. These are almost never granted. Defendants are limited to a single post conviction motion,"" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""It is extremely rare to grant and send back for a new trial."" The court further instructed that a different judge should be assigned to Byrom's new trial. Circuit Judge Thomas J. Gardner, who imposed the death sentence on Byrom after her conviction, declined to comment to CNN, saying, ""The matter is ongoing."" Diaz also said the order for a new judge was extraordinary. ""Also, taking the step of removing the original trial judge is very unusual as well,"" he wrote. Tara Booth, spokeswoman for the Mississippi Department of Corrections, said the department expects an order Tuesday to transfer Byrom from the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility to Tishomingo County, where the killing occurred. Hood, the attorney general, had requested that Byrom be executed ""on or before (the date of) March 27,"" but the Mississippi Supreme Court, which has the final say on execution dates, denied Hood's request. During Michelle Byrom's original trial, prosecutors said she plotted to kill her husband, who was fatally shot in his home in Iuka, Mississippi, in 1999 while Michelle was in the hospital receiving treatment for double pneumonia. A jury convicted her based on evidence and testimony alleging that she was the mastermind of the plot. Byrom Jr. admitted in jailhouse letters that he had committed the crime on his own after growing tired of his father's physical and verbal abuse, and a court-appointed psychologist has said that Byrom Jr. told him a similar story. On the stand, Byrom Jr. pinned the slaying on one of his friends, whom he said his mother had hired for $15,000. Following her attorney's advice, Michelle Byrom waived her right to a jury sentencing, allowing the judge to decide her fate. He sentenced her to death. Prior to Monday's ruling, Michelle Byrom's defense attorneys had filed a motion asking the court for additional discovery so the alleged confession to the court-appointed psychologist could be fully explored. The defense attorneys also want to depose the prosecutor from her trial, Arch Bullard, regarding his knowledge of Byrom Jr.'s alleged confession to the psychologist. Bullard has told CNN that he firmly believes Michelle Byrom was the mastermind of the murder-for-hire plot.","Defense attorney ""grateful"" for decision, applauds ""just and fair result"" in case .

"Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died early Friday after a gunfight with police. Investigators are looking into his past for clues about last week's terror attack. Here's a look at some key dates, compiled from CNN's reporting and other media reports. What we know about the suspects . October 21, 1986 . Tamerlan Tsarnaev is born. His uncle, Ruslan Tsarni, says Tsarnaev was born into an ethnically Chechen family in Kyrgyzstan. 2001 . The Tsarnaev family moves from Tokmok, Kyrgyzstan, to Dagestan, according to the state committee for national security of the Kyrgyzstan government. ""They lived here for a year, not the whole year. They arrived at the school in 2001 and departed in March 2002,"" a spokesman at a school the children attended in Makhachkala, Dagestan, told Russia Today, a Russian state-funded television network. 2002 . Parents Anzor Tsarnaev and Zubeidat Tsarnaeva immigrate to the United States with their son, Dzhokhar. Their three other children -- Tamerlan Tsarnaev and two sisters -- stay behind in Kazakhstan with an uncle, his aunt told reporters in Canada this week. July 2003 . Tsarnaev, then 16, is in Turkey in July 2003 for 10 days on a Kyrgyz  passport, a senior Turkish official says. He comes to the United States that month, along with his two sisters, his aunt, Maret Tsarnaeva, told the Toronto Sun. July 19, 2003 . Tamerlan Tsarnaev first enters the United States through New York's JFK International Airport, a federal official says. 2003-2004; 2008-2010 . Tsarnaev is registered to fight with USA Boxing, the organization that oversees amateur boxing in the United States, a spokeswoman says. Tsarnaev delivered pizza and held other jobs while boxing, his aunt said. January 2004 . In an interview with the Lowell Sun newspaper in Massachusetts, after winning a fight in a local boxing tournament, Tsarnaev says he grew up in Grozny, Chechnya, and moved with his family to the United States in 2003 in hopes of starting a new life.

I could speculate that he was probably going over there more often. We don't have -- I don't have the evidence of that just yet. But that's obviously an area of focus,"" he said.

Soon after returning from a long visit to Russia, Tsarnaev creates a YouTube channel with links to a number of videos. Two videos under a category labeled ""Terrorists"" have since been deleted. It's not clear when or by whom. Analysis by CNN and the SITE Intelligence Institute has uncovered a screen grab from one of those videos. It features members of the group Imarat Kavkaz -- identifiable by the logo on their shirts. Imarat Kavkaz is the most potent militant Islamist group in the north Caucasus, which includes Chechnya and Dagestan. Tsarnaev also appears to have posted and then removed a video of a militant named Abu Dujana, a jihadist leader who was later killed by Russian troops. Russian security services killed Abu Dujana in December during an assault on an apartment in Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. He led a small militant group in Dagestan that had links to Imarat Kavkaz. While Tsarnaev was in Russia in 2012, he spent some of his time in Makhachkala, where his father lives today.

"Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal signed a wide-ranging gun bill into law Wednesday that has critics howling and proponents applauding. House Bill 60, or the Safe Carry Protection Act of 2014 -- which opponents have nicknamed the ""guns everywhere bill"" -- specifies where Georgia residents can carry weapons. Included are provisions that allow residents who have concealed carry permits to take guns into some bars, churches, school zones, government buildings and certain parts of airports. GeorgiaCarry, which lobbied for the bill, calls it ""meaningful pro-gun legislation,"" despite it being watered down from the group's perspective. Still, the group has lauded the legislation, which will go into effect July 1. Americans for Responsible Solutions opposed the bill, calling it ""extremism in action."" Wednesday's signing came at an open-air picnic area along a creek in Ellijay, in northern Georgia. It opened with a prayer, the singing of the national anthem and a recital of the Pledge of Allegiance. Hundreds of people filled more than 25 picnic tables, while others stood. Many were openly carrying handguns, and some wore National Rifle Association hats and buttons proclaiming, ""Stop Gun Control"" and ""Guns Save Lives."" The bill, which easily navigated the state Legislature -- by a 112-58 vote in the House and a 37-18 tally in the Senate -- also earned the support of Democratic state Sen. Jason Carter, the grandson of ex-President Jimmy Carter and a 2014 gubernatorial candidate. Calling it ""a great day to reaffirm our liberties,"" Deal said the law allows residents to protect their families and expands the list of places where they can legally carry firearms, while allowing certain property owners, namely churches and bars, to make judgments on whether they want worshippers and patrons carrying guns. ""The Second Amendment should never be an afterthought. It should be at the forefront of our minds,"" Deal said while touting his NRA endorsement for governor and ""A"" rating during his 17 years in Congress. The governor said the law ""will protect the constitutional rights of Georgians who have gone through a background check to legally obtain a Georgia Weapons Carry License. ""Roughly 500,000 Georgia citizens have a permit of this kind, which is approximately 5 percent of our population. License holders have passed background checks and are in good standing with the law. This law gives added protections to those who have played by the rules -- and who can protect themselves and others from those who don't play by the rules."" Americans for Responsible Solutions opposed the original bill that GeorgiaCarry pushed for, and while the group is pleased that the version Deal signed Wednesday doesn't allow guns on college campuses or in churches, except in certain cases, it feels the legislation ""takes Georgia out of the mainstream."" ""Among its many extreme provisions, it allows guns in TSA lines at the country's busiest airport, forces community school boards into bitter, divisive debates about whether they should allow guns in their children's classrooms, and broadens the conceal carry eligibility to people who have previously committed crimes with guns,"" said Pia Carusone, the group's senior adviser. ""So it is no surprise that while being trumpeted by the NRA as the 'most comprehensive' gun bill in state history, the legislation ... was opposed by Georgia law enforcement, county commissioners, municipal leaders, and the Transportation Security Administration for its potentially harmful impact on Georgians' safety."" While the bill says no one is allowed to carry a firearm past an airport's security screening checkpoint, it allows guns in other areas, including ""an airport drive, general parking area, walkway, or shops and areas of the terminal that are outside the screening checkpoint."" TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein would not say how the law might affect its agents at Georgia airports, particularly Atlanta's, the world's busiest, but he said, ""Individuals who bring firearms to security checkpoints are referred to law enforcement and are subject to criminal penalties. However, TSA has the ability to impose a civil penalty."" Another provision of the new law allows firearms into any government building that is open for business and doesn't have security personnel restricting access or screening visitors. Some critics have said it was hypocritical to allow guns in so many places but not the state Capitol. Deal addressed that perception in a question from reporters, saying the Capitol fell under a wider statewide provision that affects many government buildings, and it's ""a uniform carved-out area all across our state."" The law also allows Georgians to carry guns into bars and churches as long as the property owner hasn't banned them. Anyone bringing a gun into a church that prohibits them won't be arrested but could pay a fine up to $100, the law says. New York church to give away AR-15 semi-automatic rifle . One church that won't be allowing parishioners to carry weapons is Atlanta's historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, which remembers well the 1974 shooting deaths of a deacon and Alberta Williams King, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s mother, in its sanctuary. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, the church's senior pastor, said a deranged man who had access to guns but not health care was behind that shooting, a circumstance that still resonates today. The shooting would have been even more tragic ""had everyone been packing that day,"" Warnock said. ""The message of today's bill signing is very clear: Our politicians, tragically, are owned by the gun lobby,"" he said. ""No one asked for this bill but the gun lobby, and still, we're here. ... We will remind them in November that they work for the people."" Most churches throughout the state are focused on social issues, such as better health care and education, Warnock said. ""I don't know of a single pastor in the state of Georgia who has been lobbying to have guns brought into their churches,"" he said. ""When we say pass the peace, we mean P-E-A-C-E, not the P-I-E-C-E."" The law will also allow the carrying of firearms by any ""duly authorized official of a public or private elementary or secondary school or a public or private technical school, vocational school, college, university, or other institution of post-secondary education or a local board of education."" Deal also touted how HB60 would allow soldiers to obtain a carry license at age 18 if they've completed basic training and are either actively serving or have been honorably discharged. ""If they're old enough to hold a gun in defense of our liberties, then they're old enough to hold a gun, and they shouldn't have to wait until they're 21."" Other notable provisions of the law allow hunters to use silencers and suppressors when the owner of the property where they're hunting is aware they're using such a device; permit gun owners who have had their licenses revoked to apply for a new license after three years; restrict access for anyone whom a court has deemed mentally incompetent or insane, or anyone involuntary committed to a mental institution; and forbid police officers who see a resident carrying a gun to ask for their permit unless they're committing a crime.

"Maria von Trapp, the last of the singing children immortalized in the movie musical ""The Sound of Music,"" died at her Vermont home of natural causes, her half-brother told CNN on Saturday. The native of Austria was 99 and lived in Stowe. She died Tuesday. Maria von Trapp was the third-oldest child of Agathe Whitehead and Capt. Georg  von Trapp. The couple had seven children: Rupert, Agathe, Maria, Werner, Hedwig, Johanna and Martina. Georg von Trapp's second wife, Maria Kutschera von Trapp, wrote a book titled ""The Story of the Trapp Family Singers,"" which sparked two German-made movies and ""The Sound of Music."" In 1959, the play ""The Sound of Music"" opened on Broadway. Julie Andrews, in arguably her most famous role, played the part of Georg's wife, Maria, in the 1965 film. Christopher Plummer played Baron von Trapp. The movie won five Academy Awards, including best picture. Johannes, the youngest son of Maria and Georg von Trapp, issued a statement following his sister's passing: ""Thank you for your thoughts. Maria had a wonderful life and while we will miss her, the memories of her will live on,"" Johannes wrote. Maria von Trapp later in life served as a lay missionary in Papua, New Guinea. She never married. Both of Maria's parents were talented musicians. Agathe played the violin and the piano while her father played the violin, accordion and mandolin. ""Sometimes our house must have sounded like a musical conservatory. You could hear us practice piano, violin, guitar, cello, clarinet, accordion, and later, recorders. We would gather in the evenings to play Viennese folksongs on our instruments with Father leading on the violin,"" Maria wrote in her autobiography found on the Trapp Family Lodge's website. Agathe von Trapp died of scarlet fever in 1922. Maria also suffered from the disease and needed to be tutored at home as a result. That teacher, Maria, would eventually marry Georg in 1927. The couple would go on to have three more children: Rosmarie, Eleonore and Johannes. The Trapps fled Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938 and moved to the United States. The Trapp family, after traveling the world, purchased a 27-room family home in Stowe in 1950. Thirty years later, the building was destroyed in a fire, then rebuilt into the Trapp Family Lodge. The property is still owned and operated by remaining members of the Trapp family, according to the lodge's website. The elder Maria von Trapp died in 1987.

"Of the many shocking and wrenching images that have come from the sinking of the Sewol ferry, one that stands out for me depicts the vessel's captain -- head bowed and covered by a hood -- standing on dry land admitting he had abandoned ship. He was, in fact, among the first to be rescued. The shock for me is not this image itself, but the realization that Captain Lee Joon-seok must have known as he got off the Sewol that hundreds of other passengers -- including 325 students -- were still inside, apparently following instructions to stay put -- instructions that may be proven by investigators to have led directly to their deaths. On Monday, the South Korean coast guard released new footage of the captain and other crew members leaving the ship -- images that to me are equally disturbing. The sea around the Sewol looks glass-calm. It's bright morning light, there's no swell, there's no obvious sign of tearing currents. For a body of water with such a treacherous reputation, it looks benign. Perhaps not safe, but well worth risking if your life is at stake. At this point the Sewol is leaning dangerously, to the port or left side, its upper deck under water. No one knows the vessel is close to beginning its final descent to the seabed. But Captain Lee, wearing a shirt and what looks like his underwear, and other crew members are helped into a small rescue boat, leaving the passengers to their fate. In cell phone footage taken by a teenage boy inside the Sewol -- also released in recent days -- students after being told effectively to sit tight are seen patiently waiting for further instructions and for help to arrive. A showing of faith and trust in authority that appears now tragically misplaced. None of the crew, including the captain, identified themselves to rescuers as crew members, the first coast guard responders said in a press conference on Monday. Their uniforms -- if they were wearing them -- were hidden by life vests. This footage has only added to already widespread public revulsion in South Korea around the events surrounding the sinking of the Sewol. A week ago, President Park Geun-hye described the crew's actions as being ""like murder."" An aunt of one of the student victims from Danwon High School told me how ""ashamed"" she was that this could happen in South Korea. She is so upset, she just wants to leave the country. There are tales of heroism as well. The 22-year-old crew member Park Jee Young who died as she tried to help passengers to safety and handing out life vests. And of course there are the divers and rescue teams scouring the sunken vessel in extremely difficult conditions. Perhaps these acts may not have been necessary if more immediate and appropriate action had been taken by the ship's commanding officers. There's no international maritime law that says a captain has to go down with his or her ship. But there have been honorable examples of this course of action -- Captain Edward J. Smith of the Titanic comes to mind. The captain is responsible for the vessel and all the people on board. In some countries, including South Korea, abandoning ship is a maritime crime. It's not just the actions of Lee under the microscope here. It's also the shipping company itself and government regulation. How were the crew trained to deal with emergencies? How safe was the vessel? How well-regulated are South Korea's coastal passenger ships? All are questions to which South Koreans are demanding answers. Yes, the captain and 14 other Sewol crew members have been arrested amid ongoing investigations. They all face charges of ""causing death by abandoning (ship), and violation of the country's marine law, the Rescue and Aid at Sea and in the River Act,"" Yang Joong-Jin, the senior prosecutor for the investigation task force says. At this stage though, it is the actions and the images of the captain that stand out -- at least for me. The image of a man who for many, if not legally but certainly at least morally, is responsible for his passengers, seemingly putting himself before everyone else.","Images of captain's rescue adds to anger in South Korea over ferry tragedy .

"Three weeks ago, I had the privilege of visiting our civilian leaders and military commanders, as well as our troops, in Afghanistan. It was my fourth trip to the country and a vastly different one than my first visit in 2007. Flying over Kabul at night, I was struck by the changes: Electric lights and even traffic are visible throughout the valley. I was encouraged by what I saw and by what I heard from Ambassador James Cunningham and General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr. The Afghans are taking the lead for their own security, and now they are poised to successfully transition to a new government for the first time in their history. After 13 years, I am often asked why Afghanistan still matters. The world is growing more complicated by the day, and, in my view, more dangerous. The responsibility is on leaders in Washington to remind the American people why finishing the job right in Afghanistan remains important. The explanation is straightforward: Not only was it the location from which the 9/11 attack that killed 3,000 Americans was planned, but the country also remains uniquely vulnerable to becoming a terrorist stronghold again if we don't complete our work to empower the Afghan people, security forces and government to protect their own country. Our mission quite simply is to prevent another terrorist attack. And, there's another reason we don't talk about much, but it remains equally important. Both friends and foes are watching to see whether America has the resolve to complete its task or if we will fall short of our mark out of fatigue or political expediency. This has ramifications not just for Afghanistan but other critical areas where America has strategic national security interests. Make no mistake, Afghanistan remains a tough fight. The progress has been significant, but the country will continue to have setbacks. Violence, like the recent tragic shooting at a Kabul hospital, is going to continue. Terrorist organizations will continue to attempt high-profile attacks to break our resolve. But because of the courage and sacrifices of our deployed men and women, both military and civilian, I am optimistic that we can achieve our mission successfully if Washington doesn't squander this progress. At the time of my visit, I said that I hoped Washington and Kabul would always be worthy of the shared sacrifice and effort that our troops, the international community, and the Afghan people have made. The biggest takeaway from my visit is that of all the challenges facing our strategy for Afghanistan, the most potentially damaging and completely avoidable is quitting just short of the goal line. It's essential that we do not repeat the same mistakes in Afghanistan that we made in Iraq. Before the end of this year, the Obama administration must reach a bilateral security agreement with the Afghan government that reinforces our commitment to the Afghan people and its security forces. With input from our commanders on the ground, this will likely require retaining a credible, residual troop presence to help continue to thwart terrorist networks as well as provide appropriate levels of training and advice to the Afghan security forces as they continue to grow and mature into an effective, independent fighting force. As a former small business man, I like an analogy I heard on our efforts to train and assist the Afghan Security Forces: we've helped them open for business, and now we need to ensure they have the processes and logistics in place to stay in business. Our military has a clear, understandable plan to put themselves out of business at the end of this process. There is a shared, bipartisan legacy in Washington for Afghanistan. I am convinced history will judge both the executive branch and the legislative branch not on whether we ended wars, but how we ended them. It is increasingly apparent that the United States left Iraq too soon, and it is with heavy hearts that we see the black flags flying in areas of Iraq where the United States expended our most precious treasure, the blood of our fellow citizens. We cannot let that happen in Afghanistan. A bilateral security agreement is critical if we're going to successfully complete the work that has been accomplished to date and to help ensure that the gains we have made are not jeopardized like they have been in Iraq. America's foes, both state and non-state actors, are watching with great interest how we leave Afghanistan, watching to see whether we leave after securing our interests and honoring our commitments, or if we just leave. And over the last year, our commander-in-chief has often talked more about leaving Afghanistan than how we are going to achieve our mission. We all want to bring our remaining troops home as soon as possible, but succeeding in Afghanistan is vital to our national security interests and it must take priority over any calendar dates. The President has an obligation to better make that case to the American people. And if he does, I will support him. For more than a decade, our troops and civilian personnel have fought to bring peace and security to Afghanistan -- and to ensure it can never again be used as a safe haven for terrorists to attack the United States. Many Americans have sacrificed to secure these goals, and far too many have lost their lives or suffered life-altering wounds. Washington and Kabul must work together to secure the gains we have made together and complete our mission.

"(CNN) -- Twin brothers David and Jason Benham have lost their opportunity to host their own HGTV show. The brothers ran afoul of the network after the site Right Wing Watch published a post about the pair, labeling David Benham as an ""anti-gay, anti-choice extremist"" for reportedly leading a prayer rally in 2012 outside of the Democratic National Convention held in Charlotte, North Carolina. The site posted a recording of Benham talking to a talk show host about ""homosexuality and its agenda that is attacking the nation"" and ""demonic ideologies"" taking hold in colleges and public schools. Benham also discusses the fight for North Carolina's Amendment One, which involved a ban on same-sex marriage and civil unions in the state constitution. The Benham brothers were the planned stars of the HGTV show ""Flip It Forward,"" set to premiere in October, in which they would have helped families purchase homes they otherwise could not afford. An April press release described the planned show this way: ""After a decade of flipping houses for profit, brothers David Benham and Jason Benham now help families buy the homes they never thought they could afford. In each episode, the guys help a deserving family find a fixer-upper and transform it into their forever home -- with a healthy dose of sibling rivalry between the brothers along the way."" But after the post went public, HGTV tweeted, ""HGTV has decided not to move forward with the Benham Brothers' series."" Thursday night, Jason Benham told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that HGTV had vetted the pair. ""When they -- a year and a half ago -- saw some of the footage where my brother was saying the things he was saying, they spoke with us. ""They got to know us a little better and then they made a judgment call, recognizing that David and I have no hate in our heart for anyone. ""We've been running a successful real estate company for the last 11 years and we help all people. There is no discrimination,"" said Jason Benham. His comments were echoed by his brother. ""We love all people. I love homosexuals. I love Islam, Muslims, and my brother and I would never discriminate. Never have we -- never would we,"" said David Benham. ""Never have I ever spoken against homosexuals, as individuals, and gone against them. I speak about an agenda. And that's really what the point of this is -- is that there is an agenda that is seeking to silence the voices of men and women of faith,"" he added. The brothers believe HGTV was bullied into its decision because of the media firestorm. ""It was too much for them to bear and they had to make a business decision,"" David Benham said. Earlier, the brothers released a statement: . ""The first and last thought on our minds as we begin and end each day is: have we shined Christ's light today? Our faith is the fundamental calling in our lives, and the centerpiece of who we are. As Christians we are called to love our fellow man. Anyone who suggests that we hate homosexuals or people of other faiths is either misinformed or lying. ""Over the last decade, we've sold thousands of homes with the guiding principle of producing value and breathing life into each family that has crossed our path, and we do not, nor will we ever discriminate against people who do not share our views. ""We were saddened to hear HGTV's decision. With all of the grotesque things that can be seen and heard on television today you would think there would be room for two twin brothers who are faithful to our families, committed to biblical principles, and dedicated professionals. If our faith costs us a television show then so be it."" There is also a YouTube video of David Benham speaking at a ""celebration"" of a closing of an abortion clinic in 2013. Website GlobalFlare.com, which emphasizes ""positive news and entertainment,"" called it a ""smear campaign"" against the brothers.

"As Venezuelan opposition leaders push for demonstrators to stay in the streets, ""he who tires, loses"" is their mantra. Lilian Tintori de Lopez, the wife of jailed Venezuelan opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, held up a T-shirt showing the phrase before protesters Monday. Beside her, opposition leader Henrique Capriles called for demonstrators to keep demanding change from the South American country's government and described President Nicolas Maduro as ""an error in the history of the country."" Outrage at soaring crime and a tanking economy triggered protests earlier this month. Tintori called for a new demonstration Wednesday, asking women to march silently in peaceful protest, wearing white and carrying white flowers for each of their children, ""for the future of our children and grandchildren."" On their arms, she told them to wear black bands, ""because we are in mourning for all those who have fallen in recent days."" Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz said Monday that 13 people have died and at least 147 people have been injured in clashes since protests began. Forty-five people detained during demonstrations remain behind bars; nine of them are government forces, she said. Opposition leaders and government officials blame each other for the unrest, and both sides show no sign of backing down. In a nationally televised government meeting, Maduro said he was convening a peace conference on Wednesday for mayors, governors and leading lawmakers to sign a deal renouncing violence. As anti-government demonstrators barricaded streets and tried to maintain their momentum, supporters also rallied behind Maduro on Monday. Pro-government motorcycle clubs were the latest core group to show public support for Maduro, who insists the opposition is trying to stage a U.S.-funded coup attempt. Some opposition protesters have accused bands of pro-government motorcyclists of fueling violence during demonstrations. Maduro called on the crowd Monday to help protect peace in the country and exercise ""maximum self control."" ""Do not fall for provocations and prepare yourselves,"" Maduro said. ""We are facing a massive plan. ... We have to be prepared every day to defeat the continuous fascist coup.""","Venezuelan opposition protesters push to maintain momentum .

"The day before he was found dead in a Manhattan apartment, actor Philip Seymour Hoffman went to his favorite coffee shop for a four-shot espresso.

But some of those who interacted with Hoffman during the day Saturday paint a different picture. Call him Phil . The mother of his children said he appeared high. A passerby who stopped to say hi to him said the actor appeared ""out of it."" In New York's Greenwich Village neighborhood, where Hoffman lived, it was common to see him riding a bicycle and walking his children to the public school they attended. Now, police are trying to piece together the actor's movements last weekend as they look for anyone who might be linked to the drugs that apparently killed him. Here's a timeline of what has emerged about Hoffman's final hours before the discovery of his body Sunday. Saturday morning -- Hoffman stops in at Chocolate Bar on 8th Avenue for his regular order: a four-shot espresso over ice with a splash of milk.  He is alone and chats with members of staff.  ""He seemed perfectly fine,"" manager Jonathan Hanson tells CNN. ""He seemed in good spirits. He was very happy."" Suspected heroin found in apartment . Around 1:30 p.m. --  Hoffman's assistant speaks to him on the phone. She also thought he seemed fine, she tells police. The assistant says she had visited him at his rented apartment Friday and noticed nothing out of the ordinary then, either. 2 p.m. -- The first hint that something is amiss. Mimi O'Donnell, Hoffman's ex-partner and mother of their three children, sees him near his apartment. She later tells authorities she thought he appeared to be high, law enforcement sources say. 5 p.m. -- Hoffman is spotted walking along Greenwich Street by Paul Pabst, executive producer of the syndicated ""Dan Patrick Show."" Pabst is with his wife and his sister, who plucks up the courage to say hi to Hoffman. The actor -- bundled up in ""a big, puffy coat"" -- appears surprised a stranger recognized him, Pabst says on his show.  But he still responds, giving Pabst's sister ""a half high-five"" before continuing on his way. Pabst says his sister remarks that Hoffman seemed ""out of it."" Heroin's rise and fatal draw . Saturday evening -- Hoffman has dinner with two companions at Automatic Slims, a restaurant and bar in the West Village that he frequently visited. It is a short meal, at which Hoffman has a cheeseburger and drinks a cranberry and soda. A bartender at the restaurant, on Washington Street, tells CNN it appeared to be a business dinner. Around 8 p.m. -- O'Donnell talks to Hoffman on the phone. He again seems to be high, she later tells authorities. After their conversation, no other contact with Hoffman has so far been confirmed. Between 8 and 9 p.m. -- Hoffman withdraws a total of $1,200 from an automated teller machine in six transactions at a supermarket near his West Village home, two law enforcement sources say, citing bank records. A witness told investigators that he saw Hoffman withdrawing money around 8 p.m. at the supermarket while talking to two men who were wearing messenger bags, the officials said. Sunday, 9 a.m. -- Hoffman fails to show up at O'Donnell's home in the West Village to pick up his three children. His no-show causes concern. Hoffman interviewed in January . 11 a.m. -- O'Donnell asks a Hoffman friend, playwright David Katz, to check on the actor. Katz and another person subsequently go to the fourth-floor apartment, where they find him dead, lying on the bathroom floor with a syringe in his left arm. He is wearing shorts and a T-shirt, his eyeglasses still resting on his head, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the inquiry. Around 11:30 a.m. -- Police are called. They arrive at the apartment shortly afterward. O'Donnell is told what has happened. She quickly picks up their son from the playground and brings him home. The aftermath -- Investigators discover close to 50 envelopes of what they believe is heroin in the apartment where Hoffman is found, the law enforcement sources say. They find used syringes, prescription drugs and empty bags that authorities suspect are used to hold heroin, the sources tell CNN. After the discovery of Hoffman's body, word of his death spreads through the neighborhood. Friends bring flowers and cards in remembrance. The Oscar-winning actor was 46.","Hoffman withdrew $1,200 from a supermarket ATM, law enforcement officials say .

"Journeying by day through Borno state is a tense, nervy experience. But for some, nightfall in this part of northeastern Nigeria has become truly frightening with the threat from Boko Haram seemingly everywhere. This state has been a springboard for a wave of indiscriminate bombings, kidnappings and assassinations perpetrated by this exceptionally violent militant Islamist group whose name translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. Yet it wasn't until recently, when hundreds of schoolgirls were snatched at gunpoint from a boarding school as they slept in their beds, that this brutal insurgency really grabbed the world's attention. The terrifying and audacious nature of this raid in the dead of night under a hail of gunfire and explosions sent shock waves far beyond Nigeria's borders. When a CNN crew made the perilous journey to Chibok almost a month after the girls' abduction, they discovered the attack had left an indelible mark on this community. Locals described fearing the onset of nightfall when they felt most vulnerable, most abandoned by the outside world. Police fled . Before their village was stormed, some residents claimed friends and relatives in surrounding towns had warned them the feared extremists were on their way in a convoy of cargo trucks, pickups and motorcycles. They said they reported this to local authorities that night. The police, they said, called for reinforcements but none came. Everyone, including the police, fled into the bush, leaving the girls asleep in their dorms. The gunmen overpowered the school's guards and herded the girls onto the waiting trucks. The trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon, a stronghold for the terror group. Authorities do not know where the girls are being held. ""It was horrific, it happened in the night, it was very dark. But the sound of gunshots, explosions everywhere,"" recalled Daniel Muvia, who witnessed the attack firsthand with his family. ""We had to run away from our homes. We had to run into the bushes for our lives.  Fear is all over. Fear is everywhere."" The memory of that horrifying night on April 14 and the fear of further attacks like it has forced men like Muvia to take matters into their own hands. Armed only with machetes, homemade bow and arrows and any other improvised weapons they can find, the community's men come together each evening to patrol their village. Their nightly vigil consists of a cautious walk around their village, led by the thin light from their small torches. Occasionally they'll improvise a road block by dragging a tree on to the dirt track to block vehicles. It's a pitiful defense against the heavily-armed militants, but they hope and pray they can protect their sleeping families against further violence and destruction. Resilience . But fear is gradually giving way to resilience here, as Chibok's residents grow tired of waiting for outside help to arrive. Nigeria's government has been forced to defend its response to the crisis, with President Goodluck Jonathan roundly criticized for waiting three weeks to speak to the nation about efforts to find and free the girls. And the military's campaign to subdue Boko Haram has had little success since a state of emergency was declared in Nigeria's north a year ago this month. During the day, Chibok returns to something like normality with its vibrant market a focal point. But the physical scars from April's attack are brought sharply into focus once again -- the burned-out shell of the girls' school stands as a reminder of the scale of the destruction that fateful night.","Night abduction by Boko Haram of school girls from Nigerian village shocked world .

"In a move disavowed by the Libyan government, a retired military general led Libyan troops and other forces loyal to him in a deadly attack Friday against Islamist militants in and around the eastern city of Benghazi, Libyan media reported. At least 12 people were killed and 91 others were injured in clashes around the country's second-largest city, Libyan state news agency LANA said Friday, citing local hospitals. Retired Libyan Gen. Khalifa Haftar, who participated in the 2011 rebellion that ousted dictator Moammar Gadhafi, launched the attack that supporters said was an attempt to clear the city of extremist groups, CNN affiliate Libya Awalan TV reported. The Libyan government and the military command in Tripoli reacted with alarm, saying that they didn't order the attack, and that the operation -- which they conceded included some Libyan soldiers -- amounted to a ""coup."" That such a force could mount an attack without the government's blessing underscores the difficulty that Tripoli -- more than 400 miles to the west -- has had in trying to influence a dire situation in Benghazi, where Islamist groups have been blamed for near daily assassinations, bombings and kidnappings against security forces. A Libyan air force plane and 120 military vehicles took part in the unauthorized operation against the militants, acting Prime Minister Abduallah al-Thinni said on Libyan state-run TV. Residents of Benghazi, meanwhile, told CNN that they saw more than one military plane overhead Friday. It wasn't clear how many of the operation's fighters were members of the North African country's military. ""Their movements are against military orders issued by the legitimate authorities,"" al-Thinni said, adding that he felt the move undermined government-sanctioned efforts to fight militants in Benghazi. Haftar led the operation, Libyan army Chief of Staff Abdul Salam Jad said, describing the attack as an ""attempted coup on legitimacy,"" according to Libya's official LANA news agency. Retired general had promised action . Haftar was a commander under Gadhafi before the general defected in the 1980s. Haftar was in exile in the United States until he returned for the 2011 rebellion. In recent months, Haftar toured cities in eastern Libya, promising some kind of military offensive to purge Benghazi -- the cradle of the 2011 revolution against Gadhafi -- of Islamist extremist groups. Haftar's overtures came amid rising frustration in Benghazi that Tripoli hasn't been able to staunch radical Islamist militant groups' presence and influence, which has been rising since the revolution. Residents and officials have blamed the violence that has gripped Benghazi on groups including Ansar al Sharia. The United States designated that group a terrorist organization this year, and has accused it of being involved in the 2012 attack that killed four Americans -- including Ambassador Christopher Stevens -- at a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. Official Libyan security forces have struggled to deal with hostile militias, so the government has relied on other militias, many on the state's payroll, in an attempt to enhance security. But various other political forces also have relied on militias, leaving the country awash in armed groups -- many who refused to disband after the revolution -- with competing agendas and loyalties. Al-Thinni called on government-sanctioned militias Friday to ""practice self-restraint"" and keep abiding by the Army's orders, . ""The government calls on the people in the capital of the revolution, Benghazi, to be calm and (to) support the legitimacy of the ... revolution and its police and army,"" al-Thinni said on state TV. Algeria temporarily closes embassy in Tripoli, citing unspecified threats . Meanwhile, Algeria temporarily closed its embassy and consulate in Libya's capital due to a ""real and imminent threat"" against its diplomats and consular staff in Libya, the Algerian Foreign Ministry said Friday, according to Algerian state-run news agency Algerie Presse Service. The ministry described the move in Tripoli as an ""urgent and protective measure in coordination with Libyan authorities after receiving confirmed information about a real threat against our diplomats and consular staff,"" according to APS. Libyan government officials were not immediately available for comment.","Libyan media: Retired Gen. Khalifa Haftar leads offensive against Benghazi militants .

"Same-sex marriage in France came one step closer to legality Tuesday, as lawmakers in the lower house of parliament approved a controversial bill that would extend the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples. The measure was voted through in the National Assembly by 329 in favor to 229 against, with 10 deputies abstaining. The bill must still go before the senate before it becomes law. If passed, it would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. France is not the only nation currently wrestling with the polarizing issue of same-sex marriage. UK lawmakers took a big step last week toward legalizing same-sex marriage when they approved the second reading of a bill in the House of Commons. But while a significant number of MPs back the legislation, which is supported by Prime Minister David Cameron, the move has prompted widespread rebellion within Cameron's Conservative Party. The bill must go through several more stages before it can become law. The Church of England is among the religious bodies opposed to the UK legislation. In the United States, where President Barack Obama has voiced his personal support for same-sex marriage, it has been legalized in nine states and the District of Columbia -- but many people remain vehemently opposed. Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples in France was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. Opinion: Why the fuss about gay marriage? The National Assembly, which is dominated by Hollande's Socialist Party, was expected to pass the bill Tuesday, having approved the most important article of the law with a wide majority earlier this month. The left also controls the Senate. But the plan faces stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and social conservatives, with huge numbers turning out for protest marches in Paris in recent weeks. Another big rally against the law is planned for next month. Cardinal Andre Vingt-Trois, the archbishop of Paris, voiced his opposition at a meeting of French bishops in Lourdes last year. Same-sex marriage around the world . Opening up marriage to same-sex couples ""would be a transformation of marriage that would affect everyone,"" he said. At the same time, failing to recognize gender difference within marriage and the family would be a ""deceit"" that would rock the foundations of society and lead to discrimination between children, he said. Other religious groups, including Muslims, Jews and Buddhists, have also expressed their concern over the draft bill, and many lawmakers and hundreds of mayors are against the legislation. The legislation has won wide backing from gay rights advocates, however. The French gay, lesbian and transgender rights group Inter-LGBT has said the law, if passed, ""would be a major advance for our country in terms of equality of rights."" Lawmakers have a ""unique opportunity"" to put an end to outdated discrimination, the group said in a statement. ""The law must allow all couples to unite themselves as they wish and must protect all families, without discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity,"" it said. A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS (pacte civil de solidarite), the civil union agreement can be entered into by gay or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage. Opinion: Gay rights in France -- How even the U.S. leads the way . Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Spain, South Africa and Norway are among nearly a dozen countries that allow same-sex marriages. Polls show the U.S. public has gradually become more accepting of the idea, with more Americans in favor in 2013 than opposed, according to Pew. Nonetheless, 30 states have passed constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage, according to the Pew Research Center. The issue has also divided Australia, where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed ""support marriage equality."" According to a report released in May 2011 by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, same-sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries, and in five of those countries, the death penalty can be applied to those who violate the laws.","France's lower house of parliament approves the bill 329 to 229 .

"Idaho became the latest state Tuesday in which a federal judge declared its ban on gay marriage to be unconstitutional, delivering yet another victory for same-sex proponents -- albeit not necessarily a definitive one. U.S. Magistrate Judge Candy Wagahoff Dale issued her sweeping opinion knocking down Idaho state laws and a state constitutional amendment, passed in 2006, as failing to live up to the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee no ""state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" ""Idaho's marriage laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens the fundamental right to marry and relegate their families to a stigmatized, second-class status without sufficient reason for doing so,"" Dale wrote. ""These laws do not withstand any applicable level of constitutional scrutiny."" The judge's order takes effect at 9 a.m. Friday. It was not immediately known if state authorities in Idaho, who have been fighting to keep in place the law restricting marriage as being between a man and a woman, will appeal this decision. That's what has happened in several other states, in which federal judges overturned state same-sex marriage bans only to have those decisions stayed on appeal. A federal appeals court last month heard challenges to same-sex marriage bans in Utah and Oklahoma. Appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar challenges over current bans in Nevada, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan. The three judges on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard related arguments Tuesday. Their final decision could affect Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Maryland, the latter being the only one of the five with legalized same-sex marriage. After that, the Supreme Court could then weigh in. And late last week in Arkansas, Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza declared the state's voter-approved gay marriage ban to violate the Arkansas constitution. The plaintiffs in the Idaho case included four same-sex couples. They included two of whom married in others states and wanted their unions recognized in Idaho, and two of whom had children born while they were a couple. Among other opinions, Dale shot down Idaho authorities' argument that limiting marriage to a man and a woman is in children's best interests. For example, the judge says there's nothing preventing heterosexual couples from marrying simply for a tax break, or stopping them from marrying because they can't or don't want to have children or are ""non-optimal parents."" Furthermore, the judge said, those children who have gay or lesbian parents might pay the price, emotionally and otherwise, under the state ban. ""Idaho's marriage laws fail to advance the state's interest because they withhold legal, financial and social benefits from the very group they purportedly protect -- children,"" Dale wrote. The judge also described the state's contention that gay marriage should be banned in the name of ""religious liberty"" to be ""myopic."" ""No doubt many faiths around the world and in Idaho have longstanding traditions of man-woman marriage rooted in scripture,"" Dale said. ""But not all religions share the view that opposite-sex marriage is a theological imperative."" Even if a majority of people in Idaho oppose same-sex marriage, that doesn't mean their opinion should equate to law, according to the judge. She stated: ""This case asks a basic and enduring question about the essence of American government: Whether the will of the majority, based as it often is on sincere beliefs and democratic consensus, may trump the rights of a minority.""

"Just in case you thought you had time to catch your breath from the culture wars, the issue of marriage for gay couples is back at the  ballot box this year. On Tuesday, North Carolinians voted 61% to 39% to ban all forms of relationship recognition for same-sex couples. That's right, this amendment doesn't just prohibit gay marriage, it prevents the existence of civil unions and domestic partnerships under North Carolina's Constitution. Shockingly, the state's Republican House speaker, Thom Tillis, who was largely responsible for putting the measure on the ballot, called the anti-gay marriage initiative a generational issue and predicted that while the initiative would probably pass, it would also be repealed within 20 years. Even for most of the GOP's old-school legislators, there is dawning understanding that opposition to freedom to marry is on the wrong side of history and damaging to the long-term, and increasingly the short-term, prospects of the GOP, especially among independent-minded younger voters. Indeed, according to Gallup, 70% of people between the ages of 18 and 34 believe that same-sex marriage should be legal. Vote means uncertainty for North Carolina's same sex couples . In November, residents of four more states -- Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington -- will voice their views on same-sex marriage at the ballot box. Voters in Minnesota will consider a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and in Maryland and Washington, they will probably face measures to undo new laws legalizing same-sex marriage passed by state legislatures. Maine will, for the first time in history, have the chance to vote ""yes"" for a freedom to marry law. Unlike in previous years, polling shows that advocates of the freedom to marry stand a good chance to win some of these battles -- and the potential losses they would face are by much smaller margins than Americans witnessed even five years ago. While the reigning stereotype is that Republicans are opposed to gay rights, growing Republican support in state-by-state fights belies this perception. Indeed, in New Hampshire and New York, Republicans were critical to recent marriage freedom victories. And Republicans will play key supportive roles in November at the ballot box. There are tectonic shifts happening just beneath the surface within the Republican Party that haven't percolated to the national dialogue on gay rights. Efforts to support gay rights by GOP state legislators in several states are real and indicative of an increasing realization that expanding equal opportunity and freedom to gay Americans shouldn't be a partisan issue. Most recently, a stunning victory occurred in New Hampshire, where anti-gay forces sought to roll back the freedom to marry.  After Republicans gained three-quarters supermajorities in both chambers in the 2010 elections, the National Organization for Marriage, the chief organization opposing same-sex marriage, proclaimed it was ""confident of victory"" and would show ""that history is not unidirectional"" on the issue. Unfortunately for them, New Hampshire Republicans who believed in the state's ""live free or die"" motto were quick to build a powerful campaign and harness the two-thirds of the public who opposed taking freedoms away and downgrading people's families.  They mobilized hundreds of civic and business leaders and thousands of citizens to make their voices heard. Not only did the Republican-controlled New Hampshire House defeat the repeal bill, it did so by a lopsided 211-116 margin. The most overlooked fact: A substantial group of Republican legislators, 109 to be exact, voted to preserve the freedom to marry in the Granite State. Despite the best efforts of the National Organization for Marriage, history is unidirectional on the issue, and the freedom to marry is a settled issue in New Hampshire. The trend toward greater acceptance is clear, irrefutable and happening on both sides of the aisle. To date, 197 Republican state legislators across the nation have stood up for the freedom to marry -- and have lived to tell the tale.  Republicans put the bill on the New York state Senate floor and provided the votes needed to make same-sex marriage a reality, making it the first GOP-controlled legislative chamber in America to do so. The state senators who courageously voted for marriage risked primary opposition from anti-marriage forces but are now garnering wide support. They are well-positioned to fight single-issue attacks while running campaigns and building records of public service that respond to the core priorities of their constituents: less government, lower taxes, individual autonomy and personal responsibility. (In the interest of full disclosure, as a New York resident, I personally advocated for the passage of freedom to marry in Albany last summer.) A few years ago profiles in courage like these seemed to come in ones and twos. Today, they are occurring frequently.  A growing number of Republican legislators are choosing to stand on the side of freedom because they have gay and lesbian people in their lives who they care about. They've done so because the politics has shifted dramatically, taking the peril out of following one's conscience.  They've done so because they believe, like so many of us, that marriage is the most powerful social institution on Earth, integral to strengthening our society because it is rooted in the traditional values that strengthen our families and communities: the values of love, commitment and sacrifice. To be sure, there's a long way to go before the Republican Party fully embraces these values and is consistent about being the party of individual freedom, but I'm glad to see more and more of my fellow Republicans on the right side of history.","North Carolina approved measure banning same-sex marriage, domestic unions .

"Nigerians took to the streets Thursday  to demand the government do more to rescue scores of girls abducted by militants more than two weeks ago. Militants seized about 230 girls in the dead of the night at a high school in the nation's far northeast, a hotbed for Islamist group Boko Haram. Armed men herded the girls out of bed and forced them into trucks on April 14 in the town of Chibok. The convoy of trucks then disappeared into the dense forest bordering Cameroon. Roughly 200 girls are still missing, although the authorities and parents differ on the number. Nigerians have rallied for days to criticize the government's handling of the rescue efforts. Hundreds wept and chanted ""bring back our girls"" during protests in the capital of Abuja on Wednesday.  A day later,  protesters gathered in Lagos. Shortly after the abductions last month, frustrated Chibok residents went into the forest in motorbikes to search for the girls. During their nine-hour  trek, they never saw a single soldier in the forest where authorities believe the militants took the girls, said Enoch Mark, whose daughter and two nieces were among the kidnapped. ""A total of 230 parents registered the names of their daughters who were missing on the day of the kidnap,"" said Asabe Kwambura, principal of the Government Girls Secondary School.  ""From my records, 43 girls have so far escaped on their own from their kidnappers. We still have 187 girls missing."" Boko Haram still holding Nigerian school girls captive . Angry relatives . In Chibok, angry parents accused authorities of playing politics with the lives of their children. Witnesses have seen militants in dozens of vehicles headed to nearby Cameroon, said Ayuba Alamson, whose two nieces were among the kidnapped. In a statement Thursday, Nigeria's Defense Ministry said it's committed to the search. ""A lot of information has been received in the efforts at securing the freedom of the girls. The armed forces assures all Nigerians that it will continue to appraise every information received during this operation accordingly,"" it said. . ""While it will not relent in its efforts in this search, the armed forces is mindful of the fact  that some of the information with which it has been inundated are actually a ploy to distract it from its goal of dealing with terrorism and other violent crimes aimed at crippling the nation."" What is Boko Haram? Borno state Education Commissioner Musa Inuwa Kubo similarly said that the government and military are doing whatever it takes to secure their release. ""This is a delicate situation that requires careful handling,"" Kubo said. ""When you have heavily armed men holding close to 200 girls hostage, you have to be very careful in your approach so as not to risk the safety of these girls you want to rescue. He said authorities are withholding information for safety reasons. ""It is a security issue and we just can't be divulging all the efforts we are making to get these girls freed,"" the education commissioner said. Why terror group kidnaps schoolgirls, and what happens next . #BringBackOurGirls . But angry Nigerians said authorities are not doing enough. They took to social media using hashtags #BringBackOurGirls and #BringBackOurDaughters to demand more from the government.

""If you're not safe anywhere in the world, you should be safe in your house, in your own back yard. We mandate the federal government to bring back our daughters, and our children,"" he said. Boko Haram's name translates to ""Western education is a sin"" in the local language. The group especially opposes the education of women. Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write.

"A Western Kentucky University professor is ""broken"" but alive after surviving a 70-foot fall into a crevasse while climbing in Nepal. John All said he managed to make it out and to his tent, where he was picked up by a helicopter. ""It probably took me four or five hours to climb out. I kept moving sideways, slightly up, sideways, slightly up, until I found an area where there was enough hard snow that I could get an ax in and pull myself up and over,"" he told HLN's ""RightThisMinute"" on Thursday. ""I knew that if I fell at any time in that entire four or five hours, I, of course, was going to fall all the way to the bottom of the crevasse. Any mistake, or any sort of rest or anything, I was going to die."" All fell into the crevasse Monday while conducting climate research on Mount Himlung in the Himalayas. He shot a short video immediately after the fall. In it, All's voice rises and falls with pain as drops of his blood speckle the white snow. He scans to the top of the crevasse, a narrow hole of light, and to its bottom, a seemingly bottomless pit. A ledge had stopped his fall. ""Biggest problem was, because my ribs were so broken in my right side, I had to do everything with just my right foot, but not the upper part of my right leg, and my left leg, and then my left arm,"" he said. After he managed to make his way out of the crevasse, All said he rolled as much as he walked back to the tent. There, he called for a helicopter, which arrived within 16 to 18 hours, said All, who was alone when he fell. ""If somebody else had been with me, we both would have died. There's no question. Because I would have fallen in the crevasse, they would have fallen on top of me, and we would have killed each other,"" he said. According to the crisis response firm that rescued All, he was flown to Kathmandu and transferred to a hospital there. Global Rescue said it was alerted to his situation via satellite text message relayed over the Internet. Asked by HLN how he is feeling, All replied ""I am broken.""

"A series of al Qaeda-based threats to attack American and Western targets in Europe, as well as threats to launch attacks inside the United States, has caused significant concern inside the U.S. intelligence community, CNN has learned. Officials are trying to determine the extent to which the threats may be linked and determine what it may mean about the strength of al Qaeda in several countries. While the ""threat stream"" has evolved during the past six months, according to a senior U.S. official, none of the threats has been corroborated. The official said the threats appear to detail ""a lot of activity where intelligence suggests there are operational cells,"" but so far, ""we do not see operational cells of al Qaeda inside the United States,"" the official said, although he emphasized it could not be ruled out. U.S. officials as well as analysts have long said they believe al Qaeda is focused on attacking outside the United States because of the difficulty in penetrating U.S. homeland security. But these latest threat streams suggest domestic U.S. targets also continue to be looked at by al Qaeda. Worry No. 1: Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula . One of the biggest concerns right now remains efforts by Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to attack inside Yemen, in Europe and inside the United States. The U.S. Embassy, which was closed several weeks ago, is now expected to remain closed for several more days because of a ""credible threat stream,"" a second senior U.S. official told CNN. While it's believed AQAP is mainly focused on targeting inside of Yemen, officials say an attempt to attack inside the United States or to recruit others to carry out such an attack cannot be ruled out. Worry No. 2: Core group in Pakistan . Separately, still another official confirms to CNN that the core al Qaeda group in Pakistan is also seeking to place operatives in places to attack U.S. targets overseas and domestically. U.S. officials confirm an operative who uses the code name Abdullah al-Shami, who is living in Pakistan, may now be heading that group's efforts to plan external attacks. The New York Times first published al-Shami's name in February and noted that U.S. intelligence believes he was born in the United States but moved to the Middle East as a child. The New York Times reported that as an American-born citizen, al-Shami could be a target for attack by a U.S. drone. U.S. officials refused to comment, but a private sector analyst who has followed the matter in detail told CNN that killing al-Shami had been discussed in the past.

Worry No. 3: Spillover effects from Syria . The third threat stream continues to come from Syria. U.S. officials tell CNN they believe 70 or more Americans have traveled to Syria to fight, and many may have returned home along with other fighters with Western passports.

Earlier this month, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on an alleged al Qaeda operative, Abd Al-Rahman Muhammad Zafir Al-Dubaysi Al-Juhni. Treasury said that in 2013, he was part of a group of senior al-Qaeda members in Syria formed to conduct external operations against Western targets.

"Thinking about making a film? Better leave out the foul language if you want it to be seen in Russia. The same goes for plays. Even rock stars will need to leave their potty mouths at home. Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off on a new law Monday that bans swearing at arts, cultural and entertainment events in the country. Any new film containing obscene language won't be granted a distribution certificate, so there's no chance of seeing it at the movie theater. And copies of books, CDs or films containing swearing can only be distributed in a sealed package labeled ""Contains obscene language,"" a Kremlin statement said. According to state news agency ITAR-Tass, individuals caught using foul language face a fine of up to $70, while officials can be fined up to $40 and businesses nearly $1,400. They face a higher fine and a three-month suspension of business for repeated offenses. Determination of what counts as profane language will be done through ""an independent examination,"" the news agency said. According to the Kremlin, the legislation ""bans the use of obscene language when ensuring the rights of Russian citizens to the use of the state language, and protecting and developing language culture."" The law could come into effect as soon as July 1, ITAR-Tass said, but it doesn't apply to cultural and artistic works  that have already been issued. While some may hail attempts to clean up the nation's language, it will likely be seen by critics as the latest step under Putin's leadership to limit freedom of expression and promote a conservative, nationalist viewpoint. A report by rights group Amnesty International in January highlighted a denial of ""basic freedoms"" in Russia, which last year introduced a law barring anyone from talking positively about homosexuality in earshot of minors.

"It's been a big week for dinosaurs. With ""Godzilla"" still rampaging at the box office, Facebook also rolled out some privacy changes along with a friendly blue dino to help explain them all. In addition to making settings for all new users default to ""Friends Only,"" Facebook announced Thursday it will prompt existing users to review their privacy settings. Your new guide to the intricacies of controlling your personal info on the world's biggest social platform?

You haven't changed who can see your post lately, so we just wanted to make sure you're sharing this post with the right audience."" Fair enough. It's part of an effort that Facebook has been undertaking for months to clarify and tighten privacy settings, something critics have dinged the site for in the past. But why a dinosaur? ""Our team looked at a few different characters, saw the dinosaur, and just thought he was the friendliest and best choice,"" said Raylene Yung, an engineering manager on Facebook's privacy team. ""Once we tried him out, we saw some great results and welcomed him to the team."" Dubbed the ""Zuckasaurus"" by The New York Times in a nod to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the (thankfully) un-Barney-like creature joins an ever-growing pantheon of tech mascots. From TiVo's smiley, leggy TV guy to Google Android's android, there has been no shortage of cutesy characters introduced by Web and tech companies to reinforce brand identity or help set themselves apart from the masses. As a species, they've provoked a wide variety of reactions. Some, like Reddit's beloved Snoo, the Twitter bird and the early Web's Ask Jeeves butler invoke warm feelings among users. Even Twitter's ""Fail Whale,"" which showed up years ago whenever the platform was over capacity, had its fans. Other mascots weren't so lucky. Clippy, Microsoft's talking paper clip, became one of the computing age's most mocked, if not reviled, characters. Early Windows users were forced to click him out of existence over and over again as he popped up to give advice of sometimes questionable value. Plus, he's a talking paper clip. Kind of creepy. Then-CEO Bill Gates retired Clippy in 2001, though he was brought back in 2011 for a Microsoft Office tutorial -- but only if users chose him. Then there was the Pets.com sock puppet. Amusing enough at first, the puppet's schtick had already started getting old by 2001, when the site went belly up, its once-ballyhooed stock worth a whopping 22 cents a share. Will Facebook's privacy dino catch on? Or will he (or she) be mocked into extinction? Only time will tell. On Twitter, some users Friday were calling the creature a ""safeasaur"" or a ""privasaurus."" The New York Times said the Zuckasaurus ""could suffer the cruel fate of other tech industry cartoon characters if Facebook slips on its promise to be more mindful of users' privacy.""

"It was billed as the day's marquee primary battle, but in the end it was an easy night for Mitch McConnell. The five-term senator from Kentucky -- who's the top Republican in the chamber -- defeated tea party-backed challenger Matt Bevin in Tuesday's primary. In Tuesday's other high-profile race, two Republican candidates in Georgia will face a July runoff for the U.S. Senate, CNN projects. According to numbers compiled by The Associated Press, McConnell led Bevin 60%-36% with 97% of precincts reporting. Bevin conceded, telling supporters that he had spoken with McConnell. That conversation was confirmed by aides to the incumbent. In his concession speech, Bevin didn't back McConnell, but he said he has no intention ""of supporting the Democratic platform over the Republican platform."" But Bevin appeared critical of McConnell and the groups that supported him, saying ""the attacks that we have been on the receiving end of have made our opposition smaller people. It has cheapened their accomplishments and it has weakened the foundation of their platform."" McConnell praised Bevin and made a pitch for reconciliation. ""Matt brought a lot of passion and tenacity to this race and he made me a stronger candidate. A tough race is behind, it's time to unite. To my opponent's supporters, I hope you'll join me in the months ahead and know that your fight is my fight,"" McConnell said. How McConnell crushed the tea party . Kentucky was one of six states holding primaries on Tuesday and again, anti-establishment candidates faced long odds in high-profile Republican showdowns. In Georgia, CNN projects Michelle Nunn will win the Democratic Senate primary, taking another step toward following in the footsteps of her father, Sam Nunn. On the Republican side, businessman David Perdue led the pack with 30% of the vote -- well below the 50% a candidate must get in order to avoid a runoff, according to numbers complied by The Associated Press. Perdue will face off against Rep. Jack Kingston, who came in second with just under 27% of the vote. The winner of the July runoff will go on to face Nunn in November to fill the seat of retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. In Oregon, CNN projects Sen. Jeff Merkley has won the Democratic primary, and pediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby is the projected winner of the GOP Senate primary. The two will face off in the general election in November. And in Idaho, CNN projects Rep. Mike Simpson has won the GOP primary in the state's 2nd Congressional District, turning back a challenge from tea party candidate Bryan Smith. 5 key primaries to watch Tuesday . While his primary battle ended up easier than originally expected, McConnell now faces a much tougher test against Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. CNN projected that Grimes would win her primary. A rising Democratic star, she faced no real opposition in her primary and already has had big names -- such as former President Bill Clinton -- team up with her on the campaign trail. Speaking to supporters who held up signs that read ""Obama needs Alison Grimes"" and ""Kentucky needs Mitch McConnell,"" the Senate majority leader tied his Democratic challenger to President Barack Obama and to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""My opponent is in this race because Barack Obama and Harry Reid want her to be in this race,"" said McConnell, adding that ""a vote for my opponent is a vote for Obamacare and the President who sold it to us on a mountain of lies."" Grimes, who spoke at her victory celebration just minutes after McConnell's speech ended, quickly fired back. ""I'm here to tell you tonight, my fellow Kentuckians, I am not an empty dress, I am not a rubber stamp and I am not a cheerleader. I am a strong, Kentucky woman who is an independent thinker who, when I'm Kentucky's next senator, the decisions I make will be what's best for the people of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, not partisan interests,"" Grimes declared. And she highlighted where she doesn't see eye-to-eye with Obama. ""I don't agree with the President's war on coal. I think it's wrong for Kentucky,"" Grimes said. Grimes connected to big donors, big hitters . Bevin, a businessman from Louisville, announced his primary challenge last summer, and quickly gained the support of tea party activists and some influential DC-based anti-establishment groups. The race between the two men quickly turned ugly, and expensive, as both campaigns and outside groups spent big bucks. Anti-establishment Republicans felt that McConnell represented everything wrong in Washington and thought he could be knocked off. The Senate Conservatives fund dished out $1 million in support of Bevin and against McConnell. But the group recently became very quiet, with McConnell's formidable lead in the public opinion polls. Large campaign war chest . But McConnell had a large campaign war chest, as well as the backing from two Kentucky-based super PACs, and such powerful national groups as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association. And McConnell ended his primary campaign by once again touting his endorsement from Kentucky's other Republican senator, Rand Paul, the one-time upstart who beat McConnell's pick in the 2010 GOP Senate primary in Kentucky. But the two quickly mended fences, and Paul, who is very influential among tea party activists and libertarians, backed McConnell last year before Bevin got into the race. Paul congratulated McConnell in a tweet. The narrator in one of McConnell's two closing statewide TV commercials says, ""On Tuesday, join with Rand Paul and vote for Mitch McConnell."" And the spot includes a clip of Paul saying last year that Kentucky ""ought to be proud of having Senator McConnell."" Earlier this year McConnell predicted big wins for incumbents facing primary challenges from the right, saying, ""I think we are going to crush them everywhere."" McConnell told the New York Times that when it came to tea party challenges, ""I don't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country."" His prediction might come true, as McConnell's defeat of Bevin was the latest in a string of victories for incumbent and more moderate Republicans over candidates backed by tea party activists and other grassroots and anti-establishment groups. Soon after the race in Kentucky was called for McConnell, two of the groups backing Bevin closed ranks behind the Senate minority leader. ""Now it's time for Republicans to unite for victory in November,"" said a statement from the Senate Conservatives Fund. And the Madison Project released a statement saying, ""We congratulate McConnell on winning the primary. We ask all Republicans to come together to defeat extremist Hollywood liberal Allison Lundergan Grimes this fall."" Now it's on to November's midterm elections, where Democrats -- who hold a 55-45 majority in the chamber (including two independents who caucus with the party -- are defending 21 of the 36 seats in play, with half of those Democratic-held seats in red or purple states. Key races to watch . The only states where the Democrats currently hope to play offense are Kentucky and Georgia. If the GOP flips six Democratic held seats, they'll will win control of the chamber, and McConnell will get a promotion from minority leader to majority leader. McConnell made a pitch for that promotion in his victory speech, saying "" we can take the reins of power away from Harry Reid and make this President accountable. Make me the majority leader and Kentucky will lead America."" A big question right now is whether Bevin and his supporters will rally around McConnell, or if they sit it out come November. In 2010, after Paul topped McConnell-backed candidate Trey Grayson, the minority leader was quick to bring all sides together at a unity rally. The battle ahead . The faceoff in Kentucky should continue to be heated, and expensive. When all's said and done, the race could become the most expensive Senate campaign in history, breaking the $82 million record set in the 2012 Senate battle in Massachusetts. Grimes, 35, is using classic campaign strategy against the 72-year-old longtime incumbent: it's time for change. ""We've had 30 years of failed leadership under Mitch McConnell; we cannot afford six more,"" Grimes declared emphatically to a packed house at her campaign headquarters here in Louisville on Monday. To counter that, McConnell is using a standard strategy for a longtime incumbent. He is trying to paint his seniority as a plus and warn Kentuckians about the perils of a junior senator with little clout in Washington representing them instead of a potential Senate majority leader. ""My opponent, I certainly agree, is a new face, but a new face for what? New face for the status quo. Same majority leader, same agenda, no change at all. A new face for no change at all,"" McConnell argues on the stump. But Grimes' full-throated assault on McConnell goes beyond a call for change. She is using McConnell's GOP leader status and his frequent moves to block legislation to make him the symbol of gridlock in Washington. Like Republicans all over the country, McConnell is trying hard to make this election a referendum on President Barack Obama, who lost Kentucky big in 2012 and is highly unpopular now. ""Do we want to go in a different direction, or do we want Harry Reid to continue to be the majority leader? Do we want a vote for Barack Obama in a state that he carried four out of 120 countries? That's what's really at stake in the fall election,"" McConnell told CNN Monday. And the pro-McConnell outside group Kentuckians for Strong Leadership said they would spend nearly $600,000 starting Wednesday to run a television commercial that ties Grimes to the President. The problem for McConnell is that he too has a high unfavorable ratings back home, and Democrats here are hoping that will be his ultimate downfall. The most recent polling indicates the two candidates are all tied up in the November showdown.","CNN projects Mike Simpson has won the GOP primary in Idaho's 2nd Congressional District .

"He's the Internet's own monster, a ghoul who lurks in its darkest corners and, like the Web itself, has mutated time and again to suit the dreams and desires of his devotees. He is Slenderman, a menacing, faceless specter in a dark suit -- sometimes portrayed with octopus-like tentacles -- known to haunt children and those who seek to expose him. He was born in 2009 in an online forum for people who enjoy creating fake supernatural images. And, on Saturday, police say, he played a role in the attempted murder of a 12-year-old girl in suburban Milwaukee by two female classmates who stabbed her 19 times. According to police, the girls said the attack was meant to impress the fictitious bogeyman. To be clear, the origin story of the monstrous character (sometimes referred to as The Slender Man) in no way urged readers to kill to earn his favor. But Slenderman has undergone hundreds of permutations online in his five-year existence. In June 2009, a Photoshop contest for images that appeared to be paranormal was launched in a forum on the website Something Awful. According to Know Your Meme, a blog that chronicles Web culture, the goal of the contest was to create the images and then use them to fool, or ""troll,"" other Web users by submitting them to paranormal websites. Site member Eric Knudsen (under the screen name ""Victor Surge"") submitted two images to the contest, both black-and-white images of children, one of which appeared to show a largely undefined figure lurking in the background. They were presented as being from 1984, and one included the text "" 'We didn't want to go, we didn't want to kill them, but its persistent silence and outstretched arms horrified and comforted us at the same time...' -- 1983, photographer unknown, presumed dead.""  (Know Your Meme has documented these posts, although links to the original thread no longer work.) A day later, according to Know Your Meme, Knudsen added a third photo and a fictional doctor's account of a mass killing. And, from there, Slenderman's assault on the Internet began. ""Some people joked in the thread, 'Wouldn't it be funny if some of these ended up on those paranormal websites or someone said these pictures look real,' "" Knudsen said in an interview this year with WNYC's ""TLDR"" podcast. ""But I don't think anyone really expected that to happen."" Other Something Awful users began creating their own Slenderman stories. And they spread to other sites. Over the past five years, he's appeared in fan art, short stories, videos, video games and other media all over the Web. A Google search for ""Slenderman"" on Tuesday returned more than 4 million results. ""Marble Hornets"" is one of the most popular permutations. It's a video series on YouTube, presented in ""Blair Witch Project""-like faux-documentary style, with nearly 380,000 subscribers. Slenderman has also been a popular subject of ""creepypasta,"" a form of Web-based short fiction. A play on the term ""copypasta,"" which itself is derived from the keyboard action ""copy-paste,"" creepypasta is horror fiction written with the Web in mind and, often, done in a style that makes it appear like a news item or other piece of true crime. The girls accused in the Milwaukee stabbing told police they knew the character from the Creepypasta Wiki, a site that compiles such fiction. The site has issued a statement condemning the attack. ""This is an isolated incident, and does (not) represent ... the Creepypasta community as a whole,"" the statement reads. ""This wiki does not endorse or advocate for killing, worship, and otherwise replication of rituals of fictional works. There is a line of between fiction and reality, and it is up to you to realize where the line is. We are a literature site, not a satanic cult."" Knudsen, too, has lamented losing control of his creation. ""I feel like less of a creator and more of an administrator, in a lot of respects, or the manager,"" he told NPR in the interview from January. Knudsen, who could not be immediately reached for comment, has filed for a copyright on the character. ""I feel like I'm Slenderman's manager, and he's out there doing his thing, and I need to just kind of watch him and take care of him.""

"Here's a sobering statistic for the unofficial start of summer, when we gear up for picnics, barbecues and our kids having more free time on their hands: Memorial Day kicks off what's known as 100 deadliest days for teen drivers. From Memorial Day through Labor Day in 2012, nearly 1,000 people were killed in crashes involving teen drivers, and more than 550 of those killed were teens, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data analyzed by the nonprofit National Safety Council. Some of the reasons for the spike make sense. Teens are driving more during the summer and it might be more recreational than purposeful, the National Safety Council reports. For instance, instead of driving back and forth to school, they might be driving to the beach, lake or river, and heading down roads they haven't driven before. But one of the biggest reasons for the summer risk increase is that teens might be driving more frequently with more of their friends. ""We have always known that passengers were a big risk for teens, but what we're really finding out now is passengers may be one of the most important risks for teens, even more so than things like texting,"" said John Ulczycki, the National Safety Council's vice president of strategic initiatives. Think about it this way, Ulczycki said: Passengers are a distraction the entire time a teen is driving, whereas the distraction from texting is probably limited to the seconds or minutes they're looking at screens instead of the road. Passengers increase the risk of a teen driver having a fatal crash by at least 44%, according to the National Safety Council. ""It's tragic that parents don't really appreciate the risks of passengers,"" said Ulczycki, who said parents may understand the risks of texting or cell phone use, but aren't as aware of the dangers of a new driver hitting the road with friends in the car. A majority of states have laws on the books regarding the number of passengers allowed for new drivers. Some states don't allow any for the first six months or year after getting a license; some allow one passenger. ''If you have a kid who had their license for less than one year, you have to think very, very carefully about the conditions or the situations in which you allow them to carry any passengers. You really do,"" Ulczycki said. CNN iReport: Parents of teens share driving tips . Ulczycki, a father of six in Wilmette, Illinois, didn't allow his children to drive with passengers for the first year of their official driving lives. ""It was a real bone of contention,"" he said. ""They weren't happy about it, but they all survived."" A recent study found that loud conversations and horseplay between passengers were more likely than technology to result in a dangerous incident involving teen drivers. The study by the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center tracked 52 high-school age drivers in North Carolina who agreed to have cameras installed in their cars. The study appeared in the Journal of Adolescent Health this spring. When there was loud conversation in the car, teen drivers were six times more likely to need to take actions like making an evasive maneuver to avoid a crash. When there was horseplay in the vehicle, they were three times more likely to get into a similarly serious episode, according to the study. ""Forty-three states currently restrict newly licensed drivers from having more than one young passenger in their vehicle,"" Robert Foss, senior research scientist at the Highway Safety Research Center, and director of the Center for the Study of Young Drivers, said in a news release. ""The results of this study illustrate the importance of such restrictions, which increase the safety of drivers, their passengers and others on the road by reducing the potential chaos that novice drivers experience."" Earlier this year, we traveled to Roxbury, New Jersey, to talk with Barb Dunn, her husband and her 16-year-old son Daniel about how they were trying to teach Daniel about safety as he learns to drive. Daniel will get his license on June 3. When I recently got back in touch with Dunn about the dangers of the summer months, her anxiety went up. ""My first reaction is fear. Then sadness,"" Dunn said via e-mail. ""I just heard a similar statistic about prom night being a very dangerous time. ... I think we have to take the time to to talk to our children and remind them of the risks and talk about how to minimize them."" Ulczycki of the National Safety Council said the best advice for parents is to understand the risks about passengers and drive with them so they can get accustomed to having people in the car. He also suggest parents consider the risks of driving at night. ""It's not the time of night. It's how dark it is. That's really the risk here, and I think too many parents think of night driving as a social curfew. 'Well, I'll let my kid stay out until 11 p.m. so he's fine,' "" Ulczycki said. ""It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with the risk of driving after dark."" Annette DiCola Lanteri, a mom of two in Bayport, Long Island, has two girls who are still a few years away from driving age. The best thing parents can do, she said on Facebook, is to teach teen drivers the best we can. ""Give them the most knowledge we can so that they can adequately protect themselves, then pray,"" DiCola Lanteri said. ""There are so many variables and we only have so much control.""

"Images from the Jewish Museum of Belgium show the gunman behind Saturday's deadly attack approaching the building, opening fire, and walking away. He used an AK-47 assault rifle to carry out the shooting, which killed at least three people, police said Sunday. Photographs and video released by Belgian police show the man wearing a cap and blue shirt, carrying two bags over his shoulder. The images do not show his face clearly. The shooter left on foot after the attack and headed toward a different part of downtown Brussels before he disappeared, according to police. Authorities are hunting the suspect, believed to have acted alone, deputy public prosecutor Ine Van Wymersch said. Investigators hope the public will help to identify the suspect. Two of those killed in Saturday's attack are Israeli and the third is French, Van Wymersch said. The Israelis were a couple in their 50s from Tel Aviv, Israel's Foreign Ministry said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said the French victim was a woman and offered his condolences Sunday to the families of all those killed, his ministry said. A fourth person, a Belgian national who works at the museum, remains in critical condition, Van Wymersch said Monday. That contradicted museum spokeswoman Chouna Lomponda, who said Sunday that the fourth person had died. Terrorism has not been ruled out, Van Wymersch said Monday. No arrests have been made, she said. A person who was detained Saturday soon after the shooting is considered a witness and not a suspect, Van Wymersch added. That witness was not seen in surveillance video recorded during the attack, she said. The circumstances of the shooting have raised suspicions that it may have been an anti-Semitic attack, but no motive has been determined.  Van Wymersch said it was too early to determine whether the attack was an act of terrorism or motivated by anti-Semitism. Could the killer attack again? A senior Belgian law enforcement official told CNN that Belgian police do not yet have any leads on the killer. It's been challenging to identify the killer because he was wearing a baseball cap. The official told CNN that authorities have no information yet on the specific motivation or ideological background of the killer. They do not know whether they are dealing with Islamist terrorism, some sort of neo-Nazi type of attack or another category altogether. But there is concern that the killer could strike again, the official said, and that authorities could be dealing with a ""Mohammed Merah"" type of killer. Merah, a French-Algerian Islamist radical who received terror training with al Qaeda-linked militants in Pakistan, shot and killed three French paratroopers in two attacks in March 2012 before killing three schoolchildren and their teacher at a Jewish school in Toulouse, France, during a 10-day shooting rampage which he filmed with a camera attached to his torso. But the official stressed that no evidence has emerged in Saturday's attack pointing to any link to Islamist terrorism. The official told CNN that authorities cannot say with certainty whether the Brussels gunman was carrying a video camera to film the attacks. Some investigators who viewed the surveillance footage believed this was the case and some did not. The quality of the surveillance footage was not good enough to make a conclusive determination. The official said the killer shot the Israeli couple first in the museum entryway with one of his weapons. The couple had been consulting the wall display. He then pulled out a Kalashnikov assault rifle and shot the others inside the museum. Surveillance cameras picked up the killer walking on two or three streets before he disappeared. The official said the killer appeared to be skilled in using weapons and likely planned the attack meticulously. The official stressed Belgian authorities are investigating all possible angles, including Islamist terrorism, neo-Nazi attack, and other categories. With regard to the threat from Islamist terrorism, he noted there has been longstanding concern over the 100 or so Belgian Islamist extremists who received training in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region over the years, and high current concern over several hundred who have more recently traveled to fight in Syria. The concern is they might be able to use skills acquired there to launch attacks back home. Heightened security . Belgium's Interior Ministry raised its terror alert level in the wake of the attack. Belgian Interior Minister Joelle Milquet told a news conference Saturday that the security threat level was at its highest at locations frequented by the Jewish community across the country. This measure is precautionary, she added. She met with the police, Belgian Jewish community leaders and the president of the European Jewish Congress, Moshe Kantor, on Sunday to discuss the security arrangements, an Interior Ministry statement said. The Jewish community is determined to continue its activities in schools, synagogues and cultural centers, but under heightened security with a permanent police presence, the statement said. Kantor is also to hold urgent talks with Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo, his group said in a statement. Kantor described the attack as ""horrific but not surprising"" and urged action by European governments to tackle extremism and hate speech. ""Attacks on Jewish targets in Europe do not exist in a vacuum, but are part and parcel of an overall climate of hate and incitement against Jewish communities,"" he said, according to the statement. ""Anti-Semitism begins in the public domain, it gains international legitimacy and becomes normative even in our national parliaments but it always ends in killing Jews."" Pope Francis, who was in Israel on Sunday, told reporters that he had a ""heavy heart"" after the ""atrocious"" attack. ""While reiterating my condemnation for this criminal act of anti-Semitic hatred, I entrust the victims of this crime to the God of mercy and invoke upon the wounded his gift of healing,"" the pope said in Tel Aviv before departing for Jerusalem. Jewish men targeted in France . In neighboring France, two Jewish men were assaulted late Saturday as they were leaving a synagogue in Creteil, outside Paris, the French Interior Ministry said Sunday. Two men were involved in the aggression against the two Jewish men, who are bruised, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said in an interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve instructed police and other authorities to strengthen security at Jewish sites while looking for the perpetrators of Saturday's incident, which he strongly condemned, according to the ministry. In the wake of the attack in Brussels, Cazeneuve reaffirmed his determination to fight those who commit murderous acts and spread racism as well as well as anti-Semitism, the ministry said. Anti-Semitism worldwide . A global survey released in May by the Anti-Defamation League reported on the levels of anti-Semitism found in 102 nations. Belgium received a 27% index score in the survey. The index score represents the percentage of adults in a country who answered ""probably true"" to a majority of the anti-Semitic stereotypes tested. Belgium has an adult population of about 8.7 million. The ADL said one-fourth of adults worldwide are ""deeply infected with anti-Semitic attitudes,"" according to a CNN.com report on the survey. France had the second highest index score in Europe, with 37%, although that was well below Greece, with 67%. Germany had a score of 27%, Spain 29%, Sweden 4% and the United Kingdom 8%. The United States was given an index score of 9%. More on rampage killings .","Senior Belgian law enforcement official says police have no leads .

But in reality, the unique nature of this collection makes them priceless in a growing market. Collectible car sales last year in the U.S. topped $1 billion. Money aside, this exhibit really exemplifies America's long and fiery hot love affair with cars. These rolling masterpieces were never intended to be mass produced. They were meant to be romanced, idolized, even worshipped. Concept cars are marketing tools designed to trigger buzz and spur sales. You can be sure the Da Vinci of General Motors -- legendary designer Harley Earl -- put just as much imagination into his jet-plane-looking Firebird as old Leonardo did with that smirking Mona. ""These have got to be some of the world's craziest, beautiful cars,"" a visitor says to me with a grin as big as the grill-work on a stunning '51 GM LeSabre XP-8 sitting a few feet away. Beautiful, yes. Crazy? VERY. A few examples: . -- Not a clown car: The 1970 Lancia Stratos HF Zero measures only 33 inches from its rooftop to the floor. -- Electric Egg: A tiny electric-powered, plastic, bubble-on-wheels was created in Nazi-occupied Paris in 1942. -- Fabric exterior: A 2001 BMW Gina wrinkles when you open its doors. See photos of these sweet cars . Parked against a wall in another exhibit room sits a green replica 1935 Bugatti Type 57S. Steampunk fans will dig this elegant machine. It looks like something out of Disney's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea."" ""You can fetishize just about any detail on the Bugatti you like, from the grill to every bolt,"" a man standing nearby says to me. This guy gets it! We're like kids in a candy store -- but nobody's letting us have any candy. Instead we're hypnotized by the cars and their dramatic, sweeping lines and their chrome-spangled cockpits. Related: Gorgeous art cars auctioned . Days of future past . These vehicles were designed to look like the future. Take for example the '59 Cadillac Cyclone XP-74. It stops you cold. The thing looks like a silver rocket from a 1950s B movie. And it has futuristic safety features too. A radar-based anti-collision system is tucked inside the Caddy's cone-shaped so-called ""dagmar"" headlights. Two of the exhibit's creators -- Ken Gross and Sarah Schleuning -- showed me around a little. ""In the past, the future was really cool,"" joked Gross, who's also been Playboy Magazine's car writer for more than 25 years. Gross, the exhibit's consulting curator, says these vehicles were imagined and built by designers with one goal: to get attention. Harley Earl's been dead for 45 years and and he's still turning heads. That's called being way ahead of your time. As Gross puts it: ""Car designers are the rock stars of the automobile industry and they always have been."" When it came to car design, Earl pushed the industry to put style as a top priority, says Schleuning, the museum's curator of decorative arts and design. ""It wasn't just about the cars' technological marvels, but also about their aesthetic appeal."" Related: Teeny cars worth big bucks . The rolling rocket . The rule breaker -- the bad boy of this bunch -- Gross says, is the Firebird. This rolling rocket gets its own chamber in the exhibit. And it's no wonder. -- It's the first two-section gas turbine powered car to be built and tested in the U.S. -- It's one of the first cars with four-wheel disc brakes. -- Its body is made mostly of expensive and super strong titanium. In 1954 GM toted the Firebird around the country as part of a traveling car show called the Motorama. The car ""was so fast they only had one or two engineers who drove it at the proving grounds,"" Gross says. ""They used Mauri Rose, who was an Indy 500 winner, to test it -- and even he never took it to its full potential."" It's been suggested that America's century-long obsession with driving may die with the aging Baby Boomer generation. Some experts say that Millennials now in their 20s and 30s have little interest in owning cars, although sales among that group shot up in 2012. Are we falling out of love with our cars? The Atlanta museum is by no means the first to celebrate automobile design. Back in 1951, New York's Museum of Modern Art opened an exhibit featuring eight cars described as elegant and exotic. More recently, Gross says, the idea has become a national trend, taking hold in places like Nashville, Tennessee, and Raleigh, North Carolina. Maybe increased interest within America's art community will stoke the fire, and keep the romance burning a little longer.","Art exhibit celebrates car designers, the auto industry's ""rock stars""

"Gay couples can now legally marry in 18 countries -- a statistic that increasingly raises an important question: Where's the best spot for a same-sex honeymoon? More and more destinations are now catering to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) travelers. John Tanzella, chief executive of the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association, says it's an encouraging trend, but he worries there's a risk of gay vacationers being targeted as a ""niche."" ""When you're planning that dream trip it's still important to work with travel professionals who understand the needs of gay travelers as individuals,"" he adds. Among travel organizations that seem to be getting the message is the Association of British Travel Agents, which is the latest to  compile a list of destinations offering same-sex honeymooners a friendly atmosphere and catering to a broad range of tastes. Here's its 10. Cape Town, South Africa . The dramatic backdrop of Table Mountain rises above this gorgeous city bathed in almost year-round sunshine. It's a great place to relax for a couple of days, then travel out to the numerous wineries in the lush green countryside close to the city. Where else can you see penguins sunning themselves on a beach? Cape Town is considered the most gay-friendly city in Africa and attracts LGBT people from across the continent, adding to an interesting local cultural mix. The gay village, with its range of clubs, bars, bathhouses, cafes and guesthouses is in De Waterkant. Honeymoon hotspot: The lively Cafe Manhattan (74 Waterkant St., Cape Town; +27 21 421 6666). Lesbos and Mykonos, Greece . We get the word ""lesbian"" from the island that was home to Sappho, who wrote erotic poetry to other women in the 6th century B.C. It's now a popular destination for modern-day Sapphists. The island's main town, Mytilini is charming old world Greek, with winding streets and quiet churches. Mykonos has a vibrant gay scene for men and women, with lots of clubs and hotels. Honeymoon hotspot: Many gay travelers hang out on Super Paradise and Elia beaches, which can get noisy at night -- and somewhat naked during the day. Miami and the Florida Keys . Miami's Caribbean climate sets it apart from the rest of the United States. The city also has some of America's most interesting architecture, plus world-class art galleries and classical music performances. A day in Little Havana, the center of the not-so-little Cuban community, can feel like a visit to another country. Couples can time their trip to coincide with one of three of the planet's biggest gay events. There's the White Party in November, the Winter Party in March and Aqua Girl Weekend in May. In April, the Gay and Lesbian Film Festival is a huge draw. Honeymoon hotspot: The gay section at Haulover Beach (10800 Collins Ave., Bal Harbour, Florida; +1 305 947 3525) is a popular post-party place to unwind. Tel Aviv, Israel . The city's annual gay pride, which is sponsored by the government, draws gay men and women from all over the world. In 2012, travel guide Gaycities.com named Tel Aviv the gayest city on the planet -- at least 100,000 gay men are expected to visit this year. Tel Aviv calls itself a 24-hour city because you can spend all night clubbing then snooze all day on one of its beaches. If you've time to spare, you can squeeze ancient and Biblical sites such as the Dead Sea, Masada and Jerusalem into one- or two-day trips. Honeymoon hotspot: Tel Aviv doesn't have a gay village because the whole city considers itself gay-friendly, but Rothschild Avenue is a particular focus, where as many same-sex couples walk hand in hand as straight couples. Brighton, England . Brighton is, without doubt, Britain's gayest town and has an anything-goes reputation not just for romance, but also for art, clubbing and all kinds of culture. The beach may be rainy outside of summer, but even in winter there's a certain beauty to the place, and it's only an hour by train from London. Brighton town also sports some exotic-looking buildings, such as the Royal Pavilion, an 18th-century regent's folly built in a classical Indian style. Honeymoon hotspot: Club Revenge (32-34 Old Steine St., Brighton; +44 1273 606 064) has been a fixture of gay Brighton's nightlife for two decades. Phuket, Thailand . Thailand's raunchiest island is a nonstop merry-go-round of bars and nightlife catering to the traveler who wants it all and wants it cheap. The Thai islands are great for those who want luxury but have blown the budget on the wedding. Phuket and other nearby Andaman Sea islands are also a paradise for scuba divers and offer plenty of peaceful alternatives away from the clubs. Honeymoon hotspot: The Paradise Complex (Rat-U-Thit Road, Patong, Kathu, Phuket; +66 76 341 804) in the town of Patong hosts outdoor drag shows at places such as the Kiss Bar. Puerto Vallarta, Mexico . There are more than a dozen gay-friendly hotels in Puerto Vallerta, the town on Mexico's Pacific coast that's home to the country's biggest gay scene. The place has more history than many Mexican resorts and there are hideaways in the surrounding jungle for those who need to unwind after the wedding. Honeymoon hotspot: The gay village centers on the Blue Chairs (Malecón y Almendro No. 4, Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco;  +52 322 222 5040) resort section of the beach, where there's raucous entertainment at night. Sydney . Sydney's gay pride march is the biggest and brashest in the world. The city is famously LGBT-friendly, nowhere more so than the center of gay Sydney: Taylor Square on Oxford Street. The city's bars and restaurants are some of the best in the world, so it's a great place for foodie couples -- particularly the pricey venues in the Rock's area. Honeymoon hotspot: As a harbor city, Sydney offers opportunities to polish surfing skills on some of the local beaches, such as the world-famous Bondi -- which claims to be the location of the first ever gay surfers' group surf. Let's Go Surfing, 128 Ramsgate Ave., North Bondi; +61 9365 1800 . Sitges, Spain . The center for Spain's gay scene is 20 miles (32 kilometers) along the coast from the stunning architecture and cultural life of Barcelona. Once just a fishing village, in the 20th century it became a haven for artists including Picasso, and now welcomes an international gay community. The town has a calendar of annual events including the town carnival, a film festival, a classic car rally and the full range of traditional Spanish village religious festivals. Honeymoon hotspot: Parrots (Carrer de Joan Tarrida, 16, Sitges, Barcelona; +34 938 94 13 50) one of the city's best-known gay hotels, also has its own popular gay cafe.","Association of British Travel Agents has named its top 10 destinations for same-sex honeymoons .

"Another racially insensitive video featuring Justin Bieber has surfaced. On Wednesday, the site TMZ posted a video of a then 14-year-old Bieber changing the words to his hit ""One Less Lonely Girl"" to include the ""N-word"" and singing about joining the Ku Klux Klan. A source close to Bieber confirms to CNN that the singer was 14 at the time of the incident and made the recording after he saw a comedian parodying his ""One Less Lonely Girl"" song online. In the parody, the comic replaced some of the lyrics with racist words including ""n*****,"" the source said. In Bieber's video, he sings ""There'll be one less lonely n*****"" and adds ""If I kill you, I'll be part of the KKK."" The source close to the singer added that the teen immediately realized his error and and told his mentors, singer Usher and actor Will Smith, about the video. Usher, who wrote ""One Less Lonely Girl,"" showed Bieber some historically racist videos in an effort to teach him about the hurtful nature of such words, the source said. Now 20, Bieber reportedly wants to take full responsibility for his youthful actions. This latest video comes just days after Bieber apologized for another video in which the pop star, then 15, is seen making a racist joke. In that video, which was also posted on TMZ, Bieber asks, ""Why are black people afraid of chain saws?"" before answering his own question with the statement ""Run n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****,""  imitating the sound of a chain saw. ""As a young man, I didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was OK to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realize at the time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance,"" Bieber said in a statement after the release of the first video. ""I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously, and I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again."" The source said that over the years, there have been various extortion attempts made with people demanding money from Bieber to not surface the videos.","Website TMZ has posted a new video of singer Justin Bieber .

"My friend was just murdered under the guise of revolution. His name was Alyn Beck. He was a cop. Two unhinged people walked into a restaurant in sunny Las Vegas and attacked my friend Alyn and his partner, Igor Soldo, shooting them dead as they ate their lunch. They then turned and yelled something about it being the ""start of the revolution,"" witnesses said. They left behind a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and a swastika. They killed another person at a Walmart and then themselves. These two didn't start a revolution. They just took the lives of two heroes. They tore fathers from children and turned wives into widows. They brought darkness into the lives of all who loved these two men and another bystander. They traumatized people who witnessed the tragedy. They left a scene of carnage for dozens of fellow police workers -- the fallen cops' friends, colleagues -- to process emotionally and mentally. All for some perverse, horrific act masquerading as revolution. Authorities say that the shooters viewed law enforcement as oppressive and that they had participated in anti-government protests. But you don't start a revolution by ambushing two innocent men in a fast food restaurant. These weren't policymakers. They weren't ""big government henchmen."" They were two good cops. We may all have problems with cops sometimes. Who hasn't felt angry after getting pulled over? And yeah, I know some cops are just plain bad. Some are just out to push people around. Some are drunk on their authority and try to dominate everyone they encounter. And some hurt people. But anyone who knows any cops personally knows that those are the exceptions. Because for the most part, cops are good folks simply doing our dirty work. They are the society's janitors, taking out the trash and cleaning up the messes none of us want to deal with ourselves. Like you and me, they work for a paycheck, only their office is a squad car, their market is something like the Wild West and their briefcase is generally a 9 millimeter. Unless you are in fact ""a bad guy,"" most of these men and women in uniform aren't making your life more difficult, they're making it easier. They are not a target of your revolution! Whatever your desired revolution, it shouldn't take its power from cowardly acts of violence inflicted on the innocent. Alyn's killers should be shunned in the public memory -- there is no cause that can redeem them. We must forget them. Their brave victims are the ones to be honored and celebrated. My friend, Alyn, was a dynamite guy. He was a riot to be around:  kind and funny, capable of ridiculously juvenile behavior but also profound intellectual depth. Alyn helped me build the shed in my backyard. He insisted on helping. He was a tireless worker, and once he was done with a job, he'd be the one bringing you a lemonade. Alyn was a family man, a devoted husband and dad, and with the birth of a daughter, he was relishing the joy of being a new father again after over a decade of raising his first two wonderful kids. He liked to swim with his kids in the backyard. He loved going dancing in clubs with his wife. He was remarkably patient in training and tolerating the family's lovable but absolutely insane dog, Marty. As a cop, Alyn was top notch. When it came time for business, he was the first guy through the door, the one you would want showing up if you were in any kind of danger, because he was fearless and capable. And now Alyn is dead, because two jerks decided they couldn't patiently let the system work like the rest of us. They couldn't control their impulses. They couldn't act like adults. These were not heroes or revolutionaries. They were cowardly psychopaths who chose to throw a terrifying tantrum. If you're frustrated with government, if you're worried about the republic, if you're convinced black helicopters are watching you in the night or there is something else under your skin, there's something you can do: Start a blog, write a book, go to a protest, join a cause, call a senator, call a talk show, run for office.  Do what people in a free society do, not what out-of- control adolescents in ""Lord of the Flies"" would do. And if you just can't restrain yourself from going on a murderous rampage followed by your own cowardly suicide, do the rest of us a favor and do it in reverse order. Shooting a cop doesn't make you a revolutionary. It just makes things worse for everyone. Goodbye, Alyn. Thanks for making my life better than it would have been otherwise.","Tracy Smith: My friend Alyn Beck was shot by two unhinged people bent on 'revolution'

"Even before hitting newsstands, Monica Lewinsky's essay in Vanity Fair provoked its share of reactions across social media, from shrugs to bemusement to outright hostility.  The reactions are easy to understand when you're talking about a former White House intern whose affair with Bill Clinton threatened to bring down his presidency. Now that her essay is out, it reveals a woman still haunted by the events of nearly two decades ago. It also offers  insights into someone who has moved on. Here are the six major takeaways: . 1. She regrets the affair. Lewinsky devotes considerable ink to her various forays into the job market.  We all know about the handbags she peddled in the late 1990s and her stint as a Jenny Craig spokeswoman. In her essay, she spells out awkward conversations in offices from Portland, Oregon, to London, hearing rejection upon rejection due to ""what my potential employers so tactfully referred to as my 'history.'"" Lewinsky recalls an interview in 2008, in which fear of entanglements with the Clintons torpedoed her chances. ""There is a 25 percent chance that Mrs. Clinton will be the next president,"" she recounts being told.  ""We would first need a Letter of Indemnification from the Clintons."" ""I gave a fake smile,"" she writes, a skill she apparently cultivated over 16 years of infamy, ""and said 'I understand.'"" Lewinsky clearly holds her notoriety responsible for these difficulties -- from finding meaningful work to emotional and romantic struggles. ""I look back now, shake my head in disbelief, and wonder: what was I -- what were we -- thinking? I would give anything to go back and rewind the tape."" 2. She's dreading a Hillary 2016 run. ""Despite what some headlines will falsely report about this piece, this is not about Me versus the Clintons,"" Lewinsky writes. Then why speak out now?  Because this ain't her first rodeo. ""In 2008, when Hillary was running for president, I remained virtually reclusive,"" she writes. ""When I hear of Hillary's prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the next wave of paparazzi, the next wave of 'Where is she now?' stories, the next reference to me in Fox News' coverage of the primaries,"" Lewinsky says in her essay. But despite her doubts, she decided to go on the record because she didn't want to wait ""another 8 to 10 years"" and because ""I turned 40 last year"" and because ""I'm determined to have a different ending to my story."" 3. At times, she had ""suicidal temptations."" Another motivation for Lewinsky to write the piece:  A young man named Tyler Clementi. The 18-year-old's suicide in 2008 brought back memories for Lewinsky and her mother of some of the darkest times following the scandal, she writes. The Rutgers freshman took his own life after his roommate streamed a video, surreptitiously recorded, of him kissing another man. Clementi's death struck a chord with Lewinsky's mother . ""It was an unbearably tragic event,"" Lewinsky writes, but ""I couldn't quite grasp why my mom was so distraught."" After the news of the affair broke, her mom ""stayed by my bed, night after night, because I, too, was suicidal. The shame, the scorn and the fear that had been thrown at her daughter left her afraid that I would  take my own life -- a fear that I would literally be humiliated to death."" Lewinsky adds that she never attempted suicide but that she had ""strong suicidal temptations several times during the investigation and one or two periods after."" 4. She was a ""foolish"" 24-year-old. Throughout the essay, Lewinsky acknowledges her own complicity in her misery, but also steps back to mull over the spectacle of the affair, which she says was consensual. ""At the time -- at least from my point of view -- it was an authentic connection, with emotional intimacy, frequent visits, plans made, phone calls and gifts exchanged,"" she writes.  ""In my early 20s, I was too young to understand the real life consequences."" Looking back, Lewinsky muses on how difficult it was for her to move on.  ""Unlike the other parties involved, I was so young that I had no established identity to which I could return."" ""If you haven't figured out how you are, it's hard not to accept the horrible image of you created by others,"" she observes.  And also one of frustration ""I remained 'stuck' for far too many years."" 5. She dates. ""Yes.  I date!"" 6. She's penned a compelling essay. Many may only read the headlines but that's a mistake.  The whole piece is worth consideration. Lewinsky's story is, for better or for worse, part of America's political history. Opinion: Stop judging Monica Lewinsky .

"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina won his primary showdown on Tuesday, easily topping the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff. His victory over a crowded field on the right stands in contrast to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor's defeat in Virginia's 7th Congressional District, where GOP challenger Dave Brat upset the seven-term Republican for the party's nomination. Big upset: No. 2 House Republican loses primary . Graham's opposition was fractured heading into the primary. State Sen. Lee Bright came in a distant second, followed by five other challengers who all registered in the single digits. ""Leadership and problem solving comes with some political risk. You get a bunch of people running against you, but I'm here to tell you, it's very much worth it,"" Graham said in his victory speech. In red-state South Carolina, Graham will be considered the strong favorite in November's general election, when he faces Democratic state Sen. Brad Hutto, who easily won his party's primary. South Carolina is not Mississippi . Graham's victory also stood in contrast to Republican Sen. Thad Cochran's fight for his political life in Mississippi. Last week, Cochran was forced into a runoff against a challenger backed by the tea party. But for Graham, any comparison with Cochran was short lived, even though many tea party activists and other grassroots conservatives in South Carolina despise him and other local organizations in the state have censured him in recent years. Graham had some advantages heading into the contest: He had a massive war chest -- around $8 million cash on hand, which gave him a huge campaign cash advantage over his primary opponents -- and outside groups have steered clear of the race, unlike in Mississippi where establishment and tea party groups fought. South Carolina Republican consultant Joel Sawyer told CNN that Graham was facing off  ""against an incredibly weak field of competitors, and of course he benefited by having the 'not Lindsey' vote split among several folks."" ""Second, to Lindsey's credit, he ran a great campaign. I think the assumption among a lot of people was that he'd solely wage an air war, but I've been impressed with the way he also ran a traditional, grassroots-focused campaign in addition to a compelling broadcast message. And Lindsey himself spent a lot of time on the ground here holding events and interacting one-on-one with voters,"" Sawyer added. Graham debated his opponents for the first and only time this past weekend. They slammed him over his 2008 vote in favor of the Wall Street bailout, his votes in favor of President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominations, and especially for his support of immigration reform. Obama: Midterm elections will decide the fate of immigration reform . Maybe immigration reform isn't dead after all . Graham was a member of the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" senators who pushed immigration reform through the chamber last year. The bill was never taken up by the GOP-controlled House. Heading into Tuesday's contest, polls showed Graham close to the 50% threshold.  He spent Monday on a bus tour through the conservative, voter-rich upstate region. In his final campaign commercial before the primary, Graham touted his conservative credentials, which he said included support for ""building the Keystone pipeline, opposing Obamacare, looking for answers on Benghazi, standing up for our military."" And in the ad, which his campaign said was a six-figure statewide buy on TV, radio and digital, Graham said he is a ""conservative leader you can count on to get things done.""

"Tension dramatically mounted in Ukraine's Crimea region Friday as its ambassador to the United Nations warned Russia against any further violation of its territorial borders, a warning that came as the United States urged Russia to pull back from the region or face possible consequences. ""We are now deeply concerned by reports of military movements taken by the Russian Federation inside Ukraine,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said in televised comments from the White House. ""...It would be a clear violation of Russia's commitment to respect the independence and sovereignty and borders of Ukraine and of international laws."" Obama said any violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be ""deeply destabilizing, and he warned ""the United States will stand with the international community in affirming that there will be costs for any military intervention in Ukraine."" Read Obama's full statement . The remarks were the latest in a series of fast-moving developments that saw Ukrainian officials grappling with rising secessionist passions in the Russian-majority region, where the airspace has been closed and communications have been disrupted. Ukraine accused Russian Black Sea forces of trying to seize two airports in Crimea but said Ukrainian security forces prevented them from taking control. Ukraine Interior Minister Arsen Avakov earlier characterized the presence at the airport of unidentified armed men, who wore uniforms without insignia, as an ""armed invasion."" The crisis echoed throughout the world, with the U.N. Security Council president holding a private meeting about the crisis enveloping Ukraine and world leaders calling armed groups not to attempt to challenge Ukrainian sovereignty. 'This group is making a serious mistake' At a press conference outside the U.N. Security Council, Ukraine's ambassador to the U.N., Yuriy Sergeyev said the country was prepared to defend itself and urged the U.N.'s moral and political support for the Kiev government, particularly in Crimea. Since last week's ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, Ukraine has faced a deepening schism, with those in the west generally supporting the interim government and its European Union tilt, while many in the east preferring a Ukraine where Russia casts a long shadow. Nowhere is that feeling more intense than in Crimea, the last big bastion of opposition to the new political leadership. And Ukraine suspects Russia of fomenting tension in the autonomous region that might escalate into a bid for separation by its Russian majority. ""We still have a chance to stop the negative developments and separatism,"" Sergeyev said. Sergeyev accused Russia of violating its military agreement by blocking Ukrainian security forces, including its border guards and police, in the region. ""This group is making a serious mistake challenging our territorial integrity,"" he said. But Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaliy Churkin, compared the reports of Russian troops taking charge of positions on the ground to rumors that ""are always not true."" ""We are acting within the framework of our agreement,"" he said. Even so, U.S. military commanders and intelligence agencies were scrambling Friday to determine what was needed to get a better picture of Russian movements. That included an assessment of intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance needs, a senior U.S. official told CNN. The U.S. State Department warned Americans to defer all non-essential travel to Ukraine, particularly the Crimea region, ""due to the potential for instability following the departure of former President Yanukovych and the establishment of a new government."" Meanwhile, Obama is considering not attending the G8 Summit in Sochi, Russia, in June, if Russian troops remain in the Ukraine, a senior administration official familiar with the discussions told CNN. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity. Kerry talks to Russian foreign minister . The Russian Foreign Ministry said maneuvers of armored vehicles from the Russian Black Sea Fleet in Crimea were needed for security and were in line with bilateral agreements. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday morning about the airport and military activities, and Lavrov told Kerry that the Russians ""are not engaging in any violation of the sovereignty"" of Ukraine. Russia has a military base agreement with the country. Lavrov told him the military exercises were prescheduled and unrelated to the events in Ukraine, Kerry said. ""I nevertheless made it clear that that could be misinterpreted at the moment,'' Kerry said, ""and there are enough tensions that it is important for everybody to be extremely careful not to inflame the situation and send the wrong messages."" Yanukovych's news conference was under way in Russia, Kerry said, as he spoke with Lavrov. Kerry said Lavrov had reaffirmed to him a commitment that Russia would ""respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine."" ""We would overwhelmingly stress today that we urge all parties -- all parties; that includes the new interim technical government, rightists, oppositionists and others, anybody in the street who is armed -- we urge all parties to avoid any steps that could be misinterpreted or lead to miscalculation or do anything other than to work to bring that peace and stability and peaceful transition within the governing process within Ukraine,"" Kerry said. Russian response . In a telephone call with European leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed the importance of avoiding a further escalation of violence in Ukraine, the Kremlin said in a prepared statement Friday. Putin also called for a normalization of the situation, speaking with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister David Cameron and European Council President Herman Van Rompuy, according to the Kremlin. Crimea was handed to Ukraine by the Soviet Union in 1954. Just over half its population is ethnic Russian, while about a quarter are Ukrainians and a little more than 10% are Crimean Tatars, a predominantly Muslim group oppressed under former Soviet leader Josef Stalin. Meanwhile, Russian lawmakers introduced two bills Friday to simplify annexing new territories into the Russian Federation and simplify access to Russian citizenship for Ukrainians, the state news agency Itar Tass said. One bill also stipulates that the accession of a part of a foreign state to Russia should be taken through a referendum, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Ukraine's President in Russia . Making his first public appearance since his ouster Saturday, Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych said the newly appointed interim government was not legitimate and did not represent the majority of Ukraine's 45 million citizens. ""I intend to continue the fight for the future of Ukraine against those who, with fear and with terror, are attempting to replace the power,"" Yanukovych said in Russian, not Ukrainian. ""Nobody has overthrown me. I was compelled to leave Ukraine due to a direct threat to my life and my nearest and dearest."" In his hourlong news conference, Yanukovych accused the interim authorities in Ukraine of propagating violence. He spoke against a backdrop of Ukraine's blue-and-yellow flags before reporters in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don about 700 miles south of Moscow. ""I never gave any orders to shoot,"" he said, adding that he sought peace and that the security forces took up arms only when their lives were at risk. Yanukovych is wanted in Ukraine on charges connected to the deaths of demonstrators, who were protesting his decision to scrap a European Union trade deal in favor of one with Russia. Armed men at airports . Back in Kiev, Andrii Parubii, chief of national security and defense, said Ukrainian military and police forces had stopped Russian military forces from seizing two airports in the Crimean region. The Russian military is on the outside of both airports, Parubii said in a televised news conference from the Ukrainian parliament. Weapons were not used during the operation, according to Avakov, the interior minister. Russian armored vehicles were moving toward Simferopol, the regional capital, on Friday, the Ukrainian news outlet TSN reported. Men in military uniforms had been seen patrolling the airport in Simferopol, as well as a military and civilian airbase in nearby Sevastopol since early Friday. Avakov said the armed men at the Sevastopol air base were troops from Russia's Black Sea Fleet, stationed in the port city. They were in camouflage uniforms without military insignia, he said. The presence of the armed men has not affected the Simferopol airport, civil aviation authorities said. ""We are checking to make sure that no radicals come to Crimea from Kiev, from the Ukraine,"" said one man outside the airport, who didn't give his name. ""We don't want radicals, we don't want fascism, we don't want problems."" Other men outside the airport, dressed in black rather than military fatigues, said they belonged to the pro-Russia Unity Party and had come on the orders of the new Crimean administration -- voted in Thursday after armed men seized regional government buildings. Concerned about the latest developments, Ukraine's parliament passed a resolution Friday that demanded Russia halt any activity that can be interpreted as an attack on its sovereignty. Moscow alarmed some observers by announcing the surprise military exercises Wednesday in its western and central areas, near the Ukraine border. Meanwhile, Ukraine's largest telecom firm was unable to provide data and voice connectivity between Crimea and the rest of Ukraine because unknown people had seized telecommunications nodes and destroyed cables, it said Friday. There is almost no phone connectivity or Internet service across Crimea, said Ukrtelecom, which is the only landline provider. 5 things to know about Crimea .

"Erika Harold, a biracial, former Miss America-turned-Harvard Law School-educated attorney in her 30s, would seem to be the type of congressional candidate the Republican Party would break its neck to back in a race. But, as she barnstormed across Illinois' 13th Congressional District in a maverick effort to defeat first-term incumbent Rep. Rodney Davis in March's primary, Harold came face-to-face with an extreme example of the types of challenges female GOP congressional hopefuls sometimes face. In Harold's case, she was shut out and, ultimately, shut down. Her requests for party data on voters who had previously cast ballots in Republican primaries was denied, according to media reports. She was shunned at political functions and potential donors were warned to stay away, she said. Republican officials told Harold to consider running for another office. ""She chose to run against a sitting member of Congress,"" Andrea Bozek, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, a GOP organization which helps candidates seeking congressional office, said last week. ""There were plenty of other races she was encouraged to run for. We're a member-driven organization."" Women's work: The GOP's glass ceiling . Montgomery County Republican Party chairman Jim Allen was forced to step down from his post and apologize after he called Harold a ""street walker"" in an email to the editor of Republican News Watch, an online newsletter, and declared ""Rodney Davis will win and the love child of the D.N.C. will be back in Sh*tcago by May of 2014 working for some law firm that needs to meet their quota for minority hires,"" according to multiple media reports. Party officials denounced Allen's comments. Chicago attorney, Doug Ibendahl, who edited Republican News Watch, said the email and toxic tenor of the race is why his party is struggling to gain traction with women and minorities. Ibendahl first flagged the email which then became a national story. Crystal Wright, an editor and blogger with ConservativeBlackChick.com, put it more bluntly. ""She was black and needed to know her place,"" Wright said of the attitude she felt some members of the party establishment displayed toward Harold. ""We complain we don't have enough female and minority candidates. Then someone with Erika's qualifications comes along and we treat them like crap. It's very disheartening to me that the party I belong to doesn't get it and is so out of touch. You get tired of beating your head against a brick wall."" Harold, who was once a delegate who spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention, ultimately lost the primary to Davis, 55%-41%. She now works for an Illinois law firm. ""Women get discounted from the conversation before they have the opportunity to prove their viability,"" Harold said of her experience in the primary. The GOP knows it has a problem recruiting and supporting female candidates and attracting women voters.  After a self-examination following huge losses among women, minorities and young voters in the 2012 presidential election, the party ramped up its outreach efforts and has spent millions on such initiatives as Project GROW, which seeks to beef up the number of female candidates, and ""14 in 14"", a program aimed at winning more women voters to the Republican cause. 5 House races to watch in 2014 . Party officials point to the success of such candidates as Mia Love, the former mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, who spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention. The GOP rising star, who is Haitian American and Mormon, lost her bid against Democratic incumbent Rep. Jim Matheson to represent Utah's Republican-leaning 4th Congressional District by 768 votes in the 2012 general election. So, when Matheson announced he was retiring in 2014, Love regrouped and strategized with party officials. The advice: announce early and run hard. ""Mia Love is a phenomenal candidate who took advantage of announcing her candidacy early this cycle,"" Bozek said. ""This time she announced February 2013 which gave her a year and half to fund. And now she is almost assured to be a member of Congress."" If she wins the general election this fall, Love would become the first African American Republican woman in Congress. ""What I'm seeing, more than anything than in the last presidential election, the Republican Party learned many things and they reached out to women more,"" said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist and radio host. ""They've made tremendous strides in reaching out to women candidates and constituents."" It's not enough, said former Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. ""The net effect of their efforts is reflected in their results. They have fewer women running than they did in 2012. They have not made up lost ground and built a strong foundation for women running on the Republican ticket,"" she said. ""It's important to have those efforts, but frankly the overall efforts haven't produced the kinds of results that are essential to build support among women to run for office."" ""Instead of leaning in to encourage more female candidates the party is standing in place,"" she said. Over the past two decades, Republican women have been less likely to enter or win primaries when compared to their Democratic peers, according to a study by Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics. The number of Republican women entering primaries has also decreased, the study found. Part of the problem, some Republican women said, is the increasingly polarized nature of congressional districts and the primary battles to represent them. Women, studies such as the one from Rutgers have found, tend to be more moderate in their views on such issues as reproductive choice and, as a result, struggle in primaries that skew conservative. Another issue is the increasingly toxic nature of primary showdowns . ""Republican primaries have become bitterly contested,"" Snowe said. ""What's to attract anyone to want to engage in that kind of political flummox?"" The very nature of the primary system further complicates matters, Harold, Snowe and other Republican women said. Men dominate House and Senate seats â€” especially on the Republican side. Therefore, any woman who seeks higher office would either have to wait for that member of Congress to retire and leave an open seat or challenge a sitting member of Congress in a primary. And because state and local parties tend to support sitting members of Congress in primaries, Republican women are especially challenged when they seek those seats. ""That's why I support open primaries so that you get more independents participating in primaries and so it's not concentrated with the idealogues,"" said Snowe who was considered a Senate moderate. ""The people who vote in the primaries are controlling what happens in an election. So just a few people determine who would be governing the state or the country. "" Even when Republican women do run for office, the Rutgers study found that they often struggle to net adequate networking and funding support â€”both within the party and from outside groups â€” needed to win their races, said Debbie Walsh, director of Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics. While there are a number of well-funded groups, such as EMILY's list, supporting candidates with more liberal stances, there are fewer groups that do likewise for conservative women, the Rutgers study found. Former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has supported a number of conservative women candidates through her political action committee SarahPAC. Her campaigning and fundraising efforts benefited such candidates as New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte in 2010 and this year Joni Ernst, a Senate candidate from Iowa who won her primary Tuesday night, among others. SHE PAC, a conservative women's group, is supporting Love, who won her primary, in her House bid and Monica Wehby, an Oregon doctor who also won her primary and is running for the Senate, among other candidates. As for Harold, she said she would consider another run at public office. But she cautions that her tale highlights some of the possible pitfalls. ""Fundraising and party support are imperative if women are going to gain leadership in the Republican Party,"" Harold said.

"Gun debate? What gun debate?  Americans seem to have this settled. Yes, we witnessed on our TV screens this week yet another parade of children being evacuated from their school — this time in Oregon -- their arms held high to show they were not armed as they fled a 15-year-old shooter who police said took the life of their 14-year-old classmate. But Americans, ever more desensitized to the school/mall/navy yard attacks that come, weekly, into their lives, don't seem to want to talk about a gun problem.  Americans remain pleased for the general population -- even 15-year-old kids -- to have nearly unfettered access to all manner of firearms, including assault rifles.  Even the President seems to have acquiesced. A tweet from @WhiteHouse: ""'If public opinion does not demand change in Congress, it will not change.' -- President Obama on legislation to prevent gun violence."" What this means is that we've accepted school shootings and other random mass shootings as a normal part of life in America, no matter how they affect the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness that was first announced in the Declaration of Independence, some 13 years before our oft-quoted Constitution and the Bill of Rights. I guess that's not surprising: We accept collateral damage for other privileges we enjoy.  We tolerate a certain number of drunk driving deaths, more than 10,000 in 2012,  and there's little public outcry for greater restrictions.  We've been willing to sacrifice nearly 7,000 soldiers (and tens of thousands wounded) in two wars to maintain our political influence in the Middle East.   About 400 children drown each year in pools and spas,  but we're not scrambling to outlaw summer fun. Why should guns be any different?  In the United States only about 10 people out of every 100,000 are killed by guns, or a little more than 30,000 per year (As a reference, we lost about 60,000 soldiers in the Vietnam War). This is clearly an acceptable sacrifice to make to maintain our sacred, un-infringed right to bear arms, no? After all, I've been told by some gun-rights advocates that reasonable restrictions on gun ownership will undoubtedly send us down a slippery slope to the abolition of all guns in America.  And if we didn't have unfettered access to guns, think about what would happen: We would be overrun by a foreign power; our government would assume totalitarian control and burn the Constitution; and criminal gangs, the only people left with guns, would run roughshod over all law-abiding citizens. If you suggest, as I have, that we should place reasonable restrictions on guns, then you are clearly a delusional or ignorant pacifist who has been dropped on his head. What part of ""shall not be infringed"" don't you understand? they ask. (For the record, I'm a responsible gun owner.) I'm confident that in the next few weeks there will be another school shooting.  I'm confident because there have been 74 shootings on or around schools or colleges in the year and a half since the Sandy Hook massacre. That's averaging one a week. I'll repeat: We have a gun problem in this country. Reasonable restrictions on guns will not lead to totalitarianism and anarchy.  Suffering 30,000 gun deaths annually is not a reasonable sacrifice to make in order to blindly maintain our unrestricted gun culture, particularly when the rallying cry is an outdated reference concerning infringement which, known to anyone who has actually studied the Constitution and our founding fathers who drafted it, was a reference to the then-existing reality that young men, when called upon to defend the state and the laws of the state, were expected to provide their own arms. Listen, reasonable restrictions are necessary to assure the continued viability of our Second Amendment rights, and to curb the unnecessary bloodshed caused by the proliferation of guns into hands of irresponsible people who care little about constitutional rights, and less about the sanctity of life.  Like that of a boy in Oregon, who was shot dead.","Mark O'Mara: America appears to have settled its gun debate .

"Dressed in all white with a striped shawl across his shoulders, the gaunt American looks up at the Black Hawk chopper circling overhead. Armed Taliban men stand around him, one with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher ready. When the chopper lands, the American is led there by two men, one carrying a white flag. He is given a pat-down, loaded on to the helicopter and whisked away. A new video released by the Taliban showed the final moments of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's five years in captivity, just before he was handed over to the United States. As debate over the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's release showed no signs of slowing Wednesday, the video revealed intriguing clues about Bergdahl, his Taliban captors and his American rescuers. The narration on the video says the transfer took place in Khost province, in eastern Afghanistan. ""We had a number of tribal elders with us ... in order to build trust between us and the other side,"" a voice in the video says. ""We told them that we had warned all our Mujahideen fighters in Khost province and especially in Batai area not to attack them."" The 17-minute video also showed an unusual sight: Taliban members shaking hands with men from the Black Hawk. The Pentagon said Wednesday it has no reason to doubt the video's authenticity. ""But we are reviewing it,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""Regardless, we know the transfer was peaceful and successful, and our focus remains on getting Sgt. Bergdahl the care he needs."" Mike Baker, a former covert operations officer for the CIA, said there's a clear purpose behind the video. ""The Taliban doesn't operate in a bubble. They don't live in a cave. They understand the importance of social media. They understand the importance of marketing and public relations,"" he told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. ""This is a scripted propaganda piece for them. ... And so they're doing this, in a sense, to show their credibility, to show their strength as warriors to their supporters, and to try to use it as a recruiting tool."" Bowe Bergdahl: Strong, well-rounded and easy to talk to, friends say . Surrounded by Mujahideen . At one point in the video, Taliban members start chanting, ""Long live Mujahideen of Afghanistan, long live Mullah Omar, the leader of Taliban."" Mujahideen refers to those who carry out jihad. The narrator's voice said armed fighters were stationed throughout the transfer area. ""We waited in the area for around 10 minutes before the helicopters arrived, and there were 18 Mujahideen fighters with me in the area,"" the narrator said. Indeed, the video showed armed men perched high and low on nearby hillsides. ""Our arrangement was that once the helicopters are on the ground, three people from the other side would get off the helicopter and three from our side, including the captive, would move toward the helicopter to hand him over."" The video has few words in English, other than this message superimposed over Bergdahl: . ""Don'come back to afghanistan"" Narrator in video: 'He was fine' In the video, the narrator also gives his opinion about an issue that's become a focal point since Bergdahl's release: the soldier's health. ""They first asked us about the health condition of the captive and told us to tell them the truth if he was not well, but we saw him, that he was fine, and we told them that,"" the narrator says. Since announcing Bergdahl's release over the weekend, Obama administration officials have repeatedly said they fast-tracked the operation over concerns about his health and safety, which appeared to be in jeopardy. Recent intelligence, in addition to two proof-of-life videos of Bergdahl released in recent months, led to growing concern about his health and safety, a senior defense official said Wednesday. Chris Voss, the FBI's former lead international hostage negotiator, said that might have been exactly what Bergdahl's captors wanted. ""You expect the hostage-takers to make it look like the hostage is in bad shape so that they can drive a better bargain, and clearly it looks to me that's what they did here,"" he told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Wednesday. Deserter or hero? National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Bergdahl served with honor and distinction. But there's a growing chorus of criticism from some who served with him, describing him as a deserter. ""I believe that he totally deserted not only his fellow soldiers, but his leadership that wanted the best for him and for our country,"" said former Army Staff Sgt. Justin Gerleve, who was Bergdahl's squad leader. Some soldiers involved in operations to find Bergdahl have said at least six soldiers were killed searching for him. Asked about this point, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters Wednesday that he did not know of specific circumstances or details of soldiers dying as a result of the efforts to find Bergdahl. Gerleve told ""The Lead"" that he believes Bergdahl is at least partly to blame for the soldiers' deaths. ""I can't really say I blame Bergdahl to fullest extent, but if he wouldn't have deserted us, these soldiers very well could have been in a different place at a different time,"" he said. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after Bergdahl's 2009 disappearance concluded that he left his outpost deliberately and on his own free will, according to a U.S. military official briefed on the report. The official spoke to CNN on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the information. There was no definitive finding Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something Army officials couldn't do without talking to the soldier. On Wednesday, a U.S. official said that commanders referred to Bergdahl as a ""good soldier"" in that initial fact-finding report, and that fellow soldiers said he'd left the post on other occasions. The official, who has been briefed on the investigation, said the report said that Bergdahl had mailed his computer and other items home before his disappearance, but his motivation was unclear. Hagel said Wednesday that it's ""unfair"" to Bergdahl and his family to presume anything about his motivations for leaving the base. He reiterated that the Army will conduct a review of the case. Hagel spoke with Bergdahl's family via telephone Wednesday, a senior Defense official told reporters. The defense secretary reassured them that Bergdahl would continue getting support with regard to his medical care and reintegration, and that the department was focused on their son's health, the official said. Bergdahl will remain at a U.S. Army medical center in Germany until he completes treatment, a U.S. defense official there told CNN. After that, Bergdahl will return to the United States and go to a San Antonio military base, the official said. As the debate over Bergdahl showed no sign of slowing Wednesday, his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, canceled a ""Bowe is Back"" event planned to celebrate his return ""in the interest of public safety."" Organizers, the city said, expected a large number of supporters and protesters to increase attendance. ""Hailey, a town of 8,000, does not have the infrastructure to support an event of the size this could become,"" the city said. Controversial swap . Bergdahl's captors handed him over to the United States in exchange for the release of five prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Gitmo detainees swapped for Bergdahl: Who are they? Both Democrats and Republicans have criticized the deal, arguing that it puts American lives at risk by releasing terrorists and accusing Obama of breaking the law by not notifying Congress 30 days in advance. Administration officials have said they consulted the Justice Department and acted legally. But some Republican lawmakers have said they're not buying that argument, and want proof that Bergdahl's health was really in jeopardy. ""This American is going home to his family,"" Sen. Marco Rubio told CNN's ""The Situation Room"" before heading into a classified Senate briefing on Bergdahl on Wednesday. ""These five members of the Taliban are going back to the battlefield."" Afterward, Rubio and several other Republicans told reporters that the briefing had done nothing to stem their skepticism. ""I remain increasingly convinced that the President has now set a precedent that will encourage enemies of the United States to target American men and women in uniform,"" he said. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, said criticism from lawmakers who'd long been pushing for Obama to help bring Bergdahl home is ""disingenuous."" ""We had intelligence, from everything that I understand ... that this was our last, best opportunity, that he was potentially on death's door. Looking at grainy video is not a way for us to determine that. But from everything I understand, this was our last best opportunity,"" she said. John Bellinger, a former State Department legal adviser in President George W. Bush's administration, told CNN that the prisoner swap deal was ""defensible."" ""This is one of those tough national security situations that presidents face,"" he said, ""where all the options are bad."" Clinton wanted a tougher deal with Taliban for Bergdahl?

"It's the earthquake that rocked the GOP. In a year when mainstream Republicans have mostly bested tea party-backed challengers, a little-known and little-funded tea party challenger in Virginia's 7th Congressional District pulled the upset of the year, defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor by 10 percentage points. The victory by economics professor Dave Brat gives the tea party an instant jolt of energy, sends shock waves through Capitol Hill, shakes up the GOP House hierarchy -- as Cantor was seen by many as the next speaker -- and effectively kills any chance of immigration reform passing through the House any time soon. ""I think this is a scale eight earthquake. I think it will shock the Washington establishment; it will shock the House Republicans,"" former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said. ""It certainly upsets the balance of power inside the Republican conference. And combined with the results last week in Mississippi, it sends a pretty strong signal that while money matters, voters may matter more, and people have to have a little respect for the right of the voter to have attention paid to them, and the right of the voter to throw people out if they're not happy with them,"" added Gingrich, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate and co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" Cantor becomes only the second member of Congress running for re-election this year to go down in defeat in the primaries, following 91-year-old Republican Rep. Ralph Hall of Texas. Longtime Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi may soon become the third. He's fighting for his political life as he faces a primary runoff election in two weeks against a tea party-backed state senator who narrowly edged him in last week's primary but not by enough to win outright. ""This victory is the 'Pulp Fiction' equivalent of the adrenaline needle plunged into the chest of the tea party,"" said GOP consultant Ron Bonjean, who served as a top strategist and adviser to House and Senate Republican leaders. ""They had largely conceded most of the Republican primaries to the establishment."" Brent Bozell, an anti-establishment leader and ""ForAmerica"" chairman, proclaimed that ""Eric Cantor's loss tonight is an apocalyptic moment for the GOP establishment. The grass-roots is in revolt and marching."" Eric Cantor loses primary in big upset; Lindsey Graham avoids runoff . How Cantor lost . In the primary's closing days, aides close to Cantor said they expected the majority leader to win around 60% of the vote in his primary. He didn't come close. ""Obviously, we came up short,"" the seven-term congressman told supporters as he conceded the race. Cantor apparently didn't read the pulse of conservatives in his Republican-dominated district, which is anchored in the Richmond area but stretches some 100 miles from the Tidewater to the outer reaches of the Washington exurbs. ""Eric Cantor lost this race as much as Dave Brat won it. Two years ago, Eric Cantor got 37,000 votes in his primary. Nine thousand fewer votes this time. He simply violated rule number one of politics: Go home,"" said CNN chief national correspondent John King. ""This is Eric Cantor's fault. He was in Washington on primary day, not back in his district."" Cantor also turned down last-minute help from political allies. ""His confidence, his arrogance, his smugness cost him his seat,"" King added. ""My sense from talking to people in the 7th is that he had lost touch with the base of the Republican Party there, and by the time he realized it and tried to make amends, it was too late,"" Virginia political analyst Quentin Kidd said. ""The real problem that the (tea party) base had with Cantor is that they got to where they didn't trust him,"" added Kidd, director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. ""The issue that broke the bank for him was immigration. They saw him say one thing in Washington, then say something else to them, and it caused deep distrust in the district."" Cantor's campaign shelled out a couple of million dollars in television and radio ads to send its message that Cantor was ""a strong conservative."" It outspent Brat's by more than 10 to 1. To put it another way, Cantor spent well over $100 for each vote that he won. Brat spent around $5 per vote. In his victory speech, Brat told supporters, ""Dollars do not vote -- you do."" Brat framed his challenge as another case of a grass-roots conservative taking on the GOP establishment, a major theme in Republican contests this year. And Brat made immigration reform the central issue and said Cantor's position would hurt the economy. ""The amnesty issue is the symbolic powerful expression about the difference between Eric and I on jobs,"" Brat said. Cantor has publicly supported proposals allowing children of those who enter the country illegally -- so-called Dreamers -- the ability to obtain some type of legal status. But Cantor opposed the bill passed by the Senate last year that included a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. Cantor's team pushed back, calling Brat, a ""liberal college professor."" That worked against him, Kidd said. ""His negative turn played into this narrative that Cantor couldn't be trusted ... that he was out of touch with the conservative principles of the district, and was using Washington-style campaign tactics to beat his opponent down."" Brat's victory may have also been fueled by popular conservative talk radio host Laura Ingraham, who was an early supporter. ""The seeds for Brat's upset were sown on right-wing radio talk shows, particularly Laura Ingraham's,"" CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter said. ""This time last week, Ingraham was busy headlining a giant rally for Brat. On Tuesday, her website implored fans to vote for him."" Two pieces of irony: Cantor's defeat comes just three days after Virginia Republicans, meeting at their state party convention, nominated Ed Gillespie -- the poster boy for ""inside the beltway"" Republicans -- as the party's U.S. Senate nominee. And Cantor's loss also came on the same night that GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a frequent target of conservatives, easily bested six primary challengers from the right. Aftershocks on Capitol Hill . In his 13 years in Congress, Cantor has rocketed up the ranks, all the way to majority leader, the No. 2 spot in the House Republican leadership. And Cantor was seen by many as biding his time until the eventual retirement of House Speaker John Boehner. Now that succession is upended, and Cantor's defeat will only embolden the powerful tea party wing in the House. Conservatives will most likely demand that Cantor be replaced with someone on the right. ""It's going to speed up the process of tea party members positioning themselves for a leadership run. This stunning news could be the first shot in an all-out war between the establishment and tea party over leadership control,"" said Bonjean, the GOP consultant. The No. 3 House Republican, Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, is popular among members and has chits from many of the freshman and sophomores he helped elect. But because he's part of the current GOP leadership lineup, many tea party groups and members on the right of the conference don't trust him as a solid conservative. He is likely to want to move up to Cantor's post, but could draw a challenge. Some are floating House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan's name, but a source close to the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee calls those rumors ""baseless and unfounded"" and notes that Ryan batted down questions about his interest in any run for the top spot. But because the news of Cantor's defeat is still sinking in, members are still calling around and testing the temperature for what should happen next. Cantor's defeat also effectively kills any hopes that the House will pass an immigration reform bill. ""It's going to be a tough case to make that immigration is going to be brought to the House floor anytime soon,"" Bonjean said. CNN senior political analyst David Gergen agreed. ""For Cantor to be knocked off by a tea party conservative over his efforts to push for immigration reform and his earlier efforts to lift the debt ceiling, I think it will send shock waves through Republican ranks."" Look at the price he paid for doing things the majority of Americans support,"" said Gergen, a senior adviser to both Democratic and Republican presidents.

"Pakistan continued its crackdown on militants in North Waziristan for a sixth day Tuesday, killing more than 20 Taliban and other fighters with airstrikes, the Pakistani army said. Airstrikes early Tuesday killed 25 local and foreign militants at six terrorist hideouts, including a training camp and an IED-making factory, the army said in a statement. Over six days, more than 200 militants have been killed in airstrikes and ground assaults. At least eight soldiers have died in the fighting, which started after an airport attack in Karachi on June 10 by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. The group said the attack was carried out with the Pakistani Taliban. Dozens died during the siege of Pakistan's largest airport, including the assailants. A curfew remains in effect, and all routes leading to North Waziristan remain sealed off with no one allowed to move out. Northwestern Pakistan is home to loosely governed tribal areas. It's also a base for foreign fighters and a refuge for members of the Islamist militant Haqqani movement.","An army crackdown on militants in North Waziristan has killed more than 200 over six days .

"They come in all sizes and shapes, athletes do, small and tall, round and lean. They come with all kinds of personalities as well. Some are cheerful as a cheerleader and sunny as a summer's morn. They do more than just impress you, on the field or off; they delight you. Precious few have been the equal of Tony Gwynn, when it comes to a combination of superhuman prowess plus an everyman's way of coming across not as someone to idolize but more like your drop-by-for-coffee neighbor next door. When he died Monday, cut down at 54 by a mouth cancer that spread, Major League Baseball mourned. Baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn dies . The statistics of Anthony Keith Gwynn are so off-the-chart absurd, they almost make a baseball lover laugh out loud: In the 20 seasons he played (all for the same team, the San Diego Padres), he did not slug home runs the way Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron or Barry Bonds did; on the contrary, a mere 135 homers in all that time? Ha, you would think this Gwynn must have been a 98-pound weakling, rather than the chubby-cheeked, tubby-tummied specimen that he was. What he did do was hit the ball. In his two decades, in 9,288 official at-bats, Gwynn struck out a grand total of 434 times. A pitcher couldn't get a pitch by him. It was the old ""like trying to throw a lamb chop past a wolf"" kind of joke. You chucked it, Tony Gwynn knocked it. A single to left, to center, to right, wherever he darn well pleased. He looked like a slow-pitch softball batter who decided to poke a ball anywhere he liked. Except he did this against young, rock-abbed, iron-armed men who could hurl a hardball between 90 and 100 mph. Gwynn's lifetime tally of 3,141 hits exceeded  that of Rod Carew, Al Kaline, Roberto Clemente, Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig... His career batting average of .338 was the kind kids fantasize about when they are up-and-comers, watching videos of themselves, trying to learn how to hit. The ballpark figures this Hall of Famer etched into the game's record books are exceptional. Yet there was so much more to Gwynn: a perpetually happy and humble human being. A couple of examples, just to get the ball rolling: . The year was 1984 and the San Diego Padres had made it to the World Series at last. Game 1 was about to be played there in southernmost Southern California, in a town known far more for its beauty than its baseball. Tony Gwynn sat in a dugout, taking on all comers, talking to reporters and teammates and TV cameramen and vendors and batboys. ""Don't you just love baseball?"" Gwynn asked at one point of no one in particular. He and the Padres were expected by many to lose to the Detroit Tigers, a very strong team that year. ""If we do lose,"" Tony the non-Tiger said, ""hooray for the Tigers. Somebody's going to win, so if it can't be us, hooray for them."" Don't you just love that? The lack of intensity, solemnity, fear that his observation would be interpreted in some negative way? Kirk Gibson, star of the opposing team, was the kind of guy who would have stared daggers at a teammate who fraternized with the enemy. Gwynn sought them out, trying to find Tigers before the game, eager as a frisky puppy to make friends and then go play. He had a brother, name of Chris, who got to play on his team. In 1996, the Padres were up north in Tony's birthplace of Los Angeles for a big game. It was decided on a clutch 11th-inning double by a pinch-hitter -- yep, Chris Gwynn, the lesser of the Gwynn brothers historically, and it won the division championship for the Padres. ""Aren't you Chris Gwynn's brother?"" a reporter joked. ""I am today!"" Tony exulted. He loved his brother. He loved pretty much everybody. Including his own son, Tony Gwynn Jr., who also made it to the major leagues. Brother and son might not have been in Tony's league (as it were), but those Gwynns, they could play this game. Tony Jr. was succinct and sincere on Twitter when the bad news came Monday: ""Today I lost my Dad, my best friend and my mentor. I'm gonna miss u so much, pops."" Tony Gwynn and a habit all too common in baseball . He had a cherubic face and a soft and nasal voice, a little bit Walter Payton, a little bit Wayne Newton. He had the torso of a nonathlete and his cheeks were puffed by smokeless tobacco, a habit that likely killed him. He endured oral surgery in 2010 and again in 2012, and there had been a growing dread that his days were numbered. Tony Gwynn is gone? Say it ain't so. He didn't play for New York or St. Louis or San Francisco. He played against them. But he played for all of us, watching him with that bat, waggling it, digging in, smacking a ball where it couldn't be caught. He would smile, patting the other side's fielder on the back, while the rest of us turned to each other, shook our heads and said something like, ""Man, that guy can hit.""","Mike Downey: Tony Gwynn had dazzling baseball, but he kept his humility, common touch .

"In what's being described as a political ""earthquake,"" a tea party neophyte booted the No. 2 House Republican, Eric Cantor, from office. But the tea party suffered a setback in South Carolina, where incumbent Lindsey Graham prevailed to avoid a runoff. Cantor conceded the race with 99% of precincts reporting from the Richmond-area district showing him trailing Dave Brat 56% to 44%, according to the Virginia Secretary of State's website. Turnout was low. ""Obviously we came up short,"" Cantor said in his concession speech. ""It's disappointing sure but I believe in this country. I believe there is opportunity around the next corner for all of us,"" said Cantor, whose loss is all the more shocking because he's considered very conservative. In a statement following Cantor's defeat, House Speaker John Boehner called the No. 2 Republican ""a good friend and a great leader."" In his victory speech, Brat struck a populist tone. ""Dollars do not vote, you do,"" he said. ""When I go to D.C., every vote I take will move the pendulum in the direction of the people, away from Washington, D.C.; back to the states; back to the localities; and back to you."" Mark Preston, CNN's executive political editor, said the defeat would have national implications since Cantor has been viewed as ambitious and a potential speaker. ""This came out of nowhere,"" Preston said. CNN Political Analyst David Gergen called it an ""earthquake"" that would ""send shock waves through the Republican ranks."" Cantor 'earthquake' rattles Capitol Hill . Graham wins in South Carolina . Although the tea party won big in the Old Dominion, it met defeat in South Carolina, where incumbent Sen. Lindsey Graham handled challengers from the right and easily topped the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff. Graham had some advantages heading into the contest: He had a massive war chest -- around $8 million cash on hand, which gave him a huge campaign cash advantage over his primary opponents -- and outside groups have steered clear of the race, unlike in Mississippi where establishment and tea party groups fought. ""Leadership and problem solving comes with some political risk. You get a bunch of people running against you, but I'm here to tell you, it's very much worth it,"" Graham said in his victory speech. A boost for the right . Brat's victory is another tea party blockbuster, reminiscent of its banner year in 2010 when those conservatives swept Republicans to control of the House. Most recently, Republican candidate Chris McDaniel in Mississippi gained more votes than longtime Republican Sen. Thad Cochran and forced a runoff, which McDaniel is expected to win. Key races to watch . Another notable conservative takeover was in 2012 when tea party favorite Ted Cruz defeated Texas Lt. Gov David Dewhurst in the state's Senate GOP primary. Dewhurst had support of most Texas mainstream Republicans. â€Ž . CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash said the outcome in Cantor's race will re-energize the tea party fueled right and disrupt attempts to bridge gaps between archconservatives and establishment Republicans in Congress. It could also cloud any prospects the White House and moderates might have for any legislative gains, Bash said. ""This will throw it all up in the air,"" Bash noted. Most Republicans viewed Cantor, 51, as the most conservative member in the House leadership and a potential successor to Boehner. Two sources familiar with the thinking of House Speaker John Boehner told Bash that it is now less likely with Cantor out of the picture that he will retire. Voters rose up . Although Cantor dramatically outspent Brat in a race most political observers anticipated he would win, the cash advantage didn't affect the outcome. CNN ""Crossfire"" host Newt Gingrich suggested that a large part of Cantor's constituency in Virginia's reliably conservative 7th Congressional District concluded that he wasn't listening and rose up to toss him out. Losing, Gingrich said, was by no means the end of his political career, noting that he has a ""great record,"" is a hard worker and could come back if he wants to. Cantor was President Barack Obama's chief foil in budget negotiations in 2011, a role he proudly pointed out during this campaign season. Promised a shocker . Brat, who predicted a shocker on Tuesday, is an economics professor at Randolph-Macon College. His Democratic opponent in November, Jack Trammell, also teaches at the school outside Richmond. Trammell was nominated at a party convention and is thought to have a very tough road ahead. In a phone interview with CNN on Monday, Brat argued that Cantor was more attentive to donors in New York and California and big business groups than he is to enacting an agenda based on Republican ideals. ""While he's got an eye on the speaker job, he's turned his back on his constituents,"" Brat said. He noted that Cantor and other GOP leaders have dropped their free market principles and not done enough to address looming deficit problems. Brat attempted to frame his challenge as another case of a grassroots conservative taking on the GOP establishment, a major theme in Republican contests this year. He has tried to make immigration reform the central issue and said Cantor's position would hurt the economy. Brat said Cantor's campaign ads actually elevated his name and helped his low-budget campaign, which was supported by some heavyweights in conservative media. A Boehner bypass?

"An abandoned subway terminal in New York City is being pitched for redevelopment into a sunlit, subterranean park -- replete with 60,000 square feet of flowers, ponds and trees. Located in Manhattan's trendy Lower East Side, the vast underground space -- which is about the size of a football field -- has remained untouched since the terminal was discontinued back in 1948. Now, a group of entrepreneurs are proposing an elaborate green makeover, in which sunlight would be ""harvested"" above ground and channeled into the vaults below via a network of fiber-optic cables -- creating an environment apparently filled with natural light and, in theory, ripe for growing all the foliage of a typical city park. ""Effectively, we'd gather an image of the sky and sun at street level and distribute it underground,"" said James Ramsey, former NASA satellite engineer-turned-architect and the brains behind the idea. Ramsey began developing the Delancey Underground project (named after the old New York street under which the park is planned) after persuading the local transport authorities to give him, and co-founder Dan Barasch, a guided tour of its derelict carriage terminal. ""Sixty years of accumulated filth aside, I was struck by the beautiful historic qualities of the space -- with its cobblestone floors, original footway tiles and high-vaulted arched ceiling,"" recalled Ramsey. ""These are all features we'd love to see carried through, but with the futuristic addition of a fully functioning community park."" Read related: Could 'Earthscraper' really turn architecture on its head? Ramsey and Barasch's romantic vision includes a polished, undulating ceiling plane from which the ""remote skylights"" -- developed by Ramsay to filter out harmful ultraviolet and infrared light frequencies -- will flood the park with sunrays all year-round, night and day. According to Ramsey, the technology is ""like a cross between a  telescope and an endoscope"" -- capturing light from the sun and then transporting it through fiber-optic cables onto a relatively small focal point. ""Of course the lighting will be supplemented with an electric supply at night and during cloudy periods ... and we'll also need additional energy for a ventilation system,"" said Ramsey. ""But for both cost and environmental purposes, any additional energy use will be as green and efficient as possible,"" he added. Comment:  Would you give them your support? Is the ""Delancey Underground"" project a feasible and much needed innovation or a pretty but impractical pipe dream? Tell us you thoughts in the comments section below. Despite the possibility of this additional energy consumption, Barasch -- who also works for an NGO promoting socially innovative applications of technology -- is resolute about the park's eco-credentials. ""This will be a distinctive testament to the varied applications and incredible promise of solar power,"" he said. ""It would also bring a slice of nature into one of New York's least green areas, and encourage people to think about their relationship with the environment."" The plans have drawn comparisons with the popular High Line -- another park built along an old railway way line -- in this case high above the city streets in New York's Lower West Side. ""Rather than demolish what was there and replace it with shiny new office blocks or expensive apartments, the existing structure has been re-imagined to become a sustainable space for everyone to enjoy ... and we have very similar aims in that respect,"" said Ramsey. The terminal is currently under the control of the transport authority, and they have agreed to listen to the duo's pitch -- but made it clear they will not submit any funding for the construction of the park. ""In the end, we will have to compete with other proposals, which will no doubt offer compelling commercial arguments for things like a car-parking lot or shopping mall,"" said Ramsey, who plans to finance the entire initiative through private funding and donations. The duo say it's too early to put a price on how much the park will cost to build and run, but they are currently in the process of raising $400,000 for a full-scale demonstration of the ""skylight"" technology and a thorough feasibility study regarding the structural and ventilation conditions of the terminal. Barasch says that after a recent spate of community meetings, they also have the enthusiastic support of the locals.","A group of entrepreneurs are proposing an an underground garden for New York .

"The force was with Chicago. The Windy City beat out other cities, including a contentious battle against San Francisco, winning the bid to build an interactive museum for ""Star Wars"" creator George Lucas. ""This is a milestone for the city,"" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Tuesday after the decision was announced. ""This is a tremendous opportunity for the city."" The decision was a stunning upset for San Francisco. Lucas has plenty of ties to the Bay Area. He's from Modesto, California, and built his Skywalker ranch complex in Marin County north of the city. He started other ventures over the years also based in the Bay Area, including Lucasfilm Ltd. Lucas said in a news release Tuesday that choosing Chicago over San Francisco was the ""right decision for the museum, but a difficult decision for me personally because of my strong personal and professional roots in San Francisco."" San Francisco Mayor Edwin M. Lee said there was a lot of support for the Lucas museum in his city. But Lee also said he understood why the iconic movie producer searched for sites in other cities for the cultural center. ""The Presidio Trust unwisely rejected Mr. Lucas' proposal for a site near Crissy Field, which ... forced Mr. Lucas to look to cities like Chicago, and put San Francisco's chance at landing the museum in jeopardy,"" Lee said in a statement Tuesday . The location for the future Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in Chicago, along the city's famed lakefront as part of what's known as the museum campus, was a deciding factor. Chicago was chosen ""because of the quality of the site proposed by the city's task force. The 17-acre site offers unparalleled visitor access,"" a news release said. The campus is already home to the Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum and the Adler Planetarium. Lucas' wife, Mellody Hobson, also calls Chicago home. She's the president of Chicago-based  Ariel Investments and sits on numerous corporate boards. The new museum . The Chicago task force picked the location for the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art based on the site's accessibility to public transportation and easy access. But the potential to create green spaces was important, too. To accommodate the museum, existing parking spaces will be moved underground and acres of asphalt will be replaced with more parkland along the harbor, museum officials said in statement. Final plans for the construction of the museum are expected this fall. The museum will display some of Lucas' extensive collection of artwork, including paintings by Norman Rockwell, Maxfield Parrish and N.C. Wyeth. It will also feature his large collection of movie posters and memorabilia, including props from his ""Star Wars"" films and others. The museum is also billed as a ""gathering place to experience narrative art and the evolution of the visual image -- from illustration to cinema to digital arts,"" according to a news release. ""No other museum like this exists in the world, making it a tremendous educational, cultural and job creation asset for all Chicagoans, as well as an unparalleled draw for international tourists,"" said Emanuel. Lucas film history . Lucas created the blockbuster ""Star Wars"" franchise with the release of the first film, ""Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope"" in 1977. The film was a box office sensation and won seven Academy Awards. He also made the ""Indiana Jones"" series of movies with famed director and friend Steven Spielberg.

"President Barack Obama's announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage reflects a dramatic shift taking place across the country. Last year, for the first time, polls found a majority of Americans share that stance. Surveys show the country's position has undergone a rapid change over the past 15 years -- one not seen on other issues. On climate change, abortion and the death penalty, ""we're not seeing Americans necessarily becoming more liberal,"" said Frank Newport, editor in chief of Gallup. ""This one stands a little alone."" Views of same-sex marriage around the world . In 1996, Gallup found 27% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, while 68% opposed it. Last year, 53% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed. This year, Gallup found the country almost evenly split, with 50% supporting same-sex marriage and 48% against it. Sampling error could explain the apparent change from 2011. A CNN/ORC International poll found in September that 53% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, up from 44% in 2008. American attitudes have seen dramatic changes on some other issues, Newport noted, but the changes generally have taken much longer. ""The number of people who said they would vote for an otherwise well-qualified black president used to be well below 50%, but decades later it's up to 95% or higher,"" he said. It's been similar for the idea of a woman president. Two main factors are driving the increased acceptance of same-sex marriage, said David Masci, senior researcher with the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, whose surveys have found a similar change. The first is ""a cultural shift that's been going on for decades -- not just same-sex marriage, but broader acceptance of gays and lesbians."" He points to changing depictions of gay people and fictional characters in media -- something Vice President Joe Biden referred to Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Biden apologizes to Obama for putting him in tough spot . The sitcom ""'Will and Grace' probably did more to educate the American public than almost anything anybody's ever done so far,"" Biden said. The second key factor, Masci said, is young people. So-called Millennials, born since 1981, are by far the most supportive of same-sex marriage. Obama, in announcing his new stance this week, pointed out that his daughters have ""parents whose friends are same-sex couples. It wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated differently. And frankly, that's the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective."" He also said college Republicans he meets, who dislike his economic and foreign policies, often express support for same-sex marriage. Pew found 63% of Millennials support same-sex marriage, while 30% of people born between 1928 and 1945 support it. So the changing attitudes in America aren't just the result of people changing their minds. They're also the result of a changing electorate. As more young people become old enough to be polled and vote, and more of the oldest Americans die, the figure skews upward. Still, Pew found that even among the oldest Americans, support for same-sex marriage has gone up over the past 10 years. And while younger people sometimes move toward more conservative positions as they get older, Newport said the change on same-sex marriage ""seems like something that will stick with them."" There have been a few years recently in which polls found support for same-sex marriage had dropped slightly. However, Gallup and Pew found those in different years, and pollsters said they can't be sure what caused the change. An increase in opposition sometimes follows a controversial court decision, they said. Across the country, there are regional differences in where voters stand, which partly explains why North Carolina this week became the 31st state in which voters supported a constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Also, the national surveys assess overall voter attitudes -- not just the attitudes of those who will show up to vote on a specific question in a specific state. While the survey trends are unmistakable, they could reverse themselves at any time, Masci says. ""One thing to be careful about is the idea of an inevitable march toward acceptance of (same-sex marriage).  If I were a betting man I would be, but there's no guarantee,"" he said. And, he said, ""it doesn't mean that five or 10 years down the road we won't still be a divided country on this.""","Gallup and CNN polls in 2011 found the majority of Americans supported same-sex marriage .
Usually such changes take place over longer blocks of time, a pollster says .

"Today millions of Egyptians are going to the ballot boxes to decide on a new constitution, the third time they have done so in as many years. They are voting with high hopes that this referendum will put an end to the bloodshed, social tensions and instability that followed the ouster of the Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013. Seen as the lynchpin in the ""roadmap"" that was declared soon thereafter, the referendum is to be followed by presidential and parliamentary elections. Once these elections are conducted, it is hoped that Egypt's revolution, which erupted exactly three years ago, will have accomplished its goals. However, hopes that this referendum offers a panacea to Egypt's deep problems are wishful thinking. The referendum is being conducted under measures that can only be described as draconian. An anti-demonstration law has recently been passed and put into effect with the result that dozens of young activists who were instrumental in the 2011 revolution -- but who continue to be critical of the military -- are now behind bars. A ferocious publicity campaign urging people to vote ""yes"" is constantly blaring out of government and private media outlets. Human Rights Watch says seven members of the opposition Strong Egypt party were recently arrested for hanging posters saying ""no"" to the proposed constitution. The army is expected to deploy 160,000 troops with thousands of tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopters to ""protect the voting process."" The outcome of the referendum is not in doubt. If the preliminary results of the vote of ex-pat Egyptians who have already cast their ballots are anything to go by, the constitutional draft is expected to pass with an overwhelming majority that may approach 90%. And it would be a mistake to believe that this outcome is the result only of army manipulation, intimidation and threats. There are millions of Egyptians who are willingly standing behind General Abdel-Fattah el-Sisi -- the Minister of Defense and the mastermind of the roadmap. Three years into the revolution, they are tired of the political instability, lack of security and deteriorating economic conditions. In el-Sisi they see a savior whom they believe is the only one capable of lifting the country out of its crisis. Still others have become suspicious of the revolutionary youth whom they accuse of being inexperienced, irresponsible and untrustworthy. But most have been so frightened by the Muslim Brotherhood's brief rule and what they see as its dangerous, undemocratic maverick politics that they decided to give up essential liberty and purchase a little temporary safety. However, while the outcome of the referendum is assured, so too is el-Sisi's failure to provide either safety or liberty to the millions of starry-eyed Egyptians. For one thing, Egypt's economy is nearing total collapse, with a recent report by Egypt's Ministry of International Cooperation showing annual growth rates plummeting from 7.2% before the revolution to a mere 2.1% in 2012-2013. According to the same report, the rate of unemployment rose from 8.4% to 13.2%, and poverty rates worsened -- from 19.6% in 2010 to 25.2% in 2013. Meanwhile, foreign reserves more than halved in the three years of the revolution. Equally dire is the political situation. While the Muslim Brotherhood is accused of failing fundamental democratic tests while in power, the subsequent hounding, arresting and killing of its members has only given the organization the kiss of life and assured its existence for generations to come. Economically and politically, therefore, Egypt's problems are of such a depth and complexity that they cannot be solved by force. A political solution is desperately needed, one that el-Sisi and his henchmen seem singularly incapable of offering. Egypt thus appears to be back where it was in 2011 when its revolution erupted. A military dictatorship seems to be re-establishing itself, and the notorious security forces appear to be back in business, with a vengeance. Still, as someone who took to the streets in 2011 against Mubarak, and again in 2012 and 2013 against Morsy, I am willing to take to the streets once more against this new military dictatorship that is poised to impose itself with a civilian veneer. And I know that I will not be alone. The many Egyptians who have participated in the 2011 revolution; those who have lost loved ones since then; the Muslim Brotherhood supporters who have been brutally suppressed and disenfranchised; and the many more who have become deeply engaged in politics hoping for a better future -- those millions of Egyptians cannot be wished away. They have become bolder, more vocal and more experienced. At the same time, the military has shown a dismal lack of political tact and strategic vision. Egypt's revolution, whose tragedy it is to tackle -- at the same time -- the two intractable questions of what should be the proper role of the military in politics and what should be the proper role of religion in politics, is still in its infancy. The road ahead is long and bumpy. But I have no doubt that the future belongs to us.","Egyptians are voting on a draft constitution that would give the military more power .

"Two veterans in a Veterans Affairs psychiatric facility languished for years without proper treatment, according to a scathing letter and report sent Monday to the White House by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, or OSC. In one case, a veteran with a service-connected psychiatric condition was in the facility for eight years before he received a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation; in another case, a veteran only had one psychiatric note in his medical chart in seven years as an inpatient at the Brockton, Massachusetts, facility. Examples such as those are the core of the report released Monday by the OSC, an independent government agency that protects whistleblowers. Read the OSC letterThe agency said it is still investigating more than 50 whistleblower disclosures involving patient health or safety allegations at the VA nationwide, and ""these cases represent more than a quarter of all matters referred by OSC for investigation government-wide,"" according to the report. Fear kept the VA scandal a secret . The report also slams the VA's medical review agency, the Office of the Medical Inspector, or OMI, for its refusal to admit that lapses in care have affected veterans' health. For example, when the office reviewed the Brockton psychiatric cases, it confirmed the patient neglect yet ""denied that... (it) had any impact on patient care."" ""The VA, and particularly the VA's Office of the Medical Inspector (OMI), has consistently used a 'harmless error' defense, where the Department acknowledges problems but claims patient care is unaffected,"" the OSC said. ""This approach hides the severity of systemic and longstanding problems."" In response to the OSC's letter, Sloan Gibson, the VA's acting director, issued a statement: ""I respect and welcome the letter and the insights from the Office of Special Counsel. I am deeply disappointed not only in the substantiation of allegations raised by whistleblowers, but also in the failures within VA to take whistleblower complaints seriously."" Gibson said he has directed a ""comprehensive review of all aspects of the Office of Medical Inspector's operation, to be completed within 14 days."" As part of its review, the OSC looked at whistleblower allegations at 10 VA hospitals, where it found the VA's review of cases ""appears to contradict its own findings."" According to the OSC, at a VA hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, the Office of Medical Inspector substantiated a number of allegations, including ""improper credentialing of providers, inadequate review of radiology images, unlawful prescriptions for narcotics, noncompliant pharmacy equipment used to compound chemotherapy drugs, and unsterile medical equipment."" ""In addition, a persistent patient-care concern involved chronic staffing shortages,"" which led to the creation of ""ghost clinics"" in which veterans were scheduled for appointments without an assigned provider and as a consequence were leaving the facility without receiving treatment. Despite the numerous lapses in care at the Jackson VA, the Office of Medical Inspector did not acknowledge any impact on the health and safety of veterans, according to the OSC letter. Monday's letter also outlined whistleblower complaints ranging from unsterlized surgical equipment in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to neglect of elderly residents at a geriatric facility in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to a pulmonologist in Montgomery, Alabama, who ""copied prior provider notes in over 1,200 patient records, likely resulting in inaccurate health information being recorded."" Other facilities with substantiated complaints include Grand Junction, Colorado;  Buffalo, New York; Little Rock, Arkansas; and Harlingen, Texas. The OSC said all these cases are ""part of a troubling pattern of deficient patient care at VA facilities nationwide, and the continued resistance by the VA, and the OMI in most cases, to recognize and address the impact of health and safety of veterans."" The agency also expressed concern that the VA hasn't adequately addressed whistleblower complaints of wrongdoing. Referring to the scandal of a secret wait list at the Phoenix VA facility, the OSC found that ""the recent revelations in Phoenix are the latest and most serious in the years-long pattern of disclosures from VA whistleblowers and their struggle to overcome a culture of non-responsiveness.  Too frequently, the VA has failed to use information from whistleblowers to identify and address systemic concerns that impact patient care."" At a facility in Fort Collins, Colorado, the Office of Medical Inspector substantiated allegations made by a VA employee, including a shortage of providers that led schedulers to cancel veterans' appointments. It found that 3,000 veterans were unable to reschedule appointments and that staff was instructed to alter wait times. In May, CNN interviewed Lisa Lee, who worked as a scheduler at the VA clinic in Fort Collins. ""We were sat down by our supervisor ... and he showed us exactly how to schedule so it looked like it was within that 14-day period,"" Lee told CNN. ""They would keep track of schedulers who were complying and getting 100 percent of that 14 day(s) and those of us who were not."" Despite its findings in Fort Collins, the Office of the Medical Inspector wrote that it ""could not substantiate that the failure to properly train staff resulted in danger to public health and safety."" In Monday's letter, the OSC disagreed with that determination, saying the VA's conclusion in this case ""is not only unsupportable on its own, but is also inconsistent by other VA components examining similar patient-care issues."" Since November 2013, CNN has been investigating and publishing reports of wait lists and deaths of veterans across VA hospitals across the country. In April, details of the secret wait list in Phoenix, and allegations of 40 veterans dying there while waiting for care, emerged when retired Phoenix VA physician Dr. Sam Foote stepped forward; Dr. Foote first appeared on CNN with details of what happened in Phoenix.

"(CNN)Charlie Sifford, the first African-American to play on the PGA Tour, died Tuesday at age 92, the Professional Golfers' Association of America said. ""His love of golf, despite many barriers in his path, strengthened him as he became a beacon for diversity in our game,"" PGA of America President Derek Sprague said in a statement. ""By his courage, Dr. Sifford inspired others to follow their dreams. ... Golf was fortunate to have had this exceptional American in our midst."" Sifford was called the Jackie Robinson of golf for breaking the color barrier in 1961 when he was 38 years old. ""I wanted to prove that a black man could play golf,"" he told CNN affiliate WEWS after he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November. His son told the station that his father was advised by Robinson to use his smooth swing to fight the integration battle. ""Which I think is the way he went through his struggles -- smooth, quiet,"" Craig Sifford told the station. Unlike Robinson, who took the field with eight teammates, Charlie Sifford played an individual's game. ""It didn't bother me. It wasn't going to stop me,"" Sifford said. Tiger Woods referred to Sifford as a grandfather. ""Terrible loss for golf and me personally. My grandfather is gone, and we all lost a brave, decent and honorable man. I'll miss u Charlie,"" Woods tweeted. Jack Nicklaus said Sifford was his playing partner for the first two rounds Nicklaus played in a PGA Tour event. He called Sifford a kind and gracious gentleman. ""Charlie led by example, handling himself with great class and dignity inside and outside the ropes,"" Nicklaus said on his website. ""We can't underestimate the impact Charlie's career has had on the face of golf today. Charlie was a leader and an inspiration."" Sifford won two PGA Tour events, his first victory coming in the 1967 Greater Hartford Open. He also won at the Los Angeles Open two years later. It was a difficult career. In his speech honoring Sifford at the White House, President Barack Obama talked about Sifford's travails. ""Charlie was sometimes banned from clubhouse restaurants. Folks threatened him, shouted slurs from the gallery, kicked his ball into the rough,"" the President said. ""Charlie's laughing about that -- my ball is always in the rough.""

"Arkansas' Supreme Court on Friday afternoon stopped any more same-sex marriages in the state, a court spokeswoman said, leaving the legal status of more than 400 gay and lesbian couples who got marriage licenses in limbo. This development stems from 21 couples' legal challenge of Amendment 83 to the Arkansas Constitution, arguing that it violates their federal and state rights of equal protection and privacy. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Chris Piazza ruled in their favor last Friday. But same-sex marriage was back up in the air after the state Supreme Court said Wednesday it couldn't decide whether to grant an emergency stay because Piazza's decision was ""not final."" The county judge updated his order Thursday, adding that his decision allowing same-sex marriage took effect immediately. Pulaski County, at least, was issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples by Thursday afternoon. Supreme Court spokeswoman Stephanie Harris told CNN that more than 400 same-sex couples got marriage licenses in the state since last week's original ruling. She said Friday that the legal status of any of these marriages is unclear. CNN first learned of the state Supreme Court's issuance of an emergency stay -- which is in effect while its judges consider the appeal of Piazza's ruling in full -- via Twitter. The Arkansas case is an entirely in-state matter, involving a local county court and the state's Supreme Court. But it's similar to a spate of federal rulings in recent months that have struck down other states' bans on same-sex marriage. In those cases, U.S. district judges ruled that the marriage restrictions violate the federal Constitution's equal protection guarantee. But none of these decisions are in effect now, because either those judges stayed their rulings pending appeals or appellate courts did the same. There were a few states, including Michigan and Utah, in which same-sex couples married before higher courts stepped in to issue emergency stays. That's what happened in Arkansas. Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond, said Friday that he expects more challenges in state courts to same-sex marriage prohibitions. Still, Tobias thinks advocates are more likely to take their fight to federal court. ""Plaintiffs have preferred to sue in federal courts in the apparent belief that they are a more favorable venue, or that federal judges will view their rights more broadly,"" said Tobias.

"William ""Kyle"" Carpenter lost most of his jaw and an eye when he fell on a grenade to shield a fellow Marine from the blast. His body shattered, one lung collapsed, Carpenter was nearly given up for dead after that 2010 Afghanistan firefight. Then he spent 2½ years in a hospital as doctors worked to rebuild his body. But if you think he's bitter, think again. ""I look back, and I'm actually very appreciative I had those two and a half years, because those years put things in perspective more than a whole lifetime of things could if I wasn't there,"" Carpenter said. On Thursday, he became the eighth living veteran of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan to receive the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award. President Barack Obama presented the medal at a White House ceremony. Carpenter was wounded in Helmand province, Afghanistan, on November 21, 2010, while serving as a machine gunner, according to the White House. Carpenter and another Marine were manning a rooftop position during a firefight with Taliban insurgents when a hand grenade landed nearby, the Marine Corps said. Carpenter rushed toward the grenade and his body took most of the blast, according to the Marine Corps. The other Marine, Lance Cpl. Nicholas Eufrazio, was also injured. In a Defense Department video, Carpenter said he had to be revived while being evacuated by helicopter from the battle and was labeled dead on arrival at a field hospital. He later nearly died again at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, he said. ""The enemy killed me. I came back, ran a marathon, completed a mud run and jumped from a plane. I won't ever quit. I am just getting started,"" he said in the video. Carpenter, medically retired from the Marine Corps last year, is now a student at the University of South Carolina.

"Actor Shia LaBeouf has literally made an art of apologizing for a chain of ill deeds. He added a link to that chain late Thursday when, police said, he lit up a cigarette in a Broadway theater. The ""Transformers"" actor was led away in handcuffs from a showing of ""Cabaret"" at a theater at New York's Studio 54. He was drunk and had been disruptive in the theater, police said. On Friday, a tired-looking LaBeouf was silent as he left a Manhattan courtroom after being released on his own recognizance. Represented by a legal aid lawyer during his brief court appearance, the actor was formally charged with criminal trespass, disorderly conduct and harassment. In court, a prosecutor voiced concern about releasing LaBeouf without bail, but the defense lawyer noted the media buzz that his failure to appear for his July 24 court day would generate. The actor was surrounded by reporters and photographers for several blocks after leaving court. LaBeouf had been sitting in the audience at Studio 54, CNN affiliate WABC reported, when he allegedly disrupted the show during the first act. A criminal complaint said he allegedly yelled ""loudly at the actors onstage"" and refused to leave. As a police officer escorted the actor out of the theater, LeBeouf allegedly said, "" ""F--- you. This is f---ing bull---. Do you know my life? Do you know who the f--- I am? Do you know who I am,"" the complaint said. At the police precinct, the actor spat in the direction of the officer and cursed at him, according to prosecutors. LaBeouf  was held overnight. Two women in the audience thought that LaBeouf's outburst was an act, they told WABC. ""He was brilliant,"" one said. ""I thought he was working on a role or something."" His alleged belligerence may have all been an act, just like the next apology the public can expect from him. In February, he started a performance art exhibit in Los Angeles titled #IAMSORRY, in which he apologizes for a litany of transgressions while he wears a paper bag over his head. He was also dressed for the role during Friday's outburst, the two theatergoers said. He staggered around in a torn shirt with the cigarette and was mixing with the crowd. He walked up to a woman at the theater bar, fed her a strawberry by hand and tipped the bartender, they said. LaBeouf rose to fame at age 14 as the star of the Disney series ""Even Stevens."" He has stayed busy with regular movie and TV roles since the late 1980s, including starring in three ""Transformers"" films. Of late, he has played in films with a more literary appeal, such as ""Nymphomaniac"" and ""The Necessary Death of Charlie Countryman."" He co-stars with Brad Pitt in the upcoming movie ""Fury,"" according to LaBeouf's profile on the Internet Movie Database. Last year, LaBeouf, who has also written screenplays, was accused of plagiarizing another writer's work.","Shia LaBeouf formally charged with criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, harassment .

"(CNN) -- His black robes and turban may harken back to Arab rulers from 1,500 years ago, but Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's taste in wrist-wear is decidedly more 21st century. Days after the mysterious leader of the Sunni terror group ISIS was purportedly filmed at a mosque in northern Iraq calling on believers to wage ""jihad"" against God's enemies, social media is ablaze with speculation on the make of al-Baghdadi's watch. But while critics claimed that the flashy silver timepiece dangling from the Arab warlord's wrist was a luxury Western watch worth thousands, his supporters say he was actually wearing a relatively more modest $560 ""Islamic watch"" from Al-Fajr, a Saudi Arabia-based watchmaker. The deluxe stainless steel WA-10S watch -- the preferred choice of ""true Muslims,"" according to some commentators on social media -- can be programmed with the correct prayer times for hundreds of cities around the world. The watch can be set to ring before each ""azan,"" or call to prayer, wherever the wearer happens to be, according to the Al-Fajr website. Muslims pray five times a day, and prayer times are based on the movement of the sun, so they can vary in different places within the same city. In addition to the prayer alarms, the Swiss-made watch has a built-in compass to indicate the direction of Mecca, Islam's holiest site, so believers will know what direction to pray. The bilingual watch displays in English and Arabic and allows you to choose either the Gregorian or Hijra calendar, which is ""based on the astronomical moon sighting at Mecca,"" according to the watchmaker's website. The deluxe model also has a Quran bookmark feature which enables you to record the last Sura and Verse number so you can pick up where you left off later. An employee at the watchmaker told CNN: ""We can't be sure 100% that the watch [al-Baghdadi] was wearing was actually ours, but after seeing the picture we can assume it is the Al-Fajr WA-10S Deluxe. Though the Arabic signs were not clear, the watch's shape is identical to ours."" ""There is no record about who bought what from the more than 30 branches we run. While we don't have branches in Iraq, we do have them in many other countries, among them 11 Arab countries and even European branches such as the one in the UK,"" the employee added. ISIS has not commented on the watch al-Baghdadi was wearing, but observers claimed earlier this week that one of the world's most wanted men was wearing either a Rolex or a $5,000 Omega Seafarer -- the timepiece of choice for James Bond, the world's most famous silver screen spy. Critics of al-Baghdadi -- the ringleader of the al Qaeda splinter group whose lightning-quick advance has seen them seize large swathes of land in Syria and Iraq in recent months -- say his flashy silver timepiece contradicted with his attempt to strike a pose of pious humility during his sermon at the mosque in Mosul. ""The 'Khalifah' Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes his first appearance wearing expensive Omega or Rolex watch,"" said one observer on Twitter. ""New 'Caliph' spotted with serious bling, maybe he needs that Swiss precision to know it's time for the Caliphate?"" joked another. Regardless of the brand, al-Baghdadi, like Osama bin Laden before him, wore the watch on his right arm in accordance with Salafist tradition dating back nearly 1,500 years to the Prophet Mohammed, who encouraged all Muslims to prioritize the right side of their bodies as they go about their daily lives. Al-Baghdadi's appearance in Mosul came days after ISIS declared him as the leader of a new state extending from Aleppo in northeastern Syria to the Diyala province in Iraq. CNN could not independently verify the video's authenticity, but the video did identify the man as Al-Khalifah Ibrahim, the name al-Baghdadi now goes by with his followers since ISIS declared the creation of their so-called caliphate, or ""Islamic State.""

"(CNN) -- Say ""urban poor,"" and the image that most likely comes to mind is one of young black men caught up in a swirl of drugs and violence and irresponsible single women having babies. But this pervasive stereotype overlooks a surprising reality: Many whites live side by side African-Americans in some of the country's poorest urban neighborhoods. Because white poverty is less expected, less recognized and less studied, we often exclude poor whites from our discussions. That masks a fundamental truth about economic inequality: Poverty is colorblind. But neither is it the same for everyone, as the white poor benefit from a lifetime of the hidden perks of white privilege. As our nation continues down the road of economic recovery, this is a reality our local and national policymakers cannot afford to ignore as they seek to address employment and income inequality. We traced the experience of nearly 800 children in Baltimore for more than 25 years, from the time they entered first grade in the fall of 1982 in 20 Baltimore public schools to well into their third decade. Half their families were low income, according to school records, and the typical low-income parent hadn't finished high school. What might be surprising is that of that half, 40% are white. Looking at where these children started in life and where they ended up, the study results are troubling but clear: At 28, hardly any of the children from a disadvantaged background, black or white, had finished college. But even without the benefit of a college degree, whites, and white men especially, had vastly better employment outcomes. At every age, the white men experienced shorter spells of unemployment, were more likely to be working full-time and earned more. Baltimore, like so many other American cities, suffered immensely under the ravages associated with de-industrialization: the loss of industry, population and wealth. Under such circumstances, many of the city's disadvantaged youths stumbled along the way. But the consequences have been especially dire for African-Americans. As young adults, African-American men had fared much worse than whites in the job market, even though they and their white counterparts had about the same levels of education and the whites reported higher rates of marijuana and heavy drug use and binge drinking. Take, for example, the types of jobs the men in our study held. At 28, nearly half of the white men who had not attended college were employed in the industrial and construction trades, the highest-paying sector of blue-collar employment. By contrast, only 15% of African-American men worked in these sectors, and even within that small group, annual earnings were less than half that of whites -- $21,500 versus $43,000. This disparity is no accident. It fits a broader pattern evident as far back as high school: About one-fifth of white men who grew up in disadvantaged families had after-school and summer jobs in these industries -- important experience that can help secure a full-time job -- while not a single African-American person did. Indeed, throughout the course of our study, it was clear that African- Americans face greater barriers to employment. Having an arrest record or failing to complete high school were less consequential for white men than for African-American men: 84% of whites without a high school degree were employed at 22; among African Americans, just 40% were. Racial inequality also is embedded in hidden ways in other spheres of life, including discrimination in housing and banking practices that have kept white and black Baltimore substantially separate and cut off working class African-Americans from potentially valuable social contacts. Why do differences in employment track so sharply with color lines? The race-based privilege that benefits working-class whites over working-class African-Americans has its origins in the discriminatory practices that excluded African-Americans from the skilled trades during Baltimore's booming World War II and post-war industrial economy. Although overt racial discrimination has lessened since then, the deep structural inequalities these barriers helped establish continue today through word-of-mouth hiring, employer attitudes that limit opportunities for African-Americans and segregated social networks. The differences in how these young people found jobs illustrate the invisible ways race-based privilege is institutionalized in the job market. When asked at age 22 how they found their current jobs, whites more often mentioned help from family and friends, while more African-Americans found jobs ""on their own."" The white job seekers in our study had family, friends and neighbors who could help them access good-quality, higher-paying jobs. And what of those women having babies? Most of the women of disadvantaged background, white and African-American, became mothers as teenagers, worked sporadically and when working, their employment was concentrated in the low-pay clerical and service sectors. The difference, though, is that many more white women were married or in a stable co-habiting relationship. An additional earner in the household makes a vast difference in economic well-being, which means that white men's workplace advantages benefit white women as well. As Americans, we like to think that we are all on a level playing field. Our society treasures rags-to-riches stories of individuals overcoming their humble origins to achieve the American Dream. But, the harsh reality we witnessed in Baltimore is that race and class place severe limitations on a child's ability to achieve that dream. Too often, our policymakers focus on colorblind solutions, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, to help the urban poor. Such programs only help those who already have jobs and fail to address chronic unemployment among African-Americans. Amid the growing national conversation on economic inequality, now is the time for our leaders to recognize that race matters and develop creative programs, such as President Barack Obama's ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative, to address the different challenges facing poor African-Americans. Tracking the lives of Baltimore children for 25 years, we witnessed all too clearly how family conditions and poverty early in life cast a shadow that follows children into adulthood and how that shadow extends much further if you are African-American. Only by facing this reality head on with proactive programs and policies can we offer young African-Americans a fair shot at achieving the American dream.","Authors: ""Urban poor"" is not just black men, single moms; many whites fit the category .

"ISIS, the brutal insurgent/terrorist group formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, has seized much of western and northern Iraq and even threatens towns not far from Baghdad. From where did ISIS spring? One of George W. Bush's most toxic legacies is the introduction of al Qaeda into Iraq, which is the ISIS mother ship. If this wasn't so tragic it would be supremely ironic, because before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, top Bush officials were insisting that there was an al Qaeda-Iraq axis of evil. Their claims that Saddam Hussein's men were training members of al Qaeda how to make weapons of mass destruction seemed to be one of the most compelling rationales for the impending war. After the fall of Hussein's regime, no documents were unearthed in Iraq proving the Hussein-al Qaeda axis despite the fact that, like other totalitarian regimes, Hussein's government kept massive and meticulous records. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency had by 2006 translated 34 million pages of documents from Hussein's Iraq and found there was nothing to substantiate a ""partnership"" between Hussein and al Qaeda. Two years later the Pentagon's own internal think tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses, concluded after examining 600,000 Hussein-era documents and several thousand hours of his regime's audio- and videotapes that there was no ""smoking gun (i.e. direct connection between Hussein's Iraq and al Qaeda.)"" The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded in 2008, as every other investigation had before, that there was no ""cooperative relationship"" between Hussein and al Qaeda. The committee also found that ""most of the contacts cited between Iraq and al Qaeda before the war by the intelligence community and policy makers have been determined not to have occurred."" Instead of interrupting a budding relationship between Hussein and al Qaeda, the Iraq War precipitated the arrival of al Qaeda into Iraq.  Although the Bush administration tended to gloss over the fact, al Qaeda only formally established itself in Iraq a year and a half after the U.S. invasion. On October 17, 2004, its brutal leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi issued an online statement pledging allegiance to Osama bin Laden. Zarqawi's pledge was fulsome: ""By God, O sheikh of the Mujahideen, if you bid us plunge into the ocean, we would follow you. If you ordered it so, we would obey."" Zarqawi's special demonic genius was to launch Iraq down the road to civil war. In early 2004, the U.S. military intercepted a letter from Zarqawi to bin Laden in which he proposed provoking a civil war between Sunnis and Shia. Zarqawi's strategy was to hit the Shia so they would in turn strike the Sunnis, so precipitating a vicious circle of violence in which al Qaeda would be cast as the protector of the Sunnis against the wrath of the Shia. It was a strategy that worked all too well, provoking first sectarian conflict in Iraq and later civil war. Al Qaeda in Iraq, or AQI, regularly attacked Shia religious processions, shrines and clerics. The tipping point in the slide toward full-blown civil war was al Qaeda's February 2006 attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra, which is arguably the most important Shia shrine in the world. Three years into the Iraq War, AQI seemed all but unstoppable. A classified Marine intelligence assessment dated August 17, 2006, found that AQI had become the de facto government of the western Iraqi province of Anbar, which is strategically important because it borders Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia and makes up about a third of the landmass of Iraq. In addition, AQI controlled a good chunk of the exurban belts around Baghdad, the ""Triangle of Death"" to the south of the capital and many of the towns north of it, up the Tigris River to the Syrian border. Thus AQI controlled territory larger than New England and maintained an iron grip on much of the Sunni population. In other words, the Bush administration had presided over the rise of precisely what it had said was one of the key goals of the Iraq War to destroy: a safe haven for al Qaeda in the heart of the Arab world. By 2007, al Qaeda's untrammeled violence and imposition of Taliban ideology on the Sunni population provoked a countrywide Sunni backlash against AQI that took the form of Sunni ""Awakening"" militias. Many of those militias were put on Uncle Sam's payroll in a program known as the ""Sons of Iraq"". The combination of the Sunni militias' on-the-ground intelligence about their onetime AQI allies and American firepower proved devastating to al Qaeda's Iraqi franchise. And so, between 2006 and 2008, AQI shrank from an insurgent organization that controlled territory larger than the size of New England to a rump terrorist group. But AQI did not disappear. It simply bided its time. The Syrian civil war provided a staging point over the past three years for its resurrection and transformation into the ""Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,"" or ISIS. And now ISIS has marched back into western and northern Iraq. Only this time there is no U.S. military to stop it.","When Bush administration attacked Iraq, it argued there was a Hussein-al Qaeda connection .

"In a perfect world of course, there would be no serious predatory crime, and thus no need nor call to respond to it. We wouldn't have murder, attempted mass murder, or the sexual abuse of children. But alas, that world seems all too remote today. Assuming we continue to have murder and other serious crime which kills or maims innocents, what should we do about it?  Most of us believe that rarely, but sometimes, callous, depraved, vicious predators do deserve to die. Opinion: Death penalty is unchristian . And we feel certain that justice requires they get what they deserve. Related: Blecker joins CNN's Google Hangout to answer your death penalty questions . But not all convicted murderers deserve to die. We must fundamentally commit ourselves to ensure that those who don't deserve to die -- either because they did not really commit murder, or because they are not the worst of the worst of the worst -- will not be executed.  We should construct our punishments more nearly to fit their crimes -- neither much more nor much less than what they deserve. 1. Let's have better definitions for who should die. I've spent decades visiting prisons and interviewing convicted killers and corrections officers. I'm convinced that states with the death penalty can and should morally refine their statutes. My crime and punishment memoir, ""The Death of Punishment,"" details many changes and suggests a model death penalty statute, reserved for especially heinous, atrocious and cruel killers. This includes not only sadistic serial murderers -- those who relish torturing their vulnerable victims, especially condemned for their cowardice -- but also cold, cruel, callous killers who may not intend to kill, but simply don't give a damn. In short, mass murderers, terrorists, sadistic serial killers, contract killers or other paid assassins deserve to die. Once we more consistently condemn the attitude of those who act with a depraved indifference, we will also  punish more severely ""red collar killers"" -- callous corporate executives who calculatedly cause the deaths of unsuspecting employees or consumers -- for the serious crimes they commit, albeit from the best of motives: the profit motive. In a more perfect world, we'd shed double standards and embrace more nearly a uniform metric of justice. At the same time that we punish more, we should punish less.  Remove many other standard -- aggravating circumstances which make a person eligible for execution in states that allow the death penalty. Robbery, burglary other than home invasion and drugs should not elevate murder into capital felony murder.  If we drop economic crimes such as robbery and drugs as aggravating circumstances, racial disparity will drop significantly. Rape still qualifies as torture, however, and all other things equal, rapist murderers do deserve to die. In short, we can -- and should -- define the worst of our worst more clearly and punish them more nearly as they deserve. 2. Let's be more certain that they are guilty. Western culture has essentially committed us to a presumption of life, of innocence and we have long required special proof of guilt before we punish with death.  ""Super due process"" requires vigorous defense counsel challenging the prosecution to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury. Death (or life without parole) as society's ultimate punishment demands even more, however.  A jury should not only be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the condemned did it, but also that they deserve their punishment. In the separate penalty phase of a trial, where the question is not guilt or innocence, but life or death as punishment, a jury should be left with no lingering doubt -- no real doubt, however irrational -- about the convicted killer's guilt. Even this should not be enough to condemn a vicious predator to die. A nearly unanimous jury should be convinced with no ""lingering or residual doubt"" that the convicted murderer did it, and to ""a moral certainty"" that he or she deserves to die for it.  No state has adopted this higher, special burden of persuasion, but they should. 3. Let's choose a better execution method. Lethal injection -- which grabs headlines these days -- never was and never will be a good execution method. The execution scene I witnessed resembled final goodbyes at a hospital or hospice for the terminally ill. The dying person lies on a gurney, wrapped in white sheets, an IV attached, surrounded by medical technicians with loved ones in attendance.  We should oppose lethal injection, not because it might cause pain, but because it certainly causes confusion, wantonly merging punishment and treatment. The firing squad seems to me the best of traditional methods, but a state might give a member of the victim's family a choice among available constitutional options. In any case, when we do punish we should be clear and make it clear that we are punishing.   We should reconnect the punishment to the crime. Before (or after) the condemned makes a final statement, the victim's family or friends may display a brief audiovisual memorial of the victim's life.  We should make punishment honest and overt. 4. Let's take a hard look at inmates' prison lifestyle. Most vicious killers a jury condemns to die will never be executed.  And even those we do kill, will live out much of their lives on death row. For the worst of the worst whom we have condemned, daily life on death row should be their punishment.  Their conditions should be no better than what corrections reserve for lesser criminals who commit additional offenses inside prison and are additionally punished with punitive or administrative segregation. It's obscene today that sometimes our condemned killers inside prison live better than our working innocent poor in society. Specifically, within constitutional bounds, those we condemned to die or live a life in prison with no chance of parole -- the worst of the worst -- should be allowed only the minimum constitutionally mandated exercise, phone calls, or physical contact. They should not be permitted any communal form of recreation or play. For the rest of their lives, their food should be nutraloaf, nutritionally complete and tasteless. Photographs of their victims should be posted in their cells, out of reach, in visibly conspicuous places. Prison administration should make every effort to connect punishment to crime. Departments of corrections should administer prisons to protect the public, protect staff, and provide humane supervision of prisoners with opportunities and programs that meaningfully support successful community reintegration for the vast majority of offenders sentenced to a term of years or life with a possibility of parole. We must recognize that economic circumstances drive people to commit crimes.  In a more perfect world we would stop punishing drug dealers as if they were murderers. We should allow and encourage lesser criminals to pay for the crimes and give them real opportunities to start fresh. But for those prisoners sentenced to death or life without parole, corrections should administer punishment: an unpleasant, restrictive daily regimen designed to continually convey society's intense disapproval of the crime and the criminal. 5.  And when mistakes are made? During the penalty phase of a capital trial, skilled defense attorneys should attempt effectively to humanize even guilty defendants. Anyone, including friends or family, may recount the convicted murderer's good deeds or emphasize the killer's own traumatic suffering or abuse as a child.  But recognizing that even murderers remain human beings, defense attorneys should not discourage their clients from taking responsibility, nor use the defendants to promote their own abolitionist agenda. Prosecuting attorneys, in their turn, may call surviving friends or family to humanize the victim and testify to their own sense of loss.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that survivors must express no opinion on the killer's proper sentence. Regardless of how survivors feel, however, the victim's opinion of the killer's fate should count. Thus, a reliable living will or declaration of life should be admissible in the penalty phase. As long as evidence clearly supports it as authentic, the jury should hear that the victim would have opposed -- or supported -- the death penalty (or life without parole) for the killer and give that fact such weight as they think it deserves. In the unusual but real case where we later discover an innocent person has been condemned to die or imprisoned for life without parole, the state shall not only release that victim, but also pay substantial reparations to the wrongly condemned or surviving family, regardless of whether any public official intentionally or recklessly miscarried justice. And should an investigation clearly establish that prosecutors or police ever intentionally and unlawfully suppressed evidence of innocence while capitally prosecuting, they should themselves be prosecuted for attempted murder.  If they recklessly caused the death or loss of liberty of the innocent, they should be prosecuted and punished for depraved indifference reckless endangerment. Again, there would be no vicious predators in a more perfect world, nor would innocents ever be convicted. However, in this world, we can -- and must -- do more to ensure that the punishments more nearly and reliably fit the crimes.","Death penalty advocate: Reserve executions for especially heinous, atrocious and cruel killers .

"Part of Jerusalem is seeing its worst flare-up in years. Here's a look at some of the key questions about the fighting. What started this new wave of violence? The violence certainly had not gone away, with rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli military incursions in the West Bank regular occurrences. But last month's abduction of three Israeli teens who were on their way home from school in the West Bank brought the tensions to a fever pitch. Israelis waited with bated breath, hoping for word that they were alive. When the bodies of Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel -- a dual Israeli-American citizen -- were found on June 30, the country was grief-stricken. The Israeli government blamed Hamas, which denied responsibility but praised the abductions. Israel carried out arrests and demolished homes of the suspects in the West Bank, and launched airstrikes against targets in Gaza that are used to lob rockets into Israel. Palestinians stepped up rocket attacks and clashed with Israeli troops. Has the Middle East crisis reached a tipping point? When was the Palestinian teen killed? On Wednesday, according to his family, Mohammad Abu Khedair was headed to a mosque in his middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat, part of eastern Jerusalem, which is populated by Arabs. Three people in a car forced him inside, according to authorities and family members. He was reported missing and, about an hour later, his body was found in a forest in Jerusalem. Israel vowed a swift investigation and condemned the killing. Still, clashes erupted in the usually quiet Shuafat neighborhood. Residents threw rocks at security forces, and Israeli authorities responded with occasional volleys of stun grenades or tear gas. Some protesters also attacked two fellow Palestinians whom they mistook for undercover Israeli police. Israel announced over the weekend that several Jewish suspects had been arrested and that there was ""strong indication"" the killing may have been in revenge for the three Israeli teens' deaths. The clashes are the worst the city has seen in a decade. Israel has condemned the killings of five teens. Who's the fifth? Israel announced over the weekend that a taxi driver had confessed to killing an Israeli Jewish teen in May. Shelly Dadon, 19, was kidnapped, stabbed to death and left in an abandoned parking lot. The suspect's motivation was believed to be Palestinian nationalism, Israeli police said. In the Knesset, Israel's parliament, lawmakers unanimously condemned the deaths of all five young people, The Jerusalem Post reported. Who's the beaten teen? Tariq Abu Khdeir is from Florida. He was visiting his relatives in Jerusalem when his cousin, Mohammad Abu Khedair, was killed. Two videos posted online Thursday show Tariq Abu Khdeir beaten by men wearing the uniform of Israeli security forces. The videos do not show what led to the beating. There's a dispute over what transpired. Ron Dermer, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said Khdeir was among six masked people who threw petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails, and three of whom had knives. Still, that would not excuse ""any excessive use of force,"" he told ""Fox News Sunday."" Khdeir says he was watching protesters and was ""attacked."" A court has ordered him to house arrest for nine days at a relative's home in a different neighborhood. His mother says the family plans to sue Israeli authorities. Physically, he's ""doing a lot better,"" a family lawyer in Florida told CNN on Monday. Will this spark a 'third Intifada'? That's a question being raised by some in the region as well as global media. The term refers to two previous armed uprisings by Palestinians against Israel. The first began in 1987 and ended in 1993 with the signing of the Oslo accords. The second lasted from 2000 to 2005. ""A third intifada is likely if Palestinians fail to distance themselves from the militants following the cold-blooded murder of three Israeli teenagers,"" the Telegraph's Con Coughlin wrote last week after their bodies were found. ""Put simply, there are solid reasons to fear that a third intifada could be far more bloody than the uprisings that have gone before. Which means the task facing leaders on all sides could not be clearer: they have to calm this situation, not inflame it,"" The Guardian's Jonathan Freedland wrote Friday. But Haaretz reported that ""many East Jerusalem officials expect the turmoil to die down."" It noted that West Bank cities have not joined the violent protest. To some Palestinians, the intifada is the ongoing effort against Israel. ""The blood of our martyrs is precious ... and is fuel for the intifada and the resistance,"" Mushir Al-Masri, a Hamas leadership figure and member of the Palestinian parliament, wrote Monday on Facebook. What are Palestinian leaders saying? Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas surprised many when he condemned the kidnappings of the three Israeli teens. He faced heated criticism from fellow Palestinians for doing so. ""Hamas, which is now part of the Palestinian Authority government in a unity deal with Fatah, made no effort to conceal its glee,"" columnist Frida Ghitis noted on CNN.com. Khaled Meshaal, Hamas political chief, told Al Jazeera after the Israeli teens' disappearance, ""I congratulate the abductors because our prisoners must be freed from the prisons of the occupation."" Palestinian leaders have called for an end to ""collective punishment"" by Israel, including the demolishing of homes and other military actions. And some have called on Israel to demolish the homes of those behind the killing of Abu Khedair. Palestinian leaders have also condemned the killings of people in Israeli military actions. Israel says it is focused on terrorist networks. More than 150 rockets from Gaza have hit Israel in less than a month, and ""terrorists from Gaza opened fire at an (Israel Defense Forces) vehicle patrolling the security fence,"" the IDF tweeted Monday. Is anyone calling for peace? Yes. In recent days, Israelis have held anti-racism rallies to counteract hatred on both sides, including groups of Israeli Jews who were seen yelling ""Death to Arabs"" after the Israeli teens' killings. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called on Palestinian and Arab leaders to join his public calls for an end to the killings. ""We don't differ between terror and terror, and against both we will act harshly. And I don't differ between incitement and incitement in the state of Israel,"" he said Sunday, adding, ""We will not let extremists -- it doesn't matter from which side -- bring bloodshed to the area."" Last week, the family of Frankel, the slain Israeli-American teen, also condemned Khedair's killing. Frankel's uncle Yishai Frankel, who works to bring Palestinians into Israel's high-tech sector, said he feels as good as ever about ""the good people"" he works with. ""It's no secret that every society has bad people,"" he said. And the family attorney for beaten teen Tariq Abu Khdeir told CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday, ""We need, really, all sides right now to just stop this disgusting cycle of violence where innocent children, both on the Israeli and Palestinian side, are being killed and injured almost daily nowadays."" What does all this mean for peace efforts? It's unclear whether there's been any real progress toward substantive peace talks in recent years, with each side blaming the other for preventing them. In April, The Economist called it ""a peace process that is going nowhere."" Israelis and Palestinians may have grown further apart in what they're hoping for. Most Israelis support a two-state solution, according to a new poll by the Dialog Institute, Haaretz reported Monday. But a June poll of Palestinians, taken during the search for the three missing Israeli teens, found that fewer than 30% of Palestinians support a two-state solution. Sixty percent say the five-year goal ""should be to work toward reclaiming all of historic Palestine, from the river to the sea,"" the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found. But the majority support nonviolent methods of ""popular resistance."" For now, the focus for all those opposing the violence is calming anger in the short term -- and stopping the killing.","The killings of three Israeli teens sparked national grief .

"You have to hand it to Dick Cheney. How many people, knowing what has happened in Iraq over the last 12 years, would dare to write an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal recently containing this line: ""Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many"" -- and not be talking about George W. Bush? The man has chutzpah. The op-ed in question was co-written with Cheney's daughter Liz, former State Department worker and failed Senate candidate. The two are forming a new organization, the Alliance for a Strong America. Of all the former Bush administration officials who have emerged in the last few days to blame the deteriorating situation in Iraq on Barack Obama, one might think Cheney would be among the last. It's one thing to turn on your TV and hear that Obama is a dangerous weakling from people like Paul Wolfowitz and William Kristol, the ones who told us that war with Iraq would be cheap and easy, then bring a wave of peace and democracy across the Middle East. But Cheney? Cheney was the war's chief propagandist, who told the American public more spectacular falsehoods than anyone, including Bush himself. Cheney was the one who told us in 2002 that ""Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction. There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us."" He's the one who tried to convince us that Saddam Hussein might have helped engineer the September 11 attacks, and who said in 2005 that the insurgency in Iraq was ""in its last throes."" (The war went on for 6½ more years.) Cheney had a central role in bringing on a war in which 4,500 Americans gave their lives, tens of thousands more were gravely injured, we spent a couple of trillion dollars, and somewhere between 100,000 and 500,000 Iraqis died. Cheney's opinion appears to be that all that death and expense never really happened (he doesn't mention them), and that everything bad in Iraq can only be Obama's fault -- because the Bush administration did such a bang-up job there. ""Mr. Obama had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some residual American forces, training and intelligence capabilities to help secure the peace,"" he writes. ""Instead, he abandoned Iraq and we are watching American defeat snatched from the jaws of victory."" Would ""some residual American forces"" have been able to keep a lid on the unending Iraqi civil war that Bush and Cheney so effectively unleashed? We'll never really know, but here's what we do know: The agreement mandating that all American troops leave Iraq by the end of 2011 was signed by one George W. Bush, before Obama took office. As negotiations over our departure proceeded in Obama's first term, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki -- eager to have the Americans gone so he could consolidate what would turn out to be a corrupt sectarian rule -- refused to grant American troops immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts. Without that immunity, there was simply no way American forces could remain there. We've heard many people say Obama ""should have pushed harder,""  but nobody says exactly what that's supposed to mean, or why al-Maliki would have given in, especially considering how he's acted since. And what does Cheney think we should do now? He doesn't seem to have any idea. The op-ed contains precisely zero recommendations about Iraq. Defeating al Qaeda, it says, ""will require a strategy -- not a fantasy."" But what is that strategy? ""Sustained difficult military, intelligence and diplomatic efforts""? Oh, of course  -- if only we had known! At least he's not alone in his arrogance and befuddlement. None of Obama's other critics seem to have much of an idea what we should do in Iraq, or Syria, or anywhere else. They're happy to say that whatever Obama is doing isn't enough, and it isn't strong. But if you ask them to be specific about what different decisions they would make, you'll be met with hemming and hawing. That's because there are only bad options for America in Iraq, as is often the case in the Middle East. If you delude yourself into thinking that wars are simple and easy, and all that matters is whether you're ""strong,"" then sometimes things become quite clear. We'll just invade, we'll be ""greeted as liberators"" (that was Cheney, too), and everyone will live happily ever after. And when what actually results is not that glorious and easy victory, but a tidal wave of violence and despair, then all you need to do is wait until after you leave office, when you can blame it all on someone else.

"Human remains found in two plastic bags near a beach in southwestern Mexico have been identified as those of Harry Devert, a New Yorker  who left his job as a trader in finance for a transcontinental motorcycle journey from the United States to Latin America, Mexican authorities said. Devert, 32, vanished six months ago after sending his girlfriend an ominous text message from a troubled region in Mexico, describing how he was being escorted from ""an area too dangerous for me to be."" Mexican authorities, acting on tips, last week located his green Kawasaki motorcycle in a shallow grave in the state of Guerrero, along with the badly decomposed remains of a man in two bags. On Thursday, DNA tests confirmed the remains were those of Devert, a representative of the Guerrero state attorney general's office not authorized to speak to the media told CNN. The investigation was turned over to federal prosecutor because of the nature of the crime and the fact that it involved an American tourist, he said. Mother has been looking for information . Devert's mother, Ann, traveled to Mexico last weekend after identifying the vehicle identification number on the motorcycle found in the shallow grave. A day earlier she provided a DNA sample to police in New York to match against the remains, said Darren Del Sardo, an attorney for Devert's mother. Del Sardo said Mexican authorities informed Ann Devert of the findings late Thursday. She is considering having a private lab conduct DNA tests, he said. ""This is horrible,"" he said. ""The major component now is to try to find out who is responsible for this and hope that the Mexican authorities bring them to justice as soon as possible."" The discovery of the remains and the motorcycle was made nearly 300 miles southwest of where Devert was last heard from in January. Del Sardo said Ann Devert spent time in Mexico after her son's disappearance, meeting local authorities and residents in the western Mexican state of Michoacan in an attempt to find him. There was hope with unconfirmed tips that he was being held at a ranch. Last week, she learned of the remains and the bike in the shallow grave. Mexican authorities said the motorcycle was found along a road leading to La Majahua beach in Guerrero. The statement said ""10 packages of what appeared to be narcotics (marijuana and cocaine)"" were found near the motorbike and body. Del Sardo said Ann Devert was told that the remains may have been moved to the shallow grave. Devert, 32, had not been in touch with his mother or girlfriend in New York since January 25. That day he sent girlfriend Sarah Ashley Schiear a text message via the WhatsApp messenger app. ""Just got an hour and a half long escort out of some area it was too dangerous for me to be,"" the message said. ""Stopping for lunch and ... voila Internet. ... Gonna get back on the road soon. Apparently there's another military escort waiting for me in some other town... I'm running way late because of the crazy military stuff...hopefully get a chance to talk to you tonight when I (hopefully) finally arrive."" He had checked out of a bed and breakfast in Michoacan and planned to travel to a beach in Zihuatanejo, on the Pacific Ocean, that was in the final scene of the film ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" according to friends and family. Friends had hoped Harry Devert would surface . Ann Devert last heard from her son January 23. The phone connection was poor. He told her he'd be out of cell phone and Internet range for a few days. She told CNN earlier this year that he would call every January 29, his late father's birthday, ""and when he didn't, I felt a misgiving but I thought maybe it would take a couple of days,"" she said. ""He didn't call."" Then, Ann Devert heard from a friend who recently returned from Michoacan, where vigilante self-defense groups in numerous communities have engaged in deadly confrontations with the Knights Templar drug cartel. After vigilantes threatened to descend on a key cartel area last month, the Mexican government sent in thousands of troops and police to try to keep the peace. The government has even joined forces with the vigilantes as the Knights Templar become further entrenched in the agricultural state. Ann Devert had been in touch with both the American and French embassies in Mexico. Her son, born in France, has dual citizenship. Devert's friends and family were hopeful that his disappearance was only temporary, another story to recount from his wild travels around the world -- from Pamplona, Spain, to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and beyond. ""I've been chased with a gun in Colombia, chipped my tooth on a gun that was shoved in my mouth in Venezuela and shot everything from a bazooka to a machine gun, an M16 to a Colt .45,"" Devert wrote in his travel blog, A New Yorker Travels. ""I've been in some of the poorest and some of the most dangerous parts of the world and to many of the finest, and I still can't tell which I liked more. I think that life is a pilgrimage."" In an October 19 post, Devert described his latest journey on a type of vehicle he had no experience using. ""I've never ridden a motorcycle,"" he wrote. ""Mostly, naturally, because I don't know how. So tomorrow I'm going to go to the DMV, get my motorcycle permit, buy a bike and hopefully figure out how to ride it home without crashing. Which I'm sure will be an adventure in itself."" He added, ""Then in the next 2 or 3 weeks I'm going to drive it across America, through Central America, down to Brazil for the World Cup, and eventually south to Ushuaia, which as far as I can tell from a map is about as far south as one can get on the continent."" He purchased a green 2002 Kawasaki. Ann Devert said her son took a safety course and spent hours studying YouTube videos on how to survive falls from bikes. But the fact that he had never driven a motorcycle concerned her, she said. He promised not to travel faster than 55 mph, yet he took a nasty spill while speeding in Florida, Ann Devert said. He emerged unscathed. Friends and family created the Help Find Harry page in Facebook, with more than 25,000 likes. 'Strong possibility' missing world traveler Bearden meant to leave .

"Believe it or not, it has been almost a year since the birth of Prince George Alexander Louis, the son of Britain's Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton. The baby is third in line to the British throne, behind his father and his grandfather, Prince Charles. Ahead of his first birthday on July 22, three new photos are being released by the UK's Press Association. One, showing the smallest royal dressed in blue and taking a step, was released on Saturday.  The Press Association promises two more pictures Monday. Here are five interesting things you might not know about the royal tyke. 1. Baby George had a low-key birth, relatively speaking. As the Duchess of Cambridge went into labor, Prince William drove her to the hospital in an unmarked minivan -- with minimal security and without a royal entourage -- from Kensington Palace to the back entrance of Saint Mary's Hospital. Even more down-to-earth? The announcement of Prince George's birth first came through e-mail and Twitter. It was truly a digital moment, according to CNN's Max Foster, who reported live from the hospital that day. The duchess, with Prince William present, delivered the baby boy at 4:24 p.m. He weighed 8 pounds and 6 ounces. The couple later announced he would be known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge. Prince William's first interview as a dad . What's in a royal name? 2. His early days were not spent at the royal palace. Despite the tradition that royal newborns spend their first days inside palace walls, Prince George spent his at the duchess' family home in the village of Bucklebury. The decision was reportedly met with protest from the highest ranks in the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II. Though there was a colossal security presence outside the home, inside it remained just the family. Kate's mother, Carole Middleton, took on the all-important role of royal nanny while her father, Michael, became the royal photographer. But the intimate family setting did not last long -- Prince William was back to work with the Royal Air Force by August 15. 3. Prince George has a special connection with Princess Diana. Prince George's christening was held on October 23 at the Chapel Royal at St. James's Palace. That location was no coincidence; it was where the body of Prince William's mother, Princess Diana, lay at rest in the days leading up to her funeral in 1997. The event also set the stage for the epic portrait of Queen Elizabeth and her three direct heirs, Princes Charles, William and George. It was the first time a reigning Queen and three generations of heirs were photographed together in more than 100 years. 4. He has a supernanny. While Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are busy with royal obligations, Prince George is cared for by what some would call a supernanny. Spanish-born Maria Teresa Turrion Borallo was trained at the prestigious and selective Norland College in England, which specializes in training nannies. There she learned everything from basic child care to defensive driving and even self-defense. This nanny not only has to handle diaper changes, she also has to worry about potential kidnap attempts and invasive paparazzi. 5. In his first year, he's embarked on an international tour and made quite the fashion statement. Prince George has had a lot of firsts this year, and many of them were in the public eye. The royal baby tagged along in April with his mom and dad on their first family trip abroad in New Zealand and Australia. The 9-month-old followed in the footsteps of his father, who was the first heir to be brought along on a royal trip at such a young age when his own parents toured Australia and New Zealand in 1983. After his overseas adventures, the public saw Prince George once again on Father's Day. But instead of the spotlight shining on his doting dad it was once again on baby George, who took his first steps in public, carefully holding on to his mom for balance. Not only that, the overalls he was wearing immediately sold out worldwide. Three pivotal pictures from the royal tour .","Photos being released days ahead of birthday .

"Apparently, when it comes to Middle-earth, director Peter Jackson thinks three is the magic number. Last month at Comic-Con, Jackson teased fans with the idea that he was interested in pushing beyond his planned two-film adaptation of  ""The Hobbit."" Today, after weeks of intensive talks with Warner Bros. over how exactly that might be achieved, Jackson announced on his Facebook page that he is, in fact, going to turn ""The Hobbit"" into a trilogy. ""It is only at the end of a shoot that you finally get the chance to sit down and have a look at the film you have made,"" Jackson wrote. ""Recently Fran [Walsh], Phil[lippa Boyens] and I did just this when we watched for the first time an early cut of the first movie — and a large chunk of the second. We were really pleased with the way the story was coming together, in particular, the strength of the characters and the cast who have brought them to life. All of which gave rise to a simple question: do we take this chance to tell more of the tale? And the answer from our perspective as the filmmakers, and as fans, was an unreserved 'yes.'"" How exactly The Hobbit will be turned into a three-film series is still somewhat unclear, though. As Jackson has acknowledged, ""The Hobbit"" is a slender story compared with the far more sprawling and complex ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. But the director is drawing not only on the original book, but also on more than a hundred pages of appendices Tolkien later wrote that expanded on the world of  ""The Hobbit."" Jackson is obviously confident that all of this material taken together can sustain three films and hinted in his announcement at what narrative elements will be incorporated to fill out the trilogy. ""We know how much of the story of Bilbo Baggins, the Wizard Gandalf, the Dwarves of Erebor, the rise of the Necromancer, and the Battle of Dol Guldur will remain untold if we do not take this chance,"" he wrote. ""The richness of the story of The Hobbit, as well as some of the related material in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, allows us to tell the full story of the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and the part he played in the sometimes dangerous, but at all times exciting, history of Middle-earth."" The first installment in the trilogy, subtitled ""An Unexpected Journey,"" hits theaters Dec. 14, 2012. The second film is slated for Dec. 13, 2013. The last installment will hit theaters in the summer of 2014. See full story at EW.com.","Peter Jackson has announced ""The Hobbit"" will be a trilogy .

"The United States upped pressure on Moscow over the Malaysia Airlines disaster as Secretary of State John Kerry drew a clearer line to Russia over its ties to rebels in Ukraine and the rocket system used to down the jet. He also noted on CNN that it was a ""moment of truth"" for Vladimir Putin. Kerry and key congressional lawmakers from both parties especially sharpened the focus on Putin to, as Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said, ""man up"" and lead. There was concern, however, that Russia's behavior since Thursday's destruction of Flight 17 by a missile the United States believes was fired by the Russian-backed rebels further underscores Putin's hardening preference for Cold War-era politics. ""This is going back to the days of Stalin, and Khrushchev and Brezhnev,"" Republican Rep. Peter King said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""The way he's responding to a crisis, which he caused, which everyone knows he did, and yet he goes underground. This is what a mafia guy does. This is what a goon does. Not a world leader. Not someone in the civilized world."" Asked on CNN's ""State of the Union"" whether the incident has pushed U.S.-Russian relations back to Cold War-era levels, Feinstein simply said, ""yes."" Outrage expressed . Governments from around the world have expressed outrage at the disorderly situation at the remote crash site about 40 miles from Russia's border and called on Putin to use his influence on the pro-Russian rebels to open up the area to investigators and stand aside. Since the crash that killed nearly 300 people, the Ukrainian government and the rebels have traded bitter accusations over who was responsible and what has been done since. Russia has denied any involvement, and Putin said Ukraine's military campaign against the rebels was to blame for blowing the Boeing 777 out of the sky. But Kerry said it would be ""ridiculous"" for the international community trust what Putin has said. Kerry said there was a ""buildup of extraordinary circumstantial evidence"" that the rebels were behind it and that the suspect rocket system used was transferred to them from Russia, which denies its military equipment crossed the border. ""We know with confidence, with confidence, that the Ukrainians did not have such a system anywhere near the vicinity at that point in time, so it obviously points a very clear finger at the separatists,"" Kerry said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" He called a ""very, very critical moment for Russia to step up publicly and join in the effort in order to make sure"" there is a full investigation. The crash site near the town of Torez in the Donetsk region is under rebel control and the situation was said to be far from organized. Negotiations were being held for the release of nearly 200 recovered bodies, and there were reports some of the dead had been looted. International investigators have limited access. Kerry said that he spoke Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in what he called a ""direct and tough conversation."" Russia needs to help ensure that investigators can conduct a thorough investigation, Kerry said. ""This is the moment of truth for Russia and for Mr. Putin,"" Kerry said. Not shooting from hip . But while Kerry urged Russia to allow for a complete investigation, he did not lay out specific repercussions for the Russians. He said they are being discussed with European allies. He added on ""Fox News Sunday"" that the United States wasn't going to ""shoot from the hip,"" but instead respond in a ""thoughtful way."" When pressed on ""Meet the Press"" that the Obama administration is giving Russia too much maneuvering room, Kerry said the world is ""complicated."" He pointed to Russia's cooperation removing chemical weapons in Syria and other parts of the world. ""Russia is working with us in a cooperative way on the P5 + 1,"" which are the talks regarding Iran's nuclear program. The Obama administration criticized . But Senator Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said Kerry's response was not severe enough. ""He didn't call Putin the thug that he is. He didn't call for arming Ukraine so they can defend themselves,"" Graham said on ""Meet the Press."" Reaction from Republicans plays into the ongoing narrative that Republicans paint of the President's foreign policy leadership as being weak and indecisive. Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker said the response by the Obama administration since Russia began its annexation of Crimea has been ""timid and cautious."" It has ""kept Putin from really paying a price inside his country for the actions that have been taken,"" he said on ""Fox."" ""The United States needs to end its tepid response,"" Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers, Chairman of the House Intelligence Community, said on ABC's ""This Week."" He called for ""aggressive"" help for the Ukrainian military. Others called for more even tougher sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors, which the administration escalated this past week just before the plane crash. King, who sits on both the Homeland Security and Intelligence Committees, said global response should also consider relieving Russia from hosting the 2018 of the World Cup. Pressure on Europeans . Kerry and Republicans and Democrats were in agreement, however, regarding the role of the Europeans who have been reluctant to impose tough sanctions against Russia because of their reliance of Russian energy. ""We hope this will be a wake-up call for some countries in Europe that have wanted to stand back and give this more time and worry about the trade relationship,"" Kerry said on ""Meet the Press,"" repeating a sentiment expressed by President Barack Obama last week. Corker said the western countries response to Russia in the past six months has been ""tragic."" ""I've been indredibly discouraged by not only the U.S. response, but by the European response,"" he said on Fox. On the same program, Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States and Europe have ""to have a far more significant response than we've seen to date."" A new Cold War? Members of Congress issued their own much more dire warning of Putin. On ""State of the Union,"" Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said, ""Mr. Putin is returning to a Cold War"" posture. ""And I think this is a game changer, what happened, the downing of this commercial flight by separatists tied to Putin,"" McCaul said. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security adviser for Jimmy Carter, believes Putin, if anything, has started a new Cold War. ""He has gotten himself into horrendous jam. I strongly suspect that a lot of people in Russia, even not far away from him who are worried that Russia's status in the world is dramatically being undermined,"" Brzezinksi said Sunday on CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS.""","John Kerry said ""extraordinary"" evidence points to Russia providing missile launcher .

"It's all John Green's fault. I'm not just talking about the strong likelihood that I'll be ugly-crying in public alongside fellow fans of ""The Fault In Our Stars"" in a theater near me this weekend -- I mean the fact that I'm reading much fiction at all these days. But apparently I'm supposed to be embarrassed about my love of Green's books. Says who? Says Ruth Graham, author of a recent Slate.com jeremiad that proclaims: ""Adults should feel embarrassed about reading literature written for children."" Graham goes on to assert that realistic (i.e. non-supernatural, non-dystopian) young-adult-targeted books are somehow supplanting works of literary fiction in adults' reading lives and how that's a ""shame."" It's the ""should"" (Slate's italics, not mine) here that vexes me most. It implies that someone else's hierarchy of taste and personal experience takes precedent over your own, when in reality, letting go of that is one of the great spoils of achieving adulthood. Let me get anecdotal here for a second. In my mid-20s, when I was a good deal less assured about my own worth in the world, and rather too highly dependent upon the approval of others, I dated a man who was hampered by neither of those issues. He was six years older than me, born and bred in New York City, possessed of an English degree from a Little Ivy, and let me know in no uncertain terms that he thought my taste in art and media was lowbrow and crappy. I was harangued for my ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" fixation, poo-poohed for my love of ""Gilmore Girls"" and told that my favorite book -- at the time ""The Great Gatsby"" -- was ""so high school."" What should I read then, I'd ask. Something that means something, he'd say, something important. But what I neglected to ask was ""Important to whom?"" Where did my own pleasure, curiosity and opinion fit in? I'm embarrassed (yes, that word) to say that at the time, I knuckled under. While my boyfriend and I found common ground with Haruki Murakami books and Guy Maddin films, I distanced myself from the words, sounds and images that connected me to the world at large, made me think and feel, and moreover, gave me pleasure. For my annual birthday movie outing, I opted for ""Le Temps retrouvé"" and tossed aside my Jennifer Weiner books to heft up ""The Golden Bowl"" instead. Was I suddenly a more worthy, worldly person, with bigger, better thoughts? Not that I could tell, but I did get an awful lot quieter about admitting to people what made me happy -- and maybe a little bit judgmental about other people's tastes, too. And that makes the world (at least my world) a little smaller. But that was a long time ago. I've grown up, and the fellow in question has, too. I told him I'd finished ""The Golden Bowl"" after we'd broken up -- just to impress and spite him, and he admitted to me that he never actually finished any Henry James. We're friends now, and periodically send recommendations of bands and movies and ridiculous YouTube videos to each other, not for the sake of bettering or shaming one another but simply to share something wonderful with someone who will be delighted by it. A brief history of young adult literature . Which brings me back to John Green. I surely hadn't stopped reading in the interim years -- and in fact started writing for a living -- but did so with maybe a little more duty and less abandon than in years past. My shelves, and eventually my Kindle app, groaned under the sturdy weight of nonfiction object histories, cultural critiques and work-related memoirs and biographies that made me conversant at parties and a little less giddy about the cerebellum. And if I read any YA fiction or chick lit, I kept my mouth glued shut about it. But then along came ""The Fault In Our Stars."" It had been recommended to me by smart people I trust, and I had a multi-hour plane flight, so why not? It undammed me. Not just with the obvious, snotty sobbing I did in seat 23A, but in the way that for the first time in ages, I wanted to announce to the world at large that I was in big, sloppy love with a book and I wasn't about to apologize to anyone for that. This quirky novel about two kids in love who are battling life-threatening illness took the brains and psyches of teenagers seriously. It made me hyper-conscious of the seconds between (hopefully) hitting the tarmac safely and a treacherous cab ride on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, because they were standing in between me and the arms of my husband. It made me feel things and do things, and for the life of me, I can't understand that's inferior to knowing more things. And I've read a lot of YA since then: old favorites from Bette Greene, Robert Cormier, Madeleine L'Engle and Paul Zindel, and a new canon from writers like Green, Rainbow Rowell, Lauren Oliver, Ava Dellaira and a whole host of others who deserve to be heard. I read plenty of other books (yes, for ""grownups""), too, and probably even more than I used to because my hunger for good words is so keenly whet. They go down a lot more easily now that I'm not choking on all that embarrassment. Books that changed your lives . Are you an adult who reads young adult fiction? We'd love to hear all about it in the comments below.","Slate's Ruth Graham wrote that adults should be embarrassed to read young adult literature .

"A Ukrainian journalist working as a freelancer for CNN remains in detention two days after he was detained by pro-Russian separatists. Armed men from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic seized Anton Skiba outside a hotel in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk after he had worked for one day with a CNN television crew. Since his detention, CNN has attempted through a number of different separatist officials, including the office of the separatist Prime Minister Alexander Borodai, to secure Skiba's freedom. CNN chose not to report his detention at the time while making efforts to obtain his release. That has not happened to date, so CNN is now publicly asking those who are holding Skiba to release him immediately. Armed fighters led by a senior official from the rebel region were waiting outside the Donbass Palace Hotel when CNN's crew returned from a day's work at the MH17 crash site on Tuesday evening. The official, who later introduced himself as Alexandr Kalyussky, the deputy prime minister in charge of industry in the Donetsk People's Republic, initially accused Skiba of ""terrorism"" and of posting cash rewards for the killing of separatist fighters on his Facebook page. Kalyussky showed a folder of printed documents that he claimed was evidence, including an apparent printout of Skiba's Facebook page. Gunmen escorted Skiba to a waiting car. The young man did not resist as he was led away. Kalyussky seized a cell phone from CNN cameraman Jeff Kehl, who tried to film the detention. Later, Kalyussky apologized and returned the cell phone to Kehl on condition that Kehl delete the video. In subsequent conversations with CNN, Kalyussky dropped the accusation that Skiba was offering cash rewards for assassinations. Late Tuesday night, Kalyussky said Skiba was being questioned for having multiple forms of identification with different surnames. On Wednesday, another high-ranking separatist official told CNN that Skiba admitted to being a ""Ukrainian agent."" The U.S. ambassador to Ukraine said he was ""very alarmed"" by the incident. Geoffrey Pyatt, the envoy, laid the blame at Moscow's door. He told CNN's Christiane Amanpour the Kremlin was trying ""to use information and fear as part of its strategy to sow chaos in Ukraine. That's a strategy that leads to a dead end for Russia."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf strongly condemned what she called Skiba's ""kidnapping"" by Russian-backed separatists. ""We demand his immediate release along with the other hostage I believe they hold,"" she said. Several international human rights and press freedom organizations have called for Skiba's immediate release. ""I strongly condemn this incident. Journalists must not become targets just for fulfilling their professional duties,"" said Dunja Mijatovic, the representative for media freedom at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Committee to Protect Journalists, Reporters Without Borders, and the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine have also expressed concern about Skiba and urged his release. ""The climate for press freedom in the volatile eastern Ukraine has deteriorated further,"" the CPJ warned. The group reported that separatists have detained up to 10 foreign correspondents in the last week who came to the region to report on the plane crash. On Tuesday, a British reporter working for the television network Russia Today and a cameraman for the Abkhazian Network News Agency went missing while reporting on clashes on the outskirts of Donetsk, the CPJ said. RT freelancer Graham Phillips and an ANNA cameraman identified only as Vadim have been missing since Tuesday, the CPJ said. They were last seen near Donetsk airport. On Wednesday, Skiba made a short phone call to CNN. He said he was being questioned at the headquarters of the Donetsk security services and added that he would ""not be available"" before the call was abruptly cut off. It was unclear whether the call was made under duress. On Thursday, separatist officials did not respond to additional requests from CNN about Skiba's welfare. On July 11, Kalyussky -- the separatist official who detained Skiba -- was added to the growing list of DPR officials to face sanctions from the European Union. Anton Skiba had previously also worked as a fixer for the BBC for two days in the wake of the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash.  A journalist at the weekly Moscow-based newsmagazine Russian Reporter told CNN that Skiba also worked for several months in 2013 as a photographer for the publication. He was working as a fixer for CNN -- a freelance position that combines journalism, translating and providing local knowledge.","State Department spokeswoman condemned what she called a ""kidnapping""

"While Iraq's military claimed Wednesday to have driven back militants battling for control of the country, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told Congress that the United States has received a request from the Iraqi government to use its air power in the conflict. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the senior ranking member of the U.S. armed forces, spoke before the Senate Appropriations Committee Wednesday on Capitol Hill in Washington, saying that the United States' ""national security interest (is) to counter (ISIS) where we find them."" ISIS is the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Comprising mostly Sunni Muslims, ISIS is an al Qaeda splinter group that wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. The group has had substantial success in Syria battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's security forces. Since launching their offensive in Iraq, ISIS claims to have killed  at least 1,700 Shiites. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis have fled, prompting fears of a brewing humanitarian crisis. Qassim Atta, a spokesman for Iraqi security forces, on Wednesday night said an investigation had been ordered into 59 high-ranking security officials accused of leaving their posts. The officials could be executed if found guilty, Atta said. Concerns over an oil refinery in the Iraqi town of Baiji continued, a key consideration because so much of Iraq's economy depends on its oil production. The country produces 3.3 million barrels per day and has the world's fourth-largest proven crude oil reserves, according to OPEC. Militants attacked the refinery complex, managing to take over some 60% of it, and set fire to five storage containers, according to police officials. Sporadic clashes are ongoing, they said. Earlier, Atta said in a televised news conference that Iraqi forces had killed 40 ISIS militants in Baiji, 225 kilometers (140 miles) north of Baghdad, the capital. ""The situation in Tal Afar, Samarra, and Baiji is under control,"" Atta said. Atta claimed that Iraq's military were ""defeating ISIS in the Baiji area"" and that ""most of the areas"" around the northwestern city of Tal Afar were liberated. That apparently included 50 Siemens employees, including eight Germans, who were holed up in a power station in Baiji but have been freed, according to German officials. The employees are safe and well, CNN was told. According to German diplomats, around 8,000 German nationals are currently in Iraq. Tal Afar fell to ISIS on Sunday, according to Iraq's military. Many Tal Afar residents, including ethnic minority Shiite Turkmen, fled the fighting north toward Iraq's Kurdish region. The casualty numbers and the situation on the ground have not been independently confirmed by CNN. Saudi government denial . Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki struck a defiant note in his weekly address, insisting that Iraqi authorities ""will win"" despite the setbacks of the past week, during which Iraqi security forces crumbled in Mosul and elsewhere before the militants' advance. ""We absorbed the initial shock of the military operations and now we are on the rebound we will respond and keep the momentum,"" he said. ""What happened was a catastrophe, but not every catastrophe is a defeat."" Al-Maliki blamed political paralysis, not military weakness, for the crisis. He urged Iraqis to unite against terrorism, insisting that the political process would begin to move now that elections are over. Critics blame al-Maliki and his Shia-dominated government for the worsening sectarian division in Iraq. Earlier, the Prime Minister's office released a statement accusing Saudi Arabia of appeasing terrorists and providing radical groups with material and moral support. ""The Saudi government must bear responsibility of the serious crimes committed by these groups,"" the statement read. On Wednesday in a strongly worded statement, the Saudi Arabian government denied that the kingdom provides ""either moral or financial support to ISIS or any terrorist networks. Any suggestion to the contrary is a falsehood."" The Saudis blamed the Iraqi Cabinet for ""exclusionary policies (that) have fomented this current crisis."" Obama, congressional leaders huddle . On Tuesday, ISIS militants battled Iraqi security forces for control of Baquba, only 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Baghdad. The fighters have ""made a great advance on Baquba"" and are pushing very hard to take it, officials said Tuesday. But the city has not fallen. Holding on to cities so close to the capital, where nerves are fraying, may prove crucial to al-Maliki's government. What is happening in Iraq is increasingly taking on the urgency of an international crisis. On Wednesday, U.S. President Barack Obama huddled with congressional leaders. ""We had a good discussion. The President basically just briefed us on the situation in Iraq and indicated he didn't feel he had any need for authority from us for the steps that he might take and indicated he would keep us posted,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters. Also Wednesday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden spoke with al-Maliki, and other leaders, by phone. ""He emphasized the need for the Prime Minister -- and all Iraqi leaders -- to govern in an inclusive manner, promote stability and unity among Iraq's population, and address the legitimate needs of Iraq's diverse communities,"" according to a statement from the White House. The administration faces some tough choices. Obama has ruled out ground troops. Airstrikes remain under consideration. A video message purportedly from a Moroccan Sunni cleric called for attacks against U.S. embassies worldwide if the United States conducts airstrikes in Iraq. The message, believed to be from Sheik Mohammad Ali Algzouli, was posted online Tuesday. Turkish citizens kidnapped . Iraq's neighbor, Turkey, and India have also seen its citizens caught up directly in the conflict. A Turkish official told CNN on Wednesday that the country is aware ""some construction workers in Kirkuk may have been kidnapped. We are following developments."" Kirkuk is one of the provinces that has seen heavy fighting. The latest reported incident follows the abduction of 48 Turkish citizens last week from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. It fell to ISIS militants just over a week ago after Iraqi forces collapsed. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that all efforts continue toward the safe return to Turkey of the consulate staff and 31 other Turkish citizens held in Mosul's Geyara district. India's Ministry of External Affairs said Wednesday that 40 Indian nationals working in Mosul for a construction company had been kidnapped in Iraq. Their location is unknown, ministry spokesman Syed Akbarruddin told reporters in New Delhi. The kidnapped Indians work for the Tariq Noor Al Huda Co., based in Baghdad, he said. Civilians flee . Families -- mostly Shiite -- are leaving Baquba and other Iraqi cities in droves. They're taking whatever possessions they can carry. Some are even taking livestock. Over the past week or so, ISIS militants have pressed forward, taking large chunks of territory. They have had several significant victories, including Tal Afar, Mosul and two villages in Diyala province. In their advance through Iraq, the militants have had support from Sunni tribes and militia angered by al-Maliki and his government, which they accuse of marginalizing Sunni concerns. The tribes, who fought alongside U.S. forces to push al Qaeda militants out of Iraq in 2006 and 2007, want to see al-Maliki forced from power but their continued backing for ISIS is not guaranteed. Baghdad offensive . The Obama administration appears to have some confidence that the insurgents will fail to take the capital. A senior intelligence official drew a contrast between Iraqi Security Forces defending Baghdad and other Iraqi soldiers who melted away in the face of ISIS fighters across northern Iraq earlier this month. ""ISF elements protecting Baghdad are assessed to be more loyal to the regime and are composed of mostly Shia who are more likely to resist,"" the official said. ""These factors, plus the fact that they are defending the capital, should motivate the ISF elements in Baghdad to put up a better fight."" Al-Maliki fired four top military officers that ""deserted and did not fulfill their professional and national duty,"" according to a statement read Tuesday on state TV. Among them were the operations command chief for Nineveh province -- of which Mosul is the capital -- and two of his officers, the statement said. Another commander will be tried in a military court in absentia for fleeing the battlefield to an unknown place. The Iran variable . President Hassan Rouhani said Wednesday that Iran would spare no effort to protect holy Shiite shrines in neighboring Iraq from ""killers and terrorists,"" Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. A senior security official in Baghdad told CNN last week that Iran had sent about 500 Revolutionary Guard troops to help fight the ISIS militants. Rouhani denied the report over the weekend but said he would be open to helping if asked, though with strategic guidance rather than troops. Iran is often accused of using proxies to hold sway in the region but has never militarily intervened in any sovereign country. Iran is closely allied with the Shia-led government of Iraq. The United States and Iran held ""very brief discussions"" in Vienna, Austria, about Iraq and the threat posed by ISIS on Monday. Forces on standby . Still, leaving nothing to chance, the Pentagon is moving more firepower and manpower into the region. Already at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, dozens of Marines and Army troops have moved in to beef up security. Another 100 personnel are in the region to provide support if needed, the Pentagon said. The aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush and five other warships are now in the Persian Gulf. More than 500 Marines and dozens of helicopters are on standby. Speaking at a CNN town hall meeting on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton, former secretary of state and a potential 2016 presidential candidate, said the Iraqi government made a ""mistake"" by failing to forge an agreement with the United States to keep American troops in Iraq after the war. The United States wanted American soldiers to be immune from prosecution. The Iraqi government resisted. ""It's imperative that the government of Iraq, currently led by Maliki, be much more inclusive, much more willing to share power, involve all the different segments of Iraq,"" she said. ""And I believe strongly that if Maliki is not the kind of leader who can do that, then the Iraqi people need to think seriously about the kind of leader they need to try to unite Iraqis against what is a terrible, imminent threat from these most extreme terrorists.""
