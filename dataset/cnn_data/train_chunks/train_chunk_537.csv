Tears: Jack Mannino admitted to crying after being caught by federal agents following a bank raid in Brooklyn earlier this year . A prolific bank robber with alleged links to the notorious Gambino crime family has told a New York court that he wept when arrested by federal agents. Jack Mannino, 43, was known as the 'Seven Second Bandit' due to the speed with which he carried out raids on banks. But the hardened criminal has admitted to shedding tears when finally caught by federal agents three months after carrying out his last robbery in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn earlier this year. Giving evidence at the trial of his alleged partner in that raid, Gary Fama, at Brooklyn federal court, Mr Mannino - who turned state witness following his arrest - confessed to crying when he was caught by the FBI. Mannino had committed 24 New York bank robberies — enough to earn him life behind bars — the New York Post reports. Mannino, who was in continual debt to loansharks decided to become a state witness following his arrest, according to the Post. Giving evidence yesterday, he said he had planned and executed the raid with Mr Fama, but that the raid had come unstuck due to unexpected events. A dye pack had exploded inside the bag of money the pair had stolen while the transmission blew on their getaway car which was eventually abandoned. Mannino was eventually caught by agents three months later on Staten Island, after they tracked him down using some of the belongings he abandoned in the car. These included his wallet which was filled with ID and credit cards and a cellphone, the Post reports.

These breathtaking images show an extremely rare, multi-coloured cloud hovering over a Scottish island at night. The dazzling sight appeared over the island of Scalpay, in the Outer Hebrides, just before sunrise on December 9. Amateur photographer Jez Wheeler was lucky enough to be in the right place to capture the perfect shots of the cloud, known as a 'mother-of-pearl' or Nacreous cloud. Iridescence: The mother-of-pearl cloud glows in a dazzling array of colours in this incredible image . Misty mountains: The unusual cloud is often found downwind of high ground, and can signal wind or waves in the atmosphere . 'I woke up early about 8.15am just to have a look outside and there it was,' said Jaz, a mink trapper. 'It was completely unexpected but I managed to get the shot. It was beautiful.' Atmospheric optics expert Les Cowley said: 'Nacreous clouds, sometimes called mother-of-pearl clouds, are rare but once seen are never forgotten. 'They are mostly visible within two hours after sunset or before dawn, when they blaze unbelievably bright, with vivid and slowly shifting iridescent colours. 'They are filmy sheets slowly curling and uncurling, stretching and contracting in the semi-dark sky. UFO: The spectacular cloud hovers high above Scotland like a visitor from space . Nacreous clouds, or mother-of-pearl clouds, form in the very cold regions of the lower stratosphere, 15-25 km (9-16 miles) high and well above tropospheric clouds. They form when methane in the atmosphere reacts with ozone, and the reason they are so bright after sunset and before dawn is because, at those heights, they are still sunlit. Dave Clark, of Aberdeen Met Office, said: 'It is unusual to be able to see these nacreous clouds as they are formed in the troposphere, high above our weather. They are a direct consequence of us releasing too much methane into the atmosphere and this reacts with the ozone to form chlorine clouds. 'In the past they could only be seen in the polar countries... But that is worrying because of what it signifies about increased global warming.' 'Compared with dark scudding low altitude . clouds that might be present, nacreous clouds stand majestically in . almost the same place - an indicator of their great height. 'They need the very frigid regions of the lower stratosphere some 15-25 km high and well above tropospheric clouds. They are so bright after sunset and before dawn because at those heights they are still sunlit.' 'They are seen mostly during winter at high latitudes like Scandinavia, Iceland, Alaska and Northern Canada. 'Sometimes, however, they occur as far south as England. They can be less rare downwind of mountain ranges. 'Elsewhere, their appearance is often associated with severe tropospheric winds and storms. 'Nacreous clouds far outshine and have much more vivid colours than ordinary iridescent clouds which are very much poor relations and seen frequently all over the world. 'Nacreous clouds are wave clouds. They are often found downwind of mountain ranges which induce gravity waves in the lower stratosphere. 'Their sheet-like forms slowly undulate and stretch as the waves evolve. 'The clouds can also be associated with very high surface winds which may indicate the presence of, or induce, winds and waves in the stratosphere. 'They form at temperatures of around minus 85C, colder than average lower stratosphere temperatures, and are comprised of ice particles. 'The clouds must be composed of similar sized crystals to produce the characteristic bright iridescent colours by diffraction and interference.'","Unusual formation spotted over the Outer Hebrides just before sunrise .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 03:50 EST, 5 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:08 EST, 5 December 2012 . Tory MPs had threatened to rebel against the government if George Osborne pressed ahead with January's 3p rise in fuel duty . A 3p rise in fuel duty planned for January will not go ahead, easing the pressure on motorists who have seen prices at the pump soar. In a rare piece of good news in a grim economic statement today, George Osborne has agreed not to impose the New Year hike. Mr Osborne said he had been advised to delay the rise until April, but has instead decided to scrap it 'completely'. However, a planned 3p fuel duty rise for April next year will be delayed until September 2013 but will go ahead. If the Chancellor had gone ahead with the January rise it would have added £2.53 to the cost of filling up a family car. Experts say it will save the average driver £7.69-a-month. He told MPs: 'That is real help for the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country.' With growth sluggish and borrowing higher than expected, the Chancellor has little spare cash to woo voters. But . he risked a political backlash if he had pressed ahead with the rise, . because it would coincide with rail and bus fare rises, hammering . families and commuters no matter how they get around. Mr Osborne used last year's Autumn Statement to scrap a planned 3p rise in fuel duty for January 2012. A scheduled rise for August was cut from 5p to 3p, but in June this year he postponed it until January 2013. Now he has decided to scrap the January rise, confirming it in today's Autumn Statement in the Commons. 'There is a 3p-per-litre rise planned for this January. Some have suggested we delay it until April. I disagree. I suggest we cancel it altogether,' he said. The Treasury said delaying and scrapping series of fuel duty hikes means the cost of a litre of fuel would be 10p higher in 2014-15 under Labour than under the coalition . 'There will be no 3p fuel tax rise this January. That is real help with the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country. And it will help businesses too. 'It means that under this Government we’ll have had no increase in petrol taxes for nearly two and a half years. In fact they have been cut.' The rises were all planned by the last Labour government to hit drivers after they left office. If they had all gone ahead it would have added 13p to a litre of fuel, breaking through the £1.50-a-litre mark. A damning report by the Institute of . Economic Affairs think tank revealed the high cost of fuel was even . encouraging people to live on benefits because driving to work makes it . uneconomical to get a job. The . study said: ‘Motoring taxes may increase welfare dependency by raising . travel-to-work costs, meaning many potential workers may be better off . on welfare benefits than entering employment.’ Within . certain income ranges, some workers face marginal tax rates as high as . 96 per cent. This means that for every extra £1 earned, the person is . better off by just four pence because of high fuel costs. With fuel duty and VAT combined, tax makes up almost two thirds of the price drivers pay for petrol. This graph shows how the latest cost of petrol (133.19p per litre) and diesel (141.06p) stack up. Wholesale costs were taken from 14 days ago to reflect the time it takes to reach pumps (Source: The AA, fuelpricesonline.com) Mr . Osborne signalled his intention to postpone the 3p rise last month, . when dozens of Conservative MPs threatened to join Labour in a Commons . vote on the cost of living. Tory . MP Robert Halfon, who founded www.PetrolPromise.com to put pressure on . ministers to act to bring down the cost of fuel, said it was the ‘number . one issue raised by backbenchers with the Chancellor of the Exchequer's . team’. RAC technical director David Bizley said: 'The Chancellor had little option but to listen to the voice of British motorists and businesses and scrap the 3p fuel duty rise planned for January otherwise he would have faced a national outcry. 'The RAC and FairFuelUK have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to encourage politicians to recognise the significant impact the price of fuel is having on our lives and how it is stifling the economy, inflating retail prices and reducing our competitive position against Europe.' The Tory MP who lead the fight . against a planned 3p rise in fuel duty today thanked the Chancellor for . backing 'white van Conservatives'. Robert Halfon, who was a vocal critic . of the planned rise ahead of a Commons debate on the issue last month, . praised George Osborne’s move to scrap the January tax increase. George Osborne offered some respite for motorists has he delivered his Autumn Statement to MPs in the House of Commons . During the Autumn Statement, the Chancellor said he was not merely postponing the 3p rise to April but scrapping it altogether. During questions on the statement, . Harlow MP Mr Halfon said: 'Can I thank you on behalf of my colleagues . and Fair Fuel UK for putting the fuel back into the tank of white van . Conservatives across the country. 'Can you confirm the scrapping of the . 3p petrol rise, not just for three months but permanently, will mean . the average Harlow resident is better off by £80 to £100 next year?' Mr Osborne replied: 'I congratulate . you for speaking for motorists and families across the country against . Labour’s fuel tax rises. 'You . speak for Harlow man and woman and I’m glad, as a result of your . campaigning and difficult decisions we have taken elsewhere to control . public spending, we have been able to cancel altogether that fuel duty . rise due for January.' The news that the January rise will not . go ahead was also welcomed by hauliers, who warned rising fuel costs . were eating into their profit margins. Relief: Motorists and hauliers will benefit after George Osborne blocked the hike . Alistair Bingle, managing director of . removals firm Bishop’s Move, said: 'The 3p-a-litre fuel duty rise, which . would have come into effect in January, would have had a severely . negative impact on the haulage industry and a potential loss of jobs . right down the ladder. For me there is no argument – the fuel duty . freeze had to happen and I’m delighted that it has.' Hard-pressed motorists have been . cutting down on the miles they drive to conserve fuel, but near record . levels of fuel duty have been pouring into the Treasury. Since 1991-92 the amount of fuel used in the UK has fallen by 20 per cent to 50.6billion litres. But over the same period fuel duty receipts have more than doubled from less than £11billion to £26.8billion in 2011-12. Edmund King, AA president, said: ‘Drivers in the UK have followed Government advice to purchase more fuel efficient vehicles. ‘It . is remarkable that fuel consumption has fallen 20 per cent in two . decades. However, drivers are contributing 144 per cent more in fuel . duty tax so shouldn’t be stung by another hike in January.’ With average UK petrol prices now at 133.19p per litre, fuel duty accounts for 57.95p, according to the AA. The Treasury is on course to rake in almost £27billion from fuel duty this year - the second highest ever. The AA said the said the Government should be putting its energy into tackling inflated and ‘bloated’ pump prices - currently at around 135p a litre - driven artificially high by ‘speculators’ and proving much slower to come down than go up. Energy minister John Hayes has ordered a report into whether oil firms have rigged the market, forcing up the price of fuel for drivers. It will also examine the number of petrol stations which have closed and the how far drivers in rural areas have to travel to reach the pumps.","George Osborne decides to scrap New Year hike to ease pressure on motorists .

Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, who is pictured below, and Maria Alyokhina are forced to sew tunics onto police uniforms and abide by strict morning inspections as part of their daily routines in the bleak penal colonies deep in the Ural mountains. The band members were convicted on hooliganism charges in August after . performing a 'punk prayer' at Moscow's main cathedral in protest against President Vladimir . Putin and are serving two-year sentences. Bleak: Pussy Riot bandmember Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, left, alongside fellow inmates . A report by Russian newspaper Izvestia said Ms Tolokonnikova, 23, and bandmate Maria Alyokhina had . 'successfully integrated' into prison life - although the newspaper is . believed to have given a positive spin to the lifestyle faced by the . women. Ms Alyokhina is . reported to have to use an outdoor toilet and, as a vegetarian, is . finding it difficult to eat at the prison, in Mordovia, which is . believed to have little access to fresh fruit and vegetables, the Times reports. It is unusual for newspapers to be given access to reports from Russia's prisons. Mordovia is a region well . known in Russia for the Gulag camps here filled with tens of . thousands of prisoners during the 1930s. The . Russian Government is currently trying to fend off international . criticism for its treatment of the Pussy Riot band members, whose . performance in the cathedral was captured on video and viewed hundreds . of thousands of times on You Tube. Three Pussy Riot members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova (right), Maria Alyokhina (centre) and Yekaterina Samutsevich (left) were jailed after staging a protest in Moscow's main cathedral in August. Ms Samutsevich has since been released . The band performed a 'punk prayer' at Moscow's main cathedral during which they pleaded with the Virgin Mary for deliverance from President Vladimir Putin . Ms Tolokonnikova's husband, Pyotr Verzilov, was turned away by authorities when he tried to visit her at a prison camp in the village of Partsa in Mordovia . Three members of the band were jailed . initially, but one, Yekaterina Samutsevich, was released on appeal last . month, while Ms Tolokonnikova and Ms Alekhina, were sent to prison camps . to serve their sentences. Prime . Minister Dmitry Medvedev said earlier this month that he detested the . Pussy Riot act, but added the women have been in prison long enough and . should be released. He made a similar statement before October's appeal hearings, fueling speculation about their possible release. Medvedev's . latest comment is unlikely to take effect, since he is widely seen as a . liberal yet nominal government figure whose pledges and orders are . seldom followed through on. The . band members' imprisonment has come to symbolise intolerance of dissent . in Putin's Russia and led to strong international condemnation. Their . cause has been taken up by celebrities and musicians, including Madonna . and Paul McCartney, and protests have been held around the world.

Jeremy Friehling was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Thursday at his apartment.

Jeremy Friehling, left, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at his apartment. His father, David Friehling, right, helped prepare phony tax returns for Bernie Madoff . Columbus police found Jeremy Friehling’s body when they visited his apartment after friends had become concerned about him. Jeremy Friehling apparently posted erratic comments on Facebook throughout Thursday, prompting concerned friends to request local police to conduct a welfare check. David Friehling and his wife Robin have been married for nearly 30 years and have two other children. Jeremy Friehling graduated from . Duke University in 2011 and was attending medical school at Ohio State . University in Columbus. He was the valedictorian of the 2007 graduating . class at Clarkstown North High School, reports Lohud.com. In 2010, Bernie Madoff’s son Mark, committed suicide in a Manhattan apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. Shamed family: Fraudster Bernie Madoff with his wife Ruth and son Mark at a dinner in Long Island in 2001 . Madoff’s Ponzi scam stole billions of . dollars and cost many investors millions and, in many cases, their life . savings. He is now serving 150 years in prison. Both his sons, Mark and Andrew, worked in senior positions for . their father's securities firm. They supervised . Madoff's stock-trading desks, a side of the firm not directly involved in the Ponzi scheme. On 11 December 2008, Madoff summoned . his sons to his New York penthouse flat to tell them his investment . business was 'one big lie'. Guilty: Friehling's sentencing has been adjourned since 2010 while he cooperates with prosecutors investigating Madoff's business empire . David Friehling became the first of Bernie Madoff's inner circle to be . named as an accomplice in March 2009 . Acting U.S. district attorney Lev Dassin . said the accountant 'failed to do his job, and lied to investors and . regulators in saying that he did.' Friehling admitted that for 17 years he . had filed false statements for Bernard L. Madoff . Investment Securities LLC with the U.S. Securities and . Exchange Commission. From . 1991 to 2008 Friehling never audited Madoff’s business and each year . told federal regulators that Madoff’s company had a 'clean audit . record.' Madoff paid Friehling $12,000 to $14,500 a month as his auditor . from 2004 to 2007. Friehling, . who became a certified public accountant in 1987 and has since lost his . license, took primary oversight of Madoff’s account in 1991 from his . father-in-law, Jerome Horowitz, who met Madoff in 1963 through the . investor’s wife. Friehling and Horowitz ran a nondescript office inside a . strip mall on North Main Street in New City. As . part of his guilty plea, Friehling forfeited $3.1 million and two . properties, including a three-story, 4,437-square-foot house South . Mountain Road in New City. His sentencing has been adjourned . several times since 2010 based upon his cooperation with federal . investigators. He is scheduled for sentencing in April 2013, but that is . likely to be adjourned again because prosecutors say he’s a witness in . another case. When eventually sentenced, he faces up to 105 years in jail. Madoff’s victims are continuing to try to get more of their stolen money back. In July, the trustee seeking compensation for . Madoff’s defrauded former clients asked a bankruptcy judge in July . to release roughly $1.49 billion to $2.43 billion in recovered funds, . several times more than they have received so far, which has amounted to . $1.1 billion. Irving Picard, the trustee, said the . payout would cover more than 1,220 customer accounts. He estimates that . Madoff victims lost about $20 billion from the scheme. Madoff used the money he collected . from his numerous clients to fund a lavish lifestyle for his family, who owned a $7 million penthouse in Manhattan, as well as homes on . Long Island, in Florida and on the coast of France. Madoff kept the scheme going by . sending his investors fraudulent financial statements, leading them to . believe that they were making money.

All lit up: A team of vets had to operate on a dog that swallowed a foot of Christmas fairy lights . Owner Sharon Fay, who refers to her dog as the ‘light of her life’, became concerned when she noticed bits of wire sticking out of Charlie's faeces in the garden. The 45-year-old said: ‘I hadn't even noticed that the lights had been chewed at this stage but it quickly became clear what had happened. ‘Back in March he ate one of my scarves and needed an operation to remove it, but I thought it was just a one-off incident as he hadn't shown any signs that he was going to be a repeat offender. I've had dogs all my life and have never known a dog act like this before.’ An X-ray shed light on Charlie's problem - the tangled remains of the decorations showed up in his stomach and would have proved fatal if they were not removed.

He has a track record for eating bizarre objects like his owner's scarf . Vets rushed Charlie to the operating table and removed the Christmas decorations, also finding a shoelace. PDSA senior veterinary surgeon Sophie Bell said that she had never seen a case like this before. ‘Over the years I've seen plenty of cases of dogs swallowing strange objects - socks, dummies, rubber ducks, but it's the first time any of us have treated a dog that has actually eaten fairy lights,’ she said. ‘A foreign body of this nature could easily have caused severe internal injuries so Charlie was very, very lucky. He was also fortunate that the glass didn't cut his mouth or throat. And he could have been electrocuted if he'd bitten through the wire when the lights were switched on. 'Light of my life': Owner Sharon Fay became concerned when she saw bits of wire sticking out of Charlie's faeces in the garden . ‘With the Christmas season upon us, I'd advise owners to keep any edible items out of reach of inquisitive pets to avoid them from becoming ill over the festive season.’ Charlie returned home and has since gone on to make a full recovery, much to the delight of his owner. Ms Fay said: ‘I'll certainly be keeping an extra close eye on him from now on and have Charlie-proofed my house now.’ PDSA is advising pet owners to be extra cautious this Christmas. Its vets see many cases of pets getting their paws on inappropriate festive items every year, ranging from Christmas decorations, chocolate and cocktail sticks to toys, balloons and bones.","Sharon Fay was concerned when she saw wire sticking out of dog's faeces .

Four men were led out of a New York court room and arrested yesterday after they allegedly photographed a teenager as she testified against an Orthodox Jewish leader. The young woman, who has not been named, is involved in the sex-abuse trial of Rabbi Nechemya Weberman, who she accuses of molesting her. The trial was thrown into turmoil after the men, believed to be supporters of Rabbi Weberman, allegedly took images of her on their phones as she gave evidence. Strict: Rabbi Nechemya Weberman is accused of sexually abusing a 12 year-old girl. Four men, believed to be his supporters, have been arrested for allegedly photographing the girl as she testified during his trial . The four, all members of the strict Satmar sect in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, of which Rabbi Weberman is leader - were arrested after one of the images of the girl was posted to a Twitter account, the New York Post reports. Rabbi Weberman is accused of fondling . the teenager and forcing her to perform oral sex on him over the course . of many years beginning when she was 12. Prosecutors . say the girl's parents sent their rebellious daughter to him for . counselling after she broke several rules of the . sect, including reading magazines like Cosmopolitan and People and . wearing stockings that were too thin. Rabbi Weberman was supposed to be re-indoctrinating the girl and . bringing her back to the ultra-conservative standards of the community . after she was branded a 'heretic.' Instead, she told a counsellor years later, that he was abusing her. Tight-knit: Rabbi Weberman has received strong support from the insular Satmar Hasidic community in Brooklyn, New York . Yesterday, the judge criticised the men for outing the young woman, according to the Post. 'You know about the Torah, you know about rabbinical courts. This is a civil court,' Supreme Court Justice John Ingram told them. 'Your phones will be held for possible criminal prosecution. You may wish to avail yourself of counsel.' The four - Lemon Juice, 30, Joseph Fried, 23, Yona Weisman, 23, and Abraham Zupnick, 23 - were taken from Brooklyn Supreme Court to the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office for questioning. They face criminal contempt charges that could carry up to a year in prison, a source said. Mr Weisman denied taking a picture, according to the Post. All spectators at the trial were then ordered to hand over their phones by the judge. One source is quoted as describing the move as being similar to what happens in a gang trial. The rabbi's lawyers are fiercely denying the allegations. They say the girl made up the story to retaliate against him. They say the she went to police only after Rabbi Weberman and her parents set up hidden cameras to secretly record the girl having sex with her boyfriend when she was still underage. Rabbi Weberman turned the tapes over to police in the hope that the boyfriend would be prosecuted.The charges against the boyfriend were later dropped. Rabbi Weberman's lawyers also claim that he had been a business partner of the girl's parents and that the families had a falling out. The Satmar Hasidic community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has rallied around the rabbi - sponsoring fundraisers to pay for his legal defence. Rabbi Weberman is charged with 88 counts of sex assault.","Judge orders arrest of the men after picture of girl testifying in court appears on Twitter .

If your Christmas turkey  turns out so dry that only drowning in gravy can rescue it, maybe it’s time to change your cooking method. Producers have come up with a new guide to producing a juicy and moist bird without the risk of food poisoning. It argues for a lower oven temperature, together with a shorter browning time and a longer resting period. Scroll down for video . What would Nigella say? The Domestic Goddess favours a hotter oven and shorter cooking time than the turkey producers' guidelines . But you’ll have to wait until next December, at the earliest, to receive the information with the turkey itself. This is because not all producers and supermarkets were happy to sign up in time to get the instructions on to their Christmas packaging this year. The industry is also waiting for approval from the Food Standards Agency, which must be satisfied  the change does not create a food poisoning risk. The delay in going public will add to the confusion about how best to cook a turkey, which has been fuelled by celebrity chefs from Nigella Lawson to Delia Smith and Jamie Oliver. While Nigella favours blasting the turkey at a high temperature and cooking it quickly, the others suggest that cooking the same bird could take as much as two hours longer. By the recipe: Turkey producers recommend longer resting time and a lower temperature in order to achieve the perfect Christmas dinner . The British Quality Turkey organisation represents all the major Christmas suppliers including Bernard Matthews, Cranberry foods, Moy Park and Kelly Turkeys. Its draft guidelines recommend a reduction in the cooking temperature from 190c to 180c for conventional ovens, and from 180c to 160c for  fan ovens. Nigella's opposite: Jamie Oliver cooks his turkey 40 minutes longer than recommended by producers . It also suggests removing the foil just 25 minutes before the end of  the cooking time, rather than the  current 40 minutes. There has also been a change to the recommended resting time – once the bird has been removed from the oven – with an increase from the current 15-20 minutes up to 20-30 minutes. The industry’s recommended cooking times remain the same at 20 minutes per kilo plus 70 minutes for a turkey under 4kg, and 20 minutes per kilo plus 90 minutes for larger birds. Under these rules a 6.5 kilo (14lb) bird would take three hours and 40 minutes to cook. However, even this is far too conservative for Nigella who believes the same turkey should be cooked at a higher temperature in just two hours  45 minutes. The main concern about opting for a short roasting time is simply that the bird will not cook through, allowing food poisoning bugs such as campylobacter and salmonella to survive. But Nigella has always been unapologetic about her method, saying: ‘The truth is we have all been overcooking our turkeys for years.’ The managing director of Bernard Matthews, Rob Mears, confirmed that most home cooks have erred on the side of caution by cooking their turkeys at a high temperature for longer than they need. But the chairman of the British Poultry Council’s turkey section, Paul Kelly, defended the decision to delay announcing the new roasting advice. ‘Due to the wide variety of turkey products available to consumers this Christmas, it has not been possible to reach a consistent set of cooking guidelines across all retailers,’ he said. ‘Therefore, until further testing has been carried out to achieve this, we recommend consumers follow the existing guidance for cooking their Christmas turkey.’ He said all ovens vary and cooks can confirm a bird is ready by piercing the thickest part of the thigh with a skewer to ensure the juices run clear.",The British Quality Turkey organisation's guide to the perfect Christmas bird .

Bravery: Newsreader Carolyn Brown is going under the knife next month to donate a kidney to her husband of 18 months Bruce Connell . Newsreader Carolyn Brown is to donate a kidney to her new husband, she revealed yesterday. The BBC Radio 4 stalwart will go under the knife next month. Her husband Bruce Connell has been on medication since his own kidneys began to deteriorate more than eight years ago. He praised the bravery of his wife and other donors in selflessly ‘putting their life on the line’ by volunteering for major surgery to help others. Mrs Brown, 57, joked: ‘We’ve only been married 18 months. I thought he was marrying me because of my cosy little cottage in the country, it turns out he was after my spare parts.’ The pair met six years ago and married in summer 2011, just a few months before Mr Connell learned he needed a kidney transplant. He said his kidneys had been in ‘slow decline’ since he had a stroke eight years ago and last year he was told they had deteriorated so much that he would need regular dialysis if a transplant donor was not found. Mrs Brown, a Radio 4 newsreader and continuity announcer since 1991, said she had no hesitation over becoming his donor. She said on Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: ‘I’ve always felt quite ambivalent about donor cards, one of those people who thinks it’s something I ought to do but never quite got around to it. 'I knew very little about dialysis. I just knew how incredibly disruptive it is and how going into hospital three times a week for three or four hours just turns your life upside down. ‘So, as soon as all this got talked about, I thought transplant is the way we have got to go if we can.’ Mrs Brown laughed off suggestions she was ‘wonderful and selfless’.  She said: ‘I’m doing it for very selfish reasons, I’m doing it to preserve my life and Bruce’s life and our life together.’ Two teams of surgeons will operate next month. One will remove Mrs Brown’s left kidney and it will be cooled and cleaned before the second team transplant it into Mr Connell. Risk: The Radio 4 presented has said she knows the procedure is 'serious' but expects to be back to work in six weeks . Mrs Brown said she knew it was ‘a serious operation’ and added: ‘I’m not underestimating it, but the recovery period is very short, I will be back at work probably in six weeks and I’m hoping to go skiing in March.’ Consultant transplant surgeon Paul Gibbs said organ donations between couples had become more common because advances in immune-suppressing medication meant an exact tissue match was no longer needed. Mr Gibbs, of the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, said waiting lists for transplants meant patients without donors could wait for years for a kidney. He added: ‘There’s between 6,500 and 7,000 people who are on the waiting list and only just over 2,000 a year get a transplant.’ For more information about donating organs, please visit www.organdonation.nhs.uk .","Newsreader Carolyn Brown to donate a kidney to husband Bruce Connell .

The Newsnight fiasco claimed another scalp yesterday as Iain Overton resigned as editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. Mr Overton offered his resignation following the disastrous investigation into child abuse claims by the BIJ and Newsnight. Friends said he had fallen on his sword because of the explosive Twitter message he sent about the programme, and not because of any involvement in the investigation, which was led by BIJ reporter Angus Stickler. Resigned: Iain Overton has resigned as editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism after the disastrous investigation into child abuse claims by BIJ and Newsnight . Tory MP Andrew Bridgen called for backers of the BIJ to end their support for the not-for-profit organisation, which claims to have received up to £20,000 from charities. He tabled an Early Day Motion calling on MPs to support his claim that the BIJ was ‘totally discredited as a serious producer of quality journalism’. The BIJ worked with Newsnight on a reinvestigation of child abuse claims from the 1970s at the Bryn Estyn children’s home in North Wales. Mr Overton tweeted on the morning of November 2: ‘If all goes well we’ve got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile.’ The message prompted a storm of speculation about the man’s identity, despite Newsnight’s decision not to give a name in its broadcast that night. There have been reports that BBC2’s flagship news programme was ‘bounced’ into running the item because of the tweet, without putting the unfounded allegation to Lord McAlpine. Explosive: Friends of Mr Overton said he had resigned because of the Tweet (pictured) he sent about the programme . The trustees of the BIJ, who include Sir David Bell, an adviser to Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into Press standards, said they were ‘appalled’ by the apparent breach of the bureau’s own standards of journalism. They accepted Mr Overton’s resignation as editor, which came with a salary and pension package of £75,000 plus an annual bonus of up to £6,000. The BIJ was founded in 2009 with a £2million pledge from the Potter Foundation, a charity run by computer tycoon David Potter and his wife Elaine, a former Sunday Times journalist. Mr Potter, who founded Psion, donated £90,000 to the Labour Party in 2001 and was appointed a non-executive governor of the Bank of England two years later. On its website, the BIJ claimed it had also received ‘charitable funding’ from organisations including Oxfam, Save the Children, Stamp Out Poverty and the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust. Fiasco: There have been reports that BB2's flagship news programme, Newsnight, was 'bounced' into running the time because of the tweet . Wrong: Angus Stickler (pictured) headed up the investigation into allegations of child abuse at a children's home in Wales (pictured) that wrongly implicated Lord McAlpine . Oxfam said it had given a one-off sum of £1,500 to support an investigation into lobbying practices in the financial sector as part of its Robin Hood Tax campaign. A spokesman said: ‘We believe it is legitimate to employ independent journalists in support of Oxfam’s campaigning agenda. We will continue to evaluate their use on a case-by-case basis.’ Save the Children denied it had ever made any charitable donations to the BIJ but said it had commissioned research from it. A spokesman said: ‘We did employ them recently to carry out some research into corporate responsibility and its impact on children. We have no plans to work with the BIJ again.’ The Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust said it donated a grant of £4,000 in June this year to ‘assist the Advisory Group on Charitable Status and Journalism to research, articulate and disseminate arguments in favour of charitable public interest journalism’, and said it had no plans for further donations. Stamp Out Poverty said it gave £2,500 in December to assist research into the financial services industry, and said it was a one-off payment for a specific project. On its website the BIJ claimed it had received charitable funding from a number of organisations including Oxfam . In a submission to the Leveson Inquiry, Mr Overton said he wanted the BIJ to be a ‘masterclass’ in public interest journalism and that its work was so important it should receive a levy from the Press. Sources close to Mr Overton, a former senior producer at the BBC and commissioning editor at ITN, said he was ‘mortified’ by his tweet and regretted any damage he had caused to the BIJ’s reputation. They said he had been diagnosed with a serious illness that led to him consuming ‘potent medication’ and ‘taking his eye off the ball’ as the child abuse investigation unfolded. BIJ chairman of trustees James Lee, a film industry entrepreneur, said: ‘His resignation is a real tragedy. He has always shown tireless commitment to the Bureau and we thank him for all his hard work.’ The other trustees are the Potters, Sir David Bell, a former chairman of the Financial Times, and Professor George Brock, head of journalism at City University, which provides subsidised offices to the BIJ. Its team of journalists has produced investigations for broadcasters and newspapers, including a previous Newsnight probe which claimed the charity Help For Heroes used some of its money to subsidise Ministry of Defence building projects rather than fund help for injured service personnel. The charity said the report was misleading. A spokesman for the BIJ said: ‘The Bureau has won awards by disclosing important information in the public interest and, with only this recent exception, by maintaining high standards of journalism. The Bureau remains absolutely committed to this aim.’","Iain Overton resigned as editor because of his explosive tweet sent about the programme, friends say .

William attended the Centrepoint Winter White's Gala on Saturday evening on his own, and said of his poorly wife: ‘I don’t know why they call it morning sickness – they should call it all day and all night sickness.

It is thought to be caused by elevated levels of the ‘pregnancy hormone’ hCG, which the body begins to produce after conception. The . condition tends to appear at around six to eight weeks into pregnancy . and for most sufferers disappears towards the end of the first . trimester.

A newly married couple claim one of their wedding guests stole their cake and gave it to her policeman boyfriend to share with colleagues at work. Bride and groom Andrew and Claire Phillips, from Great Barr, Birmingham,  say their memories of the day were ruined after an old school friend took her wedding cake. Mother of two Mrs Phillips said the friend took the uneaten 75-cupcake arrangement home at the end of the wedding and then got angry when the newlyweds asked for them back. Shocking: A joyful Andrew and Claire Phillips cut their £175 wedding . cake - blissfully unaware that an old schoolfriend would take it home . and give it to her boyfriend . Happy couple: Mrs Phillips said she was 'angry and upset' by the cake's disappearance which had ruined her memories of her big day . The friend said her policeman boyfriend had taken most of the cakes to his station, and suggested the bride 'prioritise what's really important'. The new bride complained to West Midlands Police claiming the cakes had been stolen, but was told no crime had been committed. Childminder Mrs Phillips, 30, married Mr Phillips on October 26 at Holt Castle before their dream reception in nearby Worcester. She had been delighted to invite the old friend, who had got back in touch on Facebook after 14 years - but was horrified at her eventual appalling behaviour. At the end of the night, the friend offered to help box up the uneaten cupcakes, paid for by Mrs Phillips’ new sister-in-law, to be handed to guests later. 'We got so caught up in the excitement of the day that we forgot to hand out the cakes to guests,' said Mrs Phillips. 'Happy honeymoon': Left, the aggressive text messages from the friend after Mrs Phillips asked where her £175 wedding cake, right, had gone . 'We left at about midnight and the woman who took the cakes started to box them up with a bridesmaid, who told her everything should be left in the room until the next day. 'She insisted that she would take them with her, and my bridesmaid assumed that she would drop them back to us the next day. 'I couldn’t believe it when she would not answer our calls the next day. I was so angry that I went round to her house and stood knocking at the door. She did not answer but did eventually leave 25 of them in a black bag on her doorstep. 'I tried to get the other 50 back but received a text message as we were leaving for the airport for our honeymoon, which said her partner had them with him at the police station. We assume they were just handed out. 'My sister-in-law spent £175 on the cakes and is gobsmacked that someone would do this.' In text message exchanges between Claire and her ex-friend, the woman said: 'Falling out over some f****** cakes. Wish I hadn’t bothered coming. Happy honeymoon. 'Gobsmacked': The woman eventually left 25 cupcakes in a black bag on her doorstep, the 30-year-old bride revealed . 'You really should prioritise what’s important. This is not worth the stress you’re making for yourself.' But Mrs Phillips said: 'We are just really angry and upset about the whole thing. This was no ordinary cake, it is really important to us. 'We made a statement with police in Kingstanding, Birmingham. We were given a crime reference number but received a call to say that it would be very hard to prove deception.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'This incident was reported to us on November 6. Advice was given that it was a civil matter.' The force did not comment on claims that the cakes were handed out to West Midlands police officers.","The old schoolfriend helped box up the £175 cupcake arrangement to be eaten later, after it remained uneaten at the end of the night .

A heartless thief mugged an elderly woman and stole her wedding ring while her husband lay on his deathbed in hospital. Former Shakespeare actress Yvonne Sherwell-Demakopoulos, 85, was coming home from a night out with friends on Saturday when the thug followed her into the elevator of her New York building. The burly attacker can be seen on surveillance video at around 10.50pm, waving to the woman as if he were a friend, in the lobby of her upmarket apartment block in the Meatpacking District. Scroll down for video . Brutal: The thief pushes the elderly woman to the ground after following her into the elevator at her apartment block when she arrived home from an evening out . Callous thief: He hides her handbag in his hoodie while she lies prone on the floor . 'He asked for [a resident] by their name, and I didn’t recognize it,' she said. 'I said I would go check, and he followed me into the elevator. 'He was trying to trick me,' she said. 'He got in and pushed me down. I fell on my arm, but luckily my coat is like a blanket.' The mugger then demanded that the woman hand over her black bag, before noticing the wedding ring, she said yesterday. 'My hand was out, and he saw it. He took it off me. I said, ""Please, it’s my wedding ring."" He took it - dirty dog. 'It was Greek. It was an heirloom,' she said of the ring. 'It belonged to my husband’s great-grandmother. [The robber] won’t get much for it, but it meant... the world to me.' Sneaky: Just seconds earlier, he was captured on surveillance video waving at Yvonne Sherwell-Demakopoulos in the lobby of her apartment block, as if he were a neighbour . Premeditated: The attacker even pretended to sit down while the woman - whose husband was in hospital - called the elevator . Mrs Sherwell-Demakopoulos said her husband Christos, 80, is in a nursing home after having a massive stroke last month. He also suffers from Parkinson’s disease and is in his last days, she said. 'I was indulging myself that night with friends because I was so upset with my husband being in the hospital,' she said. The couple have been together for about 20 years, and married for nine years, according to the New York Post. 'We met at the local bar, where else?' she added. 'It was a corner bistro. He was a widower, I was a widow — we were Village friends for a long time. 'He took me to a cabaret and then the Metropolitan Room.' After being robbed, the victim called her daughter, Candela Prol. 'She was hysterical,' said her daughter. 'She said, ""I was mugged, and he took my wedding ring!"" That’s when she really started to cry.' Mrs Sherwell-Demakopoulos, who moved to New York from Waterbury, Connecticut, at the age of 19, said that as a longtime New Yorker, she has been mugged before. 'It’s New York,' the octogenarian shrugged. But she added: 'Wouldn’t that be neat if they caught him? It’s just unbelievable all this horror happens at the same time.'

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 07:57 EST, 10 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:39 EST, 10 December 2012 . A British ex-soldier so fascinated by TV series Ice Road Truckers that he flew out to Canada to become one died when his HGV careered off the frozen highway featured in the show. Former gunner Brett Colley, from Bewdley, Worcestershire, was killed when his truck came off the Alaska Highway - one of the toughest roads in the world - in sub-zero temperatures and plunged down an embankment. The 45-year-old had been driving the multi-ton, 18-wheeled rig through the remote Pink Mountain region of Canada when the accident happened on November 13. His body has just been flown home, and the funeral takes place this week. Taking risks: Former gunner Brett Colley, from Worcestershire, dreamed of recreating the scenes he had seen on the reality TV series by driving through the remote terrain . Tragic: The 45-year-old former gunner had moved from Worcestershire to Canada to fulfil his dream by working for a transport company . Father-of-one Mr Colley moved from Bewdley to Lethbridge in Alberta 18 months ago to fulfil an ambition to drive along the treacherous ice roads made famous by reality TV show. The programme follows HGV drivers as they cross frozen lakes and dangerously thin ice in temperatures of minus 30 degrees in Canada and the USA. Mr Colley's sister Alex Fidoe, 41, who now lives in Perth, Australia, said the show that fired his imagination. 'Brett loved the outdoors and adventure, and he was hooked on the Ice Road truckers TV show when it first came out in the UK,' she revealed. 'He used to watch it religiously and about two years ago he actually applied to be on the show, but was unsuccessful. Dangerous dream: Popular TV show Ice Road Truckers follows intrepid truckers driving on the roads of Alaska to make essential deliveries to remote settlements . Blue steel: Mr Colley had applied to be an Ice Road Trucker but had not been successful. Pictured, stars from the show (from left) George Spears, Cody Hyce, Jack Jessee, Tim Freeman and Lisa Kelly . 'Typical Brett, he was undeterred and he applied for a job with H and R Transport, which has routes along the ice roads in Canada. 'He joined the company 18 months ago and at first he was doing drives through the US deserts - but his goal was to get a chance to travel the ice roads. 'He finally got his chance about six months ago when they put him on the Alaska Superhighway route that takes in frozen lakes and has been featured on the TV show he loved so much. 'He was really excited when they put him on that route. He'd achieved his ambition after watching the show all those years ago. 'It made us all really proud. I told all my friends that my brother was a real-life ice road trucker.' Mr Colley was delivering food supplies with a co-driver when their truck inexplicably came off the highway close to Pink Mountain in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in British Columbia. Excited: The Ice Road Truckers fan finally got his chance to emulate his heroes six months ago, after a year working for a Canadian haulage company. Pictured, a terrifying scene from the show . The region is famed for its herds of wild bison and takes its name from a mountain that appears pink because of its burnt rock. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police are currently investigating the accident, and have interviewed Mr Colley's co-driver, but have told the family it may still take up to six months to discover what went so tragically wrong. Last night, his grieving mother Rita paid tribute to her 'vibrant' son who had been planning a trip back home for a New Year family reunion. Mr Colley's wife Svetlana, whom he met in London, was living in Russia with their four-year-old son Misha. He had hoped to gain permanent residency in Canada and move his family out there. In the meantime, they were planning to meet the ice road trucker in Bewdley for the family get-together. 'Brett was really looking forward to being reunited with his wife and son and the rest of the family,' said his mother. 'It was going to be a big do. Even his sister, who had emigrated to Australia, was coming home. 'He had recently applied for permanent residency in Canada and was hoping to move his family out there for good. Dramatic accident: Mr Colley came off the road in the Pink Mountain region, after setting off from his hometown of 18 months, Alberta, Canada . 'His death has hit us all very hard but we know he was doing something that he really enjoyed.' Mrs Colley, from Bewdley, said the North American transport company employed her son after being impressed by his CV, which included the truck driving skills he had learned while serving with the 39th Regiment Royal Artillery about 20 years ago. 'He spent about six years in the Army after joining as a teenager, and that's where he got his HGV licence,' she explained. 'He was involved in the clean-up operation after the Falklands conflict. 'He also later did some work for the United Nations in Bosnia and Croatia. He loved the Army but he wanted to explore the world and had a real passion for travelling and adventure. He was a real outdoors type and enjoyed life to the full.' Sister Alex added: 'He was a very vibrant person, full of personality. He was one of those people who lit up a room when he walked in. If you sent him down the street for a loaf of bread it would take him two hours because everyone he bumped into, he knew. He had such a big heart. He was very kind-natured and very much a family man. He was always smiling.'","Brett Colley, 45, had applied unsuccessfully to appear on the TV show .

"By . James Chapman and Vanessa Allen . PUBLISHED: . 19:05 EST, 25 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:52 EST, 1 November 2012 . Senior Tories last night warned David Cameron of the dangers of state regulation of Britain’s free Press ahead of the publication of the Leveson report on media standards next month. London Mayor Boris Johnson said that Britain’s international reputation was due, in part, to a vibrant Press exposing corruption and incompetence. And John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, warned he would not support any statutory restrictions on newspapers and websites. Strong: Boris Johnson said that Britain¿s international reputation was due, in part, to a vibrant Press exposing corruption and incompetence . He criticised the Government for giving Lord Justice  Leveson too broad a remit and expressed concern that the inquiry looks unlikely ever to examine the culture of phone hacking at the News of the World – which triggered the inquiry in the first place – because of  criminal investigations. Both were speaking to mark the launch of the Free Speech Network, a campaign which argues that a vibrant free Press is essential to any democracy. The Government is preparing to receive the Leveson report, amid growing speculation that it may recommend at least a ‘backstop’ in law to a new system of media regulation. Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to push ministers to accept whatever Lord Justice Leveson recommends. But there is growing alarm among senior Tories. Mr Johnson said: ‘One of the reasons London is regarded as the greatest city on Earth to live and invest in is because we have the stability that goes with, not just the rule of law, but a system of government that is almost entirely free from corruption and criminal activity, at virtually every level. View: John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, warned he would not support any statutory restrictions on newspapers and websites . And that is very largely thanks to the free, dynamic, irreverent and independent media that we have and is one of the glories of this country. ‘We have got to fight to keep it that way.’ Mr Whittingdale, whose committee conducted its own inquiries into phone hacking, told an event in Westminster: ‘We should hold back from statutory regulation. 'At the end of the day this matter is so important it should be Parliament that decides what to do, not a judge – however eminent.’ He told the audience he believed statutory regulation would be ‘incredibly dangerous’ and urged Lord Justice Leveson to give a ‘chance to the much stronger independent regulatory body being established’ by the industry. He said the new regulator would have the ‘teeth’ lacking from the Press Complaints Commission. ‘We should give the body a chance and we will step in if it’s not seen to be doing a good job, but I don’t want to legislate now because I think that represents a step that’s incredibly dangerous,’ he added. ‘The suggestion newspapers might be held back from a legitimate investigative role would be a considerable danger.’ The MP also claimed that it was clear the terms of reference of the Leveson Inquiry were ‘too wide’. And he expressed concern that the two main issues – how the News of the World allowed journalists to tap into mobile phone voicemails and why the police failed to act – appeared unlikely to be examined because of criminal inquiries. Tim Luckhurst, professor of journalism at Kent University, insisted that a new regulatory Press body must be independent from Government, Parliament and the state. He told the event, attended by campaigners for state regulation of the Press, including comedian Steve Coogan, that any form of Government  intervention would give succour to dictators in countries such as Zimbabwe who seek to shackle free speech. In the House of Lords yesterday, however, several Labour peers urged tighter regulation. Witness: Actress Sienna Miller was among a host of public figures who gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry . Lord . Sugar, host of The Apprentice, said erring journalists should be barred . ‘from practising their profession in the same way a lawyer or  doctor . would be struck off if they had acted improperly’. Lord . Stevenson of Balmacara, a shadow minister and former aide to Gordon . Brown, said: ‘Labour supports a strong and free Press that can hold . politicians to account, which is essential in a democracy, but a strong . and free Press must have responsibilities too. ‘Most . other professions including judges are regulated and there don’t seem . to be many problems there. It is unhealthy for any industry to be its . own judge and jury.’ Viscount Younger of Leckie, a Government minister, said the status quo was ‘not an option’. ‘As . the Prime Minister has recently commented: We don’t want heavy-handed . state intervention but the status quo is not an option,’ he told peers. Steven . Barnett, professor of communications at Westminster University, said . the proposals for self-regulation put forward by Lord Hunt and Lord . Black sounded ‘admirable’, but that it had to be underpinned by legislation to ensure that publishers could be held to account.  Professor Barnett said Press freedom had to be weighed . against the rights of individuals. Professor . Barnett was part of the advisory committee for the Media Standard Trust’s . submission to the Leveson Inquiry.

The teacher, who works at the boarding school where ex-Emmerdale actress Claire King was a pupil, will find out her fate in February, after reports have been compiled regarding her 'scientific' arguments. During a brief hearing at Harrogate Magistrates Court today, her lawyer Ben Campbell said: 'The first argument is that this . defendant was not aware of the content of that which she had drunk.' When pressed by magistrates for more detail, Mr Campbell added: 'She had drunk alcohol, less than two glasses of mulled wine. 'Plainly the reading given later on the fact of it appears inconsistent with that. 'It is understood, in fact, that what she drank was a mulled drink that she thought was red wine.

A 'cold-blooded' killer who murdered her former best friend out of jealousy over a man was today sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Giselle Esteban, 28, killed 26-year-old Michelle Le in the garage of Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Hayward, California, before dumping her body by a canyon 20 miles away. Esteban showed no emotion throughout her trial at Alameda County Superior Court, with Judge Jon Rolefson saying he had not seen 'any hint of remorse'. 'No remorse': Giselle Esteban, 28, was jailed for first degree murder after killing nursing student Michelle Le . Jealous: Esteban was convinced that the father of her child was infatuated with Miss Le, pictured, and warned her ex-boyfriend that if he did not end all contact with the nursing student, 'punishment would be swift' The pair had attended the same high . school in San Diego, before both moved to the San Francisco Bay area. But Esteban grew to hate Miss Le, prosecutors said, . after the victim had a brief relationship with Scott Marasigan, her ex-boyfriend and father of their six-year-old daughter. Even after Miss Le and Mr Marasigan . broke up, Esteban was convinced he was infatuated with her old friend, . said Deputy District Attorney Butch Ford. Mr Marasigan said the mother of his . child, who was pregnant again, had taken a knife out and threatened to kill herself and their . unborn child if he didn't leave Miss Le. He said Esteban became ‘so enraged that she began essentially to hunt down Michelle.’ February 10: 'I hope you find what you are looking for in someone as disgusting as her. I wish I had a kid with a better man.' February 17: 'Cut her out for our family's sake. It's the only thing that will convince me you are trying to be better. Otherwise be prepared to be held accountable for your bad actions and decisions.' February 18: 'If you aren't sorry for anything you have done with that wh*** and are not willing to make things right for (our daughter's) sake, then no, I'm not sorry for the consequences your actions have brought on you both. ... You have dug your own graves.' February 25: 'FYI, you pushed me into insanity with you putting wh**** before your own family. You should have loved (their daughter) and I more, but you loved sex and attention more. Those two are exactly what you are going to get now. You reap what you sow.' February 26: 'And you can't protect anyone. Your wh*** will get what she deserves, too.' February 26: 'Get rid of your wh***. Block her out. Otherwise you bring your own hell on you and all you love.' February 28: 'I was loving and open and took care of you and Michelle, and you two lied to me, not once but three times. It's only fitting you pay for your mistake. So will she.' March 2: 'And Michelle has dug her own grave by being a homewrecker and a wh***. ... She won't be an issue for much longer.' March 17: 'FYI, she won't pass her midterms.' May 29: (two days after Le's disappearance): 'Where's Michelle?' He testified that he had dated Miss Le several years ago, but that their relationship was never sexual in nature and they were just friends. However, Esteban claimed Miss Le had spoken with Mr Marisigan about being pregnant and seeking an abortion in 2005. Her attorney argued that this was clear evidence the pair had slept together, saying, 'What woman tells a man she's not intimate with that she's pregnant and is going to get an abortion?' Esteban’s text messages – which began February 10, 2011, with the message, ‘I hope you find what you are looking for in someone as disgusting as her’ - grew increasingly antagonistic throughout the months. She demanded that Mr Marasigan cut Miss Le out of his life completely ‘for our family’s sake' or 'the punishment would be swift'. She wrote: 'It’s the only thing that will convince me you are trying to be better. Otherwise, be prepared to be held accountable for your bad actions and decisions.' On March 2, 2011, Esteban texted: ‘Michelle has dug her own grave by being a home wrecker and wh***… She won’t be an issue for much longer.’ 'Sociopath' Esteban told her ex-boyfriend that he and Miss Le deserved to die, said prosecutor Mr Ford. Mr Marasigan, who had custody . of their daughter, got a restraining order against her just three days before . Miss Le’s disappearance. Miss Le was reported missing after she . failed to return from a break during her shift at the Kaiser Permanente . Medical Centre in Hayward on May 27. Two days later, Esteban texted her ex: ‘Where’s Michelle?’ Miss Le’s family had offered a $100,000 reward for her return or details on her whereabouts. Her white Honda SUV was seen driving out of the garage by video surveillance later that evening and was found abandoned a few blocks away. Police believe she was killed in the hospital’s car park as CCTV showed Esteban at the scene before and after Miss Le’s disappearance. 'Sociopath': Esteban told her ex-boyfriend that he and Miss Le, pictured, deserved to die, and she threatened to kill herself . Compassion: Miss Le's body was discovered four months after her death by Carrie McGonigle, left, the mother of Amber Dubois, right, who was murdered by sex offender John Gardner III in San Diego at the age of 14 . Devastated: The victim's brother Michael Le, centre, and cousin Krystine . Dinh, right, last September . Miss Le's skeletal remains were found . in Sunol Canyon, near San Francisco, almost four months after she died, . by the mother of a girl who was raped and killed in 2009. Carrie McGonigle is the mother of Amber Dubois, 14, who was murdered by sex offender John Gardner III in San Diego. Grief: Miss Le's cousin and brother . at a news conference in Hayward shortly before her remains were identified . She and her Labrador - also called Amber - found the body after joining the search for Miss Le in Pleasanton. Searcher Marc Klaas said the find would be 'of great personal satisfaction to Carrie' and that Amber would be looking down on her mother with 'pride' and a 'big smile'. Detectives said they found traces of Miss Le’s blood inside her SUV and on one of Esteban’s shoes during a search of Esteban’s home. Esteban was named as a person of interest in June last year, when investigators questioned and searched her Union City apartment. She told KGO-TV at the time that she hated Miss Le because she was friends with the father of Esteban’s young daughter, but insisted she had nothing to do with the disappearance. She was arrested on suspicion of her murder after mobile phone signals from Le and the accused were picked up from the same area. Before the murder, Esteban did a . computer search for Miss Le's home address, according to SFGate.com. She . also stole a security badge and class roster from staff at the aspiring . nurse's university, Samuel Merritt, and called employees in attempts to . learn her schedule, added Mr Ford. Esteban's attorney, Andrea Auer, . acknowledged that her client killed Miss Le, but she argued it was . voluntary manslaughter, with Miss Le provoking Esteban, who committed . the killing 'in the heat of passion.'

Sick: Dimitris Aspiotis was handed the jail-term by a court on the Greek mainland for re-offending after his release halfway through a six-year sentence . A Greek rapist known as the 'Beast of Kavos' who attacked at least seven British women in Corfu was jailed for a record 52 years yesterday. Dimitris Aspiotis, 39, will not be considered for parole until he is 91, which is believed to be the longest sentence given in a Greek court for rape. Three of his British victims gave evidence against the cocaine-snorting thug in a trial in Igoumenitsa, on the Greek mainland. The brutal knifepoint attacks took place in the space of just a month-and-a-half, after he was released halfway through a six-year sentence for sex attacks on other British tourists. Following his repeat offence in August 2010, he appeared in a magistrates court on the holiday island and was ordered to return to a mainland prison. He was also charged with violating the terms of his release while on a suspended sentence for rape and robbery of British women since 1997, when he was 25 years old. Aspiotis would trap the women on a woodland path after partying with them on the beach and repeatedly rape them for hours. A holiday rep from Preston, Lancashire, wept as she described her ordeal in court. 'He would talk to me politely, calmly, and then rape me,' she said. 'Within that time he raped me a total of six times. 'He would tell me in broken English, ""Come on, it is not terrible, I am not a bad man. If you do not resist it will be better."" 'He would ask, ""Is it good? Say yes"". 'I feared he was going to kill me to get rid of the evidence.' Instead, Aspiotis showed her back to her hotel before taking her money and a phone, The Sun reported. Grave offences: Aspiotis is sent back to prison to complete his previous six-year sentence for robbery and rape in 2010. Today the 39-year-old was told he would not be released until the age of 91 . A 45-year-old British holiday rep was also raped by Aspiotis in the woods for hours. The woman, from London, said: 'He was forceful and very threatening, sexually totally aggressive. 'Then he would be polite and almost friendly.' Again, Aspiotis took her money and phone then let her go. His third victim was on her first lone holiday abroad as an 18th birthday gift from her parents. Greek police believe Aspiotis attacked even more British tourists. The Beast, who admitted rape, robbery and assault, begged for leniency, saying he was 'ugly' and that 'forcing myself on them was the only way I could secure physical contact with women.' Earlier, his brother yelled from the court corridor: 'Give me a gun and I’ll shoot him myself.' Greece yesterday sent out a message that it was determined to protect its valued women tourists. Chilling: Homeless Aspiotis calmly told one victim not to resist, before raping her six times, she told the court . When homeless Aspiotis failed to turn up with a lawyer, one was appointed by the state by ballot so the trial could take place. All the female lawyers refused to participate in the ballot. According to Foreign Office statistics, Greece has the highest number of British rape victims in the world. This is believed to be due to the excessive drinking of young holiday makers and the fact that the country still has vast stretches of isolated beaches. There was a scandal at the time, when it emerged that detectives had identified him as their prime suspect immediately after the rape on 12 July 2010 - but waited until he had raped four women before calling the British Consulate to help hunt him down. Police forced his surrender by cutting off all his access to food, to his family and to possible friends. Disturbing: The 'Beast', who would party with tourists on a Kavos beach before raping women on a woodland path, said he was 'ugly' and had no choice but to force himself on women . Aspiotis was unemployed and lived in poverty in a 'hovel, hardly a home', with his parents, his brother and sister. He had never married and told magistrate Apostolos Hajipantazis at the time: 'My family and I live like animals. 'We have no real home, and I myself have been rejected by society because of my past. I have no work and no hope of making a proper living. I know that no woman will accept me. 'So rape and robbery was the only solution left to me to satisfy my basic needs.'","Attacked three women after release halfway through earlier sentence .

A British woman charged with drug trafficking is awaiting sentence on the Indonesian resort of Bali. Rachel Dougall was arrested for allegedly being at the centre of a scheme to smuggle £1.6million of cocaine into the country in May. It was previously thought that the 38-year-old might face death by firing squad - which is mandatory for drug smuggling on the island. Instead, prosecutors are said to be asking the court to sentence her to just a year in a Balinese jail. Looking worn: Rachel Dougall listens to her translator during her court trial in Denpasar, Bali, today, after she was arrested for being part of a scheme to smuggle 4.8kg of cocaine into the country . Dougall was arrested along with her 43-year-old partner, Julian Ponder, and two other Britons on suspicion of being part of an international drug-smuggling syndicate. The four suspects were caught in a sting operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly caught with the drugs at Bali's Denpasar airport when she arrived from Bangkok on May 19. Customs officials allegedly found 10.3lb (4.8kg) of cocaine wrapped in pink gift paper and stuffed in the lining of her suitcase. Bali's head of Customs, Mr Made Wijaya, said 'there had been no attempt to conceal it.' He claimed Sandiford had previously met up with Dougall in a Bangkok airport cafe, where she had been given a SIM card for her mobile phone. Sandiford then allegedly made a 'dry run' a few days before she was found with the drugs. Of Dougall, he said: 'She ordered the . drugs. She organised this. Rachel was telling Lindsay what to do. Rachel . made the first contact with Lindsay.' 'Organiser': Dougall, 38, looked haggard as she listened to the evidence against her. Prosecutors claim she was at the centre of an international drugs syndicate . Police believe Dougall and Ponder were the lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug to rich tourists on the island. Dougall has consistently protested her innocence since her arrest, insisting she was the victim of a 'fit-up', but police said they had a 'very strong case'. It is believed Sandiford, from Redcar, Teesside, decided to co-operate with the police over a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice. They told her she would face the death penalty unless she helped trap the other suspected members of the drugs gang. A sting was set up allowing Sandiford to . keep the drugs with her in a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was . accompanied by an undercover police officer while she waited to be . contacted by one of the others in the alleged syndicate. Police claim Ponder turned up at the . hotel while the fourth Briton, Paul Beales, whom they believe was the . gang's 'muscle', waited nearby. Depressed: She was said to be concerned for the welfare of her six-year-old daughter, who was living with her maid and gardener . Accused: Dougall with her partner and fellow suspect Julian Ponder . Ponder has alleged that he was set up by Sandiford as he went to pick up a birthday present for his daughter. Dougall and Ponder's plush Bali villa . was built on 17,222 sq ft of land bought in 2009 — the year after Ponder's UK-based party-organising business was liquidated with huge . debts. The luxurious property is worth at least . $300,000 (£195,000) on the local market — a small fortune in Indonesia, . where the minimum wage is about £100 a month. It is located in the village of Desa . Belalang in Tabanan, about an hour's drive from Bali's main tourist . areas. The couple began living here with their daughter earlier this year and are also believed to own a property in Cyprus. 'Co-operating': The four suspects were caught in a sting operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly stopped with the drugs at Bali's Denpasar airport . Suspect: Paul Beales, right, was also arrested on suspicion of being the 'muscle' of the group . In June, a month after her arrest, Dougall declared herself frightened for the welfare of their six-year-old daughter, who was then being cared for by the family's maid and her gardener husband on the island. The Foreign Office said British officials were helping Dougall's daughter as well as the arrested Britons. It is believed Sandiford told police she only agreed to make the smuggling trip because her children in England were being threatened. If the four are found guilty, they could be transferred to the notorious Kerobokan jail, or Hotel K as it is chillingly known, where up to 11 prisoners at a time are forced to share single cells. There are currently 90 inmates awaiting execution at 'Hotel K.'

These CCTV images show the last healthy moments of a three-year-old girl skipping through a supermarket door to buy sweets, before she later died from a mysterious head injury. Mariam Alam, of Coventry, West Midlands, was on the brink of death less than 20 minutes after this  footage was taken - and police have issued a fresh appeal for information one year after her death. The little girl was taken to hospital by relatives after suffering the head injury and died despite the efforts of paramedics - but detectives are still not certain how or where she suffered the injury. Scroll down to see the CCTV and appeal... Last moments: Mariam Alam, of Coventry, West Midlands, was on the brink of death less than 20 minutes after the footage was taken - and police have issued a fresh appeal for information one year after her death . Supermarket entry: The West Midlands Police CCTV footage shows Mariam wearing a red flowery dress, white tights and a pink coat walking with her mother at a Lidl store in the Foleshill area of the city last November . ‘We haven’t forgotten about Mariam,’ Detective Inspector Chris Hanson of Coventry Police said. ‘We’re still very interested in what happened to her. I’m determined to get to the bottom of it.’ The West Midlands Police CCTV footage shows Mariam wearing a red flowery dress, white tights and a pink coat walking with her mother at a Lidl store in the Foleshill area of the city last November. Since her death, detectives have faced a wall of silence from some people while others have given wildly different accounts of how she was hurt, but they are appealing again to the local community. Det Insp Hanson, from the public protection unit, said: ‘Mariam was very poorly when she arrived at hospital and died a short time later. At that stage paramedics didn’t know why she had collapsed. ‘There was no obvious trauma or injuries. At first it was treated as an unexpected death. ‘We were unsure what had caused her to collapse, sometimes children can suddenly and unexpectedly become ill due to an infection or an underlying undiagnosed medical condition.’ Walking out: Since her death, detectives have faced a wall of silence from some people while others have given wildly different accounts of how she was hurt, but they are appealing again to the local community . Leaving: Twelve months later police still have more questions than answers about how the tragic toddler died . But the police probe took a turn when the post mortem exam - carried out as routine when a small child dies unexpectedly - found out that Mariam died as a result of a significant head injury. The impact of the injury was so severe . pathologists likened it to a hard fall from height or a heavy blow to . the head. Police then launched an investigation into Mariam’s death. 'We haven’t forgotten about Mariam. We’re still very interested in what happened to her. I’m determined to get to the bottom of it' Det Insp Chris Hanson, Coventry Police . But 12 months later they have more questions than answers about how the tragic toddler died. When witnesses were interviewed they offered differing accounts of the day she passed away. Early investigations cast doubt on some versions of events and to this day officers cannot even be certain where Mariam suffered the fatal injury. Det Insp Hanson said: ‘Less than 20 minutes after this CCTV image was taken in the nearby Lidl supermarket Mariam was on the brink of death. ‘We have built a picture of what was going on at the time but we’re still not sure where she was, whether she was deliberately hit or whether she had a fall.’ Still looking: Detective Inspector Chris Hanson of Coventry Police's public protection unit said the force 'hasn't forgotten about Mariam' and he is 'determined to get to the bottom' of what happened . Location: Three-year-old Mariam Alam died in hospital in November 2011 after an ambulance was called to a house on this road in the Foleshill area of Coventry . He added that investigators believe people in the community know how she died but are reluctant to come forwards. ‘Very early on in the investigation we had an anonymous call,’ the officer said. ‘That person helped to point us in the right direction. We believe there is someone in the community who is desperate to tell us what happened to Mariam. They may be able to tell us a little bit more. 'We were unsure what had caused her to collapse. Sometimes children can suddenly and unexpectedly become ill due to an infection or an underlying undiagnosed medical condition' Det Insp Chris Hanson, Coventry Police . ‘We would appeal for that person to get back in touch.’ Police will today recreate Mariam’s last journey - made on November 30 last year at around 1pm. They will visit the mosque near her home on Fisher Road in Foleshill and leaflet the area in an effort to jog people’s memories. A 35-year-old man and two women, aged 32 and 25, were arrested in March and later bailed but to date no-one has been charged over the death.","Mariam Alam, of Coventry, was seen on CCTV at a Lidl store last November .

A fierce tornado swept through New Zealand's largest city today killing three people and forcing 250 more to evacuate damaged and powerless homes. The storm hit Hobsonville and Whenuapai, western suburbs of Auckland, at around midday leaving uprooted trees, damaged buildings and flooding that closed roads. Three people died and further seven were admitted to hospital suffering a range of injuries in the deadliest tornado to hit New Zealand in more than 60 years. Scroll down to see video fo the aftermath . Deadly: Residents in Auckland, New Zealand, comfort each other following the deadly tornado which swept through the city today . Powerful: The tornado left trees uprooted, buildings damaged and caused widespread flooding in the western suburbs of Auckland . Although the country averages around seven tornados each year, most are small, mild and do little damage. New Zealand's temperate climate means it is not prone to the large, destructive tornados that plague places like the American Midwest. Auckland Council spokesman Glyn Walters said the storm had made about 150 homes uninhabitable. Some had roofs torn off or were severely damaged while others had more minor damage or had lost power. Around 250 residents were taken to an air force base at Whenuapai, where council staff and welfare workers were helping them. Rescue operation: Emergency service workers survey the site in the suburb of Hobsonville after a tornado ripped through the suburb . Clean-up: Winds of up to 70mph swept through Hobsonville, Auckland, as well as the tornado which kiled three people . The worst weather appeared to have passed by mid-afternoon. Mr Walters said. 'It's clearing up slightly but people need to be careful out there.' Auckland Fire Service area commander Larry Cocker confirmed three people had died in the storm. Mr Walters said one person was killed when hit by a tree and that some others who were killed or injured were workers building a school. Two of those who died were in an accident involving a slab of concrete. Meteorologist Richard Turner said New Zealand is not prone to the intense surface heating that helps create the huge and violent tornados seen in the central United States. Devastation: Resident Cale Wood inspects his shed where debris was tossed following the tornado . Deadly: Rescue workers gather on a road amongst debris in Hobsonville, Auckland following the tornado that killed three people . But he warned even relatively small tornados like today's can cause damage and death. Tornados in New Zealand are typically about 100ft wide and last for only a few minutes. Daniel Corbett, a meteorologist with government forecaster MetService, said there had been some very warm, humid air 'like soup' sitting over Auckland for several days before thunderstorms hit, creating the conditions for today's tornado. He said he expected the weather system would move away from the country tonight. Tragedy: Rescue workers inspect the scene where at least two men are believed to be dead inside a truck at a building site in the suburb of Hobsonville after the tornado hit today . Homeless: Two women and their children leave an area devastated by the tornado which has left 250 people with damaged and powerless homes .

One of the three men arrested in connection with an investigation into the rigging of the interbank lending rate Libor was an ex-trader who worked for UBS and the other two were interdealer brokers, a report said today. The British men - aged 33, 41 and 47 - were taken to a London police station after searches at a property in Surrey and two premises in Essex. They were named today as Tom Hayes, a former trader, and Terry Farr and Jim Gilmour - both employees of a London-based interdealer broker. Arrests: The Serious Fraud Office building in central London is pictured. The Government department investigates and prosecutes serious and complex fraud . Mr Hayes, 33, who has worked in London and Tokyo and . who specialised in products pegged to yen-dominated Libor, was taken to . Bishopsgate police station yesterday following a search of his home, the . Financial Times reported. Mr Farr and Mr Gilmour, two employees of RP Martin, a London-based . interdealer broker, and believed to be known to Hayes, were also . questioned, the newspaper said. The Serious Fraud Office opened its . investigation into Libor manipulation in July after Barclays was fined . £290million by U.S. and UK regulators. The bank had rigged the key lending rate which affects mortgages and loans. Other banks are also subject to investigation. At the height of the banking scandal . this summer, the SFO revealed it had been working closely with the . Financial Services Authority. The Government department, which investigates and prosecutes serious and complex fraud, . launched an inquiry into the entire banking sector. It came after a number of traders at . Barclays were found to have rigged Libor to boost profits and bonus . rewards. The bank was also accused of lowering submissions in a . bid to alter the perception of the lender’s finances. The claims ultimately led to the . resignation of Barclays boss Bob Diamond and sparked a criminal . investigation. They also became the focal point of a bitter row in Westminster . over ethics in the banking sector. Investigation prompt: Barclays was fined £290million by US and UK regulators for rigging the key lending rate which affects mortgages and loans . The arrests follow speculation that Swiss banking giant UBS has started settlement talks with regulators over alleged Libor rigging. UBS is reportedly on course to reach an agreement before Christmas and is facing a fine of more than £280million. Around 20 financial institutions have been investigated over the alleged rigging of benchmark interest rates which govern £300trillion of contracts. These range around the world from household mortgages to complex derivatives products. Taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland has previously said it hopes to settle any Libor claims soon and warned potential penalties could be huge.

The Egyptian army was today patrolling the streets of Cairo after deadly clashes between supporters and opponents of the country's Islamist leader Mohammed Morsi. Seven people have been killed and almost 500 injured as the tension which has building since the President assumed near total powers over the country threatens to erupt. Supporters of Mr Morsi attacked his opponents who had gathered to protest outside the presidential palace overnight. Moving in: An Egyptian Army tank deploys near the presidential palace to secure the site after overnight clashes between supporters and opponents of President Mohammed Morsi . Peaceful: Egyptian Army generals have promised that they have moved in to keep the peace between rival groups who have clashed outside the presidential palace . Making a grab for power: An Egyptian army tank is seen behind barbed wire securing the perimeter of the presidential palace in Cairo . Firebombs and stones were thrown in the bloodiest outbreak since last year's uprising that toppled authoritarian ruler Hosni Mubarak. Armoured troop carriers have deployed . and soldiers unfurled barbed wire to protect the palace and help police . pacify what has become a chaotic battleground. With at least seven tanks at the . palace corners, backed by about 10 armoured troop carriers and 20 police . trucks, the two sides mostly shouted slogans at each other from a . distance. But the commander of the Republican . Guard . said his intention was to separate the opposing sides, not to repress them. 'The armed forces, and at the . forefront of them the Republican Guard, will not be used as a tool to . oppress the demonstrators,' General Mohamed Zaki told the state news . agency. President Morsi, who has been silent during the turbulence . of the last few days, will address the nation later today, according to an adviser. The military played a crucial role in ending Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule by taking over from him to manage a transitional period, but it has stayed out of the latest crisis until now. Crisis: Tension has been building ever since President Morsi passed measures giving him almost total control over Egypt on November 22 . Deadly: Seven people have died and hundreds more have been injured amid violent clashes in Cairo . Faith and force: Army soldiers install barbed wire, as supporters of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi pray in the background . It is the first time rival groups have fought openly in the streets after thousands of Mr Morsi's Islamist supporters descended on an area near the presidential palace where 300 opponents were staging a sit-in. State television quoted the health ministry as saying five people were killed and 446 were injured as mobs battled outside the presidential complex in the Heliopolis district of the capital. The fighting erupted late yesterday when members of Mr Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood chased the protesters away from their base outside the palace's main gate and tore down their tents. After a brief lull, hundreds of opponents arrived and began throwing firebombs at the president's backers, who responded with rocks. Tanks: The Egyptian Army has moved in but promised not to repress demonstrators on either side . Appeal for unity: The United States and Britain have called for restraint and an 'inclusive' political process . The crowds swelled and the clashes continued well after nightfall, spreading from the immediate vicinity of the palace to residential streets nearby. Hundreds of riot police could not stop the fighting as officers fired tear gas in a bid to disperse Mr Morsi's opponents. Violence: A supporter of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi chants slogans during clashes with opponents outside the presidential palace in Cairo yesterday . Battle: Supporters of President Morsi attack an opponent during the confrontation outside the palace . Volunteers ferried the wounded on motorcycles to waiting ambulances, which rushed them to hospitals. By dawn, the violence had calmed, but both sides appeared to be digging in for a long struggle, with the opposition vowing more protests later today and rejecting any dialogue unless the charter is rescinded. Mr Morsi is pressing relentlessly forward with plans for a December 15 constitutional referendum to pass the new charter. The scale and intensity of the fighting marked a milestone in Egypt's divide between the ultra-conservative Muslim Brotherhood and liberals, leftists and Christians. The violence spread to other parts of the country yesterday. Anti-Morsi protesters stormed and set ablaze the Brotherhood offices in Suez and Ismailia, east of Cairo, and there were clashes in the industrial city of Mahallah and the province of Menoufiyah in the Nile Delta north of the capital. There were rival demonstrations outside the Brotherhood's headquarters in the Cairo suburb of Moqatam, and in Alexandria security officials said senior Brotherhood official Sobhi Saleh was taken to hospital after being severely beaten by Morsi opponents.

'No different': Opponents of President Morsi say his rule as leader of the Muslim Brotherhood will be 'no different' from Hosni Mubarak . Mr Saleh, a former MP, played a key role in drafting the disputed constitution. Compounding Morsi's woes, four of his advisers resigned yesterday, joining two other members of his 17-member advisory panel who have abandoned him since the crisis began. The opposition is demanding he rescind the decrees giving him nearly unrestricted powers and shelve the controversial draft constitution, which the president's Islamist allies rushed through last week in an all-night session shown live on state TV. Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading opposition reform advocate, said late yesterday that Mr Morsi's rule was 'no different' to Mubarak's. 'In fact, it is perhaps even worse,' the Nobel Peace Prize laureate told a news conference after he accused the president's supporters of a 'vicious and deliberate' attack on peaceful demonstrators outside the palace. 'Cancel the constitutional declarations, postpone the referendum, stop the bloodshed, and enter a direct dialogue with the national forces,' he wrote on his Twitter account, addressing Mr Morsi. The Supreme Guide of Egypt's Muslim . Brotherhood, to which Mr Morsi belonged before he was narrowly elected . president in June, has appealed for unity. Divisions among Egyptians 'only . serve the nation's enemies', Mohamed Badie said in a statement. Opposition activist Hamdi Ghassan said protesters would arrive from other parts . of Cairo later in the day, accusing Mr Morsi's supporters of bringing in . people from the countryside to boost their presence. Mr Morsi's opponents accuse him of . seeking to create a new 'dictatorship' with his November 22 decree. The president has defended the move . as necessary to prevent courts still full of judges appointed by . Mubarak from derailing a constitution vital for Egypt's political . transition. Around the palace, traffic was moving . through streets strewn with rocks thrown during violence in which . petrol bombs and guns were also used. Hundreds of Morsi supporters were . still in the area, many wrapped in blankets and some reading the Koran. Tension: Supporters of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood party throw stones at opposition protesters . Protest: Opponents of president Morsi chant anti Muslim Brotherhood slogans . 'We came here to support President . Mursi and his decisions. He is the elected president of Egypt,' said . demonstrator Emad Abou Salem, 40. 'He has legitimacy and nobody else . does.' Mr Morsi's opponents say the Muslim . Brotherhood, the group that propelled the president to power in a June . election, is behind the violence. The Brotherhood says the opposition is . to blame and that six of the dead were Mr Morsi supporters. WESTERN CONCERN . The United States, worried about the . stability of an Arab state which has a peace deal with Israel and which . receives $1.3 billion in U.S. military aid, urged dialogue. Britain also . called for restraint and an 'inclusive' political process. Egyptian Vice President Mahmoud Mekky proposed 'personal ideas' for a negotiated way out yesterday, saying . amendments to disputed articles in the constitution could be agreed with . the opposition. A written agreement could then go to parliament, to be . elected after this month's referendum on the constitution. But the opposition stuck by its demand for Mr Morsi to cancel . the November 22 decree and postpone the referendum before any dialogue. Protests spread to other cities, and offices of the Muslim Brotherhood's political party in Ismailia and Suez were torched. But Mr Mursi has shown no sign of . buckling under pressure from protesters, confident that the Islamists, . who have dominated both elections since Mubarak was overthrown, can win . the referendum and the parliamentary election to follow. As well as relying on his Brotherhood . power base, Mr Morsi may also draw on a popular yearning for stability and . economic revival after almost two years of political turmoil. Opposition coordinator Mohamed . ElBaradei said yesterday the street action and the polarisation of . society were pushing Egypt into violence and 'could draw us to something . worse'.

Olympic under-performers British Swimming have been left paying the price for their miserable Games after seeing their funding from UK Sport severely slashed. Swimming was the major casualty in Tuesday's funding announcement for the four years leading up to Rio 2016 after it returned just three medals at London 2012. There was good news for athletics, . cycling, rowing, boxing and gymnastics from the record £347million . total but there were reductions for volleyball and archery, while backing for basketball . and handball was cut altogether. Slashed: Rebecca Adlington won two bronze medals at London 2012 but it didn't prevent UK Sport cutting funding by £4m. With Rebecca Adlington picking up two bronze medals and Michael Jamieson one silver, bosses at British Swimming had been braced for the bade news. David Sparkes, British Swimming CEO, said: 'Overall we are satisfied with the outcome. While disappointed with the award for swimming, we recognise we need to rebuild confidence that we can deliver medals at Olympic level consistently before we can demand more investment. 'We had a disappointing Olympics in swimming and we now need to focus our energies on driving the cultural change needed moving forward and this will be built around a no compromise approach underpinned by performance management and strong effective leadership. 'Everyone involved in swimming remains committed to working hard towards achieving success in Rio and beyond.' Despite the cuts, British Swimming saw an increase in funding for four other aquatic sports - disability swimming, diving, synchro and women's water polo. 'We are delighted to see increased investment in disability swimming and diving which is richly deserved although there remains still much to do in these areas before Rio,' said Sparkes. 'The funding of women's water polo and synchronised swimming is welcomed as clearly UK Sport recognises the tremendous progress these two sports have made in the last four-to-five years.' Team GB did better on the athletics track than expected, with the highlights including gold medal performances from Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford, and this has been reflected in their funding. Golden: Mo Farah won two gold medals at London 2012. What a lass: Jessica Ennis won gold in the Heptathlon. Joy: Greg Rutherford took a gold medal in the mens long jump. UKA Performance Director, Neil Black, said: 'We're very pleased to receive the increased levels of support across both Olympic and Paralympic performance programmes. 'The investment in athletics reflects the progress made over the last four years and demonstrates confidence in our plans for the next Games cycle.' UKA Paralympic head coach, Paula Dunn, added: 'Funding from UK Sport and the National Lottery was an integral part of our success in London this summer and we are absolutely delighted to be receiving an increased investment of 59 per cent into the Paralympic programme.' Di Ellis, Chair of British Rowing, said: 'The GB Rowing Team would not be where it is today without the backing and support we have received from UK Sport and the National Lottery.' There was also a welcome from sailing, with RYA Performance Director John Derbyshire saying of the increase from £22,942,700 for London: 'Sailing's Olympic award is broadly welcomed and will enable us to start implementing our plans for the Rio cycle, off the back of having successfully delivered another five medals at the Olympic Games this summer to remain one of Great Britain's most consistently high-performing Olympic sports. 'We're grateful to UK Sport for their continued confidence in the RYA's World Class Programme, and look forward to the clarity and opportunity that these awards now provide us with in our planning for Rio 2016 and 2020.' Hero: Britain's legendary sailor Ben Ainslie won his fourth gold medal at London 2012 to help secure an additional 6.1% funding for his sport. Winners: Katherine Copeland and Sophie Hosking claimed gold in the Lightweight Women's Double Sculls in London and their funding has been increased from £27.3m to £32.6m .

A group of 'psychobillies' - ex-punks, teds and skinheads - stare at a camera in a shopping arcade... the flat-top hairdo of one dyed a similar colour to the logo of a C&A store in the background. Elsewhere, young boys gaze longingly at chunky video games, such as Firefox and Scramble, in a computer shop. This was the face of Peterborough in the late 1970s/early 80s, caught on camera by paramedic Chris Porsz, who spent hours walking the streets taking up to 300 photos a day. Now, the 59-year-old's remarkable record of life in the Cambridgeshire new town has been published in a book, called New England. Mr Porsz, nicknamed the 'paramedic paparazzo', spent four decades shooting scenes that captured the spirit of the town. Changing faces: Paramedic and amateur photographer Chris Porsz took these remarkable pictures of Peterborough in the 1970s and 80s . Nostalgia: The son of Polish immigrants, Chris Porsz, would take up to 300 photos a day of his everyday surroundings in Peterborough . Relaxation: Chris Porsz said taking photos helped him unwind from his stressful day job as a paramedic . Style: A group of young punks congregate on a step complete with ripped denim and Dr. Martens . Remarkable record: As an amateur photographer in the 1970s and 80s, Chris Porsz tried to improve his skills by taking snaps of people in the streets . Many of the images are heartwarming: . children playing carefree in parks; smiling as they are served school . dinners; and queuing to go to the cinema. Others are more downbeat, depicting a place of poverty where youngsters run riot in derelict buildings. Peterborough was one of many towns which . was expanded after the Second World War and attracted young people . tempted by the promise of a better life. In the decades that followed, it also saw an influx of residents from Europe, who arrived with the same hopes and dreams. By the early Eighties, Peterborough, . like many new towns, was seeing huge and cultural changes and struggling . to juggle the arrival of new cultures against high unemployment. After being designated a New Town to house London's overspill, the population increased by almost 50 per cent between 1971 and 1991. A major shopping centre, Queensgate, was built in the town centre with more than 90 outlets and parking space for 2,300 cars. Mr Porsz, the son of Polish immigrants, was a young amateur photographer at the time and decided to improve his skills by snapping people in the streets. Until now,  he had hidden away the pictures in a dusty cupboard. 'Photography has always been a hobby for me and a way to relax from my stressful job,' said Mr Porsz, who has worked as a paramedic for the last 20 years. 'I've always been interested in taking pictures of people and if there is something unusual happening that catches my eye, I will snap it. 'When I looked back at my photos from the 70s and 80s, I realised just how much had changed in Peterborough in the last 40 years. 'The pictures provide a real insight into life in those decades in a town where great changes were taking place.' During that time, new towns were coming of age and families from different backgrounds, including Poland, Italy, Pakistan and Bangladesh were living together as neighbours. New shops sprung up to cater for . these new cultures, but at the same time heavy industry declined and . three million were unemployed. New town: Peterborough saw an influx in population after being designated a New Town following the Second World War .

Hidden: Chris Porsz had left the photos collecting dust in a cupboard for forty years before he decided to dig them out for a new collection . The photos recall the fashion of the time with colourful punk rockers and children wearing flares and tracksuits. It also shows the changing face of technology with pictures showing an old computer show, chunky TV's piled in the streets and children playing video games in a store. In others they are seen hanging out with their friends at a time when playing on their own outside was considered much safer than today. They are captured blowing bubblegum, on their bikes and eating fast food. But the pictures also show a tough side to life in Peterborough, with rundown play equipment, paint peeling off gates, broken windows and rubbish dumped in the streets. Peterborough has a strong tradition . of immigration beginning with large groups of Italian men who were . recruited to work in the city's brick making industry in the 1950s. Later large numbers of Pakistani and Indian migrants came following the decolonisation of the Commonwealth. And the East of England Regional Assembly estimated at least 16,000 Eastern Europeans were living in the city by 2006 following the accession of countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic into the EU. Chris, who is married to Lesley and has three children, Simon, 34, Adam, 32 and Emma, 30, was born in Peterborough in 1953. He added: 'I am proud of my photographs of Peterborough although I never imagined I was creating a record of social history. 'I still walk the streets, . documenting change, and I have extended my portfolio well beyond my home . town, photographing Paris and New York as well as other British cities. 'I . think I somehow capture the spirit of a town in the faces of its people . and I'm pleased to see that most of the time, most of the faces look . happy.'

An elderly lollipop man has been knocked down and killed by a car outside the primary school where he had worked for more than 13 years. Raymond Elsmore, 82, had been on his usual patrol near to Queen's Inclosure Primary School in Waterlooville, Hampshire, when the tragedy happened yesterday. The pensioner, who was wearing reflective clothing and carrying his traffic sign at the time, was hit by a Nissan Micra. 'Shocked': Mr Elsmore's family said they were 'devastated' by the loss of a 'fun-loving, friendly and caring man' Scene of the tragedy: Lollipop man Raymond Elsmore, 82, died after being hit by a car as he was helping a parent across this road in Waterlooville, near Portsmouth . Heartbreak: Parents and children left flowers and letters in tribute to Mr Elsmore at the scene of the tragedy . A witness said he was still conscious at the scene and told his daughter 'I'll see you at the hospital' before being taken away in an air ambulance. He was rushed to hospital but later died from head injuries. The collision took place at 3pm, just before the end of the school day, after Mr Elsmore had helped a parent cross the road to pick up a child from the school. A 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving at the scene and later released on bail until January 31. In a statement Mr Elsmore's family said: 'We are shocked and devastated to have lost Ray who meant so much to so many. 'We feel so lucky to have shared our life with someone so fun-loving, happy, friendly and caring. 'We are very touched by eveyone's kind tributes.' Eye witness and local resident Richard Donsey, 62, said: 'When Mr Elsmore’s daughter arrived at the scene he was still conscious. 'Ray told her he would see her when she got to the hospital, these were the last words he spoke to his daughter which is just so sad. 'He was the best lollipop man ever and no matter what he was always there making sure the children crossed the road safely.' Tragic: Mr Elsmore was apparently conscious after the accident and told his daughter, who was at the scene, 'I'll see you at the hospital' Appeal: Police are asking anyone who witnessed the crash to come forward with information . 'He was a really top guy and there is no one that could possibly have a bad word to say about him.' The retired construction site manager added: 'We’ve started a petition to get a proper crossing on this busy road but it’s all too late now really. 'I’ve know him for years, I’d talk to him when I walked past with my dog which he would always give a pat to, he was such a lovely man.' Sergeant Darren Ord, of the Road Death Investigation team, said: 'At the time of the collision, Mr Elsmore was not escorting any children. 'Many people in the local community are concerned about the collision and I’d like to reassure them we are continuing our investigation. 'We are keeping an open mind as we seek to establish exactly what happened.' Queen’s Inclosure Primary School released a touching tribute in memory of their much-loved lollipop man. It read: 'Following the tragic incident yesterday, we are all completely devastated by the death of our lollipop man, Ray Elsmore. 'He was a valued member of our school community for over 13 years - and had helped hundreds of our children cross the road safely in all weathers. 'Mr Elsmore was well loved by many children and their families and will be very sadly missed. 'Our thoughts and prayers go to his relatives and friends at this terrible time.' Further tributes poured in from local residents who spoke fondly of Mr Elsmore, who they had known for a long time. Joel Hayes, 19, said: 'Whenever I walked my two dogs I stopped to chat to him on the side of the road about small things like the weather. 'He was such a lovely guy and I had known him for about four years, he didn’t have a bad word to say about anyone. 'This has come as a tremendous shock and it’s horrible to think about. 'Devastated': A statement from Queen's Inclosure Primary School where Mr Elsmore had worked for more than 13 years said he will be 'very sadly missed' 'He always waved to families who were picking up their children from school.' Chris Bray, 40, said the much-loved pensioner had often made an effort to stop and chat with his son, Daniel. Mr Bray said: 'You couldn’t help but speak to him because he was such a nice, sweet man. 'He would wave to all the cars that went by - he will be terribly missed.' Dozens of flowers and messages were later left by a lamppost in the road. One heartfelt message read: 'Thank you for helping us and many others across the busy road on the way to school for many years. 'You will be dearly missed by all the local people who knew what a kind gentleman you were. Never forgotten.' Another message from a child read: “Dear lollipop man, I’m so sad I couldn’t do any more for you. 'You’ll be sorely missed by everyone, you sir were a legend. RIP.' A further message from a thankful parent read: 'Thank you for looking after our children cross the road, you will be sorely missed.''Our dearest sweetest uncle Ray you are so loved by us all, you are not just and uncle and great-uncle Ray. 'You are a legend to us and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing you. 'You will be so sadly missed and we will carry around now in our hearts many happy memories over the years gone by, love you.' One more heartfelt message from a young child said: 'We will miss your smiley face in the mornings. RIP, sleep well.'Fran Unwin, manager of the nearby Plough and Barleycorn pub, said: 'This is very sad news. The bar staff said some people came into the pub after seeing the collision as they were in shock.' Tony Briggs, leader of the local Havant Borough Council, also paid tribute to the dedicated lollipop man. He said: 'He has always been extremely careful when he crosses the road - the children will be very upset.' The family of Mr Elsmore said in a statement: 'We are shocked and devastated to have lost Ray, who meant so much to so many.

After driving all around Mars with four rovers, Nasa wants to look deep into the guts of the red planet. The space agency has decided to launch a relatively low-cost robotic lander in 2016 to find out what makes the Martian core so different from Earth. The Insight project was chosen by Nasa's Discovery programme over missions to a Saturn moon and comet, drawing complaints from scientists that it is too focused on Mars. Scroll down for video . Opening Mars: Nasa has revealed plans to send a probe to drill 16 feet into the planet's surface in 2016 . The Nasa science chief, John . Grunsfeld, said while all three proposed missions, which cost no more . than $425m (£270m) were good, the Mars project showed the best chance of . keeping within budget and on schedule. The . Insight mission includes two instruments, one French and one German, . that will examine the geology of Mars in depth, exploring the core's . size, composition and temperature. The InSight (Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) Lander will look deep into the guts of the red planet in 2016 . Mars's interior is a mystery. It has no magnetic field, and scientists are unsure whether its core is solid or liquid or if it has frequent quakes like Earth. An artist's impression of the rover of the martian planet, with a cover over the drill that will bore 16 feet into the red planet's surface. 'What kind of Mars quakes are there? How big is the core of Mars? Does it have remnants of a molten core like the Earth does?' asked the Discovery programme chief, Lindley Johnson. Jay Melosh of Purdue University said geologists have been asking for this type of crucial information for decades and said a project like this was overdue. The mission will be run by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab in California, which is basking in the success of the $2.5bn (£1.6bn) Mars Curiosity rover, which is starting to explore the planet's surface after landing this month. Earlier this year, Nasa pulled out of two Mars missions with the European Space Agency because it lacked the $1.4bn (£0.9bn) funding for the proposed 2016 and 2018 mission. Nasa is still working on another possible Mars mission to replace the cancelled missions, with a decision due this month. The mission will study the interior of Mars in a bid to find out how it formed. Here, the red planet's geography is revealed with a topographical map. But Carolyn Porco, a prominent scientist who studies Saturn and its moons, criticised the decision, saying there was 'too much emphasis on Mars in our current plans for planetary exploration'. She said: 'Most of the solar system resides beyond the orbits of the asteroids. 'There is more to learn there about general planetary processes than on Mars … Why more Mars?' Mars beat missions to explore Saturn's moon Titan and its odd methane oceans, and a mission to land on a comet as it nears the sun. Opponents of further Mars missions say Nasa has not approved missions to the other outer planets or a comet since a Pluto mission was picked in 2001.

When the driver eventually stopped he apparently then got out and kicked the animal in the neck until it stood up, the San Antonio Express reports. He then led the horse down the driveway of a nearby house and left it there. Bastrop County sheriff's office has identified the driver as 43-year-old Mariano Resendiz Villafuerta and issued a warrant for his arrest. He faces a charge of cruelty to livestock animals by tripping, a state jail felony. The male horse, believed to be six or seven years old, had a gash above its eye as well as a torn hide and is now recovering in a shelter. 'This is something beyond horrible,' said Darla Cherry, president and executive director of Meadow Haven . Horse Rescue in Nixon, where the horse is said to be doing well. 'I mostly get starved horses, . emaciated horses. Those are pretty bad in their own . right. But this is so horrific.' Ms Cherry, who cares for 88 abandoned and . neglected horses at Meadow Haven, said the allegations of animal cruelty . are among the worst she's heard. She said a few marks on the horse's . head suggest a halter or bridle was pulled too hard in the past, and . marks on the horse's back could mean a saddle was too tight. But there . were no signs of injuries that were as bad as the scrape marks. The horse isn't jittery around people and enjoys being washed and petted. 'We're going to rehabilitate him, then we'll evaluate him. If he is sound enough, we'll adopt him out,' she added. They don't know the horse's name so Ms Cherry's husband has came up with the nickname 'Dragster'.

The exiled political leader of Hamas Khaled Meshaal kissed the ground as he returned to the Gaza Strip today for the first time since he left the West Bank 45 years ago. He was forced to leave the West Bank for Kuwait following the Six Day War in 1967 aged just 11. His visit comes after days of bloody conflict between Israel and the Palestinians ended in a ceasefire. Prayers: Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal kisses the ground upon his arrival to the Gaza Strip . Long awaited return: Exiled Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal, left, with senior politician Ismail Haniyeh, right, after he arrived at the Gaza Strip today for the first time in 45 years . In a move that underscored the Islamist group's growing confidence, Mr Meshaal declared the moment is 'third birth'. Mr Meshaal considers his 'second birth' the moment he survived an assassination attempt in Jordan in 1997 and his 'first birth' his actual birth in 1956. He became Hamas's political leader in exile after the assassination of Sheikh Yassin by Israel in 2004. In a statement to the media he said: 'I consider this moment my third birth, and I pray to God that my fourth birth will be the moment when all of Palestine is liberated. Gaza has always been in my heart.' During a three-day trip, he is expected to visit the home of military commander Ahmed Jabari, whose death sparked the offensive last month. A huge rally is set to be held tomorrow to mark the 25th anniversary of Hamas and 'victory' in the recent conflict with Israel. Hamas, considered a terrorist organisation by the US and the EU, has governed the Palestinian Territories since 2007. Growing confidence: Mr Meshaal's visit is seen by political commentators as a sign of increasing belief by Hamas leaders that the party is gaining international legitimacy . Mr Meshaal is expected to address the ongoing negotiations with the rival Fatah movement to form a national government of unity in the Palestinian Territories. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who rules the West Bank since Hamas forced out the faction in 2007, endorsed a plan to reconcile the factions last year. Mr Meshaal told Reuters ahead of his Gaza visit that 'there is a new mood that allows us to achieve reconciliation'. Hamas feels it has growing international support following the eight-day war with Israel which left 170 Palestinians and six Israelis dead. Mr Meshaal, who helped negotiated the ceasefire, believes his position has been strengthened by the involvement of the US and Egypt. 'Israel always violates agreements . but Israel will be condemned if it doesn't abide by this written . agreement under Egyptian sponsorship and US presence,' he told Reuters . last week. 'The world witnessed it,' he said. Armed men lined up in Gaza today to greet the 56-year-old whose ear was injected with . poison by Mossad agents in Amman in 1997 before Jordan made Israel hand . over the antidote. Mouin Rabbani, an expert on Palestinian affairs, said: 'It is a very welcome poke in the eye of Israel. 'It is a significant visit that shows Israel's position in Gaza has further weakened to the extent that the leader of the organisation it went to war with last month and it tried to murder can now visit Gaza with the trappings of an official visit.'","Khaled Meshaal, 56, hails moment as his 'third birth'

A care home boss ran an 'institutionalised' care home where dementia patients were sedated with drugs hidden in their meals, a hearing has heard. Janet Foster allegedly told staff to send residents to bed at 8pm, regardless of whether they were tired and refused to let them see a singer perform at the Victoria House Care Centre in Stockton-on-Tees. Meal times at the home were 'appallingly organised' and 15 out of 17 patients lost weight over a one-month period, the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told. 'Appallingly organised': Janet Foster is accused of sedating dementia patients by putting medication into their meals at the Victoria House Care Centre in Stockton-on-Tees . Foster denies a catalogue of charges including failing to ensure patient medication records were adequately maintained by staff and failing to prevent residents from losing weight. She also denies failing to make adequate referrals to GPs and dieticians for residents losing too much weight and encouraging staff to carry out showering of residents only on allocated days. Foster further denies instructing staff to administer medication to residents covertly in their meals or with their sweets. Jean Tomlinson, a quality inspector, told the hearing: 'The ward was very institutionalised, there were no activities for the patients. 'A lot of them just seemed sedated, the staff just weren't treating them properly, they weren't aware of the standard requirements. 'The weight log showed vast amounts of weight loss between November and December 2009, with 15 out of the 17 patients losing weight. 'When I investigated this, I found the meal times were appallingly organised. Residents were just getting up and walking away, and no one was checking to see if they had finished. 'There were no snacks available for residents whatsoever, as there should have been. In my opinion, Ms Foster had no leadership skills at all.' Ms Tomlinson told the panel after she introduced changes to the way meals were offered, the weight loss rate dropped to just one patient in March last year. Foster was dismissed from the home in Bath Lane, Stockton-on-Tees in March 2010 after Ms Tomlinson's inspection revealed a number of problems with her ward. Ms Tomlinson said she had to re-write all the care plans for patients, because they were out of date or omitting key details. At the time of the alleged incidents, between July 2009 and February 2010, the home was run by Southern Cross. Foster admits not reporting a fight between two residents and instructing day staff to administer night medicine at the end of their shifts. She denies the remainder of the charges against her including one alleging she instructed staff on not to allow residents to attend a performance given by a singer at the home. If the panel finds her fitness to practice impaired she could face being struck off from the nursing profession. The hearing continues.

MPs are set to probe Britain's use of controversial spydrones after a report found pilots are poorly-trained and being 'pushed to the limits'. The Defence Select Committee will examine Britain's increasing deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) after an investigation by the Military Aviation Authority found surging demand is 'constraining the length of time available to train and qualify' new operators. It found soldiers with no past experience could be in charge of piloting a spydrone after just 25 hours flying time. The Reaper is the Air Force's first 'hunter-killer' unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and is designed to engage time-sensitive targets on the battlefield as well as provide intelligence and surveillance . A review was ordered after the crash of a Hermes 450 (H450) unmanned aircraft at Camp Bastion, the main British base in Afghanistan, last year. Operated by the Army personnel with . the Royal Artillery from Kandahar, the surveillance drone's engine cut . out in mid-air after overheating. Failings identified could lead to . another incident unless action was taken, said investigators. 'Unless . urgently addressed, the contributory factors identified ... are likely . to continue to affect H450 operations and may contribute to a further . accident,' the report said. Investigation: Chair of the Defence Select Committe James Arbuthnot says the body will look into the UK's use of drone planes to kill insurgents . The report raised concerns about the . selection of drone operators, their training and development, and their . poor knowledge of air- traffic control rules. Air Marshal Tim Anderson, head of the . aviation authority, demanded more than 60 changes to the operation of . Britain's nine H450 drones after reading the report. All have been accepted and are being . implemented. But he warned ministers that the flaws that were exposed . made for 'uncomfortable reading'. 'The findings may be interpreted as pointing to an organisation pushing the limits of organic air competence,' he wrote. About half of Hermes pilots had to be . taught from scratch for each tour of duty. 'The truncated training . pipeline is producing H450 pilots and commanders to a standard that is . ""just enough, just in time"",' the report said. Members of the Commons' Defence . Select Committee revealed yesterday they would probe the deployment of . UAVs in the fight against the Taliban. As well as the H450, the UK has five . £10million Reaper drones armed with missiles currently operated by RAF . personnel from 39 Squadron at Creech Air Force base in Nevada. But five new UAVs will be controlled . above the skies of southwest Afghanistan by airmen sitting at computer . screens 4,000 miles away in the UK by XIII Squadron. The Military Aviation Authority report does not touch upon the Reapers. Unveiling the inquiry James . Arbuthnot, the Tory chairman of the cross-party committee, said there . were 'issues about the remoteness of the dealing of death that are . important'. The investigation will look at ’the . effect of changes in the interpretation of the law on the prosecution of . operations, and the use of remotely piloted aircraft'. Labour is also calling for a new set . of rules to govern the deployment of the unmanned aerial vehicles - . especially when engaged in missions to kill Afghan insurgents. A new batch of drones, known as squadron 13, were put into action at an MOD ceremony last month . Shadow Armed Forces Minister Kevan Jones said: 'We must clarify the rules, given the significance and spread of the technology . 'Whether valid or not, there is a . public perception that unmanned technology is shrouded in secrecy, which . increases the potential for its demonisation.' He spoke out as MPs debated Britain's involvement in drone warfare. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has . revealed that the UK's Reapers had flown more than 39,000 hours and . fired at least 334 laserguided Hellfire missiles and bombs. But it says only four Afghan civilians have been killed in strikes since 2008. Military chiefs say the drones give . allied forces an edge over the Taliban by monitoring an entire . battlefield and carrying out strikes against insurgents. But human rights campaigners claim . the American-built aircraft kill and injure large numbers of civilians . and breach international law. The military is likely to use unarmed . UAVs to undertake reconnaissance patrols around the coast of the UK and . for Nato operations rather than replacing the RAF's Nimrod spy planes. A spokesman for the Drone Wars UK . pressure group, which has raised concern over Britain's use of UAVs, . said: 'The inquiry is a welcome step forward, but as always the devil is . in the detail and we look forward to seeing the proposed scope and . remit of the inquiry.'","Surging demand means pilots don't get enough training, says Military Aviation Authority .

An Army marksman went from Olympic gold medal hopes to a career in ruins after illegally keeping ammunition, a court martial has heard. Warrant Officer Morgan Cook, 40, who had been tipped to lead Team GB to shooting glory at the London games, admitted illegal possession at his home of thousands of rounds of ammunition. He was today reduced to the ranks and dismissed from the military. He was also given a nine-month prison sentence suspended for a year at Colchester Military Court Centre. Admission: Warrant Officer Morgan Cook, pictured right, who was omitted from the British pistol shooting team, has been dismissed from the military for having up 40,000 rounds of .22 ammunition in his home . Judge Advocate Emma Peters said: 'You are, it is quite clear, an elite British Army marksman. 'That exalted position has been lost as a result of your actions and it is clear you will never compete again. 'Competing at that level ought to have imbued you with a healthy respect for ammunition and its safe-keeping. 'Your actions could have resulted in that ammunition falling into the wrong hands and fuelled the evil of gun crime.' Cook, who received glowing character references from his superiors, had already applied to leave the Army. The court martial heard that Cook had stored the ammunition to help train himself and a team for the 2012 Olympics. Simon Reevell, mitigating, said that success at the games had seemed a realistic ambition. 'I can’t say if he would have won but, at the time of the London Olympics, his personal best would in fact have been a gold medal score,' he added. Cook also admitted possessing 3,750 rounds of 5.56mm bullets (file picture) and seven rounds of 5.56mm tracer ammo . 'To go from being a good bet for a medal to being here with his career over is, on any view, a shame. 'When everybody else was watching the Olympics, he was waiting for his court martial and we did not have a team in his particular discipline.' Lt Col Alastair Murray, prosecuting, said Cook was arrested in November last year by military police after Jessica Robinson, an NLP Master Practitioner, posted a video of a shooting exercise supervised by him on Facebook. As a civilian, Ms Robinson did not have permission to take part in the exercise, which involved firing live rounds and automatic weapons. Cook was required to surrender his firearms licence along with any weapons and ammunition. He surrendered some 16,000 rounds but illegally kept about 30,000. Because he knew his service house at RAF Henlow, Bedfordshire, was to be searched he buried the ammunition on a nearby firing range alongside Chicksands base. This was 'outside the wire' and the public had access to the area, with a footpath about 500 metres away. A soldier on a training exercise stumbled across the cache in February while digging a sentry position. Cook became aware of the find and handed himself in, Lt Col Murray said. Cook, a warrant officer class two at the Headquarters Defence Intelligence and Security Centre in Chicksands, admitted four charges. The first was a breach of good order and service discipline by storing rounds of ammunition at his home. The second related to other calibre rounds, some stored at home and others buried. The final charges related to allowing a civilian to use a weapon on a firing range. The married father-of-two has served in the Army for 24 years, completing tours of Iraq, Afghanistan and Northern Ireland. In June, Cook was left out of Team GB despite both achieving qualifying scores. British Shooting said that the men’s scores were ineligible because they had been made during practice and not in designated events.","Marksman Morgan Cook, 40, was tipped to lead GB shooting team ."

Nelson Mandela is recovering in hospital after having an operation to remove gallstones. The 94-year-old, who was South Africa's first black president, underwent the surgery at a private clinic in Pretoria. He had previously been hospitalised last Saturday, suffering from a lung infection. South Africans have been worried about . Mr Mandela's health since he was airlifted to the clinic from his home . in Qunu in the Eastern Cape. While in hospital, tests revealed the . presence of gallstones and it was decided the operation would be carried . out after he had recovered. A government statement said: 'This . morning, 15 December 2012, the former president underwent a procedure . via endoscopy to have the gall stones removed. The procedure was . successful and (Mr Mandela) is recovering.' Gallstones are an accumulation of . crystals in the gall bladder. The condition can become life-threatening . because of the risks of secondary infections such as pancreatitis. Mr Madela's wife previously caused concern when she said his trademark 'spirit and sparkle' was waning. Graca Machel told a South African television news channel that it was painful to see her 94-year-old husband 'fading.' 'I mean, this spirit and this sparkle, you see that somehow it's fading,' she told eNews Central Africa. Mr Mandela's grand-daughter Ndileka told the same news channel that the anti-apartheid icon has come to accept his condition. 'He has come to accept that it's part of growing old, and it's part of humanity as such', she said. 'At some point you will dependent on someone else, he has come to embrace it'. Scroll down for video . Smiling: Mr Mandela made his last public appearance alongside his wife Graca Machel at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium during the closing ceremony for the 2010 World Cup . The pair's comments were the first official remarks by his family since the former President was rushed to hospital. The anti-apartheid leader is particularly susceptible to illness because of his age and his 27 years in prison, though medics say he is responding well to treatment. He fought off a similar lung infection in 2011 and once contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned. Medical experts say respiratory . illnesses like pneumonia striking a man his age are a serious matter . that require care and monitoring. His ongoing hospitalisation . has caused growing concern in South Africa, a nation of 50 million . people that largely reveres him for being the nation's first . democratically elected president who sought to bring the country . together after centuries of racial division. Tests at 1 . Military Hospital near South Africa's capital, Pretoria, detected the . lung infection, presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj previously said in a statement. Public concern: Broadcast vans parked near the 1 Military Hospital where South Africa's former President Nelson Mandela is hospitalised . Security: South African military police officers check cars entering the 1 Military Hospital . 'Madiba is receiving appropriate . treatment and he is responding to the treatment,' Maharaj said, . referring to Mr Mandela by his clan name as many do in South Africa as a . sign of affection. In January 2011, Mr Mandela was . admitted to a Johannesburg hospital for what officials initially . described as tests but what turned out to be an acute respiratory . infection. The chaos that followed his stay at . that public hospital, with journalists and members of the public surrounding it . and entering wards, saw the South African military take charge of his . care and the government control the information about his health. In recent days many in the press and . public have complained about the lack of concrete details that the . government has released about the former president's condition. They had not divulged why he had been . flown over 500 miles from his rural home to undergo the urgent tests . prompting many to fear the worst. Over the weekend the South African . Sunday Times newspaper quoted a source as saying 'he has not been . talking. He is not looking good'. The country's defence . minister visited the Nobel Peace Prize winner at the Pretoria military . hospital in which he is being treated. Afterwards Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula . echoed the official, placatory message, telling reporters that Mr . Mandela was 'doing very, very well'. Rallying round: Worshippers pray at the Regina Mundi Church in Soweto. Calls for prayer have been made for former president Nelson Mandela . Bated breath: The nation has been eagerly awaiting news of his condition . She added: 'It is important to keep . him in our prayers and also to be as calm as possible and not cause a . state of panic because I think that is not what all of us need.' Mr Mandela has a history with lung . problems. He fell ill with tuberculosis in 1988 toward the tail-end of . his prison years, after he had been moved from the notorious Robben . Island and to another jail to ease the apartheid government's efforts to . negotiate with him about a possible release. After being taken to a Cape Town hospital, a doctor told him he had water in his lungs. Mr Mandela initially refused to believe the doctor, he wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom. ‘With a hint of annoyance, (the . doctor) said, “Mandela, take a look at your chest,”’ Mr Mandela . recounted. ‘He pointed out that one side of my chest was actually larger . than the other.’ Surgeons immediately cut into his . chest and removed two litres (half a gallon) of liquid from his lungs, . which tested positive for tuberculosis. Doctors at the time suggested Mr Mandela contracted the disease from his damp prison cell. About 1.4 million people worldwide . die each year from tuberculosis, a bacterial infection which can stay . dormant for years. It also can cause permanent lung damage, though in . his autobiography Mr Mandela says doctors caught it in time. Relations: Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca Machel, at their Qunu home in August . However, tuberculosis can return to . trouble those previously infected, properly treated or not, and previous . damage could have been missed, Openshaw said. Openshaw, who has not seen Mr . Mandela's medical records and spoke generally about treating patients, . said pneumonia is the most likely respiratory illness to affect an . elderly person, though others can strike as well. Mr Mandela was a leader in the . struggle against racist white rule in South Africa and once he emerged . from 27 years in prison in 1990, he won worldwide acclaim for urging . reconciliation. He won South Africa's first truly . democratic elections in 1994, serving one five-year term. The Nobel . laureate later retired from public life to live in his remote village of . Qunu, in the Eastern Cape, and last made a public appearance when his . country hosted the 2010 World Cup soccer tournament. Mr Mandela disengaged himself from . the country's politics over the last decade but continued campaigning . against AIDS. He has grown increasing frail in recent years. He went seven weeks of radiation therapy for prostate cancer in 2001, ultimately beating the disease. In February he underwent minor surgery to determine the cause of abdominal pain. Mr Mandela's last foreign visitor is believed to have been US Secretary . of State Hillary Clinton, who had lunch with him and his wife, Graca . Machel, at their Qunu home in August. In 2011 Mr Mandela's close friend Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu described him as being 'frail'.

When an order of Augustinian nuns realised that the nursing home they had been running in Ditchling, East Sussex, for almost 150 years no longer met modern standards, they had a stark choice: to give up caring for the frail, elderly and mentally ill or to somehow find the cash to carry on. Ironically for an order sworn to poverty, they became property developers and hatched a multi-million-pound scheme to build a retirement village with 235 apartments, a swimming pool, restaurant and a theatre that doubles as a sports hall. Proceeds from the sale of the new flats has enabled the nuns to build three 60-bed state-of-the-art nursing homes in the 250-acre landscaped grounds. And the flats have proved a godsend to older buyers who want to retain their independence but give up the cost and effort of maintaining a large family home. Serene retirement: St George's Park retirement village in East Sussex which is run by Augustinian nuns . Peter Guggenheim, 82, and wife Peggy, 76, sold their five-bedroom Victorian home in nearby Keymer to move into a new two-bedroom apartment, and say their lives changed for the better within weeks. ‘I have noticed a great improvement in my health and confidence,’ says Peter, a former headteacher and retired magistrate, who is in the early stages of Alzheimer’s. ‘I enjoy regularly walking our dog around the beautiful traffic-free grounds. 'And we are both now meeting friends we haven’t seen in a long time. Whereas previously we postponed entertaining due to the time and energy involved, we can now share a pleasant meal in the restaurant without any hassle.’ The couple paid £360,000 for a two-bedroom apartment in the St George’s Park retirement village, whose grounds include a well-stocked fishing lake, wheelchair-friendly parks and even residents’ allotments. Downsized Abbey: Peggy, 76, and Peter Guggenheim, 82, have new energy after they sold their five-bedroom property and moved into a two-bed flat on St George's Park . Healthy old age: St George's Park provide a gym and care options for the retirees who move into their care home or the independent flats . The Guggenheims still have plenty of space – the living room alone is 25ft long. ‘We had 14 people here for drinks last Sunday,’ says Peggy, a former trust and estate practitioner, who knew of the development and the Augustinians’ reputation for care and hospitality. ‘Once we made the decision to downsize, I knew where I wanted us to live. I was aware of the excellent reputation of the care home at St George’s Park. I had also watched the retirement village develop and knew it offered an outstanding opportunity to live independently.’ As well as the potential of a place in one of the homes when they become frail, residents of St George’s Park can buy the services of individual carers as and when they need them. But the real emphasis is on community and convenience. There is a shop, a gym, a hairdressing salon, a library, a snooker room and treatment rooms for visiting professionals, such as chiropodists and physiotherapists. Catering for their needs: The retirement home works like a community and has a restaurant, shop, library and a hairdressers . By day, the grand hall of the original nursing home is used for bowls and tennis, and by night it becomes a theatre or concert hall. The village is not yet finished – a swimming pool and tennis courts are in the pipeline. Two-bedroom flats in the latest phase can be bought from £345,000. Everywhere is accessible in a wheelchair and there are video entry phones and a sophisticated fire alarm system, while security staff monitor the whole village. The cost of the facilities, as well as sundries such as window-cleaning, is included in a monthly service charge of about £300. The nuns manage the village and retain the freehold of the estate. Owners can be assured the Augustinian tradition of hospitality will continue, as planning permission forbids the order from selling to a commercial landlord.

Plans to store billions of pieces of private information from emails, Facebook, texts and internet use are set to be scuppered by the Liberal Democrats. They are ready to oppose a proposed £2billion law affecting everyone online or using a mobile phone which has been criticised as a snoopers' charter. The potential threat comes as a powerful committee of MPs and peers is expected to publish a series of damning criticisms of the Communications Data Bill next week. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is expected to oppose the plans to store billions of pieces of private information in their entirety . These will include the verdict that it infringes civil liberties and invades privacy. Crucially, the committee will also suggest that ministers have not made the case for the measure. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is expected to use those conclusions to oppose the plans in their entirety. He has previously insisted that he will not approve anything which threatens civil liberties. A party source said: 'Obviously given how strongly Nick felt on this, we would take the recommendations of the committee very seriously.' Mr Clegg met the Prime Minister this week to discuss the issue and was 'non-committal' about the Bill's future, the BBC reported. Isabelle Sankey, director of policy for Liberty, called on MPs to 'oppose this snoopers' charter which has no place in a free society'. Officials warn that unless a law is brought in new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images . She added: 'It would waste billions . and pave the way for blanket surveillance of innocent citizens' personal . data. Home Office evidence to the committee has been woeful.' The . Home Office insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 . months, along with use of Skype and even online games consoles, will . protect national security. Without it, police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time, they argue. Officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images. Gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data. The plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made, not what was said. The content of emails would also not be stored, just details of who sent and received them. The joint committee on the Bill has examined it in detail and is likely to conclude that even collecting the data is open to abuse. It may also contradict claims that it is possible to separate details of messages from their content. There is strong opposition to the Bill among Lib Dem and Tory backbenchers. Crucially, Labour has yet to indicate how it will vote. Committee member Julian Huppert has said the Bill is 'botched' and 'unfit in principle and detail'.","Party opposes £2bn law affecting everyone online or using mobile phone .

Registered students are now able to book appointments for Botox and fillers, lip enhancers, facial peels and laser treatments, all conducted by healthcare professionals who are studying for an MSc at the university, the Huffington Post reports. The service is offered as part of the university's MSc/PGDip in Non-Surgical Facial Aesthetics for Registered Healthcare Professionals. The graduate programme offers a part-time qualification in facial cosmetic enhancements for healtcare professionals wishing to branch out into the a booming industry. A spokesman from the university said: 'Over recent years, the provision of non-surgical facial aesthetic treatments has emerged as a key growth area within healthcare delivery in the United Kingdom. 'UCLan's MSc/PgDip Facial Aesthetics programme is designed to ensure that practising clinicians, be they doctors or dentists, are recognised to be the leading evidence-based practitioners in their field.' The saddest thing about the situation is the revelation from the Dental Clinic, where the procedures will take place, who claimed that a number of students have registered their interest. Heather Lomax, a UCLan student and member of the UCLan Feminist society has spoken of her outrage at learning of the university's offer. She told the Huffington Post's Faye Grima: 'UCLan is a university, and should be offering education and supporting the health and needs of students, not offering Botox, which certainly has its risks. The very idea of it, of students feeling the need to beat the (perfectly natural) aging process, to have perfect skin, makes me feel sick.' The University of Central Lancashire introduced the course to meet demands in a growing industry . Ed Farthing, a third-year English studies student also expressed his disgust with the recent proposals. He said: 'Botox and similar treatments epitomise the ever-growing modern day fanaticism with the ""perfect self"" image, and often enough force users into a never-ending life of constant addictive usage.'","Feminist campaigners in the student body are outraged by the offer .

A middle-aged woman claimed cash benefits for two male relatives, both of whom were dead, a jury heard today. Janet Parlour did not reveal either man’s death when claiming the money and managed to accrue almost £20,000 pounds illegally, according to the prosecution. Today the 62-year-old woman faced charges of fraud and failure to disclose information in relation to the two dead men - one of whom was her father and the other her cousin. Reading Crown Court where Janet Parlour's trial is being heard by Mr Recorder Laurence West QC . Parlour continued to receive her cousin’s housing benefit and her father’s pension even after the former moved out and then after both men had died, the jury heard. She also did not tell her local council of her cousin Alan Roberts’ departure or his death, it was claimed. Nor did she inform the Department for Work and Pensions that her father, Charles Summers, had died. Instead she contacted them to insist he had not died and that his pension should continue. Giles Atkinson, prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, told the seven men and five women on the jury: 'What we say in this case is that the defendant, Mrs Parlour, has both given false information and also failed to give information and in both respects we say she did that in order to receive or to continue to receive the benefit that should not have been coming to her. 'We also say that in doing that, she was dishonest.' He added: 'An important point is that both of the people who were entitled to the benefit are now dead.' He said on the forms filled in by Mr Roberts and Mrs Parlour when he first moved into the home she shared with husband John, in 2005, both falsely stated that they were not related to each other. After being assessed she began to receive payments from West Berkshire Council direct to her bank account for £75 pounds per week, to cover his rent. When he then moved out of her home, in Calcot, Berkshire, she did not tell the council and continued to receive the money. Even after he died, on March 25, 2009, she still did not let on. Mr Atkinson said: 'The second person is the defendant’s father, Charles Summers, and it was to him the pension was due. 'Both sets were paid directly to the defendant. In the case of Mr Roberts it was because she was acting as his landlady. In the case of Mr Summers it was because she was acting as an appointee, handling his affairs. 'The DWP was initially informed about the death of Mr Summers but then there was a phone call from someone calling themselves Janet Parlour, the daughter of Mr Summers, in effect retracting the statement, that the circumstances had changed, and that the pension should continue.' Mr Summers had passed away on February 2, 2009. Karen Coggs, the then manager of the Salvation Army Centre in Reading, said Mr Roberts had been a client there and had given his previous address as Willow Tree Glade. They got him to apply for housing benefit to cover his time with them and it was a routine audit some time later by West Berkshire and Reading Councils that exposed the duplicate applications. It was during the same audit that investigators realised Mr Roberts had actually died. Mrs Coggs, appearing in the witness box at Reading Crown Court, admitted under cross-examination by defence counsel Nigel Daly that she did not know of Janet Parlour’s existence at the time. She also acknowledged she could not see how Parlour would have known that Mr Roberts was living at the hostel. Parlour denies fraud by dishonestly furnishing a document, by failing to give prompt notification of a change of circumstances, and three further counts by failing to disclose information. When interviewed by investigators from West Berkshire Council, Parlour told them she had had “a bit of a nervous breakdown” because of her father dying. As a result she had left her job with Cleaning Logistics of Twyford, Berkshire. She also told them that her cousin, Alan Roberts, had come to live with her because he had been deported from America. Describing him as “an alcoholic” and “a nomad”, she said she would never know where he was and that sometimes he would come back and leave the house in a mess. “He was family”, she explained as her reason for putting him up. When the council uncovered the over-payments she told them she had tried to contact them on a number of occasions to let them know about Mr Roberts’ death but that she had never received a reply. So she put all of the housing benefit income into an old account held in her son’s name, she said, and did not touch it. Karen Greenaway, principal investigator in the case, said the total overpaid in housing benefit was £13,800 pounds. She told the court that when the situation with Charles Summers was revealed, Parlour flatly denied continuing to receive his pension payments. She also said it had not been her who called the DWP to request that the payments continue, even after her father’s death had been registered. The trial, before Mr Recorder Laurence West QC, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Janet Parlour, 62, claimed cash benefits for two male relatives .

A killer who stabbed a cannabis dealer to death less than two hours after carrying out unpaid work in the community was jailed for at least 25 years today. Reardon Emanuel, 20, attacked 36 year-old O’Neil Irwin while under the supervision of the Probation Service for having an offensive weapon in public. Emanuel, who had arranged to meet Mr Irwin to buy drugs, was spotted chasing the fatally wounded victim down the road before fleeing on his bicycle. Mr Irwin left a trail of blood as he fled before collapsing in front of two police officers who happened to be on patrol in their van. He was able to gesture down the street and give a brief description of his killer before bleeding to death at the scene in Forest Road, Walthamstow, east London. When Emanuel was arrested two days later detectives found the victim’s blood on the handlebar of his bicycle. Mobile phone records also showed he had called Mr Irwin three times in the 90 minutes before the murder. Emanuel was convicted of murder by a jury after a trial at the Old Bailey. Judge Paul Worsley QC sentenced him to life imprisonment with a minimum of 25 years before parole. The judge told him: ‘He did not deserve to die at your hands in the street.’ Mr Irwin, who lived in Winsbeach, Walthamstow, came to the UK from Jamaica in 2002 and earned money by selling cannabis. On May 21 this year he carried out several deals before being phoned by Emmanuel at 3.32pm. Emanuel, who was doing unpaid work in the community between 9.15am and 3.15pm that day, contacted Mr Irwin for a third and final time at 4.56pm. A few minutes later a woman living in Ulverston Road saw the victim being chased up towards the junction with Forest Road. Zoe Johnson, prosecuting, told the court: ‘The two men met to carry out some sort of drug deal. Something went terribly wrong. For whatever reason the defendant attacked the deceased and stabbed him several times including once in the back. ‘The deceased tried to flee but the defendant chased him until he collapsed and died.’ Moments later Emmanuel returned to pick up his bicycle and rode off. Mr Irwin had been stabbed four times in the chest and once in the back and died from a wound to his left ventricle. Detectives found a wrap containing 14g of cocaine and another wrap containing just over 7g of heroin on his body. The court heard Emanuel was under the supervision of the Probation service following a conviction for having an offensive weapon in public. Emanuel denied murder but was convicted.","Reardon Emanuel, 20, convicted of murder by a jury after a trial at the Old Bailey .

Gone: Avon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Colin Port who has quit after newly elected PCC Sue Mountstevens said he would have to reapply for his own job . A mother-of-three elected as a new Police and Crime Commissioner has seen off the current chief constable on her first day in the job. Sue Mountstevens, 57, who was elected last week as an independent candidate, told long serving Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Colin Port he must reapply for his own job. He refused, and quit on the spot. He is the first of what is expected to be a number of casualties of the new regime in which elected officials take control of the police for the first time. Mrs Mountstevens, a former magistrate and married mother of three children, stood on a platform of cutting anti-social behaviour, burglary and violence. She also promised to keep party politics out of policing and act ‘without interference of national politics’. The day before she took office, she met Mr Port - who has led the force for eight years - and told him his post would be opened to competition from outsiders and he would have to reapply. She had the option of extending his contract for another year, but advertising the job would allow her to appoint a chief for her whole three and a half year term, she told him. Mr Port, who will retire on a pension estimated at £100,000 a year, said: ‘Yesterday I had a meeting with the police and crime commissioner. ‘She told me she intends to start the process to recruit a chief constable to take Avon and Somerset forward. I told her I had no intention of applying for my job.’ ‘I can confirm that I will be retiring from the police service on January 26 2013 at the end of my fixed-term appointment. In effect, I will be leaving considerably sooner.’ Winner: Independent candidate Sue Mountstevens, pictured taking to the stage after clinching the role of Avon and Somerset Police & Crime Commissioner . Mrs Mountstevens, was a long-serving . member of the Police Authority and director of a local family business, . Mountstevens Bakeries. Sue Mountstevens, who lives near Pill, North . Somerset, spent 15 years as a magistrate serving on adult, youth and family . cases. The mother of three was a director of family business Mountstevens Bakeries, . which employed around 1,300 people and had more than 90 outlets across the South . West. Mrs Mountstevens, 57, who has also served on crime, police and . prison boards, was elected to her new position with 65 per cent of the vote in the second round . of counting last week. She was elected ahead of the Tory candidate last Friday with 125,704 votes to 67,842. She paid tribute to Mr Port saying he had ‘made great improvements for this area’ and said he would be ‘greatly missed’. She . said: ‘Everyone is aware that the chief constable’s contract expires on . January 26. Because of that, I would like to run a competitive process . to appoint a chief constable for my whole term of office. ‘It was his choice not to apply but I know that he will continue to do great things and I wish him the very best for the future. He has increased detection rates and reduced crime. He will be greatly missed by staff and partners.’ Long-serving: Colin Port had been Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police for the past eight years . Police and Crime Commissioners were . elected following votes last Thursday in 41 police areas across England . and Wales. Police and crime commissioners have the job of ‘bringing communities closer to the police, building confidence in the system and restoring trust’, according to the Home Office website. They are tasked with creating a police and crime plan, setting the force budget and appointing or dismissing the chief constable. The former police authorities also had the power to hire and fire but this rarely happened. Four police forces in the South West now have acting chief . constables, but they are not all said to be looking at going for the top job. The polls were marred by poor turnout, with just one in six . registered voters participating. PCCs . will have powers to hire and fire force Chief Constables, and will set . the priorities for policing in their area. Senior officers fiercely . resisted the creation of PCC posts, claiming they would politicise the . police.

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 19:21 EST, 17 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:01 EST, 18 December 2012 . Broadside: Conservative Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has accused European lawmakers of overstepping their authority and deciding matters best left to domestic courts . A senior cabinet minister last night accused European human rights judges of ‘overstepping the mark’ - in a significant ratcheting up of hostilities with the Strasbourg court. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling’s remarks are the strongest condemnation to date of the controversial court from a Tory minister. He accuses the judges of prying ‘more and more’ into areas that should be decided in domestic courts or by MPs in Parliament. His explosive comments came ahead of the publication today of the final report by a panel of experts set up to examine a replacement to Labour’s Human Rights Act. But the ‘Commission on a Bill of Rights’ which was set up by David Cameron to end the rampant abuse of human rights laws - is expected to recommend yet more rights. These could include a right to claim benefits, to have a pleasant environment to live in and to enjoy a comfortable standard of living. Insiders said the commission had split ‘down the middle’ between Tories and Liberal Democrats placed on the commission by Nick Clegg. Mr Grayling accuses the judges of moving ‘further and further away’ from the original European Convention on Human Rights - written in the aftermath of the Second World War to protect citizens against the horrors of Nazi Germany. And he says a Conservative view of human rights is that ‘with rights come responsibilities’ - and that rights should not be used as an excuse for operating outside societal norms. Mr Grayling said: ‘The human rights agenda that frustrates so many of us today has little to do with the freedoms that all of us still believe are worth fighting for. ‘Over more than half a century, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has moved further and further away from the intentions of those politicians who shaped the original Convention. ‘It has pried more and more into matters that should be routine issues for national courts and parliaments to deal with.' He added: ‘As Conservatives we remain absolutely committed to the importance of human rights around the world. But we do not believe that people should be able to claim the right to family life as an excuse for operating outside the norms that apply to most people in our society. We believe that with rights come responsibilities. ‘And we believe that the European Court of Human Rights has overstepped its mark, and that things have to change.' Mr Grayling’s comments will be welcomed by Tory backbenchers who have demanded ministers confront the European court over its rulings. Powers: The European Court of Human Rights in the French city of Strasbourg. Mr Grayling says it has moved too far from its purpose of protecting the vulnerable . They are particularly robust given his other position in Government as Lord Chancellor, who by tradition does not criticise members of the judiciary. Article 8 has been used by hundreds of foreign prisoners to stay in Britain despite committing horrific crimes using spurious claims about their right to a private and family life. It has also allowed paedophiles and rapists to demand removal from the Sex Offenders’ Register. The commission’s interim report in July recommended creating a right to claim benefits, and other so-called ‘socio-economic rights’. It also called for new children’s rights and a ‘right to equality’. At the time, critics said the commission had been hijacked by the human rights lobby and would lead to further rights inflation and an extension of the compensation culture. An eminent academic, Dr Michael Pinto Duschinsky, quit the commission warning that the ‘the Lib Dem tail is wagging the Conservative dog’ as he claimed Nick Clegg and Ken Clarke had instructed the commission to ignore the will of Parliament. Mr Grayling is engaged in a standoff with the court over its demands for an end to the ban on prisoners voting. Rights: The original European Convention on Human Rights was written after The Second World war to try and prevent horrors similar to Auschwitz (pictured) Strasbourg has threatened to hand inmates compensation of £1000 each if Britain does not pass a law giving them the vote - despite MPs voting overwhelming against a change. Earlier this month, 71 Tory MPs, including former Crime and Justice Minister Nick Herbert called on ministers to scrap the Human Rights Act in a Parliamentary vote. The vote, and the commission’s likely outcome, will heap pressure on David Cameron to take a tougher line on Strasbourg. Last night Dr Pinto Duschinsky said Britain should withdraw if it cannot negotiate a ‘democratic override’ to allow Parliament to reject Strasbourg rulings. Dr Michael Pinto Duschinsky, constitutional affairs expert at Policy Exchange said: ‘Even if the Commission does decide to publish a British Bill of Rights, it is likely that the Strasbourg court will have final say on matters of national significance such as prisoner voting. ‘The UK must alter its relationship with the international court. Firstly by trying to negotiate an ‘override’ so that national parliaments can overrule Strasbourg. ‘If this proves impossible then the UK should give serious consideration to withdrawing from the ECHR.’","Justice Secretary says European human rights judges are interfering with domestic issues .

Starbucks was accused of treating its tax obligations ‘like the church collection plate’ yesterday as the backlash against the coffee giant intensified. A Cabinet minister weighed into the row over the chain’s surprise deal with the taxman to pay a ‘voluntary’ £10million a year in tax. The agreement, revealed last week, followed weeks of damaging publicity about the American-owned company following revelations it had not paid any corporation tax in Britain for three years. Anger: Protesters gathered outside Starbucks on Euston Road in London yesterday to demonstrate against the coffee giant . Tough talk: Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said on The Andrew Marr show that the Government would clamp down on companies that dodge tax . But critics are furious Her Majesty’s . Revenue and Customs have allowed the coffee giant to cut a deal with the . taxman. MPs said the unusual arrangement risked turning Britain’s tax . system into a ‘farce’. Yesterday . Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, insisted paying tax . ‘is not a voluntary choice’ for corporations and insisted ‘it is not . something you can just chose to do willy-nilly because you think it will . please your customers, it is an obligation’. He . insisted the Government would get tough on firms such as Starbucks, . Amazon and Google who structure their financial affairs to dodge tax. ‘Thinking . of the tax system as if it is like the church plate going around on a . Sunday morning is completely the wrong way to think about it,’ he told . the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme. But Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, leapt to the coffee chain’s defence – condemning the ‘sneering’ and saying it had a duty to shareholders to minimise the level of tax it pays within the law. Huge pressure is mounting on HMRC to close the loopholes which allow multinational firms such as Starbucks to avoid paying what is seen to be their fair share of tax. George Osborne last week announced a . clampdown on tax avoidance by multinationals and the rich to plug a . £32billion a year tax shortfall between what HMRC is due and what it . receives. His move followed a devastating report by MPs which singled . out Starbucks, Amazon and Google for paying extremely low tax rates by . basing themselves abroad. Starbucks, based in Seattle, has more than 700 outlets in the UK, generating revenues of more than £3billion. Under fire: The international coffee chain paid just £8.6million in corporation tax in the UK over the past 14 years . But it paid just £8.6million in . corporation tax in its 14 years of trading in the UK and nothing in the . last three. Its £20million ‘donation’ has been widely branded a ‘PR . stunt’ – and did nothing to stop protests by anti-tax avoidance . demonstraters at more than 50 Starbucks coffee shops across the country . at the weekend. But Mr Johnson defended the chain, . saying it had a duty to pay the minimum tax it could, although he . accepted Starbucks was in a ‘hell of a mess’. He said: ‘Imagine you are the . corporate finance director of one of these companies. Your job is to . look at the law as it stands. Your fiduciary duty to your shareholders . is to minimise your tax exposure.’ Veteran Tory backbencher Bill Cash . said the voluntary contribution from Starbucks was ‘a farce’, adding it . could lead to a form of ‘democratic anarchy’ after the public ‘bullying’ of the chain.

A transatlantic banking watchdog would protect American and British taxpayers from bailing out banks which are too big to fail, under plans set out today. Instead shareholders and creditors on both sides of the Atlantic would be forced to take the losses in the event of another banking crash. It marks a significant shift from the situation in which UK taxpayers stumped up billions to rescue stricken lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. 'Shortcomings': Taxpayers stumped up billions to rescue stricken lenders including RBS in the wake of the financial crisis . The British government pumped an eye-watering £66billion into RBS and Lloyds at the height of the crisis and is years away from getting its money back. It was also forced to bail out basket case lenders Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester. 'The too big to fail problem simply must be cured' Paul Tucker, Bank of England deputy governor for financial stability . Officials in the United Kingdom and United States have now drawn up plans to ensure that failed banks can be dealt with in future without taxpayer funds. A single entity would exist in place of national bodies dealing with the subsidiaries of the financial firm in trouble in each separate country. Paul Tucker, deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England, said: 'The ""too big to fail"" problem simply must be cured. We believe it can be and that this joint paper provides evidence of the serious progress that is being made.' The report by the Bank of England in the UK and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the US says: ‘The financial crisis that began in late 2007 highlighted the shortcomings of the arrangements for handling the failure of large financial institutions that were in place on either side of the Atlantic. ‘Strategies have been designed to enable large and complex cross-border firms to be resolved without threatening financial stability and without putting public funds at risk.’ It will involve shareholders and creditors taking losses instead of taxpayers. Regulators: The Bank of England has said the joint paper is evidence of the work underway to solve the problem of banks being 'too big to fail' Major banks are deemed ‘too big to fail’ because allowing them to collapse would have a devastating impact on borrowers, savers and the wider economy. Today’s report suggests that banks causing distress would be restructured, shrunk, broken up or closed down. It also warns that ‘culpable senior management’ would be replaced and held ‘accountable for their actions’. And it is likely that shareholders would lose all value. ‘The goal is to produce resolution strategies that could be implemented for the failure of one or more of the largest financial institutions with extensive activities in our respective jurisdictions,’ the report says. ‘These resolution strategies should maintain systemically important operations and contain threats to financial stability. ‘They should also assign losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors in the group, thereby avoiding the need for a bailout by taxpayers.’ The report argues that an overhaul is needed because letting banks go bust ‘can create significant and systemic risk for the real economy’ including disruption to critical services and the freezing of financial markets. It says that the fear of such a devastating hit to the economy meant that the UK and US governments ‘resorted to providing large scale public support to failing financial companies during the 2007-09 crisis’. It adds: ‘This public support has exposed taxpayers to loss and resulted in the bailout of multiple financial institutions and their creditors.’","New proposals aim to ensure taxpayers do not have to pick up the bill if major banks fail in the future .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 07:12 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:53 EST, 12 December 2012 . Dr Ashley Sibery walks free from court . A doctor who watched his wife collapse after injecting her with heroin so she could 'experience what the drug was like' has been handed a community sentence. GP Ashley Sibery, 39, was convicted in September 2012 of giving his partner Sital the class A narcotic at their home in Edinburgh in April. He watched her lose consciousness and struggle for breath moments after she took the deadly powder. The terrifying incident took place after she confronted him about his secret drug habit. After tucking their three-year-old son into bed, the medic and father admitted to Sital that he had been using the lethal narcotic for two months. She told him that if he didn't quit his addiction, she would end their marriage. But despite the ultimatum, Sibery managed to persuade Sital into taking what was supposed to be his final fix. The court heard how Sibery wanted his partner to experience the feeling that he got when he consumed the brown powder. However, Sital collapsed and started having difficulties breathing. The shocked paramedics who attended their home in the Scottish capital recognised the former accident and emergency medic and managed to save her life. Sibery was then arrested and confessed his involvement in the potentially lethal incident to Lothian and Borders Police detectives. Yesterday, Sheriff Elizabeth Jarvie QC decided not to send Sibery to prison after hearing how he had successfully completed treatment for his addiction. Instead, the GP was ordered to perform 300 hours community service and placed on supervision by the authorities for two years after an Edinburgh Sheriff Court hearing on Tuesday. Edinburgh Sheriff's Court heard how the doctor's wife threatened to end the marriage when she discovered Sibery's habit . Sheriff Jarvie also heard that his wife and his colleagues were sticking by Sibery, who is currently suspended from practising medicine by the General Medical Council. Sheriff Jarvie added: 'I am persuaded that in these particular circumstances, the imposition of a non-custodial sentence is correct and in the public interest. 'I will impose a community payback order on you which will last for two years. You will also be placed on supervision and you will perform 300 hours community service. 'I hope that this sentence will allow you to utilise your talents within the community.' Sibery pleaded guilty to a charge of culpable and reckless conduct before Sheriff Elizabeth Jarvie QC in a hearing earlier this year. The court heard that prior to the incident, Sibery worked in the city as a general practitioner. He qualified as a medic in 2002 and had once worked in Accident and Emergency medicine. Ms Rollo told Sheriff Jarvie that the pair had an argument about how Sibery had been behaving in the months leading up to April. Mrs Sibery was concerned about how her partner had been acting. The court heard that during an emotional exchange he confessed that he been spending £55 a day on his heroin habit for the last two months. 'I hope this sentence will allow you to utilise your talents within the community' Sheriff Jarvie . Procurator fiscal Karon Rollo said: 'He had admitted to her that he had spent the last two months injecting heroin into himself. 'She issued him with an ultimatum. She told him he had to stop taking the drugs or their marriage would be over. 'Bizarrely, he asked her if she wanted to try some. He told her that he had a small quantity of heroin remaining in the house and that he would give her it. 'He wanted her to experience the drug, to see what it was like. The heroin was then prepared and it was injected into her.' An ambulance was called when Sital collapsed and started having breathing difficulties. Ms Rollo then told the court that police arrested Sibery and interviewed him at a police station in the Scottish capital. The doctor confessed to them that he had given his wife heroin and that he had an addiction problem. Ms Rollo added: 'The accused indicated that he had a heroin habit. He confessed to them that he had given his wife heroin. 'He told them that he wanted to relax her and deal with stress. He told the officers how she slipped into unconsciousness.' The court also heard that Sibery - who was on bail for the offence - was now in the care of a consultant psychiatrist who was helping him to tackle his problems. The court also heard that he and his wife were still together. Colleagues also provided the court with written statements about the good work that Mr Sibery has carried out as a doctor. On Tuesday, defence solicitor Duncan Batchelor told the court that his client had recently completed a drug treatment programme. Mr Batchelor revealed that Mr Sibery had recently been tested for drugs and the results showed that he hadn't taken any. The court also heard that Mr Sibery had also started to help other addicts who were trying to tackle their problems. After reading a report about Sibery's character, Sheriff Jarvie decided not to impose a custodial sentence on the doctor. But she ordered Sibery to appear back in court on November 12 2013 in order for another sheriff to monitor his progress. She added: 'You will reappear in this court next year.'","GP, who spent £55 a day on his habit, wanted his wife to 'experience' how the drug felt .

"By . Anna Edwards . PUBLISHED: . 12:08 EST, 12 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:18 EST, 13 December 2012 . Edward Devenney was jailed for eight years today . A treacherous Royal Navy petty officer . who tried to pass secrets about Britain’s nuclear submarines to Russian . spies has been jailed for eight years. The Old Bailey heard that Edward . Devenney, 30, who was bitter at missing out on a promotion, had phoned . the Russian embassy in a bid to betray his country. He offered information about sailing . dates and movements of Trident submarines that would have revealed the . unique sound ‘signature’ given off by the British nuclear craft, meaning . they could have been tracked around the globe. The court heard that Devenney, who had been a communications engineer on nuclear sub HMS Vigilant, rang the Russian Embassy in November last year after what he said was a 12-hour drinking binge. Devenney, from Northern Ireland, said . he had been disillusioned with the Royal Navy because his promotion hopes . had been dashed through defence cuts. But he was drinking heavily, had bouts of depression and had just been cleared of a rape charge. He asked for his training course for . promotion to be deferred for a year but his absences without leave and . conduct had led to a warning that he would be sacked if his behaviour continued, . the court heard. Two days after the phone call, he managed to get into . a locked safe on board HMS Vigilant and take three photographs of part . of a secret code for encrypted information on his mobile phone. Covert operations: HMS Vigilant could have been compromised, had Devenney actually sold secrets . It was only through the vigilance of MI5 . officers who mounted a sting operation where they pretended to be . Russian spies that national security was not harmed, said Mark Dennis . QC, prosecuting. In an exchange of text messages, . Devenney had told one of the fake spies: 'I am disillusioned by my . employers and I feel let down by them. Think we can help each other,' the court heard. He also texted: 'I am in the royal Navy and I am a bit p***** off with them at the moment.' Devenney pleaded guilty to breaching . the Official Secrets Act by gathering classified information and . misconduct by meeting the supposed spies. The officer worked in the 'highly sensitive' communication centre of nuclear submarines, and had served on three of the four Trident vessels in the fleet. After his arrest, he had been questioned about his motives. The officer called the Russian Embassy saying he wanted to 'hurt' the Royal Navy after his hopes of a promotion were dashed . Mr Dennis said: 'He explained that he was disenchanted with his work and he wanted to hurt the Royal Navy.' It had been explained to Devenney that the two men, known to him as Demitri and Vladimir, who he met at the British Museum and who took him to a Bloomsbury hotel, were not Russians. Mr Dennis added: 'The highly secret information was therefore contained. 'Although the actual damage caused proved to be minimal, that was not due to the defendant but to the skilful work of the secret service.' Mr Justice Saunders, sentencing him at the Old Bailey, said Devenney knew what he was doing when he met the two men in January. Mr Justice Saunders added: 'He did supply details of movements and operations carried out and to be carried out by nuclear submarines. 'I am satisfied that in the wrong hands it was capable of affecting the operational effectiveness of nuclear submarines. 'This is a very serious case. The defendant was prepared to betray his country and his colleagues.' The petty officer thought he was talking to two spies when he met the men in the British museum . Outside court, solicitor Richard Cannon read a statement on behalf of Devenney which said: “I am deeply sorry for the hurt and shame that I have brought on my family and loved ones. 'Prior to these events I gave the Royal Navy 11 and a half years of service and I deeply regret my actions and the effect they have had on the Submarine Service and colleagues.' Mari Reid, unit head for the CPS counter-terrorism division, said: 'This was a classic story of betrayal. 'Edward Devenney was employed by the Royal Navy to protect this country from potential threats to our security. Instead, he pursued a course of conduct likely to put his country at risk. 'We rely on the men and women of our armed forces to keep us safe. It is hard to imagine a greater breach of that role than Devenney’s actions.' The judge said: 'The photographs could, with other information, have led to the breaking of the code.' He added: 'The defendant made determined efforts to enter into an agreement to supply secret information to representatives of another country. 'The reason he later gave for his actions was that he wished to get his own back on the Royal Navy who he considered had treated him badly.' But the judge added: 'The objective evidence is that the Royal Navy treated him well.' Lord Carlile, for Devenney, read out a statement from him which said: 'I would like to apologise for the shame I brought on the Royal Navy.' He said Devenney had been 'something of a blue-eyed boy' until things began to go awry. The rape allegation led to a general collapse in Devenney’s behaviour.","Edward Devenney, 30, foiled after trying to sell submarine photographs .

In recognition of his dedication to Christmas, Mr Horniblew has been awarded a 40-Year-Service award and is one of the only Britons entitled to wear the official Santa badge, after being authorised by Santa Claus of Greenland. He said: 'I started dressing up as Santa when my son Graham was young, friends of mine then asked if I could come round and visit their children and it just snowballed from there. 'I just loved seeing the surprise and happiness I could bring to people. 'On Christmas morning I visit lots of different families I leave around 7.30 in the morning and I'm home in time for my Christmas dinner at 2.30 in the afternoon. St Nicholas of England: Santa Ron, far left, won the title of World's Best Santa in 2004 . 'During my Christmas visits, I arrive ringing my bell, the parents usually leave the presents in the porch or on the doorstep for me and I put them in my sack and deliver them to the children. 'To see the look on their faces when I arrive is wonderful, I spend time chatting to the children and pose for photos with the family. 'It just makes Christmas morning that little bit more magical, when I leave the house and everyone is smiling it makes it all worthwhile. 'I really enjoyed competing in the competitions, I have both a bronze and a gold medal. And being named World's Best Santa was a proud moment. 'The highlight of my career has to be seeing the smiles on the faces of the children I visited at an orphanage in the Bahamas. 'They were the most fantastic children I've ever came across, they were so loving and appreciative.' Wishing you a Merry Christmas: Ron shows off his diploma from Greenland, left, and tends to Rudolph, right . Despite admitting he is now a little old to compete in the competitions, Santa Ron still refuses to be photographed without his suit on and continues to visit children on Christmas day and help raise money for his local church. He has now opened his own Santa school in the hope of continuing his legacy by teaching others how to become the perfect Santa. He said: 'I take my job as Santa very seriously, it isn't just about dressing up in a red suit and saying Ho Ho Ho! 'Being Santa is about about listening to the children and making them feel special. Season's greetings: The 77-year-old has visited children at an orphanage in the Bahamas, attended Santa conferences and taken part in competitions in Sweden, Norway and Denmark . Time for a mince pie! Santa Ron delivers gifts to his delighted neighbours Margaret and Peter . 'You have to be as excited and enthusiastic with the last child you see on a day as you were with the first. It's important you don't wain. 'It's jolly hard work you have to make sure each child leaves thinking Father Christmas is wonderful. 'A good Santa mustn't use bad language and should never smoke or drink in their suit, there's nothing worse than a smelly Santa. 'They should always look their best and be a jolly good listener. 'I'm hoping to launch officially next year, I have a lot of experience to pass on and it would be nice to train others to continue my legacy.'","Ron Horniblew has been delivering presents since 1964 .

A model who was a guest at former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's infamous bunga bunga parties today told a court she knew of incriminating sexual photographs showing him with a teenage belly dancer. Imane Fadil, 26, described how she had heard that the pictures showed twice-married Berlusconi, 74, with his head resting on the stomach of then 17-year-old belly dancer Karima El Mahroug. He is accused of paying the teenager for sex, as well as dozens of other women, who were guests at the debauched parties he hosted where guests dressed as nuns and police officers before performing pole dances. Claims: Model Imane Fadil, pictured, who was a guest at former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's infamous bunga bunga parties today told a court she knew of incriminating sexual photographs showing him with a teenage belly dancer . Miss Fadil confirmed to the court in Milan rumours that have been circulating in Italy for months that incriminating pictures of a sexual nature showing Berlusconi and Miss El Mahroug exist.She said that 'a friend of a friend' named Gigi told her at a party last month that his girlfriend Michelle Conceicao had pictures of Ruby and the billionaire media tycoon who resigned from office last November. Miss Fadil added:' 'He said that he had seen them. 'He told me they were of a sexual nature and several of them showed Berlusconi with his head on Ruby's stomach.' On trial: Silvio Berlusconi (above) is accused of paying 17-year-old belly dancer Karima El Mahroug for sex . Other rumours circulating in Italy are that pictures also exist of Berlusconi kissing female guests at the party full on the month. Brazilian model Miss Conceicao, said in an interview last month with an Italian magazine that Berlusconi had paid Miss El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heart Stealer, 5,000 euros to sleep with her 'because she was so young'. Berlusconi’s lawyers, Piero Longo and Niccolo Ghedini, have previously ridiculed Miss Conceicao's account, saying it was 'completely baseless' and contradicted by Miss El Mahroug's statements and by what Conceicao has already told authorities in Milan. Miss Fadil also said that she had seen photographs of Miss El Mahroug sprawled 'naked as mother nature had intended' on Berlusconi's desk in the office of his home at Arcore near Milan, which was the venue for the parties and that he had asked her as recently as last month not to tell the truth when she testifies. Miss Fadil told the court how another Brazilian model Iris Berardi stripped down to a thong and fondled herself while wearing an AC Milan jersey and a Ronaldinho mask. This hearing in Milan involves regional councillor Nicole Minetti, TV news anchor Emilio Fede and showbusiness agent Lele Mora, who are accused of procuring the girls for Berlusconi's parties. Berlusconi himself is accused of paying to sleep with Miss El Mahroug - in Italy the age of consent is 14 but paying a woman below that age is seen as under age prostitution and it carries a maximum three-year jail term. Bellydancer: Moroccan Karima El Mahroug trial (pictured) is also known as Ruby the Heart Stealer . Prosecutors say Berlusconi had sex with 33 prostitutes at his villa over the course of several evenings but he has stressed that the parties were merely 'convivial evenings' and that nothing untoward happened - a sentiment echoed by Miss El Mahroug. Berlusconi is said to have touched and fondled the women as well as having a statue on display which they were encouraged to perform a sex act on. When details of the allegations emerged he joked 'three women in two months is too many evenfor someone who likes pretty girls, like me,' adding that once again he was the victim of left-wing biased prosecutors out to get him. In the same trial, Berlusconi is also accused of abuse of office, with prosecutors claiming he had Miss El Mahroug freed from police custody when she was arrested for theft in May 2010 by wrongly telling officers she was related to the then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak. The Ruby trial, which opened 14 months ago and resumes on Monday, is expected to run for years, with dozens of witnesses called by the prosecution and defence including George Clooney and soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo.

Two of John Galliano's menswear ensembles from the 1985 Fallen Angel collection will be on display, along with a pink, muslin dress from 1986. This section will also explore the emergence of knitwear as fun and fashionable, with examples from Kay Cosserat, Artwork and Patricia Roberts, while evening wear by Bruce Oldfield and Anthony Price will reflect the more glamorous aspect of 1980s fashion. London's clubs in the 1980s acted as a site for the convergence of music and fashion and provided a safe environment in which young people could experiment and mix with those of similar tastes. A range of looks will be displayed, ranging from the exaggerated, exotic styles favoured by the Blitz crowd, through the distressed styles of Hard Times, to the eclectic mixing and individual expression of Taboo, to the dance influenced looks of acid house.

Rave and euphoric house nights, where the combination of dance music and drugs created an atmosphere in which inhibitions were totally gone, changed dress once again. Following the summer of 1987, a number of DJs began to recreate the sound and atmosphere of the Ecstasy-fuelled Ibiza dance clubs. The loose shapes of the early 1980s disappeared and a new kind of tight fitting club wear evolved that featured day-glo colours and metallic tones. This movement is represented by the designs of Rifat Ozbeck and Westwood's silver leather 'armoured' jackets. Beatrice Dalle, Kylie Minogue and Vivienne Westwood in the 1980s . Write caption here . The atmosphere of friendly and fun clubs like Shoom began to be reflected in much more casual styles. The dressed-up aesthetic of earlier clubs, like Taboo, was replaced by 'ponchos, dungarees, and loose T-shirts bearing the yellow Smiley motif' as reported The Face in June 1988. A small club-like area will be created within the space to show film footage of clubs from the 1980s and stream music chosen by DJ Princess Julia. There will also be unique garments made for club stars such as Leigh Bowery, Scarlett and Juliana Sissons. Magazines and accessories The exhibition will feature magazines of the time - The Face, i-D and Blitz - that captured and propagated the club and street look to a wider audience. The Face heralded the arrival of the 'style' magazine and combined a sense of immediacy with the high-end production values of Vogue and Tatler. i-D, essentially a fashion fanzine, was launched in August 1980 and, alongside The Face, was considered the definitive 'style bible' of the 1980s. Accessories were an essential part of any clubber or fashion follower's wardrobe and the 1980s launched the careers of some hugely influential accessories designers. The work of Judy Blame, Bernstock Speirs, Patrick Cox, Johnny Moke and collaborations with Sock Shop will be on display alongside the Filofax and Mulberry bags.

"By . Rob Davies . PUBLISHED: . 03:23 EST, 19 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:30 EST, 19 December 2012 . Arrogant and reckless, bankers at UBS nicknamed one another the ‘three muscateers’, ‘superman’ and ‘Captain Caos’ as they rigged a crucial City interest rate. And yesterday their corruption cost their City of London employer a fine of nearly £1billion. Watchdogs said rigging the Libor interest rate – used to calculate the mortgages of millions – was ‘routine, widespread and condoned by a number of managers’ at UBS. UBS has been fined nearly £1bn for the Libor-rigging scandal which included a record £160m fine from the FSA . The regulators also said the behaviour . of some staff was ‘even more serious’ than what happened at Barclays – . fined £290million earlier this year for rigging Libor. A string of compromising emails reveal . the UBS bankers’ congratulatory nicknames, though it appeared that, . despite their huge salaries, they were as reckless with their spelling . as they were with the bank’s cash. An Italian judge has found four international banks guilty of fraud in a case involving the sale of derivatives to the city of Milan and ordered the confiscation of €88 million. Judge Oscar Magi on Wednesday convicted Deutsche Bank, UBS, JP Morgan and Depfa Bank, as well as nine current and former bankers. In Italy, institutions may be held responsible as well individuals. The individuals received suspended sentences of six months to eight months. The banks have denied wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege that the city of Milan lost €105million as part of the sale of bonds totaling €1.69billion between 2005 and 2007. Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo said the verdict recognized the importance of 'the fundamental principal of transparency on the part of banks in contracts with public administrations.' A 40-page report from the Financial . Services Authority condemns staff at UBS for Libor rigging between . January 2005 and December 2010. The regulator fined UBS £160million, with the remainder of the total fine split between Swiss and US regulators. The FSA said that staff fixed Libor . rates to benefit their own trading activities. They also rigged Libor . during the financial crisis to make the bank appear stronger than it . was. They set up fictitious and ‘corrupt’ transactions to pay each other for Libor-rigging and, said the FSA, . awareness of such wrongdoing went as high as managerial level. The City watchdog said their . activities ‘undermined the integrity’ of the benchmark rate, which is . used to calculate financial transactions worth more than £300trillion, . including mortgage rates. Extracts from messages exchanged between UBS staff reveal their astonishing arrogance. In one, ‘Trader A’ asks a broker at . another firm to help him set a high rate, addressing his friend as . ‘superman’ and urging him to ‘be a hero today’. A broker at another bank accepted the . challenge of rigging Libor with glee, telling Trader A he was ‘putting . the captain caos outfit on as we speak’. Trader A was named as one of . ‘three muscateers’. Such was the regularity of . manipulation that one banker, in response to a single request to fix . Libor, replied ‘Standing order, sir?’ The FSA said misconduct at UBS was 'extensive and widespread' with traders routinely trying to benefit their trading positions . Sergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS, said the group had 'taken decisive and appropriate actions' following the probe . The FSA said the UBS case was . ‘considerably more serious than Barclays’ because the wrongdoing was . more widespread and senior managers were aware of it. It raised . particular concern over one exchange, in which a UBS trader offered to . pay a broker friend if he will leave the rate unchanged. The trader wrote: ‘I’ll pay you, you know, 50,000 dollars, 100,000 dollars ...whatever you want. I’m a man of my word.’ Such rewards were arranged through . so-called ‘wash trades’, risk-free trades that cancelled each other out . but generated ‘illicit fees’ of more than £170,000 for brokers. The traders quoted in the FSA’s report . have not been named, but two UBS staff – 33-year-old Briton Tom Hayes . and Roger Darin, 41, based in Switzerland – were yesterday charged in . the US with conspiracy to fix Libor. They face the prospect of . extradition. The FSA said the behaviour at UBS showed a ‘total disregard for proper standards’. Some 40 staff were involved in making . more than 1,000 ‘improper requests’, while a further 70 would have been . aware of the wrongdoing. UBS chief Sergio Ermotti said: ‘We deeply regret this inappropriate and unethical behaviour.’ The revelations are another blow to . the Swiss bank’s deals reputation, after trader Kweku Adoboli was found . guilty of fraud earlier this year after his bad deals lost £1.4billion. The Financial Services Bill, which . received Royal Assent yesterday creates a criminal offence for making . ‘misleading statements’ in relation to benchmark rates such as Libor. Andrew Tyrie MP, who is leading the .

Mary Snelling has celebrated her 107th birthday and swears the secret to long life is simple - just start the day by eating an apple. The extraordinary woman was born on December 17, 1905 - nine years before the Great War broke out in August 1914. And pictures taken on her big day this week show she is looking younger than ever. Fighting fit: Mary Snelling has celebrated her 107th birthday with friends and with a card from the Queen - and says the secret to long life is an apple a day . And long-life clearly runs in the family as Keeny lived to the ripe old age of 102. Mrs Snelling said the key to a long, healthy life was to have a good diet, lots of exercise and avoid smoking. 'I don't eat fat from meat, I always make sure I cut it off and I like to start my day with an apple. 'I don't drink much - just occasionally with friends and I have never smoked,' she said. 'I always said I work too hard for my money to see it go up in smoke. 'We used to walk a lot with our mother so that probably helped.' In the family: Mary, left, is seen here when she passed 100 with her older sister Keeny, who was 101 at the time . Delighted Mary celebrated her 107th birthday on Monday with a card . from the Queen, a giant cake and a visit from her dearest friends. It came as official figures showed yesterday that the number of people surviving till the age of 105 or more has almost doubled in less than a decade. Mary was one of 640 Britons who have reached that grand old age or greater, compared with 350 in 2002, the Office for National Statistics, reveals. The number of 'super centenarians' – which experts classify as aged 110 or over – were  unavailable but are also said to be rising fast. Speaking about her childhood Mary recalled: 'I was piggy in the middle'. 'We were very close. Neither of my sisters married or had any children.' Historic: The front page of the Eastern Evening News on Monday 18th December 1905 - the day after Mary Snelling was born in Norfolk . They all went to a private school but had to move when the First World War erupted. The 107-year-old worked as a secretary before becoming a clerk at Norwich magistrates' court and working as a Sunday School teacher at St Alban's church. Mary met her husband, Thomas, at a dance hosted by the Junior Imperial and Constitutional League, now the Young Conservatives. The couple got married in All Saints Church, Norwich, on August 3, 1939. 'The war started exactly a month later and Thomas joined the Army and he worked his way up to a Major in the Ordnance Corps,' she said. 'He went to Burma where he caught malaria.' 1905: Mary Snelling is born1908: Ford Introduces the Model-T1914 - 1918: Great War begins1929: Wall Street crash1936: Edward VIII abdicates1939 - 1945: Second World War1956: Suez crisis1961: Berlin Wall built . 1963 JFK assassination . 1968: Martin Luther King assassinated1969: Man lands on the moon1979: Thatcher become PM1982: Falklands War1989: Berlin Wall falls1990: Mandela freed1997: Diana dies in car crash2001: 9/11 xxx                                             2012: Mary hits 107 . They then moved to Newbury, Berkshire, but her husband was rushed into hospital in 1949 with a stomach ulcer and died the following year. 'I think it was everything that he picked up in Burma that killed him,' she said. 'I loved being married. 'When he died his mother didn't want a post mortem so we never found out exactly what killed him.' The couple did not have any children. Mary moved back to Norfolk and became a secretary at Norfolk County Council before returning to her old job at the court. Her sister Edna died of pancreatic cancer in 1981 and Mary lived with her beloved big sister Keeny in a bungalow in Brundall until she died in 2006 aged 102. Mary moved into a home in Letheringsett for a year before she went back to live in Brundall with the help of carers. The incredible centenarian has lived in Manor House Residential Home since April.","Mary Snelling was born on December 17 1905 and married exactly a month before the Second World War started .

Packs of ten cigarettes could be banned under a European proposal to crack down on smoking. The EU’s Health and Consumer Commissioner also unveiled plans to ban menthol cigarettes and to force companies to cover three quarters of their packets with a picture warning. The idea is to make smoking less attractive to children, who are more likely to buy smaller packets of cigarettes with their pocket money. Youngsters are also more likely to buy flavoured cigarettes such as menthol and strawberry. Smoking: The EU will not force all cigarettes to be sold in plain packets with graphic health warnings, as is now required in Australia, but individual governments will be free to insist on such packaging if they wish . Last night the Department of Health in . London said ministers were considering the proposals, which will have . to be agreed by all Europe’s health ministers before they can go ahead. The EU wants the new rules to come into force across the continent by 2016. Under the proposals, packs of less than 20 cigarettes would be banned, as would ‘slim’ cigarettes. E-cigarettes, which are used by many . people wanting to quit the habit, would also have to carry health . warnings for the first time, because they contain nicotine. The moves were announced by Maltese EU commissioner Toni Borg to reinforce an existing tobacco products directive. Negotiations over the controversial . plans have taken place with the tobacco industry and health campaigners . for years, and they target the use in cigarettes, roll-ups and . ‘smokeless tobacco products’ flavoured with menthol, vanilla and . strawberry. Such ‘characterising flavours’ will be banned under the new legislation, if approved by Euro MPs and EU health ministers. Current pictorial health warnings will . more than double in size and the rules will extend to products not . specifically covered so far, such as ‘electronic’ cigarettes and herbal . smoking products. Chewing and nasal tobacco will have to have specific labelling and controls on ingredients. Dr Borg said: ‘The European Commission . had promised a proposal on tobacco products by the end of 2012, and . that’s what I’m presenting today. Plans: The draft European Commission legislation said the proposal 'foresees that combined warnings (picture plus text) of 75 per cent should be displayed on both sides of the packages of tobacco products' ‘The figures speak for themselves: . tobacco kills half of its users and is highly addictive. With 70 per . cent of the smokers starting before the age of 18, the ambition of . today’s proposal is to make tobacco products and smoking less attractive . and thus discourage tobacco initiation among young people.’ He added: ‘Consumers must not be . cheated: tobacco products should look and taste like tobacco products . and this proposal ensures that attractive packaging and flavourings are . not used as a marketing strategy.’ Current rules are now more than a . decade old and outdated, the Commission said. Significant changes have . taken place, such as new scientific evidence on the impact of . flavourings used in tobacco, and clearer statistics about the . effectiveness of health warnings. Novel products such as electronic . cigarettes have joined the sector, and Brussels is concerned about the . continued use of what it calls ‘attractive’ packaging and flavours. The new proposed labelling rules would . require a combined picture and text health warning covering 75 per cent . of the front and the back of cigarette packs. Current information on tar, nicotine . and carbon monoxide - now considered misleading - would be replaced by a . warning on the side of each pack noting that tobacco smoke contains . more than 70 cancer-causing substances. Choice: Seventy per cent of smokers start to smoke before 18. EU health and consumer commissioner said 'the ambition is to discourage tobacco among young people.' Newly-developed electronic cigarettes, . used by many smokers as a healthier alternative, would have to carry . health warnings, as they contain nicotine. If the nicotine content is above a . certain threshold they would not be allowed unless authorised by a . doctor as medicine, like nicotine replacement therapies. Even herbal . cigarettes would have to carry health warnings. The plans will now be considered by . the European Parliament and EU health ministers, with a target of . adopting the new laws during 2014 and bringing them into force in . 2016. The rules stop short of imposing plain . packaging as has recently been introduced in Australia. But individual E . governments would be free to impose them if they wished. A spokesman for Hamburg-based . Reemstma, Europe’s biggest cigarette producer and a subsidiary of . Imperial Tobacco, said the draft proposals were in breach of German and . European law. ‘This is plain packaging by the back . door, and by that token it is a deep intrusion into the intellectual . property rights and trademark rights of the manufacturer,’ she said. ‘It . destroys brand values that companies have built up over time.’ Last night, the Department of Health in London said ministers are considering the plan.","Proposals will have to be agreed by all Europe's health ministers .

Lawyers for Cameron Douglas (pictured) will try to convince an appeals court not to double his five-year sentence . His conviction for drug dealing two years ago sealed his status as the black sheep of the Douglas acting dynasty. And, sadly, it seems jail has done little to improve matters for Cameron Douglas, son of Michael and grandson of Kirk. Yesterday a New York court heard how he had persuaded his besotted defence lawyer to smuggle drugs to him, hidden  in her bra. The 34-year-old admitted he had shared the drugs with other inmates, and had also smoked cigarettes, gambled, snorted substances and committed other infractions while in prison. Following these offences, a judge doubled his original five-year sentence to ten. The appalling history and extent of Douglas’s drug problems were revealed as his legal team returned to court to appeal against that decision. It came just a few days after Douglas reportedly suffered a broken leg and finger in a prison attack. Papers submitted to the appeals court revealed that Douglas had persuaded his defence lawyer to sneak drugs into prison in her bra on at least three or four occasions. Jennifer Ridha, 33, put contraband Xanax anti-anxiety pills inside a balloon, which she slipped inside her underwear. Douglas’s current lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said she ‘apparently became enamoured of Cameron during  frequent visits’. Judge Richard Berman, who extended Douglas’s original sentence, said he had never ‘encountered a defendant who has so recklessly and wantonly and flagrantly and criminally acted in as destructive and (as) manipulative a fashion as Cameron Douglas has’. But Mr Shechtman called the additional five years ‘shockingly long’ and said it ‘may be the harshest sentence ever imposed on a federal prisoner for a drug possession offence’. He also blamed his client’s long history of substance abuse on a lack of parental support when he was growing up. ‘While still a young teenager, he drank heavily and began selling drugs,’ Mr Shechtman said. ‘He used illegal drugs to self-medicate – to ward off depression and panic attacks.’ Before his conviction Cameron, the only child of Michael Douglas’s first marriage to Diandra Luker, had been arrested several times over drugs but never prosecuted. Michael Douglas, pictured in 2002 with son Cameron, has previously said that he thought prison might be a good thing for his troubled son . Michael Douglas, pictured in 2009, with son Cameron who has suffered a broken leg and fingers after being attacked in prison . But in July 2009 he was held in a . Manhattan hotel and accused of distributing and conspiring to distribute . more than 4.5 kilograms of methamphetamine and 20 kilograms of cocaine . over the previous three years. At the time, he was so visibly high on heroin that he had to be taken to hospital before he could go to court. It later emerged he had been injecting himself with heroin five or six . times a day for the past five years, according to the new court papers. He was released from custody on the condition that he remain under house . arrest with a private security guard. But within days, he persuaded his . girlfriend, Kelly Sott, to smuggle him heroin hidden inside an electric . toothbrush. His bail was revoked and he was sent to prison. He admitted narcotics distribution charges and was jailed for five . years, avoiding a mandatory ten-year sentence by cooperating with . investigators. Two drug suppliers were arrested and convicted as a result of his information and Douglas testified at the trial of one. This reportedly led to the attack this week, which is said to have . happened during a prison game of American football. Cameron Douglas is serving time at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Pennsylvania (left). (Right) pictured partying in 2004 . Mobsters allegedly . put a $100 (£60) bounty on Douglas for being a ‘rat’. At the original sentencing, Judge Berman noted that Douglas’s family had . tried to help him, but he had refused, and that two decades of drug . addiction treatment had been unsuccessful. Incarceration, the judge noted, had produced the longest period of sobriety Douglas had ever known since he was 13. But in fact he was still getting hold of drugs while behind bars, prosecutors said. In the court papers, it emerged that Douglas – who had roles in four . minor films – began using intravenous cocaine at the age of 20. He swiftly moved on to heroin and, by the time he was 25, ‘his life revolved around [the drug]’, Mr Shechtman said. His friends were fellow users  who gravitated to him because of his . access to family money, which supported their habits, the lawyer said. He added that Douglas’s ‘exasperated’ father cut off his son’s allowance . when he refused to go into rehab, forcing Cameron to turn to drug . dealing to pay for his habit. Mr Shechtman argued that the judge had gone too far with Douglas, punishing an addict for something beyond his control. ‘While we recognise that many of the words that the district court used . to describe Cameron’s conduct – “reckless”, “manipulative”, . “destructive” – were apt, the simple truth is that Cameron Douglas is a . heroin addict who has yet to shake his habit,’ he said. His 68-year-old father has previously said he had a strained . relationship for many years with his own father, Kirk, and acknowledged . that he may have repeated that pattern with Cameron. ‘Kirk was all-consumed, was overworked. Probably like myself at a certain time in my life,’ he said. Michael Douglas and his ex-wife, Diandra Douglas, leave the US District Court after their son Cameron was sentenced to five years in prison in 2010 .","Judge doubles his five-year sentence because of prison drug crimes .

Barack Obama has warned Britain against leaving the European Union, it emerged today. The US President used a call to David Cameron to urge him to resist calls to abandon Brussels, ahead of the PM delivering a major speech on Europe in the New Year. But President Obama is understood to be backing Mr Cameron's approach in his fight for a 'better deal for Britain'. David Cameron and Barack Obama discussed growing levels of Euroscepticism in Britain during an hour-long conference call last night (file pictures) The White House is thought to be . concerned that Britain would lose clout on the world stage if it was no . longer part of the euro bloc. It could also harm the special relationship if London was no longer seen as an ally able to wield influence across Europe. Mr Cameron is under pressure from Tory backbenchers, and a surge in the polls for the UK Independence Party, to take a tougher line with Brussels. He is expected to use January’s landmark speech to set out areas of policy controlled by the EU that he believes could be repatriated to Britain, before offering a referendum on a ‘fresh settlement’. On Monday Mr Cameron told MPs the idea of Britain leaving the EU was ‘imaginable’ but not what he wanted. Washington is thought to be increasingly concerned about what is seen as Britain inching towards full-scale withdrawal from the EU. A Downing Street source said Britain’s membership of the EU ‘came up’ in an hour-long video-conference call between President Obama and Mr Cameron last night. ‘The President was supportive of the PM’s position,’ the source added. President Obama backed the stance taken by Mr Cameron at a European Council meeting in Brussels last week . Last week Mr Cameron told reporters at a European Council meeting in Brussels that the eurozone moving towards greater integration presented an opportunity for Britain. 'As this plays out, this is changing the European Union,' he said. 'As it changes the European Union and the eurozone make changes that they need, so I believe there are opportunities for others, including Britain, to make changes ourselves.' The call also touched on the Sandy Hook school shooting, the news of the Royal baby and discussions on Afghanistan, Syria, Iran and the Middle East Peace Process. Officials in the US have stressed that the UK continuing to have a strong role Europe is ‘in America's national interest’. The Obama administration views the EU as a ‘force multiplier’. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has also revealed the anxiety in the US and around the world at the prospect of Britain quitting the EU. 'One of the things that has alarmed me recently in different parts of the world – America, China, India - there is a very large question that people are asking which is: ""are you guys seriously going to get out of Europe?”,’ he told journalists in Westminster yesterday. He said Britain has a 'profound national interest' in staying in the EU and warned that a referendum could not be used by politicians to dodge tough decisions. 'The first thing is we need to work out what it is we want Europe to be then we get to the referendum questions later,' he said. 'A referendum is not the way of alleviating the political responsibility of leaders to take a clear position and fight for it. 'If we start giving the suggesting that the referendum is an issue you are kind of probing for political reasons that's very difficult.'","US President and UK Premier use hour-long call to discuss rising tide of Euroscepticism in Britain .

President Barack Obama has been named TIME's Person of the Year for 2012, allowing him the honour for the second time in four years. The magazine cited the president's historic re-election last month as symbolic of the nation's changing demographics amid the backdrop of high unemployment and other challenges. 'He's basically the beneficiary and the author of a kind of new America - a new demographic, a new cultural America that he is now the symbol of,' TIME editor Rick Stengel said as he announced the choice on the Today show on Wednesday. 'He won re-election despite a higher . unemployment rate than anybody's had to face in basically 70 years. He's the first Democrat to actually win two consecutive terms with over . 50 per cent of the vote. That's something we haven't seen since Franklin . Delano Roosevelt.' The 'Person of the Year' accolade is given to the . person or thing that has most influenced the culture and news throughout the year for good or for ill. Obama . was named as Person of the Year in 2008, with Federal Reserve Chairman . Ben Bernanke, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and 'The . Protester' filling the years in between.

Min Yongjun, 36, has been arrested on suspicion of jeopardising public security for stabbing a total of 23 children last Friday . A statement from the Guangshan county government indicated that Min might have been strongly affected by 'Doomsday rumours', that predict an apocalypse this Friday. Scroll down for video . A man waving a machete in his hand chases the tiny girl as he enters an elementary school in Guangshan county, Henan province . The man can be seen taking a swing at the girl who crashes to the ground outside her school as a frightened child cowers behind the school gates . Armed men and women chase the knifeman out through the gates. Police later arrested 36-year-old Chinese man, Min Yongjun, in relation to the attacks . Ancient Mayans claimed that on December 21 2012, a . 5,125-year cycle known as the Long Count supposedly comes to a close. Experts estimate the system, which is made up of 394-year periods called baktuns, starts counting at 3114 BC, and will have run through 13 baktuns, or 5,125 years, around December 21. They . say 13 was a significant number for the Maya, and the end of that cycle . would be a milestone — but they have been keen to stress that it does . not mark an end. Conspiracy . theorists nonetheless believe the Maya may have been privy to impending . astronomical disasters that would coincide with 2012, ranging from . explosive storms on the surface of the sun that could knock out power . grids to a galactic alignment that could trigger a reversal in Earth's . magnetic field. Min Yongjun, who is reported to suffer from epilepsy, first burst into the home of an elderly woman an slashed her with the machete before rushing to the school where he continued the frenzied attack. 'Initial police investigation found Min, a . long-term epilepsy sufferer, had been strongly psychologically affected . by rumours of the upcoming end of the world predicted by ancient . prophecy,' Xinhua said. Chinese police have already detained more . than 500 people from a fringe Christian group for spreading rumours about . the world's impending end, according to state media reports.

Police . seized leaflets, video discs, books and other apocalyptic materials as . they arrested more than 500 people across eight provinces and regions, . from the prosperous east coast to less developed western China, state . media reports said. Those . detained are reported to be members of the group Almighty God, which is . also called Eastern Lightning, after a phrase from the Bible's Book of . Matthew.

The violence that broke out at the Sandy Hook Elementary School continues to shock: images of the little faces and the heroic teachers who tried . desperately to save their students have pierced the hearts of people worldwide. As the grief-stricken families are laying to rest the loved . ones stolen from them in the tragedy on December 14 – the small town of Bath, Michigan is standing in solidarity with the people of Newtown as the . Connecticut community struggles to move forward after being shaken to the core by the unspeakable . violence. The Midwest town, just 20 miles from Lansing, was the site of . the most deadly school violence in U.S. history, when in May 1927 a trustee . from the local school board wired the school with 600 pounds of dynamite and then detonated the explosive, killing 45 people, 38 of whom were children. Scroll down for video. Horror: The townspeople of Bath, Michigan were shocked at the damage to the Bath Consolidated School after a school board trustee wired the school with dynamite in 1927 . Damage: Andrew Kehoe had outfitted the school building with 600 pounds of dynamite which caused massive damage to the structure, only 100 pounds actually exploded. 45 people were killed, 38 of whom were children . Small town: The picturesque school in the small town of Bath, Mich. before Andrew Kehoe planned the deadly attack on May 18, 1927 . Bath has been described as the 'quintessential American . small town,' by author Arnie Bernstein . who profiled the devastating attack at the Bath Consolidated School in his 2009 book, 'Bath Massacre: . America’s First School Bombing.' The perpetrator of the horrifying crime, Andrew Kehoe, was a . trustee on the local school board and planned the gruesome attack after he had contentious arguments with the school . superintendent, Emery Hyuck. Mr Bernstein researched the incident and spent significant . time with the survivors of the attack, telling the MailOnline that Kehoe was an 'evil genius' who methodically prepared over the course of several months. As a . trained electrician and a farmer, the man was one of the few people equipped to repair the generator that powered the school in the rural community and he was . given unfettered access to the building. Rebuild: The townspeople of Bath, Mich. came together to rebuild the school after the tragic school explosion . Moving forward: Even the young community members joined the effort to move forward after the deadly attack . It took several months for Kehoe, 55, to . completely outfit the school building with dynamite – sticking sticks in the ceilings, . floors and in any open cracks. In the lead up to the crime, the man’s large stock of . dynamite wasn’t seen as a red flag since as a farmer it was common to blow up . heavy stumps or large debris in fields. But on May 18, using the timers that he had installed . throughout the building, Kehoe detonated the explosives. The explosion rocked the . building filled with children and the second floor of the building collapsed. The explosion was heard as far away as Lansing, . according to witnesses, and at first school officials thought a boiler had exploded. As rescuers scrambled to search for survivors, Kehoe himself . drove up to the school in a truck that was laden with dynamite and shrapnel. His enemy, Superintendent Hyuck, approached Kehoe's vehicle, . pleading with the man to help in the rescue effort. Heroes: In the Bath school explosion 21-year-old teacher Hazel Weatherby (left) clutched 2 students in her arms until rescuers came. Vicki Soto, 27, (right) was shot trying to shield students in the Sandy Hook attack . Unthinkable: Images of terrified students at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut have shocked the nation and the community is recovering after a shooter entered the school and killed 26 . According to witness accounts as told to Bernstein, Kehoe told . hthe man, ‘Okay I’ll take you with me’ and he fired his gun into the cache of . dynamite in his truck, blowing himself up and killing and injuring several more. A day after . the attack, police discovered that before Kehoe had launched his attack . at the school, he killed his wife and her body was found burned . in the remains of the Kehoe farm, which the man had torched. Kehoe was married to Nellie but the couple had no children. Officers also found a sign on the man's property that stated, 'Criminals . are made, not born.' Bernstein said that Kehoe perfectly fit the clinical . description of a psychopath, making it frustrating when people begin to ask what . could have possibly motivated such a terrible crime. 'As rational beings we want a why. There is no why. That's . the frustrating, sad thing about this,' he said. Bernstein noted the . same pattern in which Kehoe and Adam Lanza, the . 20-year-old shooter in the Sandy Hook massacre, carried out the attacks. Both killed someone . close to . them, Kehoe killed his wife Nellie and Lanza shot his mother Nancy, then . launched a killing spree and then both took their own lives. Hope: The Newtown community has come together in the aftermath of the tragedy . In remembrance: A man prays at a memorial for shooting victims near the Sandy Hook Elementary School . But he also noted the courage and overwhelming show of support from the community after . the terrible crimes. Moments after the explosion at the school in 1927, a 21-year-old teacher, Hazel Weatherby, was found by rescuers . clutching two young students in her arms, according to a story told to Bernstein. The teacher was barely breathing when . she was found and when the rescuers took the children from her arms, she succumbed to death, seemingly at peace to die knowing the children were safe. 'It's like she instinctively reached out to protect the . children, like Vicki Soto did,’ the author said, referencing the 27-year-old . teacher at Sandy Hook who was shot as she tried to shield her young students. Though the Bath school disaster predated technological advances in communication, . worldwide the Michigan community still received expressions of sorrow from . across the globe. 'Out of the inexplicable bad of one person has brought out . the tremendous good of most people,' the author said, adding that he has been in touch . with many of the Bath survivors who have expressed their sorrow about the Sandy Hook tragedy. Mastermind: Andrew Kehoe, 55, (left) took months to wire the school building with dynamite before the Bath massacre of 1927. Police are investigating why 20-year-old Adam Lanza (right) launched his shooting spree . 'They’re feeling this in Bath the way no one else can. They . know what it’s like,' he said. As the town in Connecticut tries to recover from the tragedy, the author said that the community of Bath came together to try to recover from the tragedy. The town tried to find a sense of normalcy and the school met in various . buildings in Bath’s downtown, the local church and the general store, while the . school building was repaired. The building was repaired and classes resumed but in the 1970s was torn down. T . he cupola that sat on the building was preserved and now rests on a small structure at a park, on the site where the school once stood. But as the community moved forward, many swallowed their . grief and kept their emotions to themselves. Many only began to open up about the experience . when the author began probing in research for his book.","The Bath Massacre in a small Michigan town killed 45 people, 38 children .

Glossy posse: Pippa shakes the rain from her umbrella as she climbs into a taxi outside hip new nightspot Tonteria . Stylish couple: The 29-year-old looked chic in black suede ankle boots and a monochrome snakeprint skirt, while new beau Tom Kingston was handsome in a navy suit and grey scarf, with a bright blue shirt . Seal of approval: The attendance of the younger Middleton sister could trigger a flood of visits by the inner circle of young royals . Making waves: Tom and Pippa have been dating since October and appear to have plenty in common . The Duchess's sister kept out the cold with sensible black opaques, swishing her long mane of glossy chestnut hair and grasping a black leather clutch as she cheerfully slipped out of the club under the shelter of an umbrella. Pelly's last Chelsea nightclub, Public, was forced to close after complaints that it had become the well-heeled area's 'number one crime generator', with rich twenty-somethings causing havoc as they stumbled home in the early hours. Stowe-educated Pelly owns popular clubs Mahiki and Whisky Mist, but still needs the boost of a successful new project after the embarrassing blow of Public's closure led some to speculate that he was relying on the status of his well-connected friends. So Pippa's beam as she left the fledging nightspot will do much to cement the stylish reputation of the club, which launched in October to great fanfare. Swish event: The socialite seemed in good spirits after her night at the fledging Sloane Square club . Royal cachet: Pippa's chic appearance will be a boon for Pelly, whose last nightclub venture was shut down after becoming Chelsea's 'number one crime generator' Ariba! Pippa and friends enjoyed tequila-based cocktails served in skull-shaped bowls and mixed at their table, as well as sharing platters loaded with nibbles including tacos and nachos . Christmas night out: Pippa let her hair down as she showed off her new squeeze to friends . The partygoers lounged on hammocks and were served tacos on sharing platters and cocktails in skull-shaped punch bowls at the themed bar, already a hit with the likes of Otis Ferry, Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs and Prince Harry's on-off girlfriend Chelsy Davy. Pippa seems happier than ever since she started appearing in public with Kingston last month, just weeks after splitting with cricketing boyfriend Alex Loudon. The rugged 34-year-old Bristol graduate could be the perfect man for the younger Middleton sister, having worked at Schroders private bank and procuring the release of hostages in Iraq. He is already well used to the royal circle, as the ex-boyfriend of Prince William’s former squeeze, Natalie Hicks-Loebbecke. New author Pippa certainly looked more than pleased with her pre-Christmas night out at the subterranean Tonteria, and her visibly glowing recommendation could trigger a rush of young royals keen to down some tequilas at the trendy venue.","The 29-year-old enjoyed tequila-based cocktails and Mexican sharing food .

Andrew Mitchell was yesterday eager to prove he had put his problems with the police behind him – by planting a kiss on the cheek of a female officer. Mr Mitchell made the awkward gesture to Chief Superintendent Lorraine Bottomley after visiting a police station in his constituency. He said he had been visiting the local police and other emergency services for the past 11 years to thank them for keeping the community safe ‘while many of us are putting our feet up over Christmas’. Scroll down for video . Tory MP Andrew Mitchell today put his stand-off with police to one side to embrace Chief Superintendent Lorraine Bottomley on the steps of Sutton Coldfield police station . ‘They’ve done such a very good job,’ he added. ‘They’ve made Sutton Coldfield the second safest town in . Britain and I’m very proud of what the police have achieved.’ Despite the recent furore over the . ‘plebgate’ affair, Mr Mitchell insisted he had always had ‘a really . excellent relationship’ with his local police. He added: ‘We’ve worked closely together for the past 11 years in the interest of the local community. ‘They’re a great team, they do a very good job and we work together extremely well.’ Meanwhile, the leader of the rank and . file police last night said he would apologise to Mr Mitchell if an . investigation found the MP did not call officers ‘plebs’ during the . infamous incident in Downing Street. Paul McKeever, chairman of the Police . Federation, said he ‘will be one of the first in the queue to apologise’ if the former Chief Whip is exonerated. It was a very public display of support for the police at a time when senior Tories have claimed Mr Mitchell is the victim of a 'stitch up' Mr Mitchell had been holding meetings with members of the police force in his Sutton Coldfield constituency . Mr Mitchell has claimed the plebgate saga has 'shaken' his confidence in the police . After details of Mr Mitchell’s . foul-mouthed rant were leaked, members of the federation repeatedly . referred to the scandal in their campaign to highlight alleged police . cuts, wearing ‘PC Pleb’ T-shirts to the Tory party conference to try to . garner public sympathy. Yesterday Mr McKeever admitted he . ‘came pretty close’ to demanding the minister’s head in the days after . the row blew up and acknowledged concerns that his organisation had . ‘stoked up’ media attention. Mr McKeever said he was ‘taken aback . and shocked’ by Mr Mitchell’s reported comments, which came immediately . after the murder of two women police officers in Manchester. ‘I think we can all say we could have done things better,’ he told Radio 4’s PM programme. The Met Police now have 30 officers . working on the investigation into plebgate, which has been widened to . probe claims of a conspiracy against Andrew Mitchell. The Metropolitan . Police Service Directorate of Professional Standards inquiry wants to: . ‘The federation has to look at how we . can get some measure of control to ensure that there is perhaps a better . way of doing business in the future. ‘If he has been done a calumny in relation to what happened, I will be one of the first in the queue to apologise. ‘I can understand when people say . there is a danger that trust might be eroded in the British police . service as a result of what’s happened.’ His comments came as Scotland . Yard revealed that a second man had been arrested in connection with the . affair. A 23-year-old man was questioned . yesterday on suspicion of helping a police officer from the elite . Diplomatic Protection Group commit misconduct in a public office. Speculation was growing last night . that the latest suspect, who is not a police officer, may have attempted . to conceal evidence last Friday. The alleged offence took place the day . before the 52-year-old police officer from the DPG was arrested in . North London last Saturday on suspicion of misconduct in public office. The officer is accused of sending a . fabricated email claiming he had witnessed Mr Mitchell call officers . ‘f***ing plebs’ at the gates of Downing Street on September 19. It has since emerged that key sections . of the barely literate email, which he sent to his local MP John . Randall, directly contradict CCTV footage from Downing Street of the . incident. His alleged accomplice was arrested at a house in North London on Wednesday evening. Controversy: Andrew Mitchell with his wife yesterday . Scotland Yard said the man’s home was . searched and he was released on police bail yesterday but would not . confirm if he is related to the officer who was arrested. Some 30 officers are working on the inquiry, which is being supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron today expressed his dismay at the allegation that a police officer tried to 'blacken the name' of a Cabinet minister' Detectives are also investigating how . the police log, with details of the police officers’ version of events, . was leaked to the media.

A serial flasher wore a pink suspender belt and black lacy bra and exposed himself to women in a tiny village. Kevin Robinson, 29, was jailed for 18 months yesterday after a judge at Ipswich Crown Court said he had 'grave concerns' about the risk the pervert posed. One women said he opened a trenchcoat while wearing a blonde wig, revealing his lingerie to her through a shop window in Blundeston, near Lowestoft, Suffolk. She said the sex pest gave her a 'chilling stare' before flashing at her from the darkened street as she browsed the store. Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, told the court the flasher's face had been masked with a black scarf. Another terrified target was walking her dog at night when the sex pest jumped out in front of her, while another said he approached her while wearing tights with nothing underneath. On a separate occasion, Robinson leapt out in front of a car while dressed in black and wearing a balaclava, before exposing his genitals. Robinson, of Lowestoft, admitted two offences of exposing himself to women in Blundeston on September 6 and October 18. He also asked for five other offences to be considered. Robinson was jailed in 2007 for four . years for false imprisonment, sex assault and unlawfully detaining a . child, the court heard.

A bride-to-be has lost her fight to marry in a Scientology 'church' after High Court judges ruled that it is not a legal place to wed. Louisa Hodkin had battled to overturn a refusal by the registrar general of births, deaths and marriages in England and Wales to register the chapel for the solemnisation of marriages on the grounds that it was not 'a place of meeting for religious worship'. The 24-year-old had wanted to wed fellow Scientologist fiance Alessandro Calcioli in a chapel at the church's London base in Queen Victoria Street, central London. She had argued that the decision not to allow her to hold a ceremony there was unlawful religious discrimination. But Mr Justice Ouseley backed the registrar's decision and dismissed her case. The judge was backed today by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles who welcomed the decision. The court had been told at an earlier hearing that the chapel would have to be legally certified as a meeting place for religious worship to enable a marriage to take place there. Miss Hodkin's lawyer Lord Lester of Herne Hill QC said that the bride-to-be's brother David had been married in a religious ceremony at a Church of Scientology in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 2007 and that she and her fiance had wanted a similar ceremony. But a casework manager for the registrar general said such a wedding could not be recognised because of the 1970 case of Segerdal in the Court of Appeal. Judges in that case ruled that another Scientology chapel was not a meeting place for religious worship because its services involved 'instructions in the tenets of a philosophy concerned with man' and were not concerned with religious worship. Mr Justice Ouseley said today that he felt bound by that Court of Appeal ruling. He said in a written ruling: 'In my . judgment there has been no significant change in the beliefs of . Scientologists or in their services since (that) decision.' '(That . ruling), in the absence of a significant change in the way . Scientologists worship, still binds me to hold that they do not . worship.' But he said the issue should be analysed by the Supreme Court - the highest court in the UK. Miss Hodkins and Mr Calcioli, both volunteers at the church, had appealed the decision to block the wedding in July last year. The case was of particular importance . to the Church of Scientology and its followers as several similar cases . have been turned down in court in the past. Engaged: Louisa Hodkin pictured with her fiance Alessandro Calcioli . The case was of particular importance to the Church of Scientology and its followers as several similar cases have been turned down in court in the past. Miss Hodkin argued that the 1970 ruling should not be binding on any court because Scientologist beliefs and services had evolved during the past 42 years. Support: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles backed the High Court ruling . She said services were 'ones of religious worship' and likened Scientology to Buddhism and Jainism. But she said after the case that she was pleased that the Supreme Court may take a different view of her case. She said: 'I knew I would have to be strong and patient given the current law. 'I am delighted that the court has granted me the opportunity to ask the Supreme Court to hear my case. 'I hope that the court allows me to marry in my own church, surrounded by my family and friends, which means everything to me.' Her solicitor, Paul Hewitt, who works for law firm Withers, said: 'It has always felt wrong that, simply because she is a member of the Church of Scientology, Louisa has been denied the right given to Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Jains and other faiths to have a legal marriage ceremony in accordance with her own religious beliefs and in her own church.' He added: 'Louisa is determined to see the process through to achieve this basic right.' Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the Church of Scientology might have been entitled to 'tax breaks' - because of rules governing places of public worship - had a decision gone in its favour. He welcomed Mr Justice Ouseley’s ruling and said taxpayers would not want 'such a controversial organisation' to get 'special' treatment. Believers: Actors John Travolta, left, and Tom Cruise, right, are both followers of Scientology . Officials at the Department for Communities and Local Government said places of public worship could be exempted from paying business tax rates. And Mr Pickles, Conservative MP for Brentwood and Ongar, added: 'I welcome this ruling. Tolerance and freedom of expression are important British values, but this does not mean that the likes of Church of Scientology deserve favoured tax treatment. He said the Church of Scientology was not a registered charity and went on: 'The majority of the public would not want their own council to be giving special tax breaks to such a controversial organisation.' Scientology is a controversial religious belief system that teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Famous Scientologists include actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta.","Louisa Hodkin, 24, lost her appeal to be allowed to marry Alessandro Calcioli .

A paralysed schoolboy who can only communicate with his eyes has written a Christmas song by blinking. Adam Bojelian, 12, who has cerebral palsy, wrote the song with the help of mother Zoe, 52, who painstakingly pointed at letters until the festive track was complete. The Edinburgh family have now made the song available on iTunes and it has already attracted celebrity backing including from Hollywood actor Ewan McGregor. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Adam Bojelian, 12 with his mother Zoe. He can only communicate by blinking his eyelids. But this remarkable little boy has managed to write an amazing Christmas song that has already attracted celebrity backing . His delightful ditty, called the Christmas Gibbons, tells the story of how Santa only manages to deliver presents to children all over the globe in one night because he has an army of monkeys to help him out . The only movement cerebral palsy sufferer Adam can make is to move his eyelids up and down in answer to questions. A blink means yes and if he simply stares it means no . Based on Adam's poem called Christmas Gibbons, the song tells the story of how Santa can only deliver presents to children with the help of an army of monkeys. Gibbons are fun at Christmas, They don't mind the snow,Gibbons are fun at Christmas,But there is something about them you don't know.They are Santa's secret weapon,They work on Christmas night,Swinging across the roof tops,They really are a sight. Bringing lots of presents,All around the world they go, More agile than the reindeers, Swinging to and fro. They are Santa's secret posties, Bringing gifts wrapped in paper and ribbons, You thought the reindeers did this job, Now you know it is the gibbons. Mrs Bojelian said: 'Because it was a poem about Christmas, I made a list of festive words like snow and Santa and he would blink at the words he wanted to include. 'We'd gone through this process and had a whole load of Christmassy words and then I asked 'are all the words you want to use on your list?' and he said 'no'.' Baffled, she then started to point to letters on an alphabet chart and Adam carefully selected G followed by I. 'I thought the word must be ""gift"" but then he chose B and spelled out the word GIBBONS,' she added. 'Once he had all the words he needed he put them in order. It took him a week to write all the words for the poem. 'This year his health has been really bad and he was in the Rachel House Hospice for respite care and they asked him to think about what he would like for his Make A Wish. 'Most of his friends wanted to go to Disneyland or meet a celebrity but Adam wanted to make his poem about the gibbons into a Christmas song.' Adam, of Edinburgh, was born with cerebral palsy and lost all movement at just 10-months-old. When Mrs Bojelian, who is studying for a PhD in medical law, noticed that Adam would blink when she spoke to him she realised this was how he was trying to communicate. As he got older and learnt to read she began to hold up an alphabet chart, pointing to letters, with Adam blinking when she pointed to the correct one. The only movement Adam can make is to move his eyelids up and down in answer to questions. A blink means yes and if he simply stares it means no. The laborious process can mean it can often take a day to write just one sentence. His mother took him along to a poetry group at their local church and Adam wrote his first poem, aged nine. When talented Adam won a poetry prize only a year later his mother suggested he wrote a festive poem to send out with the family's Christmas cards. Adam with his parents Zoe and Paul in February 2000. He was born with cerebral palsy and lost all movement at just 10 months old . The touching poem, featuring a helpful gang of musician gibbons, has now been animated and released on iTunes for charity . The Christmas Gibbons are Santa's 'secret weapon' helping him on his merry way to delivering presents across the world . The jolly jingle is a collaboration between Adam Bojelier (left) and Hollywood musician Tom Harrison (right) It was only when the family, including father Paul, 51, were out for a walk in a local park with his beloved Parson's Jack Russell terrier, Charlie, that Adam's dream of making a song became reality. The trio bumped into family friends Gary and Kim Harrison, and the two families got chatting about Adam's poem. Now, thanks to the Harrison's son Tom, 23, a Hollywood music composer, who has worked on hit TV series CSI, Adam's poem has been turned into a song. Actor Ewan McGregor said he 'loves the idea that Santa is assisted at Christmas by gibbons' The musician, who is originally from Elgin, Scotland, said: 'Adam's story really moved me and when his mum told me it was Adam's Christmas wish for his poem to become a song, I just wanted to help make his dream come true. 'He's really inspiring. Despite all his difficulties, Adam was able to create something so wonderful. 'Because Adam's poem was so beautifully written and rhymed well, it only took me about three hours to compose the music to go with the words. 'It then took me about a week to record the track and I played all the instruments, including the piano and acoustic guitar, flute and bells.' Animator Nikki Godley was then recruited to create a video cartoon to accompany the single which is being sold on iTunes to raise money for CHAS, a charity that runs children's hospices in Scotland. McGregor, a supporter of the charity, said he was bowled over when he heard Christmas Gibbons, saying: 'It’s quite incredible to think that Adam shares his vivid imagination with is through poetry written by blinking. 'I love the idea that Santa is assisted at Christmas by gibbons! I hope lots of people will download this track and help raise money for CHAS.' When the families finally showed Adam his song they said he was 'over the moon.'

Music users who copy CDs to iPods and laptops will no longer be treated as criminals under a major shake-up of copyright laws. The government has also ruled out imposing an ‘iTax’ on all music storage devices, despite being levied across much of Europe. And record companies will no longer be able to block parodies of songs by their biggest artists, clearing the way for spoof videos to go viral. Ministers will scrap the law which means it is technically illegal for someone to copy a CD or ebook on to an iPod or Kindle. Scroll down for video . Users will be able to copy music and ebooks between devices without breaking the law under the shake-up of copyright. Business Secretary Vince Cable (right) said the 'common sense' changes would clear the way for more spoofs . Most of the millions of people using mobile music devices have no idea they are unwittingly breaking the law every time they move a song from one device to another. Six years ago, the British Phonographic Industry said it would not seek to punish people, provided they were only copying tracks for their personal use. But only now have the government agreed to change the law to keep pace with technology, which sees people regularly swapping and copying files between devices and software like iTunes. The . change means users will be able to copy files as many times as they . like for their own use, but it will still be illegal to give copies to . other people. However, . Business Secretary Vince Cable has ruled out following other EU . countries that have imposed a copyright levy – dubbed an ‘iTax’ - on any . technology that can copy, including iPods, computers and photocopiers. For . example, in France, a 64GB iPod is hit with an iTax of 15 euros. In . Poland the charge is added to anything which can be used to make a copy, . including blank paper. It . puts Britain at loggerheads with Brussels, where EU officials are . drawing up plans for a Europe-wide iTax, due to be announced within . weeks. Mr Cable is refusing to back the idea of an EU levy set centrally by Brussels. He said the changes were ‘common sense’ for the public but could also be good for business too. ‘Bringing . the law into line with ordinary people’s reasonable expectations will . boost respect for copyright, on which our creative industries rely,’ he . said. ‘We feel we have struck the right balance between improving the way consumers benefit from copyright works they have legitimately paid for, boosting business opportunities and protecting the rights of creators.’ Rules on using well-known songs for parodies will also be changed, clearing the way for a slew of spoof videos which record companies can do nothing about. Teachers will be able to use more material on interactive whiteboards without getting permission from copyright holders . New rules on ‘parody, caricature and pastiche’ set out by the government will ‘allow limited copying on a fair dealing basis which would allow genuine parody, but prohibit copying disguised as parody’. A raft of changes will make it easier for people to use work covered by copyright without getting permission from the copyright owners. Teachers will be able to use more material on interactive whiteboards and share files across secure networks for students. Sound recordings, films and broadcasts can also be copied for non-commercial research and private study purposes. Under existing legislation a breach of copyright can be punishable by up to two years in prison or a fine of £5,000. Mike O’Connor, chief executive of Consumer Focus, said: ‘It is not before time that a private copying exception is built into law. When consumers have paid for music or other digital material, they should be allowed to copy it for their own use. 'It is absurd that private copying such as transferring a CD into an MP3 format is copyright infringement under current UK law.'","Copyright law shake-up to make it easier to transfer files between devices .

A British tourist drowned after he jumped up to 100 feet from a cliff face into the sea. Phillip Hawkes, 25, who was nicknamed Captain Caterpillar, had travelled with his best friend to Majorca in June to try free climbing craze, Deep Water Soloing. Tragedy struck when Mr Hawkes from Leigh in Greater Manchester, struggled to get out of the water using a rope ladder fixed to nearby rocks. After talking to his friend, Edward Bailey, 25, the Lancaster graduate decided the best option was for him to swim to a nearby cave. However, he got into difficulties and was found lying face down and lifeless in the water by coastguards. He was pronounced dead at the scene after attempts to resuscitate him failed. Mr Hawkes, who had been working in Scotland as a climbing instructor, and was due to be best man at Mr Bailey’s wedding wanted to be the first of the two friends to free climb on the first day of their holiday. Mr Bailey who is a trained outdoor climber said the climbing routes they were hoping to complete on the holiday were quite low on the grading spectrum. He told the Bolton inquest: ‘This climb was around a 6A grade and we were both able to climb grades 6C and 7A - the route was well within our comfort rate. We were deliberately cautious since we had never done it before. ‘When we climbed together, we were very close in ability - but in terms of strength I would have been slightly higher. However what he lacked in strength, he more than beat me in confidence, in terms of going for it.’ Tragedy: After Mr Hawkes allowed himself to fall up to 100 feet, he struggled to get out of the water using a rope ladder fixed to nearby rocks . On examining the crag, they decided they would need rope to help aide them to a ledge located further down. Mr Bailey said: ‘Philip wanted to go first; he was really, really excited about it and was really enthusiastic. He had a lot of confidence in climbing so he wanted to go for it.’ The hearing was told Philip removed his climbing shoes off, wedged them into a gap where the ropes were attached to the rock, and jumped. Cautious: Mr Hawkes and his friend chose climbing routhes that were well within their comfort rate. After he landed in the water, the pair decided it best he swim round the cliff to a nearby cave . Mr Bailey said there were three ropes - . two in the form of a ladder - secured to the rock which dropped to the . water to enable easy access back up on to the rock. As he struggled with the ropes, Mr Bailey said: ‘He was a little bit frustrated, but he was still chatty and chirpy. ‘His nickname at university was Captain Caterpillar because he was very long in the body and when he used to climb his backside would stick out - and it was - he was finding it difficult to get into an upright position on the rope.’ Unclear: It is not known exactly how Mr Hawkes died as when he began swimming he moved out of sight of his friend . After the pair, who did not have . phones on them, decided that it would be best for Philip to swim round . the cliff, Mr Bailey made his way along the cliff top to the cave which . was around 200 feet away. On the way he saw a German couple and told . them to alert the emergency services. When he got to the cave, there was no sign of Mr Hawkes. He said: ‘He didn't appear. It shouldn't have taken him very long’. Deep Water Soloing is a relatively . new style of climbing but it is believed to have originated in the late . 1960s or early 1970s in Dorset, Southern England or Majorca. The activity involves climbing on sea . cliffs with no ropes and only climbing shoes and chalk as aides – but at . high tide so the water cushions climbers from serious injury. Normally a dinghy is used to pick up . the fallen climber as a fall from a taller route can still knock the . climber out, causing them to drown. The . practise is sometimes named ‘Psicobloc’, which, when translated . literally from Spanish into English, means ‘Psycho Bouldering’. Recording a verdict of accidental death coroner Alison Mulch said: ‘Philip has been described as a very competent and confident climber. From his friend's evidence, we've heard that they had gone on holiday with the intention of deep water soloing. ‘They had prepared for that - they didn't go in blindly. Both he and Philip prepared as much as they could for this. We've heard that Philip jumped into the water and seemed to be enjoying swimming in the water. ‘He struggled to get out of the water, notwithstanding the fact that the ropes were in the water. His friend created a rope using slings. He dropped them into the water. Philip appeared to find them easier to use but was still struggling. ‘Philip dropped back into the water and the two of them reached the decision that Philip would swim to a spot about 50-70 metres away to a cave which would allow Philip easier access out of the water. ‘This was not a reckless decision by Philip - the sea appeared calm, Philip felt confident swimming in the water. ‘At that point he started swimming to the cave knowing exactly where he was swimming to on his back. ‘His friends ascended back up the rock and went to the cave. Phil was then out of sight , so it's unclear what happened.’ ‘At that point he started swimming to the cave knowing exactly where he was swimming to on his back. ‘His friends ascended back up the rock and went to the cave.

A Colorado mother has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a 14-year-old boy in her home closet - the first of two young victims' claims against her. Lynne Collette Freeman, 39, a mother of two and former parent volunteer at University Schools in Greeley, has pleaded guilty to one count of attempted sexual assault on a child following a plea deal. Police say a 14-year-old first reported a series of sexual assaults by Freeman before a second 16-year-old boy came forward with similar allegations earlier this year. Guilty! Lynne Freeman, 39, of Greeley, Colorado has pleaded guilty to sexually abusing one of two underage boys, one in her home closet and a second allegedly in the park and her basement . Freeman has two daughters who were aged seven and 13 at the time of her arrest in June. Freeman's attorney says she initially denied the assaults to police, having previously told the 14-year-old that it would ruin his aspiring baseball career if he told anyone. But when both boys called her to discuss what happened, police recorded the calls capturing what they described as a confession. According to the affidavit, it was in April that the 14-year-old was pulled into the closet while watching a movie at Freeman’s home with a friend. After the other child was asked to take the dog outside by Freeman, she pulled the 14-year-old into an upstairs closet, according to the arrest report. Freeman locked the door behind them, pulled off his pants, kissed him and performed oral sex on him, police said. Case: A court hearing is seen earlier this year for Freeman, a mother with two daughters whose seen in an orange jumpsuit on the left monitor . After the incident, the woman repeatedly told the boy to keep the sexual contact a secret. The victim contacted police in June after confiding in his father about the assault. The mother said she '100 percent trusted' the boy to keep the situation private because she would get in trouble.

Scam: Leonid Rotaru, front right was involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £3 million and with 9,000 potential victims. He is pictured walking free from court today . Detectives estimated that the network to which Rotaru belonged had . access to at least £3 million, based on the average fraud per card for . typical skimming offences. After he was convicted of his part in the scam, the 32-year-old was given an 18-month jail term, suspended for two years, at Taunton Crown Court. Speaking outside the court, Avon and Somerset Police civilian investigator Barrie Douglas said: 'The potential in these cases is always for a lot of money to be made. 'Banks say the average (fraud) per card is around £460.' Asked whether he was content with the sentence handed down to Rotaru, Mr Douglas said: 'That’s for the courts to decide, it’s not for me.' The court heard that father-of-two Rotaru had been living legally in the country for three years. Fraud: Leonid Rotaru is pictured returning to remove his skimmer from a cash machine in Somerset .

Those details were then sent on an email to another man. Free: Mr Rotaru was given an 18-month jail term, suspended for two years . Rotaru told police he was 'at the bottom end' of the operation, and that the 'big boys operated out of London'. However, he refused to explain why he had not given their names to police as he left the court a free man today. He also refused to say who received the card detail emails. Judge Graham Hume Jones told Rotaru: 'This is a sophisticated scam by which a number of people could have been victims. 'Even if they had been repaid by the banks, the banks themselves would have been the victims, and ultimately the banks’ customers.' The court heard Rotaru skipped bail while under investigation for one such fraud, in Axminster, Devon, in 2011. He was eventually convicted by a jury after his DNA was discovered inside the inner components of the tiny device. Rotaru . was later apprehended when he was spotted by police in Minehead at an .

Mr Varga managed to escape through an emergency exit but realizing that there were still co-workers in the building, returned and helped three people escape in Newtown, Connecticut.

Mr Varga told the New York Daily News that he was talking about the previous night’s choral performance with four other teachers in the conference room. Principal Dawn Hochsprung popped in to offer them some chocolate. He said that she commented on his tie before leaving. Moments later, she would be gunned down. Once the shooting began, Mr Varga tried to lock the door to the conference room. When he found out the door would not lock, the teacher then ran down a smoke-filled hallway to safety but turned back to help his fellow staff escape. Once back in the conference room, Mr Varga helped dislodge a wooden board on one of the windows and three of the teachers escaped through the hole.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage promises to help the parents take legal action against Rotherham Council . A couple who had their foster children taken from them because they are members of Ukip are threatening to sue the council that removed the youngsters over alleged press leaks. Rotherham Borough Council took the children - who are Eastern European - after discovering their foster carers were members of the UK Independence Party which was deemed a 'racist' party by social workers. Now the experienced foster parents say they have been blacklisted and are demanding an apology. They have said that they will now take legal action after their foster agency said the council had accused them of leaking information to the press about their children and birth parents. They told the Guardian:  'If Rotherham Metropolitan Borough . Council are accusing us of a breach of confidentiality and do not issue a . formal apology in order to clear our name we may be forced to seek . legal action to protect our future as foster parents.' Ukip has said it will back the couple's legal action. A spokesman said:  'If that black mark isn’t removed, their chances of fostering again are very, very limited.' He . said Ukip will 'entirely” support any law suit, adding: 'We hope it . won’t come to that. We hope that Rotherham council will back down and do . the decent thing and apologise.' Education Secretary Michael Gove, who ordered an investigation into the matter, has branded the decision to remove the children 'indefensible' and made 'in the wrong way for the wrong reasons'. Rotherham council launched an urgent review when it was revealed that the children had been removed from their foster home in November. Responding to the couple’s threat of . legal action, a council spokesman said in a statement: 'The council is . not and never has been the couple’s employer. 'Their future employment as foster carers is not a matter for the council, it is a matter for the agency which employs them.' Earlier . this month the birth parents of the three children were revealed to be a . Slovakian couple who have had six of their offspring taken away by . social workers. Attacked by all political parties: Rotherham council (pictured) social services were accused of acting like 'Thought Police' and was also criticised for failing to protect scores of young girls how have been sexually abused by street grooming gangs . The father accused council staff of ‘racism’ and of destroying his family as he told how  20 police officers ‘raided’ their home to remove their last four children. The authorities have also taken the couple’s grandchild (the baby son of their 17-year-old married daughter), bringing the total number now being looked after by the state from this one family to seven. Their ages range from five months to 11 years. The parents, who are happily  married . and came to Britain five years ago, found themselves at the centre of . national controversy after the staunchly Labour council in Rotherham, South . Yorkshire, discovered that it had sent three of their removed children . to live with the foster couple who are UKIP members. Through . friends, the parents of the Rotherham children say the irony is that . despite the council’s fears of the UKIP foster couple being racist, it . is the council which has picked on them because they are Roma, and . social workers disapprove of their non-British ‘lifestyle’.

But it was only when he received no reply and let himself in that Mr Evans's friend realised that he was dead. Verdict: The coroner ruled that Andrew Evans's death was accidental at Horsham Coroner's Court, pictured . Mr Evans had injured his head before his death on May 10, but it is not known how seriously. Horsham Coroner's court heard how Mr Evans was four times the drink drive limit when he died. It is thought that he died after blacking out as he reached into a cupboard in his kitchen . His body is said to have fallen against the kitchen fittings and he remained standing up. His injury had caused him to bleed heavily, but the court heard he might not have realised how serious the injury was 'because of his intoxicated state'. Coroner Dr David Skipp said at the inquest last week that the death was 'strange', but said he died from asphyxiation of the lungs. He said: 'It is unusual for a man whose alcohol levels were high to be found stood against a work surface. 'He obviously did not try to get out of the flat after banging his head and the evidence suggests he was not bothered by what was going on - It is bizarre.'

A woman who allowed the death of her two-year-old son at the hands of her murdering boyfriend has been jailed for four years. 'Infatuated' Kirsty Smedley, 24, put her desire to please Daniel Rigby ahead of son Rio, who suffered 91 injuries all over his body. The fatal blow was delivered to the youngster’s stomach and split his liver in two after Smedley left her home in Bolton to get cash to buy cannabis for her boyfriend. Tragic: Rio Smedley, pictured left, was left in the care of Daniel Rigby by his mother Kirsty Smedley, right. He was found to have 91 injuries and his liver was split in two . She was convicted last month in a trial at Manchester Crown Court of allowing his death after the court heard she knew her son had received two nasty injuries to his backside and head the day before when Rigby was looking after him. Rigby, 23, from Tyldesley, Wigan, was sentenced to life last month and ordered to serve a minimum of 17 years after he was found guilty of the murder on April 22 at Smedley’s former home in Cheriton Drive, Breightmet. Daniel Rigby, pictured holding a baby, was found guilty of murdering two-year-old Rio whilst he was supposed to be looking after him and jailed for a minimum of 17 years . The injuries were inflicted in the space of three hours and included significant bruising to both his feet caused by stamping. Smedley who has already been pregnant seven times was castigated by the judge for having 'an irresponsible view . of obligations of a mother' after he heard how she put her love life . first. Sentencing her, Mr Justice MacKay said the jury’s verdict meant they were sure she knew or ought to have known there was a significant risk of serious harm to her son. He told Smedley: 'At no stage did you do anything to protect Rio from his fate. He must have suffered greatly before his death. 'You should never have left him that night. It was quite clear that Rio was at risk. You were infatuated with Rigby at the time and I think you still are, or at least during the trial. 'At the top of your list was a need to please him (Rigby).' Doctors said he was beaten viciously . his injuries were similar to being kicked repeatedly by a horse or being . involved in a road accident . The mother of two had been headbutted, . slapped across the face and called a 'fat slag' by 23-year  Rigby during a stormy relationship. Yet even though he . was arrested and banned from contacting her she was so infatuated . she dropped charges against him - even though her son Rio had had previous unexplained bruises. The pair had only kissed and made up . after a row just 48 hours earlier but Smedley paid the deadly price for . inviting Rigby back into her home when he battered her son senseless. Kirsty Smedley, left, was so keen to impress her boyfriend Daniel Rigby, pictured right, that she did not think about the safety of her toddler . The judge noted that she had shown no remorse over Rio’s death and the only time she showed distress was when her 999 call to the emergency services was played in court. The tragedy occurred whilst Smedley was heavily pregnant with a third child - but had not told Rigby someone else was the father. She only revealed the truth in a witness box when she was testifying at a trial over the toddler’s death. Whilst awaiting trial she fell pregnant again to a neighbour but she had a termination in prison two weeks ago - and is now considering sterilisation, the judge was told. She was said to have been exposed to a chaotic upbringing and suffered a traumatic assault at the age of 15. Smedley is of low IQ, has low self-esteem and as a consequence sought solace in a string of sexual relationships - moving on to the next man when abandoned, her QC Robert Woodcock said. He said she did not believe Rigby posed the 'slightest threat' to Rio. Rio was beaten to death at his house in Cheriton Drive, Breightmet, Bolton, pictured. The jury found Smedley knew leaving him with her lover left him at risk . Mr Justice MacKay told Smedley, who will be released on licence halfway through her sentence: 'I hope you will take the assistance that the prison will give you. 'I hope it will lead to some realisation that you need to take control of your life in a different way.' Following sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Reade said: 'This is a shocking case in which an innocent and defenceless little boy has suffered appalling injuries at the hands of someone who had been trusted to look after him. A police officer stands guard outside Smedley's former home in April where tiny Rio recieved 91 injuries including a split liver which caused his death . 'Although Daniel and Kirsty have now both been jailed for their involvement in Rio’s death, this will go little way to ease the suffering of Rio’s family, who have lost their beloved little boy under such tragic circumstances.' Her two surviving children will now be cared for by foster carers and she has made little effort to contact them. Smedley began dating Rigby, who has previous for or assault, public order matters and car theft, in 2011 . Last January she announced she was three months pregnant with her second child but Rigby punched and slapping Smedley in the belief she had been texting other men. Smedley, pictured left leaving Manchester Crown Court, has been pregnant seven times and Rigby, right, was not Rio's father . Friends recalled how he also headbutted her and kicked her in the head during a row in the kitchen whilst waiting for her to 'get him some money'. Last March 21 when Smedley was five months pregnant, Rigby punched her in the face grabbed her by the cheeks, pushed her into a door and headbutted her after claiming she was planning to have sex with other men. He was arrested and bailed on condition he make no contact with her with Smedley telling her midwife how she feared Rigby would kill her. A social worker also urged Smedly to ring her if there were any further problems. But on April 3 Smedley later withdrew a police statement she made about the attack and on April 20, Rigby was told no further action would be taken against him. Flowers and a teddy bear were left in memory of tragic Rio outside the home where he was beaten to death earlier this year . He immediately returned to their home and that evening Smedley left him to care for Rio for an hour whilst she and a friend went off to pick up portions of fish chips from a nearby takeaway. When Smedley returned home Rio already had red blotches on him and was feeling sick but she ignored the warning signs and instead went out again the next day to see relatives leaving the youngster at home with her violent boyfriend. During that time Rigby sent a text to Smedley saying Rio had 'fallen off the arm of the couch' at his grandmother’s house when the dog jumped up at him' and another saying he had been hit with a plastic toy sword. When she returned the youngster was sporting a bruise to his bottom, yet the following day the mother went out for a third time leaving Rio with Rigby. She was eventually called in a text by Rigby who said Rio had fallen down the stairs. She rushed back home to find the youngster was not moving and his eyes “sunk” to the back of his head and dialled 999. Rio was taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital but later died of a ruptured liver caused by punches kicks and stamping. A pathologist who examined Rio, found 91 separate marks of injury including 40 bruises and abrasions to his head and face, 11 bruises and abrasions to his abdomen, a 9.5cm x 3.7cm bruise to his buttock, seven bruises and abrasions to both his arms, and 20 injuries to his legs and feet. A police officer surveys the home where Rio was killed by his mum's boyfriend just days after the pair had got back together . Prosecuting Simon Phillips QC said: 'Kirsty was infatuated or desperate to make her relationship with Rigby work. 'What she was fearful of wasn’t what might happen to her child but what might happen to her if she didn’t please him. Rio was very much second in her thoughts. He was not her priority.' During the hearing Rigby held his head in his hands as Smedley revealed a DNA said had shown he was not the father of her second child. Earlier he had told the trial he never harmed Rio and insisted the youngster had fallen down the stairs.","Kirsty Smedley, 24, put her lover Daniel Rigby ahead of son Rio .

A British child molester who slipped through the hands of UK police because they did not have enough evidence against him has been sentenced to prison in Cambodia. But the one-year-jail sentence imposed on 71-year-old Reginald Blakely has outraged child protection groups in the south east Asian country, the previous haunt of notorious child sex abuser Gary Glitter. Child victim groups said the sentence was too lenient and would do nothing to deter other abusers of children in Cambodia. British Reginald Blakely, 71, has been jailed for one year in Cambodia, pictured, for abusing young boys . Blakely was arrested by British police, working with their Cambodian counterparts, when he returned to the UK in 2010, but he was released because there was not enough evidence to lay charges of child abuse against him. Since then, said Cambodian police, he has been back to the country five times, staying mostly in the city of Siem Reap, where he has since gone on trial. He took up a position as an English teacher, but child protection groups said he had ulterior motives. Cambodian police said they had footage, captured by surveillance officers, of Blakely approaching youngsters outside schools. Former pop star Gary Glitter, pictured, lived in Cambodia until 2002 when he was permanently deported to Vietnam due to suspected child sexual abuse . He was charged with molesting five boys aged between seven and 14 and was sentenced this week to two years imprisonment. But the court ordered him to serve only one year, the remaining 12 months being suspended. Blakely was also ordered to pay a fine of $US5000 and pay compensation of $150 to each of his victims. 'This sentence is far too lenient,' said Mr Samleang Seila, Cambodia's director for the child rights group Action Pour Les Infants - Action (Care) for Children. 'It won't do anything to deter other abusers of children.' Dozens of foreigners have been jailed or deported to face trial in their home countries since Cambodia stepped up its anti-paedophile push in 2003 in an attempt to wipe out its reputation as a haven for sexual predators.","Reginald Blakely charged with molesting five boys aged between 7 and 14 .

A male model has been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison after he was convicted of murder in the castration killing of a Portuguese TV personality in a New York City hotel room. Renato Seabra, a 23-year-old Portuguese native, was convicted last month of choking, bludgeoning and mutilating Carlos Castro. Castro's bloodied body was found in January 2011 in his Manhattan hotel room. Guilty: Renato Seabra has been convicted of murder over the killing of his gay lover Carlos Castro and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison today . Pictured together: Seabra sitting next to Castro, a well-known journalist in his native Portugal . Prosecutors argued the two were a . couple and Seabra was angry that Castro, a successful journalist, had . ended their relationship. The defense claimed that Seabra was . mentally ill. It said he believed he was on a mission to kill what he . saw as the devil of homosexuality in Castro. Seabra asked for forgiveness in court, saying through an interpreter that he didn't know what came over him. Renato Seabra, 23, had argued that he . was insane when he killed 65-year-old Carlos Castro in New York in . January 2011, and pleaded not guilty to a charge of second degree . murder. Seabra bludgeoned Castro with a . computer monitor and wine bottle, and used a corkscrew to sever his . lover's testicles in a Times Square hotel room. He . then wore the testicles as a bracelet and even told doctors he had been . drinking Castro's blood following the frenzied attack. 'You do not need an expert to tell you this is psychotic behavior,' David Touger, one of Seabra's lawyers, told the jury in closing arguments last month. More than 20 doctors have since diagnosed Seabra with bipolar disorder, he said. Weapon: NYPD detectives showed jurors the corkscrew that they found covered in blood in the hotel room . But the jury found him guilty after deliberating for a day. Seabra's trial in Manhattan had lasted two months, partly because it was repeatedly delayed by the effects of Hurricane Sandy. Neither the defendant nor his mother showed any emotion when the jury read out the verdict. 'This . was a brutal and sadistic crime, where Renato Seabra bludgeoned choked, . and mutilated his victim before murdering him,' district attorney Cy . Vance said. 'But the jury's verdict now, finally, holds Seabra . accountable. 'It is . particularly tragic that Carlos Castro was not only betrayed by his . spurned lover, but met a very painful and violent end far from his . home.' Touger had argued that his client was not responsible for the killing because he did not know what he was doing was wrong, believing instead he was on a God-ordained mission to slay the 'demon' of homosexuality that he saw in Castro. Seabra was found by police at a Manhattan hospital where he had checked in under his real name after arriving by taxi. Maxine Rosenthal, the lead prosecutor, told jurors that driving to the hospital was a ruse to feign insanity, as Seabra knew the body would soon be discovered. She described Seabra as an opportunist who was 'playing the role of the loving boyfriend' to exploit Castro's wealth and connections. He was apparently angry that Castro had ended their relationship. Aspiring model: 23-year-old Seabra claimed to have had a psychotic episode during the killing . Luxury: Castro and Seabra were staying at the high-end InterContinental Hotel in Manhattan . Castro, who met Seabra through Facebook, was a gay-rights activist and journalist, writing about fashion and society for Diario de Noticias, 24 Horas and Correio de Manha. As their relationship dissolved into fierce arguments during their stay in New York, Seabra became enraged, Rosenthal told the jury. 'It is no coincidence . Castro's life ended at the same time he ended his relationship with the . defendant,' she said. 'The . motive is as clear as if it were written in lights on a Times Square . marquee.' After killing Castro, Seabra disconnected the room phone, dismantled Castro's cellphone, and put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door as he left to buy him more time, she said. He took with him about $1,600 from Castro's wallet and their flight itinerary, fully intending to flee, she added. 'That shows presence of mind, it is deliberate action and is inconsistent with delusion,' Rosenthal said.","Renato Seabra, 23, bludgeoned 65-year-old Carlos Castro to death last year .

Plea: A teary-eyed Monserrate Shirley appeared in court today accused of causing the fatal gas explosion which killed a couple and destroyed 33 homes in Richmond Hill, including her own . Three Indianapolis residents accused of . causing a gas explosion, which killed a couple and destroyed 33 homes, in . order to fraudulently receive insurance money were held in jail today and could face the death penalty. Monserrate Shirley, her boyfriend Mark . Leonard, and his brother, Bob Leonard, were held without bond following a . short court hearing, Abcnews.com reported. The trio stand accused of causing a . raging blaze which not only led to irreparable damage of Shirley's home and . 32 others in Richmond Hill but also killed a husband and wife. They deny the charges and pleaded not-guilty yesterday. Shirley's neighbours, second-grade . teacher Jennifer Longworth, 36, and her husband John Dion Longworth, 34, . an electronics expert, were killed on November 10. Shirley and the Leonard brothers stand accused of their murder, arson and other counts following the incident. Yesterday a Marion County judge entered not guilty pleas for all three as relatives of the Longworths and owners of the damaged properties watched in court. John Dion Longworth's aunt, Pam Mosser, a psychiatric nurse, said: ""Dion and Jennifer died suffering and screaming"". Court documents claim 47-year-old Shirley was heavily in debt owing $63,000 on credit cards and in bankruptcy proceedings, while her 43-year-old boyfriend is said to have lost thousands in a casino trip three weeks before the blast. Accused: Mark Leonard, 43, Monserrate Shirley , 47, and his brother, Bob Leonard, 54, are on trial following the explosion. They pleaded not-guilty today and were held in jail without bond . Mark Leonard told the judge he . couldn't pay for an attorney because all his cash was inside Shirley's . house when it blew up, leaving him with about $500 in a checking . account. The home's original loan was for $116,000 and a second mortgage was taken out on the home for $65,000, the affidavit says. The judge appointed public defenders for the Leonards. Those attorneys did not return phone calls seeking comment. Randall Cable, Shirley's attorney, declined comment when reached by phone after the hearing. 'All my money, all of it, it's gone,' he said. 'I had money in the house and it's not there anymore.' The three accused face two counts of murder as well as 33 counts of arson - one for each of the homes authorities now say are so damaged they must be demolished. Shirley and Mark Leonard also face two counts of conspiracy to commit arson and Bob Leonard, 54, faces one conspiracy count. These relate to an attempted blast prosecutors claim they tried to carry out a weekend before. Destroyed: Those who lost their homes in the Richmond Hill blast were in court yesterday to watch the three accused plead not-guilty . Abcnews today reported prosecutor Terry Curry will consider seeking the death penalty in the trial which is scheduled for March 4. He will argue that the suspects removed a gas fireplace valve and a gas line regulator to fill Monserrate's house with gas. It is alleged that they then used a microwave, set to start on a timer, to spark the explosion. - John Dion Longworth's aunt, Pam . Mosser . John Dion Longworth's aunt, Pam .

He may be a Californian surfer who throws around the word 'dude' and goes to work in a t-shirt - but Nicholas Woodman has not been taking it easy. The 36-year-old is the mastermind behind GoPro - a wearable camera used by athletes to capture ski slopes or massive waves - and, as a result, the world's newest billionaire. Technology manufacturing company Foxconn bought 8.88 per cent of his company for $200 million last week. He is the . majority owner so even if he owns the minimum of 51 per cent of the company, Woodman is worth at least $1.15 billion. Scroll down for video . Billion-dollar idea: Nick Woodman, pictured, is the founder of GoPro cameras which capture action shots . The firm has sold more than 800,000 . cameras and expanded by a staggering 300 per cent last year, largely . thanks to its fans who posted a new GoPro video to YouTube every . minute. The cameras, which can be fixed to helmets, the body, equipment or a hand-held pole, are used by athletes conquering 6ft waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps. 'People use GoPros to capture the experiences they are passionate about,' Woodman told Inc. But his road to success has not come without its bumps and detours. After he graduated from UC San Diego with a visual arts degree, Woodman shuddered at the idea of working for someone else and gave himself until he was 30 to become a successful entrepreneur. Sports lover: Woodman, 36, came up with the idea while surfing in Australia and Indonesia . Successful team: Woodman, speaking at a conference in October, has now sold 9% of the firm for $200m . Loving his work: Woodman, who now has around 300 employess, is pictured using a GoPro camera . Nick Woodman is the founder and CEO of GoPro, a camera which can be fixed to helmets, the body, equipment or a hand-held pole. They are used by professionals and hobbyists conquering 6ft waves, treacherous ski slopes, scrappy dirt track races and bungee jumps. The cameras have also been used to film inside of the mouths of alligators, sharks and polar bears - and Woodman's wife giving birth to one of their sons. They are WiFi capable, typically come with remotes for control and have a capacity of 64GB currently. They are also versatile thanks to numerous add-ons, including LCD screens, and the most expensive model is $400. He started a marketing company called . funBag in the early 2000s and raised outside capital, but it struggled . to reach the potential he had predicted and the company died. At age 26, he was back to square one. With the clock ticking, he decided to seek inspiration for a new company by spending time on his favourite hobby, surfing. He toured Australia and Indonesia for five months and took a 35mm camera to strap to his . wrist, intending to capture his best surfing tricks. But the camera was awkward to work with, often falling off during the middle of a wave or hitting him in the face. He started thinking about a strong, . adjustable band that could secure a camera to a person's body . as they surfed, Business Insider reported. To fund the project, Woodman and his . now-wife Jill bought 600 sea shell belts from a market in Bali for $1.90 each. On returning to the U.S., they drove . along the California coast selling them for $60 each. Product: The GoPro camera sells for around $300, with the most expensive model reaching $400 . Getting to grips: It can be attached to equipment to film professionals or enthusiasts in action . With the money they raised and a $35,000 loan from . his mother, Woodman created the first GoPro camera straps and developed the idea for two years. While spending time on another hobby - race car driving - he realised he could mount his GoPro to capture the route - and that his new product 'could be the . world's most versatile camera'. In 2004, GoPro had its first big boost when . a Japanese company ordered 100 cameras at sports tradeshow. The cameras now retail for around $300. Woodman now maintains that you get your best ideas while spending time on the things you love. 'Things happen when you are . pursuing your passion,' he said. In action: YouTube is now awash with thousands of videos of people conquering waves and ski slopes . Sky high: The cameras can be attached to helmets, equipment or carried on a hand-held pole . He also believes that his good team is key to his success, and at first he only hired people he knew from college, school or his travels. He now employes more than 300 people and 'we are now a really fun, all-inviting, . loving brand'. And he is always finding new inventive ways of using the cameras. Now a father of two boys, Duke and Hugo, Woodman used footage of Hugo's birth at a conference in October.","Nick Woodman sold 8.88 per cent of GoPro to Taiwanese manufacturing company for $200 million, making him worth at least $1.15 billion .

Christians from the world over packed Manger Square in Bethlehem Monday to celebrate the birth of Jesus in the ancient West Bank town where he was born. For their Palestinian hosts, this holiday season was an especially joyous one, with the hardships of the Israeli occupation that so often clouded previous celebrations eased by the United Nations' recent recognition of an independent state of Palestine. In his annual pre-Christmas homily, the top Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal, said the road to actual freedom was still long, but this year's festivities were doubly joyful, celebrating 'the birth of Christ our Lord and the birth of the state of Palestine.'

'The path (to statehood) remains long, and will require a united effort,' added Twal, a Palestinian citizen of Jordan, at the patriarchate's headquarters in Jerusalem's Old City. Then he set off in a procession for the West Bank city of Bethlehem, Jesus' traditional birthplace. There, he was reminded that life on the ground for Palestinians has not changed since the U.N. recognized their state last month in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. Twal had to enter the biblical town through a massive metal gate in the barrier of towering concrete slabs Israel built between Jerusalem and Bethlehem during a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in the last decade. The Israeli military, which controls the crossing, said it significantly eased restrictions for the Christmas season. Israel, backed by the United States, opposed the statehood bid, saying it was a Palestinian ploy to bypass negotiations. Talks stalled four years ago. Hundreds of people greeted Twal in Manger Square, outside the Church of Nativity. The mood was festive under sunny skies, with children dressed in holiday finery or in Santa costumes, and marching bands playing in the streets. After nightfall, a packed Manger Square, resplendent with strings of lights, decorations and a 17-meter (55-foot) Christmas tree, took on a festival atmosphere.

Fuad Twal, head of the Roman Catholic Church in the Palestinian territories, waves to worshipers upon his arrival at the Church of the Nativity . A choral group from the Baptist Church in Jerusalem performed carols on one side of the square, handing out sheets of lyrics and encouraging others to sing along with songs such as 'We Wish You A Merry Christmas.' Festivities led up to the Midnight Mass at St. Catherine's Church, next to the fourth-century Church of the Nativity, built over the grotto where tradition says Jesus was born. Devout Christians said it was a moving experience to be so close to the origins of their faith. 'It's a special feeling to be here, it's an encounter with my soul and God,' said Joanne Kurczewska, a professor at Warsaw University in Poland, who was visiting Bethlehem for a second time at Christmas.

Audra Kasparian, 45, from Salt Lake City, Utah, called her visit to Bethlehem 'a life event to cherish forever. It is one of those events that is great to be a part of.' Christmas is the high point of the year in Bethlehem, which, like the rest of the West Bank, is struggling to recover from the economic hard times that followed the violent Palestinian uprising against Israel that broke out in late 2000. Tourists and pilgrims who were scared away by the fighting have been returning in larger numbers. Last year's Christmas Eve celebration produced the highest turnout in more than a decade, with some 100,000 visitors, including foreign workers and Arab Christians from Israel.

The Israeli Tourism Ministry predicted a 25 percent drop from that level this year, following last month's clash between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, which put a chill on tourist arrivals. Foreign tourists heading to Bethlehem must pass through Israel or the Israel-controlled border crossing into the West Bank from Jordan. Outside the town's quaint Manger Square, Bethlehem is a drab, sprawling town with a dwindling Christian base. Overall, there are only about 50,000 Christians in the West Bank, less than 3 percent of the population, the result of a lower birthrate and increased emigration. Bethlehem's Christians make up only a third of the town's residents, down from 75 percent a few decades ago. Clergymen take part in the Christmas celebrations outside the Church of the Nativity . Catholic clergy make their way out of the Church of the Nativity during the day of celebration . Elias Joha, a 44-year-old Christian who runs a souvenir store, said even with the U.N. recognition, this year's celebrations were sad for him. He said most of his family has left, and that if he had the opportunity, he would do the same. 'These celebrations are not even for Christians because there are no Christians. It is going from bad to worse from all sides ... we are not enjoying Christmas as before.' Located on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem, Bethlehem has the highest unemployment in the West Bank, but the tourist boom of Christmas offered a brief reprieve. Officials say all 34 hotels in the town are fully booked for the Christmas season, including 13 new ones built this year. A boy looks up at a Christmas tree during Christmas celebrations outside the Church of the Nativity . Israel turned Bethlehem over to Palestinian civil control a few days before Christmas in 1995, and since then, residents have been celebrating the holiday regardless of their religion. Many Muslims took part in celebration Monday as well. Christians across the region marked the holiday. In Iraq, Christians gathered for services with tight security, including at Baghdad's Our Lady of Salvation church, the scene of a brutal October 2010 attack that killed more than 50 worshippers and wounded scores more. Earlier this month, Cardinal Leonardo Sandri, who is responsible for the Vatican's outreach to the Middle East's Catholic communities, traveled to Iraq and presided over a Mass to rededicate the church following renovations. In his homily, he remembered those who were killed and expressed hope that 'the tears shed in this sacred place become the good seed of communion and witness and bear much fruit,' according to an account by Vatican Radio. The exact number of Christians remaining in Iraq is not known, but it has fallen sharply from as many as 1.4 million before the U.S.-led invasion nearly a decade ago to about 400,000 to 600,000, according community leaders cited by the US State Department.

The egg is a billion-to-one find, according to Forklift driver Mark Cameron, who shelled out just 21p for the amazing foodstuff. The 45-year-old discovered it in a box of six eggs from a Morrisons store in Thamesmead, south London, as he started to prepare himself an omelette. Poor chicken: Forklift truck driver Mark found a perfectly round egg in his Morrisons carton. He raised £91 by selling it on eBay . Cracking find: Mark's research uncovered just two other perfectly circular eggs . Intrigued, he did a little research and found that just two have been found in the UK in recent years, despite Brits consuming 11billion eggs every year. So instead of cracking it for a meal he decided to put it on eBay to see how much it would fetch. To his astonishment, the egg racked up 38 bids over five days. It was eventually sold for £91. The egg cannot be eaten as it is know passed its sell-by-date, but that didn't deter bidders on eBay . The eBay listing read: 'Rare Unique Item, Round Chicken Egg 100 per cent real with Lion time and date stamp. 'Only One in a Billion chance of finding such an egg.

One in ten pensioners in Britain has sold or downsized their home to help make ends meet, according to research. Cash-strapped Britons are reassessing their retirement plans because of the state of the economy, according to a survey of 1,000 adults in 12 European countries, which found that more people in this country are planning to use their property to fund their pension than in most other European nations. They are also reconsidering the age at which they will stop working, with an average delay of five years. Fears: A total of ten per cent of pensioners say they have sold or downsized their home because of money worries . The average age at which people planned to retire before 2007 was 60, but this has gone up to 65, the research found. In comparison, French people have increased their estimated retirement age from 60 to 62, while workers in Turkey still believe they can stop work at 55. The survey, commissioned by finance firm ING Direct, found that more than a third of Britons planned to use their property to fund their retirement, compared with less than a quarter on the continent. ING Direct chief executive Richard Doe said: ‘As a nation of homeowners and with property often the largest asset Brits have, it’s not surprising that many people are considering downsizing as a way to fund their retirement. Elderly people are being forced to drastically reassess their retirement plans (file picture) ‘Even though people’s retirement plans have been affected by economic factors over recent years, they’re often delaying in order to build up their savings to give themselves a more stable retirement.’ Just last week the head of the Civil Service said that people were ‘deluding’ themselves if they thought they could enjoy a comfortable retirement without living more frugally and working longer. Sir Bob Kerslake said he believed  ministers had failed to have an ‘honest debate’ with the public about the issue. He told a Lords committee that it was ‘absolutely clear’ that the pension age would have to rise, but that the public had not ‘faced up’ to this. He added that people needed to come to terms with the fact that they would have to make do with poorer circumstances in retirement than current pensioners. Currently, men can get their state pension at 65 and women must wait until they reach 61 and three months. However, the pension eligibility ages are rising constantly. By 2020, state pension ages for both sexes will have reached 66, rising again to 67 by 2028. They will continue to go up, with rises likely to be linked to increasing life expectancy. Nearly a million pensioners are working in Britain, the largest number since records began. Over the past year, the army of so-called ‘grey workers’ has increased by 100,000 – or 270 a day. Nearly 10 per cent of people who are 65 and over have a job.","Staggering amount of people forced to sell their property to make ends meet .

A conman who racked up a £2,400 bill at a luxury hotel by posing as a professional rugby player was caught out because staff thought he was too fat to be a top sportsman, a court heard. Christopher Hoare, 30, registered at top Kent hotel Eastwell Manor under a fake name in October. He gave receptionists a fraudulent credit card number and claimed a fictional body called Sports England Training was picking up the tab. Christopher Hoare racked up a £2,400 bill during a six-night stay at the Eastwell Manor hotel in Kent before he was caught by police . But the hotel manager became suspicious when he wore the same outfit for several days running and noted his overweight appearance, Canterbury Crown Court heard. He called Natwest bank who advised the hotel to call police. Hoare, a gambling addict, was arrested by Kent Police and admitted false representation and theft. He was on the run after committing a string of offences from Cardiff to Manchester. Tom Dunn, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Hoare had been wearing the same clothes for a few days and appeared, . putting it neutrally, not to have the physique and healthy appearance . that one might associate with a professional rugby player. 'That, combined with the general attitude, made the hotel manager not quite believe him.' Hoare had boasted to the hotel owner how he was a rugby player on transfer from Cardiff Blues to London Wasps during his six-night stay at the four-star hotel in Ashford, Kent, which charges up to £445 a night. The court heard on April 13 Hoare stole a man’s phone and used his identity to take out a £150 payday loan. Three . days later, he tricked a woman on Facebook into taking out a £250 . payday loan by pretending he ran a mystery shopper scheme. Hoare was spared an immediate prison sentence by a judge at Canterbury Crown Court after he admitted false representation, theft, criminal damage and harassment . He tricked another man using a similar scheme on May 3 - this time through the classified advertising site Gumtree. After . Hoare split with partner Leanne Cooke in September he stole her laptop, . smashed her money jar, slashed her bras and tops in two and sent her . text messages threatening: “I promise I will make headlines with my . antics.” Hoare then used her details to stay four nights at Manchester's Chancellors Hotel before turning up at Eastwell Manor. Handing Hoare a suspended jail sentence, Judge James O’Mahony told him: 'You have behaved as a complete conman.

'You clearly have a serious problem with gambling that means you were driven to commit offences. 'If you had only used the intelligence and ingenuity you obviously have, things might have improved.' He added: 'If you don’t do what you are told, back here you come.' Hoare, . of no fixed address, admitted five charges of false representation, two . of theft, one of criminal damage and one of harassment. He was handed a year’s jail - suspended for two years - a year’s supervision order and 150 hours of unpaid work. John .

Couple: American Daniel Whiteley (left) graduated with a degree in astrophysics from St Andrews University this summer and married management graduate Jenny (right) in October . A couple who met at one of Britain’s most prestigious universities and married two months ago are set to be forced out of Scotland by tough new immigration laws. American Daniel Whiteley graduated with a degree in astrophysics from St Andrews University this summer and married management graduate Jenny in October. His student visa expired the same month. But despite marrying a Scottish woman and contributing at least £91,000 to the Scottish economy, Mr Whiteley, 23, is likely to be barred from living in the UK. The couple, who want to settle in or around the Fife town, say they have little option but to move to the United States. Mr Whiteley, of York, Pennsylvania, said he had been ‘insulted’ to learn that he was not wanted by the UK. The previous rules would have allowed him to live north of the Border simply because he was married to a UK national. The new system, which is intended to reduce immigration, requires UK citizens to have a minimum income of £18,600 before they can bring a spouse from outside the EU to live here. After graduating the couple left Scotland to travel and married in Wolseley, South Africa. They will return home on January 16 but it is likely Mr Whiteley will be refused entry. He said: ‘I feel that, based on my behaviour while I was in the UK, what is happening to my wife and I is a great injustice. Seat of yearning: The couple married after graduating from St Andrews University in Scotland (file picture) ‘We both contributed so much to the UK economy while at university and I cannot understand why we are the type of people the UK wants to get rid of.’ Mr Whitely added: ‘During our four years in the UK we each spent £16,000 on accommodation, each paid £5,000 in taxes and National Insurance and I spent £70,000 to attend university. 'I feel that, based on my behaviour while I was in the UK, what is happening to my wife and I is a great injustice' Daniel Whiteley . 'How a couple who has given £112,000 to the UK economy before the age of 23 can be excluded based on financial grounds is beyond me. ‘I called the UK my home and was looking forward to returning in January to start a life and business.’ Mrs Whiteley, also 23, of Livingston, West Lothian, said: ‘It is extremely distressing to not be able to return home to live where we once lived. ‘We are choosing to move to America together, where I can enter, stay and work on a specific visa while a green card is approved. The new laws make me extremely angry.’ She said it was unfair to penalise newly married couples because they do not have large savings or highly paid jobs. She added: ‘We did not marry for convenience, a visa or to abuse the UK benefits – we simply married for love.’ 'We did not marry for convenience, a visa or to abuse the UK benefits – we simply married for love' Jenny Whiteley . The couple only realised they were facing a ban from entering the UK after visiting the British High Commission in Lusaka, Zambia, during their travels. Mr Whiteley said: ‘Everyone we have spoken to in immigration refuses to help us because we don’t “live” in the UK, but neither will the Lusaka embassy because we don’t live here either. ‘We do intend to fly back to the UK on January 16, hoping we can talk to a real human at immigration in Glasgow and deal with the issue there.’ If Mr Whiteley is refused permission to live in the UK he will have to obtain a 30-day tourist visa. If that happens, he said: ‘We will spend the next month getting Jenny a visa to America and packing up our things.’ No one was available for comment last night from the Home Office.","American Daniel Whiteley graduated from St Andrews University in summer .

The children of a US veteran who died from gastric bypass surgery which went horribly wrong could be denied a payout of nearly $1m because the Government believes he was abusive and set a bad example to them. Father-of-three Warren Jupiter, from New York, died after developing a gastric leak which went undetected for months following the surgery at the Manhattan VA Hospital. Last week the federal government was ordered to pay $5m to his widow and an additional $900,000, which was to be split among his three grown-up children. The government is now reportedly considering appealing the $900,000 payout because he called his son a 'homo', refused to pay for his Bar Mitzvah and made obscene gestures when he felt they were ignoring him. On Thursday Brooklyn Federal Judge Leo Glasser ruled it was 'inexplicable and inexcusable' doctors failed to detect the leak in the 35 stone cab driver because did not think he would fit inside a CT scan chamber. But according to the New York Daily News, court papers filed after the 2010 trial saw government lawyers argue his children should not receive any money for damages as he was abusive and irresponsible. They also argued his bizarre behaviour set a bad example to his children. The children have claimed they had a close relationship with Mr Jupiter, but the government has said his odd behaviour included upsetting his daughter by urinating in the back yard when he was unable to use the bathroom. The court papers also say he laughed when leaving human waste on the walls and floor of the bathroom and eventually moved out of the apartment in Manhattan because his wife said he unhyienic. The government's lawyers argued: 'Mr. Jupiter offered no meaningful support or guidance to his children at any age, and could not have been expected to provide guidance to his now adult children in the future.' A Brooklyn US Attorny's office spokesman has said the ruling was being reviewed. Mr Jupiter was admitted to the government-run Manhattan VA Hospital in April 2003 when it became apparent his huge bulk was a threat to his life. The 2010 court hearing heard how when he failed to recover, his family had to watched as he wasted away before his death at a nursing home in the Bronx two years later. His daughter Hannah, 21 at the time, told the hearing: ‘There were times I would visit him... his air bed was deflated and he was sunken in and couldn't move’. New York Daily News website .

However, when the scientists fired up their boiler's primary burner for the first time its controller circuit failed. A secondary burner was fitted and the team worked around the clock to shovel snow to feed the hot-water drill, and in four days they had melted enough to begin drilling the borehole to the cavity.

The 12 scientists, from the British Antarctic Survey, are now in a race against time to complete the mission before the borehole reseals as they only have enough fuel for one attempt . But then, on Saturday afternoon, this secondary burner failed leaving the BAS team with nothing to do but wait for a replacement part as their bore hole - and equipment - slowly begins to freeze shut. 'We are now committed, having gone past the point of no return,' expedition leader Chris Hill told the Independent.

The £7million project to drill beneath two miles of Antarctic ice in search of undiscovered life hangs in the balance - after a major equipment failure. The BAS reports that the replacement components will be with the deep field team in a few days time. They will work with the manufacturers to make sure they install them properly. But if the replacement parts malfunction malfunction again the team will have no option other than to by pass the circuitry and manually 'drive' the burner - an operation that will require skill and a light touch. The Lake Ellsworth drill site on the West Antarctic ice sheet: Four British scientists arrived at the site yesterday to finalise preparations for drilling down to a lake locked beneath nearly 10,000ft of ice .

A key patent that Apple used to extract more than a billion dollars in damages from smartphone rival Samsung is under threat after U.S. authorities rejected its claims. Apple scored a sweeping legal victory over its South Korean competitor in August when a jury found Samsung had copied critical features of the iPhone and iPad. The jury had ruled that Samsung had infringed six of seven Apple patents and the Silicon Valley firm was awarded a mammoth $1.05billion (£645billion) in damages. Pinch to zoom: The iPhone was one of the first touchscreen gadgets to have the feature - but the USPTO has ruled Apple's patent on the invention is invalid . But the USPTO yesterday rejected all 21 claims of U.S. patent no. 7,844,915 - known as the 'pinch-to-zoom' patent - after looking at it again. The 'pinch-to-zoom' feature, which was among the intellectual property contested at the trial, allows users to zoom in or out by moving two fingers apart or closer together while touching the display. Samsung's lawyers pointed the rejection out in a filing to U.S. District Court Judge Lucy Koh yesterday afternoon, Cnet reported, noting it was 'relevant' to the company's attempts to force a retrial. The Galaxy SIII: Samsung's flagship phone also uses the feature, which was one of the claims cited in Apple's $1bn lawsuit against their competitor . Apple has also attempted to get an injunction against a number of Samsung's products for infringing the 'pinch to zoom' patent. Samsung and Apple, the world's top two smartphone makers, are locked in patent disputes in at least 10 countries as they vie to dominate the lucrative mobile market and win over customers with their latest gadgets. Samsung won a preliminary invalidation of Apple's 'rubber-banding' patent in October that had the 'bounce' feature. The patent is for a feature which allows users with touchscreens to bounce back to the image on the screen if they attempt to scroll beyond the edge. The ruling by the U.S. patent office after Samsung requested an examination of the patent was included in documents filed by Samsung in a federal court in San Jose, California. Apple's claims were rejected on the grounds that prior patents, including one from the U.S. and one from Japan, already covered the inventions. When the U.S. patent office rules against a patent, the full process involves multiple steps and can take years. It can also often be appealed in court, further tying up the process. Representatives for Apple and Samsung were not immediately available for comment. A Dutch court ruled in October that Samsung did not infringe on Apple's patent by using certain multi-touch techniques on some of the Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablet computers. Apple's shares have taken a beating recently, with investors worried about rising competition from Samsung and other mobile device makers using Google Inc's Android platform.","'Pinch to zoom' was one of six Apple patents a jury ruled that Samsung had infringed after August trial .

A camper was left with horrific injuries after a cauldron of boiling baked beans was blown on top of her by a strong wind during a family trip. Mother-of-one Sarah Conner was forced to spend three weeks in a specialist burns centre and endured  four skin graftss, after the fiery mixture of boiling water and scalding baker beans landed on her. Sarah, of Anna, in Texas, has now described how she could see her skin 'peeling away' as her clothes were removed after the 'lava-like mixture' covered her legs, arms, back, side and buttocks, searing her skin in an instant. Smiling again: Sarah is now able to enjoy life again after recovering from the horrific burns . On the road to recovery: Sarah with a 'get well soon' card from her nephews . The accident left the 35-year-old former gymnastics coach, who had just started a teaching course at the time of the accident, in the Parkland Memorial Hospital's Burn Centre, in Dallas, for three weeks. She then spent another six weeks being cared for by family before she was well enough to return home. But she said the harrowing experience has changed her life for the better, encouraging her to return to gymnastics and putting her on the path to a new career in radiology. She said: 'As much as the scars affect me, I couldn't imagine not having them now. 'The limitations in my mobility and the scarring I've suffered have made me a survivor whereas before I was just living. 'Before, I was going to school and I was just living my life but the accident has made me look at life so differently. Healing process: The mother-of-one now posts pictures of her scars online to help other burns' victims . 'Everything can be taken away from you and your entire existence can change in the matter of a couple of seconds. 'Everything I do now needs to have meaning and I'm focused on changing other people's lives for the better.' Sarah had been celebrating Labor Day weekend in September last year with her boyfriend Randy Dinsmore, 39, who has two sons from a previous relationship, with family and friends at Lake Texoma, on the Red River between Oklahoma and Texas. Operation: The 35-year-old was left with serious injuries and needed four skin grafts following the nightmare accident . She had been excitedly telling her . companions about her new teaching course when a gust of wind blew over . their campsite, knocking over the pot of baked beans on to Ms Conner. She said: 'Randy's sister, Debbie, has first aid training and straightaway she was telling everyone to get my clothes off me. 'They stripped me completely naked and as they were removing my clothes I could see my skin was coming off with them. 'I looked down and there was just nothing there - just blood and black, burnt flesh. 'When they took my shorts off, my skin literally came off with them in front of my eyes, it was like watching a horror film. 'That's when I started to realise that it was bad and that I was hurt. 'The . pain started to kick in and it was like nothing I had ever experienced, . it was a throbbing, stinging, pulsing kind of pain that was relentless . and always intensifying.' To add to her horror, Sarah realised the commotion had attracted a crowd of onlookers so she managed to scramble, naked, into a near RV. She was then wrapped in sheets doused in ice water and crouched in the back of an SUV as it raced to Texoma Medical Centre. After doctors took a look at the burns she was airlifted to the burns specialist in Dallas where for the next four days she suffered horrendous nightmares that her family had been told she had already died and she was being tortured in secret and subjected to painful experiments. When she awoke four days later, she saw the face of her sister Rachel, 31, by her bedside. She said: 'As soon as I saw her, I knew it was real. But the next thing I thought was that if it was real, I could survive it. 'I could get out of there and I was going to be okay.' Burns: Sarah's skin was badly hurt by the boiling food which landed on her arms, legs, back, side and buttocks . Healed: But she has since recovered and her experience has taken her on to a different course in life . After three weeks in the burns unit, Sarah was put in the care of her mother Nadine, 53, at her home in Kansas while Randy returned home to look after her daughter, Carlene-Marie, 20, and his sons, Joe, 17, and Nick, 18. She was unable to dress or wash herself and needed 24-hour care. Sarah also needed daily massages and physiotherapy to help heal the sites of her skin grafts and regain the mobility in her tightened skin. Over time, Sarah regained her mobility and even took up her former passion of gymnastics coaching again as it helped her flexibility.While she was recovering, she also reassessed her path in life and decided teaching was not for her. Instead, she enrolled on a course to study radiology in the hopes of working alongside medical professionals like the ones that got her back on her feet. Sarah is also determined to reach out to other burns survivors via social media in the hope that they can take some inspiration and encouragement from her journey of recovery. She said: 'I posted some pictures of my injuries on Facebook and the reaction I got from other people who had suffered burns was incredible. 'Many people said that if I was brave enough to show my scars then they didn't feel so bad about showing their own. 'They are intimate pictures - not just my legs or my arms - and they are personal to me. 'But knowing they have inspired other survivors of burn injuries has given me the confidence to show them to the world.'","Sarah Conner left with injuries after vat of baked beans was blown on to her .

The period drama recorded its lowest ever viewing figure and was watched by almost a million fewer people than last year’s Christmas special, managing only 7.3million. Unforeseen: Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and his wife Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) and their baby in TV drama Downton Abbey. Matthew had just left the maternity hospital when he was killed in a car crash . Sleep-fest: Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens, made a dramatic exit from Downton Abbey but failed to attract viewers . Competition: Jo Joyner (left) in EastEnders and Miranda Hart in Call the Midwife (right) also featured in programmes on Christmas Day . It was soundly beaten by EastEnders, which was shown at the same time and attracted 9.4million viewers. Downton was also trounced by Coronation Street, Strictly Come Dancing, The Royle Family, and Doctor Who. It pulled in the same number of viewers as rival BBC1 drama Call the Midwife, whose viewing figures were also a record low. This year’s Christmas Day ratings were a triumph for low-budget soap operas. Brothers Grimm: Derek Branning's death helped EastEnders become the most watched TV programme on Christmas Day . You old smoothie: Max Branning and his usual shenanigans ensured that EastEnders had 9.37million viewers . Better luck next year: Coronation Street were very close but ended in second place . Downton costs around £1million an episode to make, compared to soaps such as EastEnders, which cost around £200,000. The Christmas ratings battle was . dominated by the BBC, which drew in almost a third of the peak-time . viewers, compared to a quarter who watched ITV. The corporation had . seven of the top ten programmes. However it is believed that many more . viewers recorded Downton Abbey, preferring to watch it after it had been . broadcast to avoid the frequent advert breaks. ITV has previously been . criticised for broadcasting one minute of commercials for every three . minutes of the programme. Family ties: Jim and Barbara Royle reunited for their Christmas special and managed to finish in fourth place . Christmas sickness: Call The Midwife failed to live up to expectation and only drew in 7.2million viewers . Despite the dramatic storyline – which . included the death of Dan Stevens’s character Matthew Crawley after . becoming a father – fans said the two-hour episode was too long. Others said the decision to broadcast it from 8.45pm made it too late for many families. It is the lowest ever viewing figure for the programme, which has performed well on Sunday evenings. The previous lowest was the third . episode of series one in 2010, which got 8.9million viewers. The . highest-rating episode was the finale of series two which recorded . 12.4million. One fan wrote on Twitter: ‘As much as I . love Downton Abbey I really can’t be bothered with two hours of it.’ Another, LennyBow, wrote: ‘I looked forward to the Downton Abbey .

Callous thieves ransacked a hospital grotto and stole presents that had been donated by top footballers for sick children. The raiders tore down decorations the seriously ill youngsters had made by hand for the playroom at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire's Children's Centre. Thieves took around £1,000-worth of gifts, including Playstation, Xbox and Wii games and controllers in the overnight raid on Sunday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heart-warming: Stoke City players Kenwyne Jones and Michael Owen donated computer consoles to University Hospital of North Staffordshire to be used by children at like nine-year-old Joe Harrison from Madeley - but it was stolen .

Donations: All gifts stolen from Great Ormond Street have been replaced by an anonymous . supporter, yet further gifts, such as these from last night, keep arriving . The selfish crime follows the theft of 20 donated presents worth £2,000 from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. That burglary, described as a 'disgusting crime beyond belief', prompted a full replacement by an anonymous donor and an avalanche of offers of help. Last night, gifts came pouring in to Great Ormond Street from well-wishers, including the Duchess of York. Now children at UHNS, aged between six and 16, have been left unable to play on computer equipment donated to the 'Adolescent Room' by players at Stoke City FC and have seen the hard work they put into Christmas preparations go down the drain. Ex-England star Michael Owen, along with striker Cameron Jerome, donated the presents and played with the young patients when they took a tour of the hospital's children's ward. Shocked staff at the hospital today branded the thieves 'sick', and said the time and effort put into the Christmas preparations by sick children could never be recovered. Christmas crime: England manager Roy Hodgson and assistant coach Ray Lewington have a chat with children at Great Ormond Street Hospital yesterday, following the theft of £2,000-worth of presents .

Spreading festive cheer: Hodgson and football star Gary Neville sign a shirt for nurses during their visit to the shell-shocked hospital . Sister Julianne Wilkes said: 'To have someone steal all of the games and other equipment in the run up to Christmas is sickening. 'The games consoles were not taken as they are screwed into the secure unit, but they are worthless without any of the games and controllers. 'The theft is upsetting, but these items may be replaced by generous donations. 'What can't be replaced is the time and effort that our poorly children put in to make the playroom feel Christmassy. 'Although the centre is a locked down area, we haven't previously locked the playroom itself because we want the children to be able to come and go. 'This is something we might have to do in the future.' Lynette Barlow, deputy manager for the UHNS Charity, appealed for help to replace the stolen equipment. She said: 'I'm really saddened that this equipment has been stolen. 'You could see the smiles on the children's faces when they were playing the games against the Stoke City footballers.' The thefts come after a gang of yobs broke into a secure facility at Great Ormond Street Hospital and took presents intended for sick kids. London Police are combing through CCTV footage to identify the culprit, feared to be a member of staff at the Central London hospital. The gifts were in a room secured with a key-code lock which the thieves ransacked, even taking the giftbags the presents were to be given to the children in. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said he found it hard to imagine a worse crime. 'It's pretty disgusting really, isn't it? You can't imagine anything worse in a way: children who are very ill and at Christmas,' he told radio station LBC 97.3 yesterday. 'Somebody's taken the time to buy them something to cheer them up and somebody's stolen them. So it's pretty awful.'

Fears were growing last night for a building society executive who disappeared days after being sacked for making a ‘simple mistake’. Colin Morton, 52, was devastated to lose his job of ten years over the administrative error and was left feeling ashamed and depressed. He saw his GP on Christmas Eve but, shortly afterwards, he phoned his long-term girlfriend Liz Callighan and said he was on the cliffs and wanted to end his life. Less than an hour later, a man was seen wading into the sea at Whitley Bay, North Tyneside. Police believe Mr Morton may have gone to the beach after making the call and are trying to identify the man. Miss Callighan, 52, said her partner of 34 years was sacked as senior financial manager at the Newcastle Building  Society only five days before he went missing. He had been suspended since November 19 when it was discovered he had wrongly signed a form relating to work undertaken by a colleague. Miss Callighan, of Whitley Bay, said: ‘Up until five weeks ago, Colin was a very chatty, sociable, friendly person. He would talk to anybody. ‘But when he was dismissed, I saw a huge change in him. ‘He was absolutely devastated. His career was a huge part of his life. ‘I just love him and whatever happened there was always  a way we could have worked  it out.’ Mr Morton had worked for the building society for more than a decade and had hoped bosses would accept he made an innocent mistake. But at a disciplinary hearing last week, he was fired. He feared people would believe he was dishonest and became very depressed. The last known footage of Mr Morton shows him on a footbridge at Whitley Bay Metro Station . ‘He made a simple mistake,’ said Miss  Callighan. ‘It was a  split-second decision. I think his over-riding feeling was shame.’ She said his state of mind quickly deteriorated. ‘I was just constantly trying to calm . him down and, at times, he was fine, but then he would get himself all . worked up again,’ she said. ‘He just felt like he had lost everything he had worked for.

The Church of England has urged people not to feel bad about shopping online on Christmas Day, despite concerns about the increased commercialisation of Christmas. The statement, from CoE spokesman Steve Jenkins, comes after Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said that Christmas Day was a 'precious time' for families that was in danger of being overtaken by gadgets. But Mr Jenkins urged people not feel guilty about spending a little time shopping online as long as they make time to go to a church service and spend time with their loved ones on Christmas Day. He said: 'What really matters is that people make time to go to church, to have a family Christmas lunch, to open presents with their families - and maybe spend a bit of time online spending their new Christmas vouchers.' Balance: Church spokesman Steve Jenkins said people should not feel ashamed of shopping online as long as they spend time with family and at church over the festive period . 'Nothing is black and white in life and no-one is going to spend 24 hours shopping. 'This is a way for retailers to get the message out that they are open for business. 'People need variety in life.' Nearly 1.5million people are expected to log on today as firms start their online sales in what will be the busiest ever Christmas Day for shopping. Last-minute bargain hunters were . cashing in on internet sales yesterday as online retailers slashed their . prices earlier than the traditional Boxing Day sales. Lord Carey, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said that Christmas Day was a 'precious time' for families that should not be overrun by presents and gadgets .

Online giant Amazon will start its sale on Christmas morning, a day earlier than usual. High-street spending in the run-up to Christmas has been 'acceptable but not exceptional', the retail industry trade association said today. Spending over the final weekend before Christmas hit the predicted £5billion, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), but swathes of retailers still risk going under after the festive period. As more shoppers flock to the web rather than the shops to buy presents, high-street retailers face the threat of closure, business recovery group Begbies Traynor warned. Almost 140 firms were in a critical condition in the fourth quarter, meaning they are on the brink of collapse, while more than 13,700 were in 'significant' distress - up 35% during the three months to December 17, the Begbies Traynor report said. But the BRC's head of media and campaigns Richard Dodd said poor accessibility on high streets, a lack of parking and weak consumer demand were to blame rather than an increase in online shopping. But he acknowledged that some high-street retailers would 'undoubtedly' fail after Christmas. 'Retail sales over the weekend have been up to expectations but expectations were relatively modest,' said Mr Dodd. 'Christmas will turn out to be acceptable but not exceptional.' He went on: 'There are a lot of myths around online retail. Ten per cent of overall retailing over the year comes from online shopping and actually it presents lots of opportunities for the retail sector.

BBC chairman Lord Patten faced renewed calls to resign yesterday after he accused a parliamentary committee of ‘shabby’ treatment when it criticised ex-director-general George Entwistle’s bumper payoff. The Tory peer clashed with Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, over a report which attacked the ‘cavalier’ use of public money to give Mr Entwistle a ‘reward for failure’ after a mere 54 days in the job. Lord Patten accused MPs of ‘taking no notice’ of 12 pages of legal advice the BBC Trust had supplied – which he said showed it would have faced a bigger payout had they not agreed the deal. Defence: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has maintained that the package was a good deal for taxpayers . In a scattergun approach, he attacked MPs, the NHS and the Press, and said his hands were tied by the corporation’s lawyers. He suggested some newspapers, naming the Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph, were overly critical of the payout although he seemed finally to accept that Mr Entwistle was the ‘wrong man’. On Mr Entwistle’s appointment to the job of Director General, he added: ‘With the benefit of hindsight, we chose the wrong one. But we chose him from a very distinguished field. 'It was the unanimous choice of the whole of the BBC Trust.’ He defended the BBC’s approach to the Jimmy Savile scandal – saying it had acted more swiftly than the National Health Service in response to the revelations about the TV presenter’s sordid past. The NHS, which has received allegations from former patients at three trusts, has still to start formal inquiries into what went wrong. Miss Hodge said the BBC chairman should accept there might be ‘different views’ about his decision to rush through a generous deal with Mr Entwistle, adding: ‘He may not be right.’ She pointed out that there had been a . culture of generous settlements to former executives, including former . chief operating officer Caroline Thomson who received £670,000 earlier . this year after she was passed over for the director general’s job. ‘They just don’t get it,’ she said. Scandal: George Entwistle (left) was paid £450,000 to leave the BBC after 54 days in the job - which Public Accounts Committee chairman Margaret Hodge (right) says was an unacceptable (amount) Senior Labour backbencher Barry . Sheerman said he was shocked by Lord Patten’s comments, saying the . remarks ‘merits his resignation’. Last month Mr Entwistle was given a . full year’s salary – £450,000 – double what he was entitled, to ensure a . speedy resignation amid the crisis caused by Newsnight’s dropped Savile . investigation and the botched report which wrongfully linked Lord . McAlpine to the abuse of children. His deal also provided a year’s . private healthcare, fees for lawyers and even £10,000 to pay for Press . advice. The PAC said the deal was ‘out of line both with public . expectations and what is considered acceptable elsewhere in the public . sector’. MPs also criticised ‘excessive’ severance payments to ten other . senior managers, including Miss Thomson. On Radio 4’s Today programme, the BBC . chairman said: ‘You are not supposed to criticise the Public Accounts . Committee ... in politics it is sort of the equivalent of swearing in . church. The Public Accounts Committee - ‘I do think the treatment we have had from them is a bit shabby.’ NHS over Savile scandal - ‘It has to be said that the BBC has moved to tackle all this more rapidly than some of the other institutions in the country – hospitals and so on....’ Press speculation that Savile report was pulled to protect tribute programmes - ‘I was quite surprised by the fact that there was newspaper after newspaper making that allegation.’ Caroline Thomson’s £670,000 payoff - ‘She negotiated her departure with the executive. It is not an issue which the trust has the responsibility of dealing with.’ Agreeing Entwistle payoff - ‘The legal advice we had was that if we fought it we would fetch up with a bigger bill.’ ‘But I do think the treatment we have . had from them is a bit shabby. I do not think they have been fair . because they did not look at our legal arguments at all.’ In a question to Commons Leader . Andrew Lansley, Mr Sheerman said Lord Patten’s accusation of ‘shabby’ treatment ‘merits his resignation’. Lord Patten said legal advice pointed . out if the BBC Trust had not made the settlement to Mr Entwistle ‘there . and then’ it would have probably ended up having to pay out for . constructive and unfair dismissal claims. He said he knew and liked Miss . Hodge, ‘but I don’t think this is a fair way of treating us’. Miss Hodge told the Daily Mail . yesterday that her committee ‘did give them a fair hearing’ and said the . BBC Trust ‘called it wrong’ by not letting the National Audit Office . look at the deal. ‘I think they don’t understand that . the public really do get irate when they see their licence fee being . used on such big handouts which are rewards for failure.’ The MP said she did still not . understand the whole package of Mr Entwistle’s deal and did not know if . his pension was based on what he was earning for the 54 days as BBC . chief. She said the committee was ‘gobsmacked’ and ‘astounded’ when it . was revealed what was in his exit package. Lord Patten said the BBC has taken . legal advice on whether it can recoup some of the £450,000 payoff given . to Mr Entwistle, but was not hopeful.

They may be more accustomed to patrolling the beat, but one police force has shown that it doesn’t have the X Factor when it comes to trying to sing along in time to it. Facebook users have slammed Bedfordshire Police’s ‘tragic’ cover version of Slade’s 1973 anthem Merry Christmas Everybody – the not very catchily named ‘Christmas Crime Reduction’. The force had hoped that the song would offer residents winter crime advice but it is unlikely to trouble the frontrunners for the number one spot over the festive period. Although it didn't cost the Beds Police anything to produce, some residents have taken to Facebook and Twitter to question whether putting the song together was an appropriate use of employees time. Scroll down for audio . Rip off: Bedfordshire Police has attempted to spread its seasonal crime prevention message by re-writing festive anthem Merry Christmas Everybody by Slade, pictured performing in 1973 . Communications staff at the force came up with the novel idea as part of its focus on driving down burglary. Instead of using the song's traditional lyrics, the team penned a version of their own. Their version of the song includes such lines as: ‘It’s a time when every burglar has a ball, have you locked the upstairs window? 'Are the keys left by the door? Have you turned the lights on so that they’re not sure?’ In place of the famous refrain 'What would you do if you saw your mother kissing Santa Claus?' is a cringeworthy plug for the force's crime prevention website. And instead of Noddy Holder's rasping vocals, police project analyst Jacqueline Cooper took to the microphone. And not everyone was impressed with Beds Police's songwriting skills. It's a no from me: Facebook user Sean McNally did his best Simon Cowell impression to pan the Beds Police Christmas crime reduction song . Unimpressed: Although Facebook user Adam Croft thought that the idea was good, he said the lack of money used for producing the song showed . Not a fan: Max Ogden questioned how much time the police force had spent on the song . Thumbs up: Not everyone disliked the Christmas tune. Emma Carter complimented Beds Police on their festive song . Sean McNally took to the force Facebook page to say: ‘Well all I'm gonna say is Simon Cowell would not be impressed at all.’ (sic) Paul Keating described the version as: 'Tragic'. Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?It's the time when every burglar has a ball,Have you locked the upstairs window?The key is by the door,Have you turned a light on so that they aren't sure?So here it is crime reduction,It's advice that you can use,Put off those burglars,Make sure they're the ones to loseHave you locked all the doors before you leave?Don't leave your presents on display for them to thieveHave you seen anything suspiciousThat you maybe should report?Get on the phone to us so they'll get caughtSo here it is crime reduction,It's advice that you can use,Put off those burglars,Make sure they're the ones to loseVisit our website for tips and advice and sign up to RingmasterAaaahaaaaaHave you marked up all your stuff with your postcode?Have you registered it on the Mobilise in case it goes?For a New Year's resolutionGo to a property marking eventThere'll be one near you to bring the gifts that you've been sentSo here it is crime reduction,It's advice that you can use,Put off those burglars,Make sure they're the ones to lose . Benjamin Ferdinand took to Twitter to claim that Beds Police had 'ruined Christmas, while Adam Croft added: 'I just died a little inside.' Max Ogden questioned how many hours of police staff time were used to produce the song. But the Christmas spirit wasn't lost on everyone. Emma Carter tweeted: 'Good song. Gets the message clearly across.' Andrea Briggs, E-Comms Manager at Bedfordshire Police said: 'The idea came around last year as we looked to promote crime prevention advice during the Christmas period. 'It is a bit of fun but the message behind it is very clear. 'We want people to have a very Merry Christmas without becoming the victims of crime. . 'The song isn’t available to buy as we want as many people as possible to hear it free of charge.' The song didn't cost the force as the recording session was donated for free. Bedfordshire Police isn't the only emergency service to find novelty ways of reducing crime and promoting community safety this winter. The county's fire service also decided to show off its lyrical skills by producing its own version of Rocking Around the Christmas Tree. The catchy tune's reworked words go: 'Rocking around the Christmas tree, don’t make the fire bells ring out! 'Test your smoke alarm every week, don’t take the batteries out.' Surrey Police were slated earlier this month for tweeting lyrics warning motorists that roads were slippy in the style of Vanilla Ice's 1990 hit 'Ice, Ice Baby'. Meanwhile, creative Canadian cops in Abbotsford, British Columbia, sent out a Christmas card to well know criminals asking whether they would be on Father Christmas's naughty or nice list next year. The card featured the local police chief dressed up as Santa and clutching an automatic weapon.

The Pope has pardoned his butler for stealing and leaking documents that alleged corruption in the Holy See. Pope Benedict made a surprise pre-Christmas visit to the jail holding Paolo Gabriele, before the butler was allowed to return to his family. The pope and former butler spent about 15 minutes together before Gabriele was freed and allowed to go home to his family in their Vatican apartment, a Vatican spokesman said. Gabriele, 46, was convicted of aggravated theft on October 6 in a case that shone unwelcome publicity on the Vatican and had been serving an 18-month sentence in a jail cell in the city state's police headquarters. Pope Benedict XVI talks with former butler Paolo Gabriele during a private audience at the Vatican, and pardons him . 'This was a paternal gesture towards a person with whom the pope shared his daily life for several years,' Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman, said. 'This is a happy ending in this Christmas season,' he said. Gabriele was arrested in May after Vatican police found many documents in his possession that had been stolen from the pope's office. The former butler gave them to the media in what mushroomed into an embarrassing scandal for Benedict's pontificate that became known as 'Vatileaks'. Gabriele told investigators he had leaked the documents because he saw 'evil and corruption everywhere in the Church' and that information was being hidden from the pope. Gabriele told the court that convicted him at the trial - one of the most sensational in the recent history of the Holy See - that he did not consider himself a thief and that he had done what he did out of 'visceral' love for the Church. The former butler (right) was found guilty of stealing and copying the Pope's documents and leaking them to an Italian journalist . In one of the most dramatic betrayals of trust in Vatican history, Gabriele, who served the pope his meals and helped him dress, photocopied sensitive documents under the nose of his immediate superiors in a small office adjacent to the papal living quarters in the Apostolic Palace. He then hid more than 1,000 copies and original documents, including some the pope had marked 'to be destroyed,' among many thousands of other papers and old newspaper clippings in a huge armoire in the family apartment inside the Vatican walls. A former member of the small, select group known as 'the papal family', Gabriele was one of fewer than 10 people who had a key to an elevator leading directly to the pope's apartments. He said during the trial that from his perch as papal butler he was able to see how easily a powerful man could be manipulated by aides and kept in the dark about things he should have known. In the course of the trial, intimate details emerged of the inner workings of an institution long renowned for its secrecy. The documents Gabriele leaked triggered one of the biggest crises of Pope Benedict's papacy when they emerged in a muckraking expose by an Italian journalist earlier this year. The case was all the more embarrassing for the Vatican because it came at a time when it was trying to limit the reputational fallout from a series of scandals involving sexual abuse of minors by clerics around the world as well as from mismanagement at its bank. The Vatican said the pope had also pardoned a second Vatican employee, Claudio Sciarpelletti, who was convicted in a separate trial of helping Gabriele and given a two month suspended sentence. Gabriele will no longer be able to work in the Vatican but will be helped to find a job and start a new life outside its walls together with his family, the Vatican said.","Pope Benedict pardoned Paolo Gabriele, who was allowed to return home to his family .

Understanding: This unnamed writer admits that have been 'somewhat bad' this year, so understands if Santa decides not to get them anything at all . Quick quick! This cheeky chap doesn't mind what presents Father Christmas brings, just so long as he brings them early . Your best pal: Joshua knows the way to Father Christmas' heart, but he also has a couple of queries about Rudolph's famous nose . Rainbow request: This dilligent child spent such a long time writing their letter in multicoloured pens that they forgot to sign their name at the end...but hopefully Santa will still be able to find them . Timing is everything: This little boy has been good for 'about three years', so thinks it's fair enough to make some requests from the big man . A Venus fly trap, a scooter and The Nightmare Before Christmas: Quinn seems to be hatching some sort of plot, but needs Father Christmas' help to carry it out . Flattery will get you everywhere: Cullen is curious about whether or not his friend Carter made the 'nice' list, and why he found all those presents in the basement.... A picture paints a thousand words: Sadie illustrates her letter with a picture of the doll's house she's after . Missing the point: Timothy is less bothered about sending his toy requests to Santa and much more curious about the biggest cookie he has ever had to eat while delivering presents . Please? Eva promises that she has been a good girl, and that she is still trying to be a good girl . Excitable: Some young writers got so carried away with excitement while writing their letters to Father Christmas that they appear to have lost their train of thought...

This year's Royal Institution lectures are set to wow audiences with a trio of explosive experiments. The lectures will explore the theme of The Modern Alchemist, unpicking the chemistry of Air, Water and Earth - three ancient 'elements' that puzzled science for centuries. The MailOnline has been given an exclusive first look at some of the incredible alchemist-style experiments the institution has planned to stun audiences. Going off with a bang: Dr Peter Wothers igniting gun cotton in front of a live audience at the Royal . Institution as part of this year's Christmas Lectures . 'When medieval alchemists staged spectacular stunts in front of royalty they never revealed the secrets of their mystical potions and fire-breathing creations,' the Royal Institution says. 'Today’s chemists can perform equally impressive feats, but they do so to explain and explore the extreme frontiers of our material world.' Three experiments will show how chemical reactions can have dramatic consequences, with explosions, jets of flame, and stone crumbling amid clouds of steam. Stunned audiences will watch as researchers make apparently solid stone blocks melt with just a watering can, detonate volatile nitrogen triiodide, and throw caution to the wind as they tip water onto an oil fire. Video of these experiments, too dangerous to carry out in front of a studio audience, has been provided to MailOnline to give our readers an exclusive first look. Apparatus: Dr Wothers will play the role of The Modern Alchemist to show how dramatic chemical reactions can teach us about the world around us . Illuminating: Dr Wothers burns white Phosphorus in air. The name Phosphorus was derived from the Greek ‘phosphoros’ meaning bringer of light . This year's Lectures will be given by Dr Peter Wothers, a Teaching Fellow in the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. He will give three talks on three of the Ancient Greek 'elements' - air, water and earth - to explain the chemistry of the world around us. The MailOnline has had a preview of some of the experiments that Dr Wothers has demonstrated - and we can assure readers there will also be plenty of fire to complete the set. ‘It's such an honour to be selected to give the 2012 Christmas Lectures,' Dr Wothers said. 'I first became interested in chemistry at the age of eight with my first chemistry set. 'The spark that first ignited my interest has never faded, the only difference now is my chemistry set is much bigger. 'I look forward to sharing my work and love for chemistry with the audience at home and in the Ri's famous theatre.' Dr Wothers burns magnesium in carbon dioxide, producing a bright white light . Hot ticket for an electrifying show: Dr Wothers channels close to 1 million volts from a Tesla coil, combining nitrogen and oxygen from the air. Right, he ignites a Christmas tree made from gun cotton . Some of the topics Dr Wothers will . tackle include the chemicals in favourite coffee shop's festive blend, . whether you are worth your weight in gold, and whether your house could . be devastated by an ice bomb. The . Christmas Lectures are the Royal Institution’s biggest and most famous, . demonstration based science events for young people. Broadcast . on television every Christmas, they have formed part of the festive . tradition for generations – often compared to the Queen’s Christmas . message and the carols from Kings. The . Lectures were begun by Michael Faraday in 1825, a time when organised . education for young people was scarce. He presented 19 series himself, . establishing an exciting new way of presenting science. Since then they have continued annually, stopping only during the Second World War. The first of the Royal Institution's lectures will be broadcast on Wednesday, December 26, and will tackle the chemistry of air - the mixture of highly reactive and incredibly stable gases inside all our lungs. Oxygen is the most reactive constituent. When we eat it’s these O2 molecules that seize electrons from our food to give our bodies the energy to live, the Royal Institution says. Add a third oxygen atom and we make ozone, a gas so reactive that it’s toxic if we breathe it in, but high up in the stratosphere this gas protects us from the sun’s radiation. Add a carbon atom and we produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas responsible for warming the planet. The lecture will unravel the puzzle of how and why these compounds of oxygen hold the key to the viability of life on the planet. Nitrogen, the most common element in air, is an unreactive gas, but a key atom in every cell in every living thing on Earth.  How can we imitate nature to bring this suffocating gas alive? Even less reactive are the Noble or inert gases. They’re so stable they are the only elements that exist naturally as individual atoms – but what is it about them that make them so inert? And how can we excite these gases enough to join the chemical party? We’ve come a long way from the days when alchemists thought air was a single element. The second of the lectures, to be broadcast Thursday, December 27, will investigate water - essential to life since every reaction in our bodies takes place in it. But what makes this fluid so special? What happens when you add a lighted splint to a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen? Kaboom! But why? What makes this particular rearrangement of atoms to form water so explosive? Can we tap this energy release to provide environmentally friendly solution to our energy problems? Plants have the ability to reverse this reaction by using the energy from sunlight to release oxygen from water.  We are starting to learn how to do the same.  In this lecture Dr Peter Wothers will unpack how energy lies at the heart of chemistry. We’ll also look at the salts contained in water. Once again we will see the startling difference between a compound and its constituent elements. Take sodium chloride – aka table salt. Sodium is a soft silvery metal that explodes with water; chlorine a deadly poisonous, choking green gas. Both elements are lethal to us, but after they have met, a dramatic change takes place. The sodium and chloride ions that form are essential components in our bodies. They help generate the electrical impulses that make our brains and nerves work. The rocks that form planet Earth have always fascinated alchemists, and they will be the topic of the final Christmas Lecture, which will be broadcast on Friday, December 28. Deep in the bowels of the Earth they thought the metals literally grew in the rocks and that one metal over time matured into another. They dreamed of replicating these natural processes turning ‘base metals’ into gold. Today the extraction of minerals and metals from rocks has made fortunes, but not quite in the way the alchemists imagined. We now know many rocks are the result of oxygen combining with different elements – each with individual properties. Breaking the strong bonds between oxygen and these elements has always been a challenge. Humankind learned how to release copper in the Bronze Age, and iron in the Iron Age, through smelting. Now we can extract even more exotic materials. By understanding the properties of materials, such as the silicon present in computers, or the rare earth magnets generating our electricity in wind turbines, we are entering a new era of chemistry in which we can engineer electrons in new configurations for future technologies. We can now put together the unique cluster of protons, neutrons and electrons that form each of the 80 elements in exciting new ways. If the ancient alchemists were alive today they’d be dazzled by the wonders created by the Modern Alchemist. Many world-famous scientists have given them, including Nobel Prize winners William and Lawrence Bragg, Sir David Attenborough, Carl Sagan, Lord George Porter and Dame Nancy Rothwell. The Christmas Lectures have been broadcast on television since 1966, first on the BBC and then on Channel Five, Channel Four and more4. In 2010, the Lectures returned to BBC Four and in 2011 the combined broadcast reached over 4million viewers. The Royal Institution will also this year broadcast online its own chemistry Advent calendar, featuring famous faces as they talk about their favourite elements from the periodic table. Each day a short film reveals a different person – from Dallas Campbell and Liz Bonnin to Jerry Hall – answering the simple question ‘what’s your favourite element?’. By opening the calendar’s doors you can find out which of the participants remembers dropping lithium and sodium into water, who’s a fan of life-sustaining choices like carbon and oxygen and view enlightening and entertaining films each day. 'The Royal Institution hopes that the calendar and the Lectures inspire the next generation of chemists: people who are fascinated by the way that elements combine to make up the world around us,' a spokesman said. 'Even if you just watch the films it will prove to be a much more enriching experience than a small, ultimately unsatisfying piece of chocolate (and have a less detrimental impact on your waistline!).' This year’s Royal Institution Christmas Lectures will be running on the 26, 27 and 28 December on BBC Four. They will be available to view on the Royal Institution's own video channel after they are broadcast. 1)    Contact explosive: detonating nitrogen triiodide . To illustrate a point in the Air Christmas Lecture, the Royal Institution have used a very sensitive, but very powerful explosive, which detonates with the slightest touch. When it detonates it releases a beautiful plume of purple smoke and a very (!) loud bang. 2)    Water on an oil fire . In Lecture two, we see why you should never use water to put out an oil fire. Even a small amount of water added to this small beaker of oil that has caught fire causes a huge jet of flame. 3)    Disintegrating quicklime blocks . For the final lecture, we see how water from a watering can dissolve apparently solid rock/ Quicklime (treated limescale blocks) reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide, releasing clouds of steam into the air.","The topic for this year's Christmas Lectures is The Modern Alchemist .

Santa's little helpers will certainly have their work cut out delivering Christmas presents to one Glasgow housing estate this year, with 18 babies celebrating their first Christmas. 10 of the youngsters live on the same street, while the other eight live nearby. What's more, the estate's baby boom looks set to continue into 2013, with two more children due to be born to couples who moved in just two months ago. 18 children have been born on one housing estate in Glasgow this year - which means a busy night for Santa . Leanne Corbett, 31, gave birth to the estate's newest arrival Millie just eight weeks ago.Leanne, who lives with husband Colin, 34, a welder, and their three-year-old son Logan, said: . 'It's unbelievable. This Christmas is going to be special because it's Millie's first Christmas so we are all very excited.'It's great that we have all these children because they all get to grow up together, though they may have to extend the primary school in a few years.'Morningside Gardens housing estate in Wishaw, Scotland, welcomed 16 babies in the first half of this year, and two since July.

Housing bosses have had to have a special baby area allocated in the estate because of the unprecedented baby boom, which has seen the number of births soar to three times the national average. The sudden spurt in numbers also means Morningside's population is now too big for the local primary school, which may give council bosses a headache in four years' time. Sales consultant Victoria Dempsey, known as 'Auntie' to the mums on the estate, said: . 'With so many babies celebrating their first Christmas this year, it seems sensible to do so as one joint party, otherwise it'd be January before we got through them all. 'I don't know what it is about Morningside Gardens, but it is a big hit with babies.Ten of the new arrivals all live on the same road, within the collection of terraced houses. 'We are already thinking about a joint street part next year when the children turn one, as it's going to be difficult to keep up with all the first birthdays.' Mum Morven O'Kane, 30, who lives with her eight month old daughter Holly, added: 'It's incredible, it's something else.

They cost £9billion at a time the country could barely afford it, but four out of five Britons say this summer’s Olympics were well worth the expense. Months after the Games ended, the expected Olympic hangover has still not hit - and there are signs the resulting feelgood factor has rallied spirits across the nation. Even after being reminded of the price tag, 78 per cent of voters said the Olympics ‘did a valuable job in cheering up a country in hard times’. Four out of five Britons say this summer's Olympics were well worth the expense. Pictured is the Olympic Park in Stratford . In comparison, just 20 per cent think of the Games as ‘a costly and dangerous distraction’, according to an ICM poll. The vote of confidence is even higher than during the Games themselves. In an online survey taken immediately after Super Saturday – on which Mo Farah, Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford all gold for Team GB – ICM found that just over half of the population supported the Games, with 35 per cent against. Asked to reflect on 2012 as a whole - a year which has seen the Diamond Jubilee, the first double-dip recession since the 1970s and volatile weather - 49 per cent of respondents said the last 12 months had made Britain a better place to live, against 41 per cent who said the reverse. Triumphant: Jessica Ennis celebrates winning her women's heptathlon 800m heat at the London 2012 Olympic Games in August . Katherine Copeland and Sophie Hoskins celebrate together at Eton Dorney after winning gold for GB . In an ICM poll in December 2011, 60 per cent said they expected Britain would become a more miserable place in 2012. But politicians have not found it easy to cash in on London 2012's feelgood legacy. When voters are asked to award a grade to ministers for work completed in the last year alone, David Cameron and Ed Miliband each get a C-, and no senior politician fares any better. The Queen, in comparison, comes in with a solid B+, with 32 per cent of her enthusiastic subjects awarding her an A+. In the poll, 79 per cent of men say the Games were 'well worth the cost', as do 77 per cent of women. In every age bracket, more than three-quarters of people take the same view, with the 80 per cent of 65+ voters who gave the thumbs-up being the most enthusiastic of all. The vote of confidence was reflected across the region, with the 79 per cent support in the South closely matched by 80 per cent, 74 per cent and 77 per cent respectively in the Midlands, the North and in Wales. Victory: Athlete Mo Farah wins his second gold medal for Britain in the 5000m . Those in Scotland were not quite as enthusiastic but even so, 69 per cent were in favour of the Games. Pollsters said the Paralympics may have helped to cement this majority from interviews with 1,002 adults. A clear margin in favour of London 2012 was found in every social class and in every region. It seems that a positive public take on the Olympics  has helped to colour wider perceptions of the year - but only 27 per cent believe 2012 allowed Britain to increase its power in the world. More than double that percentage - 61 per cent - said British power diminished this year. Furthermore, pessimistic voters continue to expect the slump to drag on. Asked to look ahead to the end of 2013, 42 per cent expect that Britain will have turned the economic corner, against 51 per cent who believe the country will still be stuck in a downturn.","78 per cent said the Olympics 'did a valuable job in cheering UK up'

Letter: Bernie Madoff, pictured, spent Christmas Eve bemoaning the state of the financial system from his prison cell . While most of America spent December 24 gearing up for Christmas, Bernie Madoff was bemoaning the state of the financial system from his prison cell. The white collar criminal who pleaded guilty nearly four years ago to running one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in U.S. history, sent a letter on Christmas Eve to CNBC detailing his thoughts. In the note, Madoff lambasted the lack of transparency in financial markets and quashed the idea that insider trading was a new phenomenon, after a raft of recent cases. '(O)ne would be led to believe that with the recent spate of insider trading prosecution that insider trading is a new development,' he wrote. 'This is false. It has been present in the market forever, but rarely prosecuted.' The letter, which is bizarrely littered with spelling mistakes, was penned from the medium security federal prison in North Carolina where he is serving a 150-year sentence. Madoff has granted only a handful of interviews since he went to prison in 2009 and more recently has refused to speak on the record about his case. But he was willing to share some Madoff wisdom in the e-mail, which he sent to the TV station and a handful of attorneys and academics who he has been communicating with, according to CNBC. 'A number of you have been asking my views on a couple of subjects that I am comfortable in going on the record, because they are not related to my case,' he started off, 'there for(sic) the following are remarks that you are free to use for whatever value you feel are appropriate.' Keeping quiet: Madoff, pictured in March 2009, has granted only a handful of interviews since he went to prison three years ago and more recently has refused to speak on the record about his case . In the letter, he said front running - the illegal practice of brokers using knowledge of their customers' pending orders to trade for their own accounts first - was also commonplace and had been going on 'forever.' He said the 'lack of transparency' was created by the growth of so-called 'dark pools' or arrangements outside the established stock exchanges that allow parties to trade stocks privately, with trades and prices only disclosed after the fact. 'Institutions have always attempted to guard this buy and sell information from exposure to the market for fear of being front run,' Madoff wrote. 'Certainly they are entitled to have this right of confidentiality. That being said, the more secret this information, the more valuable this information is to those that can obtain it. Therein lies the problem. It is naive to think that there will be no leakage of this information.' Home: The letter was penned from the medium security federal prison in North Carolina, pictured, where Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence . Before his epic scam, Madoff was prominent in the financial community. He served as a non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ, and his firm was once among the largest on Wall Street. He built his fraud on one of the largest hedge funds in the U.S., which attracted investments from individuals as well as a series of so-called 'feeder funds.' According to CNBC, Madoff says the rapid growth of hedge funds and feeder funds, with their commissions and fees, have created a problem for investors and regulators. 'It has been this additional layer of costs that have created the need for more risk to be taken to earn worthwhile returns. This has created a minefield of regulatory problems involving the very reasons that the desire for a lack of transparency has grown. Both of these areas are going to be the greatest challenge that both the industry and the regulators are going to face.'","Wrote letter from his medium security federal prison in North Carolina bemoaning the lack of transparency in the financial system and claiming insider trading has been going on 'forever'

Home minister Sushil Kumar Shinde announced the setting up a commission of inquiry to review the response of the security agencies after the shocking gang rape was reported. The minister assured the people that the government will take steps to amend the Criminal Procedure Code to enhance punishment in the ""rarest of rare rape cases"", stopping short of stating if it meant death penalty for rapists.

Police manhandle women's rights campaigner as the the disruption escalates . Women in the city demanded made their voices heard . A picture speaks a thousand words for these outraged women . India Erupts: A sea of protesters demanded faster and stricter action in rape cases . He also announced the appointment of a judicial commission to review women's security. The measures, which should have been announced much earlier, came after a miffed Congress top brass pulled up the authorities for ""poor"" handling of anti-rape protesters by the Delhi Police on Saturday. The party's concern was articulated by none other than Sonia, who spoke to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the evening, demanding swift action in the case. She also wanted the PM to ask the home minister to ensure that all steps are taken to protect the victim. Congress sources said Sonia also spoke to Shinde and expressed her displeasure at the inaction of the ministry and the police. She asked him to take the ""severest"" action against the alleged rapists. She said she had been following the case daily and is learnt to have demanded justice to be ""fast-tracked"". Several senior Congress leaders watched with unease on television as the police fired water jets, lobbed tear gas shells and resorted to lathi-charge on demonstrators, comprising mostly college students, who had gathered at India Gate and Raisina Hill to protest against the gang rape of the 23-year-old girl. The police crackdown was perhaps the biggest the city has seen after the anti-Mandal agitation of 1991. At least 72 people were injured, including 37 policemen. One constable and an RPF inspector suffered serious head injuries. Two DCPs were also reported to be injured in the protests. Security forces fired a total of 125 tear gas shells in seven sessions during the day. Two government vehicles, a Delhi Police bus, six public buses and two motorcycles were reported to have been damaged in the protests. The protests started on a peaceful note with thousands of protesters marching from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhavan, carrying placards and raising slogans against the city and the Union government. ""Stop raping India. Change the law,"" read one of the placards. When the police tried to stop the protesters from jumping over the barricades at Raisina Hill, the agitation turned violent, forcing the police to resort to mob control measures. Former Army chief Gen V K Singh takes part in a protest showing his support for women's rights . Television channels went viral capturing the police action, which drew criticism from different sections of the society, denting the image of the police further. The home minister said the protesters had gathered for a just cause and claimed the government had taken a serious view of the sentiment of the people. He also assured that the lathi-charge on the protesters would be probed and claimed itwas resorted to only after some people tried to bring down the security barricades. The government has asked police commissioner Neeraj Kumar to give an explanation on the police action by Monday. Further, he has been asked to explain how the OB vans of channels entered the high-security Rajpath and India Gate without prior information. Top Congress sources confirmed their dissatisfaction with Kumar's handling of the entire case and the agitation. Too little Shinde announced five policemen will be suspended. Half-an-hour later, the Delhi Police said a total of eight cops have been suspended in connection with the case. Those taken off duty were, however, junior- level policemen, including one sub-inspector and seven constable and head constable-rank policeman. The action is unlikely to soothe the rising tempers of Delhiites. The agitators wanted the responsibility of the gang rape to be fixed at the top of the police hierarchy and those in the home ministry. However, it seems, the senior officers are being spared the flak by making junior policemen the scapegoat.","The minister announces inquiry into botched handling of gang-raped student .

But when he slipped into a diabetic coma, he was far beyond shouting – and seemingly beyond help. Millie, however, had other ideas. When she found Mr McKenzie, 47, slumped on the floor, the clever black labrador took matters into her own paws – and pressed the button all by herself. Paw talent: Millie raised the alarm by pushing a panic button when Paul McKenzie slipped into a diabetic coma . Initiative: Millie managed to press Paul's panic button even though he was unconscious and unable to give her the command . It alerted staff at a 24-hour control centre who tried to contact Mr McKenzie, before dialling 999 and calling his neighbours for help. Mr McKenzie, who also has neuropathy – nerve damage, a common complication of diabetes – was taken from his home in Derrington to Stafford hospital and put on a drip to restore his blood sugar levels. The former IT consultant said: ‘Millie is my very own Lassie – she saved my life, and if it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be here now.’ ‘She is a lifeline for me anyway - she is . specially trained to help me do household tasks, as I have trouble . getting about and lifting and carrying things on my own. Mr McKenzie was rushed to Stafford hospital after Millie raised the alarm where he was put on a drip to reduce his blood sugar levels . ‘I can’t . believe how clever she is. We have trained her to press my emergency . button on command, and I often use it to call for help if I’ve fallen at . home and can’t get up. ‘Never in my wildest dreams did I think that . Millie understood the consequences of her pressing the button - that . help always arrives. ‘The emergency services were amazed when they realised it was my dog who had called for help. ‘She’s . one in a million - my best friend.’ Millie was trained by canine . assistance charity Canine Partners, who provide assistance dogs to . people with disabilities to help them with day to day life. Mr . McKenzie, who gave up work five years ago when his nerve damage . worsened, relies on Millie to pick up things from the ground, which is . difficult for him, and often causes him to fall. As part of her . training, the four-year-old was taught to press the emergency button if . Paul gets into difficulties, and has done so around ten times in the . last two-and-a-half years. The button contacts staff at Stafford and . Rural Homes, a charity which owns and manages 5,600 homes in the borough . that were formerly council housing stock. Mr McKenzie, who is . divorced, said of the incident last month: ‘I’d been out in the morning . with Millie doing some shopping and all was well but my bloods had been . low. ‘I ate lunch but was then sick and so felt a tad rough in the . afternoon and at around 6:30 Millie and I had a game of tugging a rope, . which was my last memory for a while. ‘The Lifeline button was . pressed at 7:45pm. The team were shouting for me through the speaker - . usually we can shout to each other using this no matter where I might be . in the flat - but when they heard no response from me they realised . Millie must have pressed the alarm and summoned help.’ A spokesperson . for Canine Partners said: ‘We train all our dogs in emergency . procedures, whether it is fetching help or activating a Lifeline button. ‘Usually . the dogs do this on command, but in Millie’s case she knew Paul was in . trouble and worked out that by pressing the button help would be . summoned. ‘We are very proud of Millie.’ Life-saver: Mr McKenzie said he has no doubt that if it wasn't for Millie he would have died .","Labrador saved owner Paul McKenzie after he passed out unconscious .

Well-off pensioners who do not need their winter fuel allowance should donate the money to charity, a government minister has said. Charities Minister Nick Hurd said he would congratulate any pensioner who chose to give away the allowance to good causes. The benefit is worth £200 for pensioner households and £300 for those over 80. Well-off pensioners who do not need their winter fuel allowance should donate the money to charity, a government minister has said (file photo) Mr Hurd’s intervention comes at a time when Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has been pressing for a stop to universal benefits, such as the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes, going to the wealthiest pensioners. ‘Money should not be paid to those who do not need it,’ Mr Clegg said at think tank Centre Forum last week. But David Cameron has made clear that he is determined to stick to the Conservatives’ general election manifesto commitment to maintain universal benefits for the elderly. Charities Minister Nick Hurd, pictured, said he would congratulate any pensioner who chose to give away the allowance to good causes . Downing Street last week ruled out any means testing before the next election. A spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister made a commitment to protect those benefits and he believes in keeping his promises.’ Mr Hurd said that while the Government would honour its pledges, he would welcome pensioners who chose of their own accord to give the money to good causes. ‘The Government is going to stick to its commitments,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘But if people take their own decisions that they want to use (the money) for good, of course, as minister for charity, I would support, congratulate and encourage them.’ Former Tory cabinet minister Baron Patten echoed Mr Hurd’s words last month. In a debate in the House of Lords, John Patten said: ‘Everyone is austerity aware and people who used to think there were free lunches and free dinners now know that we live in a pretty austere world. ‘A time of maximum austerity is the time to get rid of a lot of perks for well-off pensioners which they don’t deserve and don’t need and the better sort of better-off pensioner makes a point of not claiming them - all those TV licences, all those cheap travel, all of those winter fuel arrangements.’",Charities Minister Nick Hurd says he would welcome decision by pensioners to give money away .

A woman has been charged with felony animal cruelty after she allegedly tied a pit bull puppy behind her ex-husband's car before he unwittingly dragged the dog behind him for a mile along a highway. Benetta Johnson, 41, is accused of instructing her 13-year-old son to tie the puppy behind the truck in a bid to secretly return the dog the man had given to her 5-year-old daughter as a present. Victor Washington, 39, of St Louis, Missouri, has said that he didn't know the puppy - now named Trooper - was attached to his vehicle on the morning of November 21 before he drove off - a claim St Louis police say is supported by surveillance footage outside his home. Scroll down for video . Thoughtless crime: Benetta Johnson, 41, has been charged with felony animal abuse after she allegedly tied the dog to her ex-husband Victor Washington's truck while trying to give it back to him . Real trooper: This 5 1/2-month-old pill bull named Trooper by members of Missouri's Humane Society, is quickly recovering after being dragged for more than a mile on an interstate . Heading into work that morning, Mr Washington was on I-55 when a woman frantically signaled for him to stop. Once he pulled over, he made a discovery so horrifying that he fled about 100 yards to escape its sight. Crumpled and bloody, he said the dog never made a sound while lying limp on the roadway. 'I was just so devastated by what I saw,' Mr Washington told the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 'It still makes me emotional just thinking about it.' He initially told police he had never seen the dog before, not realizing it as the puppy he had given to Johnson's daughter several months earlier. It was a gift Johnson had tried to return to him before. Rising up: Bandaged from his ears down to his toes, the once critically injured pup shows some strength during his recovery . Unwanted gift: Washington, pictured with Johnson here, told police he had given the dog to Johnson's five-year-old daughter but not wanting it, Johnson tried to return it against Washington's will . Washington said it was only after a flurry of media attention to capture the culprit - with rewards doubling to $5,000 - that he texted Johnson, asking: 'Please tell me you still have that dog.' 'She told me she did,' he told the paper. Healing: Trooper is seen here on December 10 with a toy before him, his face noted by the humane society as nearly all healed . But weeks before the incident, he said Johnson called him  complaining about the puppy, saying the animal was sick and too timid. She wanted him to take the dog back but he admits having been upset by the request and brushed it off. Footage taken outside Washington's . apartment complex on the night of November 20 shows a car pull up to his . truck around 10pm. He recognized it as his ex-wife's. Her son can then be seen leading the animal to the back of the truck, attaching him to the hitch of the trailer, and walking away. Mr Washington said that he likely did not see the canine because it was either hiding or taking a snooze under the truck. 'He must have been asleep,' Mr . Washington said. 'She said he was a really shy dog, so maybe he didn't want to come out if he saw me.' Johnson was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of felony animal abuse. Mr Washington doesn't think Johnson intended for him to take off with the dog tied to his truck. He told the Post-Dispatch: 'This whole situation is just so sad. Sad for the dog. Sad for my ex-wife. I mean, just because she's my ex-wife I don't want to see her go to jail. She has kids,' he said. Horrific injuries: Trooper underwent intense surgery to save his life after veterinarians worked to clean and close his wounds that exposed bone and tissue . Reward: A reward for the individual who tied the dog on the back of the driver's truck doubled to $5,000 . Healing: Seen warmed up in a small yellow outfit made for a baby, Trooper relaxes on a knit blanket with now just two leg braces . 'It was an ignorant mistake she made. But she is a sweet person, and I don’t think she would just leave him . there thinking this would happen,' he said after her arrest. Today, the golden pit bull once bandaged from his ears down to his toes, is recuperating under close watch at the Humane Society of Missouri after his harrowing rescue. Seen today with two leg casts, a raw right ear and a soft knit jersey made for a baby over his body for warmth, Trooper's status has largely improved. The puppy, which doctors feared may not survive, was admitted with exposed tissue and bone. Treats: The humane society reports numerous gifts, cards and donations sent to them since his injuries last month, with Trooper seen here enjoying a cookie sent in . Open hearts: Along with the gifts, some pictured, the humane society rewards an overwhelming interest in adopting the dog once he has recovered . Bright future: The greatest worry for veterinarians was Trooper's front right leg they weren't initially sure they would be able to save . 'Trooper is eating and drinking normally and he is walking on his own several times a day,' the Missouri Humane Society wrote earlier this month on his dramatic improvement. Initial fears that he may lose one of his front legs have passed and he is expected to keep them all. 'The fact that he has survived thus far . is amazing,' director of Shelter Medicine Dr Mark Wright said.  'He’s . truly living up to his name and is a real Trooper.' The humane society reports that along with numerous treats, cards and donations coming in, they have had 'overwhelming' interest to adopt the dog. They say that due to the extent of his injuries, however, they expect a still long road to recovery before he is able to leave veterinarians' care. That's an opportunity Mr Washington hopes he's equally entitled to. 'I owe that much to that puppy,' he told the Post-Dispatch, promising he'd give it a good home. 'Because I gave it to the wrong people.'

School: The abuse took place at the Queen Anne Elementary School in Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles . A student has been awarded a record $6.9 million in damages for suffering sexual abuse at the hands of his elementary school teacher. The civil lawsuit damages are believed to be largest ever awarded to a single victim in a . molestation or lewd conduct case involving the nation’s second-largest . school system. A Los Angeles Superior Court jury took five hours to rule in favour of the teen, who was identified in the suit as Walter 'Matt' Doe. The victim was 10-years-old when the abuse started in the classroom of Queen Anne Elementary School in the Mid-Wilshire, Los Angeles, during the academic year 2008-09. He was abused 10 to 15 times during that year and another five times during the summer of 2009 by his teacher Forrest Stobbe, 41. Stobbe was sentenced to 16 years in prison after pleading guilty in 2011. The victim's lawyer argued that the headteacher and other employees failed to act on warnings and . could have taken action that would have prevented or limited the abuse. Lawyers for Los Angeles Unified Schools District (LAUSD) insisted that the district . was not responsible because there was no evidence, known to the . district, that Stobbe posed a threat to children. Lawyers for both sides agreed that liability for molestation by . employees does not hinge on the acts themselves, but on the district’s . actions and policies that would prevent or respond to harm to children. The payout comes as LAUSD seeks to settle nearly 200 claims against it over . allegations of abuse by teacher Mark Berndt at Miramonte Elementary . School, Los Angeles. Abuse: The victim was abused by his fifth grade teacher Forrest Stobbe, 41, up to twenty times . He is suspected of spoon-feeding his semen to blindfolded children as . part of what he called a 'tasting game,' among other alleged wrongdoing. LAUSD General Counsel David Holmquist said in a statement that the safety of children was the district's top priority. 'We . are all impacted when a child is hurt,' Holmquist said. 'We take our . duty to protect our students seriously and are continually looking for . ways that we can strengthen our screening and reporting processes to . ensure that no child is ever hurt in this way. 'Although we can't change . what happened in this case, we remain committed to doing everything in . our power to promote healing and improve trust with those impacted.' Second largest in the nation, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) enrolls more than 640,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade, at over 900 schools, and 187 public charter schools.

A church service in the morning, some Laurel and Hardy in the afternoon, then an evening in the company of Norman Wisdom before being tucked up in bed at 11pm. Christmas Day television in 1952 was a rather gentler affair than it is now – with a much bigger proportion of it devoted to religious programming. But some things, reassuringly, have endured, not least the presence of Bruce Forsyth – and the Queen. A survey has revealed exactly how Christmas television has changed over the past 60 years. Radio Times analysed BBC1 schedules from 1952, 1972, 1992 and 2012, and found that we are watching more drama and more children’s shows than ever before. But the proportion of religious programming has declined. It will make up just 5 per cent of BBC1’s 24-hour schedule this Christmas. At 75 minutes, that’s the same amount of time as in 1952 – but then it accounted for almost a fifth of programming, as there were only seven hours of content in total. In 1972, there were 115 minutes of religious programming. Viewers will watch much more drama this year than in previous decades, with shows such as Call the Midwife and Doctor Who accounting for 13.5 per cent – or 195 minutes – of the Christmas Day output. In 1952 and 1972, drama did not feature in the schedules at all. Sixty years ago, the highlight of the . channel’s Christmas Day output, which began at 11am, was the Christmas . Party, featuring Frankie Howerd, Norman  Wisdom and Petula Clark. That . was a far cry from the BBC’s first festive offering in 1936, which . included carol-singing and a turkey carving demonstration. Viewers in . 1952 could watch 90 minutes of comedy, including the Laurel and Hardy . film Swiss Miss. This year, there will be 210 minutes . of comedy on BBC1, slightly less than in 1992, when comedy dominated the . prime-time Christmas Day schedules. In the 1950s religious shows accounted for almost a fifth of all Christmas programming . In 2012 families will be watching more film, repeats and comedy than ever before on Christmas Day . Sir Bruce Forsyth, 84, is still appearing on our screens after a showbiz career spanning more than 70 years. He will be hosting a Christmas special edition of Strictly Come dancing with Tess Daley on December 25 . In . that year, shows such as Only Fools and Horses, Birds of a Feather and . Victoria Wood’s All Day Breakfast accounted for 260 minutes, or 23 per . cent, of content broadcast throughout the channel’s Christmas Day . schedule. There used to be . far fewer repeats on Christmas Day, too. These have risen by 14 per cent . since 1992, to 225 minutes in total. There were no repeats at all in . 1952 and 1972.One man, however, has never been far from our Christmas Day TV screens – Sir Bruce Forsyth. Along with the Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show, his Generation Game was one of BBC1’s most popular programmes in 1972, when 14 hours and 30 minutes of television were broadcast. The programme was back on the schedules in 1992, when almost 19 hours of content were shown. And this year, 84-year-old Sir Bruce, who holds the Guinness World Record for the male entertainer with the longest career, will be hosting the Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special. Not even he, however, can beat the Queen, whose Christmas Day broadcast has been televised since 1957. This year, for the first time, it will be shown in 3D.Top of the Pops is another perennial fixture of the Christmas Day schedules, featuring in 1972, 1992 and 2012. Alison Graham, TV editor of  Radio Times, said: ‘It’s a delight to know that TV drama is flourishing and is right at the heart of families’ Christmas celebrations. ‘After decades of films, light entertainment and comedies uniting everyone around their tellies, times have changed and there’s a new tradition of home-grown, quality drama bringing us all together.’ Actor and presenter Bill Oddie, whose comedy show The Goodies featured in the 1972 Christmas Day schedule, last night said he believed that big budget drama shows such as Call the Midwife provided perfect family entertainment. He said: ‘It’s important that programmes shown on Christmas Day are things that the whole family can watch. One of the most popular Christmas shows ever was the Morecambe and Wise Show. People loved that kind of comedy entertainment. ‘I think they still do, which is why programmes featuring entertainers such as Bruce Forsyth continue to be shown at Christmas time.’","More religious content in the 1950s and light entertainment in the 1970s .

Sarah Hunter, head of public policy at Google, has told MPs the company is not the 'bogeyman' of the internet in a bid to restore its damaged reputation . Google has told MPs it is not the 'bogeyman' of the internet in a bid to restore its damaged reputation. The web search giant has come under fire recently after it was revealed it slashed more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year using an elaborate structure. Despite making sales of £2.6billion, taxpayers were left to fund the shortfall after Google contributed just £6million to government coffers. The American company also faces charges of unfairly skewing search results to boost its own services above those of rivals, and of failing to take tough enough action with websites that promote illegal content. In addition Google . has been lambasted by child protection campaigners after its . claims to have put effective safeguards on access to porn were called . into question. But Sarah . Hunter, the company's UK policy chief, who was previously a senior . policy adviser to Tony Blair, insisted yesterday that Google has been . unfairly maligned. She used a wide-ranging meeting with the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee to say: 'I  genuinely think we make a substantive contribution…We obey by all the laws in the country and other countries we operate in. 'It’s not the case that we’re the . bogeyman [of the internet]. On the one hand we are seen as disruptive. On the other hand we are making [other companies] money.' MPs were not pacified by her remarks, and described Google as 'public enemy number one'. Jim Sheridan, Labour MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire, told The Daily Telegraph that Google’s stance on tax avoidance . had angered 'honest, decent tax payers'. He said: 'It reflects how NI was . behaving on the phone hacking. It’s just arrogance. They [Google and NI] . are far too influential and powerful these days.' It emerged recently that the internet giant avoided paying $2billion of tax worldwide. The boss of Google sparked outrage last week as he said that he was ‘very proud’ of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year. MPs on the influential Public Accounts Committee last month slammed the group’s methods as ‘immoral’. Google chairman Eric Schmidt said he was 'very proud' of the elaborate structure that helped the search giant slash more than £200million from its UK tax bill last year . But when asked about the arrangement which saw the group funnel billions of pounds to Bermuda, a renowned tax haven, the company’s chairman Eric Schmidt said: ‘It’s called capitalism.’ Mr Schmidt, who is estimated to be worth £4.6billion, said: ‘We pay lots of taxes; we pay them in the legally prescribed ways. ‘I am very proud of the structure that we set up. We did it based on the incentives that the governments offered us to operate. ‘It’s called capitalism. ‘We are proudly capitalistic. I’m not confused about this.’ Ms Hunter repeatedly told MPs it was 'way above my pay grade' to comment on Mr Schmidt's remarks. She said that News International has been accused of illegal activity, unlike Google, which has been investing heavily in combating piracy, taking down illegal links and tweaking search results to ensure that pirate websites appear further down search rankings. The news comes as the European Union set Google an ultimatum yesterday after it was accused of intentionally manipulating its search results to harm competitors. The EU have given it a month to come up with detailed proposals to resolve a two-year investigation into complaints that it used its power to block rivals, including Microsoft. The EU's antitrust chief, Joaquin Almunia, delivered the deadline in a meeting with Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt in Brussels. If it fails to address the complaints, the world's most popular search engine could face a lengthy battle. If found guilty, it could mean a fine of up to 10 percent of its revenue, or $4 billion. It emerged recently that the internet search giant avoided paying $2billion of tax worldwide . Almunia said in a statement: 'Since our preliminary talks with Google started in July, we have substantially reduced our differences regarding possible ways to address each of the four competition concerns expressed by the Commission. 'On the basis of the progress made, I now expect Google to come forward with a detailed commitment text in January 2013.' Google has also come under fire recently for 'failing to stop easy access to porn' despite tweaking search results in the US to hide X-rated images. The internet giant had changed its programming after earlier criticism so as to make X-rated pictures more difficult to find. But a trial carried out in the US by the Daily Mail revealed that such images were still easily available. Entering the word 'porn' in a search on Google brought up hundreds of X-rated pictures. The result brought into question Google's claim that users in the US would have to be more specific if they wanted to view porn. The changes had affected users in the US only. Those in the UK do not at present have the supposedly improved programming and there is no timetable to bring it in.","Sarah Hunter insisted the web search giant had been unfairly maligned .

Former nurse Iain Balsillie, pictured, who placed women in a trance so he could grope them, has been caught illegally accessing a hypnotic website . A former nurse who placed women in a trance so he could grope them has been caught illegally accessing a hypnotic website. Iain Balsillie used the trigger words 'drop for me' in an attempt to make women fall into his arms, before sexually assaulting them. Balsillie, 44, had breached a Sexual Offences Prevention Order by browsing an online site that carried information on hypnosis, Dunfermline Sheriff Court heard . The order, made by a judge in Manchester in 2008, banned Balsillie from accessing Internet sites displaying erotic or hypnotic material. It was imposed at Minshull Street Crown Court under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 after he carried out a sex attack on a woman in Manchester and was jailed for 12 months. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register for 10 years. But in August this year, police carrying out regular computer checks at his home in Rosyth, Fife discovered he had been logging on to a website which describes itself as a 'BDSM & fetish community'. Balsillie pleaded guilty to knowingly visiting a hypnosis portal on the members-only site between August 28 and 30 2012 at his home in Rosyth, without reasonable excuse. The court heard that he was arrested and taken into custody when officers discovered he had been browsing the site. Sheriff Ian Abercrombie warned Balsillie that breaching a court order was a 'serious matter' but he noted that he had cooperated with social work reports. The sheriff placed him on a community payback order, with a six month supervision requirement. He will be monitored by social workers during that period and will have to notify the police of any change of address. In 2007, Balsillie was fired from BSkyB's Dunfermline call centre, where he worked as an occupational nurse, after two female workers claimed he tried to put them in a trance before inappropriately touching them. Following the incidents in Fife, he was convicted of the attack on a woman in Manchester and struck off the nursing register. Speaking during a Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing in 2009, his victims said he would say 'drop for me' in an attempt to make them fall into his arms, after which he would grab them by the breasts and, in one case, lower her head on to his private parts. The 2009 hearing heard that one of the women had been referred to the Balsillie in September 2007 for recurring back problems, and because she had taken an excessive amount of time off work for high blood pressure. Balsillie said that he would teach her relaxation techniques to help lower her blood pressure. After taking a reading, he carried out a standard relaxation technique, before moving on to the hypnosis. The witness said: 'I had learnt similar relaxation techniques some time before during ante-natal classes and I thought I knew what to expect. 'He told me to close my eyes and imagine myself in a happy place. An order was imposed at Minshull Street Crown Court, pictured, under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 after Balsillie carried out a sex attack on a woman in Manchester and was jailed for 12 months . 'He said to imagine I was standing on a beach with the sun on my face, looking out at the view.' The woman's blood pressure dropped but Balsillie said that he would carry out the exercise again, moving closer to her and making inappropriate remarks, she said. The witness said: 'He was sitting right next to me - I could smell the sweat on his body and hear him breathing heavily. It was very uncomfortable. 'He told me that I would become more relaxed when I heard his voice, and that I would become excited when I saw him. 'He also stated that I would not remember anything from the trance, except that his voice would make me calm, and seeing him would make me excited.' She added that she felt uncomfortable because she had no control over her body and felt like she was under a local anaesthetic, saying: 'I was aware of things going on around me but I could not open my eyes or move my body'. When she returned to her work station, the patient complained about Balsillie to her line manager. But later the same day, Balsillie approached her on her way out of work and asked her to sign a GP consent form. She said that although she didn't want to see him, she went into his office but left the door open. She said: 'When I put my hand on the doorknob to leave, he placed his hand against the door to stop me, clicked his fingers and said 'drop for me now'. 'My legs just gave way - the next thing I remember is lying on the floor. It happened really quickly. 'As he pulled me to my feet, he placed his arms under my breasts.' She later learned that a similar complaint had previously been made about Balsillie by another BSkyB employee. Striking him from the nursing register, Nursing and Midwifery Council chairman Laurence Peterken said that Balsillie had abused the trust placed in him by his patients. Mr Peterken said: 'He sought to control the patients by way of hypnosis and by way of the use of control words, in particular the phrase ""drop for me"".'

A globetrotting automotive consultant has become a real-life Ryan Bingham - the character played by George Clooney in the film Up In The Air - by clocking up a million miles in a single year. Tom Stuker took his love of travel to new heights by becoming the first customer of United Airlines to achieve the feat. Mr Stuker, who divides the little time he spends outside of a plane between New Jersey and Chicago, was recognised for his record on December 6 United Flight 949 from London to Chicago. This is the latest travel milestone for the 59-year-old super-frequent flier, who in July 2011 became the first person to fly 10 million miles on United. To mark the accomplishment, the airline honored Stuker by putting his name on a Boeing 747. Jet-setter: United customer Tom Stuker poses in front of a Boeing 747 bearing his name in July 2011, more than year before becoming the first customer to fly United one million miles in a year . Life imitating film: Actor George Clooney is shown in a scene from the film Up In The Air where he played frequent flyer Ryan Bingham . With more than 13 million miles under his belt, Stuker is one of commercial aviation's highest-mileage travelers. In the Oscar-nominated movie Up in the Air, Clooney's high-flying character, Ryan Bingham, details the life of a 10-million-miler, from the free round-the-world airline tickets right down to the personal greeting from ticket agents who have likely never met him. Stuker estimates he has flown more than 6,000 flights on United, including about 400 flights this calendar year alone which equals circumnavigating the world about 40 times. Cruising at 570 mph, a single nonstop flight of one million miles would land 73 days after takeoff. Stuker's 11 million miles flown on United would also put him about a third of the distance from Earth to Mars. Stuker, an automotive sales consultant who will soon appear in Spike TV’s upcoming reality show Car Lot Rescue, began clocking his miles after joining United's MileagePlus loyalty program in 1983. Since then, he has logged most of his miles flying to Asia and Australia, where he helps struggling car dealerships, and has visited all 50 U.S. states. As one of the world's most avid . globetrotters, Stuker enjoys many perks that his fellow passengers can . only dream of: he usually flies first class and is a member of United’s . elite Global Services, an invitation-only program that offers 'certain . unpublished benefits.' Frequent flier: Stuker is an independent automotive sales consulate and travels a lot for work, visiting car dealerships in Asia and Australia, as well as in Europe . New career: Stuker, center, will soon appear in Spike TV's new reality show called Car Lot Rescue in which he will be whipping into shape failing auto dealerships . For . Stuker, the quest for the million milestone began when a fellow frequent . flier suggested that the two of them should try for the 'sexy' round . number. Stuker said he was . crisscrossing the globe for work, going back and forth between the U.S. and Australia, and thought that he was on a strong pace to reach the . goal. Nemesis: Stuker's arch-rival in the record-setting business is Fred Finn, the British businessman in his 70s who claims to have logged more than 15 million miles on different airlines . While his friend abandoned the . challenge due to health problems, the 59-year-old decided to go for the . record, although he admits that he could not have done it flying coach. Speaking to NBC from . Hawaii, Stuker said that in all his time flying, he has never . experienced a serious emergency, not counting aborted takeoffs and . landings. Stuker said that beside traveling for work, he and his wife, who is a teacher, love visiting new places and never miss an opportunity to take off for a new destination, even for just a couple of days. On the Stukers' itinerary is a two-night trip to Buenos Aires in January, a getaway to Hawaii for President's Day and a romantic week in April that will be split between Paris and Prague. But while Stuker's record is . impressive, he is not the only jet-setter out there. The 59-year-old man . has a powerful rival in the face of Fred Finn, a British businessman in . his 70s who has allegedly logged a lifetime record of more than 15 . million miles on various airlines. Stuker, . however, is neither impressed with not intimidated by his opponent's . record, saying that being in his late 50s, he has many more years of . travel ahead of him. 'God willing, I’m going to be passing him in a couple of years. He knows who I am,’ Stuker told the New York Times.","Tom Stuker works as automotive consultant traveling to Australia and Asia .

Excluded: Under-threes have been banned from Jack and the Beanstalk at The Hawthorn Theatre, Hertfordshire . 'Scrooge'-like theatre bosses have banned toddlers from attending a pantomine - because they are too noisy. Parents slammed killjoys at The Hawthorne Theatre in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, after it banned children under the age of three from its Jack and the Beanstalk show. According to managers at the council-run theatre, it is not 'house policy' to allow children under 36 months in although exceptions are made for certain family films. But the theatre will not be making an exception for the panto, which is designed to encourage audience participation, in case noisy youngsters ruin the performance for other children. Mother-of-five Mel Hackworth, 34, said that she was refused entry for her six-month-old son Finley when she called the theatre to buy tickets. The box office told her that she would be allow to take her other four children, who are all old enough to attend, but would have to sit outside in the foyer with Finley while the show was on. She said: 'I asked if it was free for Finley to come in, (and) was told it's no children under three in case they make a noise. 'It's ridiculous, it's a children's pantomine, how can they not let under threes in? 'That's a lot of families that won't be able to go this year. What's the point of running a panto for children and not letting children in?'

The founder of a South Texas cargo airline has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for federal child pornography charges. Robert L Hedrick, 61, was sentenced in Brownsville, Texas on Wednesday after undercover officers posing as young teenage girls say they caught him engaging them in explicit online chats. Hedrick — who at trial blamed former business associates for conspiring to frame him — said on Wednesday that he couldn't apologize for crimes he didn't commit. Locked away: Pan American Airways founder and President, Robert L. Hedrick, sentenced to 30 years in prison on child pornography charges is seen in 2011 . 'I can't ask the court for anything,' Hedrick said Wednesday, according to the Brownsville Herald. 'I was framed. I didn't do what I was charged and convicted of.' Hedrick founded Pan American Airways, a . cargo airline he set up in a building that once belonged to Pan American . World Airways — the once-renowned airline that collapsed in 1991. Prosecutors presented evidence at trial tying Hedrick to the chats with undercover officers posing as 13- and 14-year-old girls. They said Hedrick sent detectives 136 images of adult and child pornography, along with a webcam video of himself masturbating, and played in court an audiotape of Hedrick talking explicitly about sex. Authorities found more than 2,400 images and 18 child pornography videos on Hedrick's laptop and two external hard drives, prosecutors said. Some of the children in the materials were later identified as known victims of sexual assault, prosecutors said. No apology: The 61-year-old has denied the charges while blaming former business associates for conspiring to frame him . Prosecutors had asked for 90 years in prison, but Hanen set sentences on other charges to run concurrently due to Hedrick's age, the newspaper reported. Hedrick's airline ran flights between the U.S. and Latin America. He was also president of a global pool supply company and a logistics company, according to trial testimony. Hedrick testified on his own behalf in May, jumping from secret government contracts during the Cold War to business disputes to a failed marriage. Defense attorneys denied it was Hedrick at the keyboard, trying to use the Internet's thin veil of anonymity to raise doubts among jurors, and claimed he had a long list of enemies with the motivation and money to set him up. Prosecutors on Wednesday said they presented victim impact statements from two witnesses and their families. Hedrick was also ordered to pay $5.4 million in restitution.

'He wanted police assistance because while they were there at the address people were coming and going and taking things and he felt scared.' Mr Beckford was found in a state of rigor mortis at the address on Vining Street, Brixton, after paramedics were alerted by a friend. The police initially treated the case as suspicious, but the investigation was dropped after no signs of injury or forced entry to the property were found. The inquest heard Mr Beckford rarely took his epilepsy medication and that he had been frequently treated at Kings College hospital after suffering seizures. Paramedics were called to the address on Viking Street, Brixton, after a friend of Mr Beckford's raised concern . Dr Olaf Biedrzycki, who conducted the post mortem investigation on May 30 said: 'The toxicology report showed a trace of alcohol but it was not enough to be significant. 'Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy is not common, but it is by no means particularly unusual. 'It occurs more frequently in cases where people have poorly controlled seizures, or fit in their sleep. 'Very often the person is found face down in bed, as they were in this case.' Recording a verdict of death by natural causes, deputy coroner Phillip Barlow said: 'It is clear Menelik Beckford had a long history of epilepsy. 'There were concerns over his compliance with the medication he was prescribed, and he was seen frequently at King's College Hospital suffering from seizures.

Andrew Mitchell went to war with ‘amateur’ Downing Street and Scotland Yard yesterday – attacking David Cameron’s judgment and the impartiality of Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe. The attack comes as the Police Federation, the body representing rank-and-file officers, has ordered a review into how it handled the episode. The body has been accused of 'stoking up' Mitchell's alleged bust-up, which led to him quitting the Cabinet. At war: Former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell, left, has launched a withering attack on the impartiality of Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe, right, . Police Federation chairman Paul . McKeever said he would apologies to the politician if it was proved that . he did not call police officers 'plebs'. The body was vocal in its opposition . to Mitchell's alleged behaviour, with some branches organising protests . where officers wore 'PC Pleb' t-shirts. Friends of the former chief whip said . it was ‘mindblowing’ that the Prime Minister had allowed Mr Mitchell to . resign despite knowing that CCTV footage cast grave doubt on claims by . police in Downing Street that he called them ‘plebs’. Mr Mitchell’s allies said he was not . even allowed to see the video before he resigned but was instead left . ‘swinging in the wind’. Tory MPs also called on Scotland Yard to suspend the two diplomatic protection officers whose log made the claims while the force runs a criminal investigation into the events of last September. The CCTV footage shows Mr Mitchell being refused permission to pass through the gates of Downing Street but not the blazing row the police claim then occurred, nor the members of the public who were allegedly ‘visibly shocked’ at the argument. Mr Mitchell admits swearing but not using the word ‘plebs’. Up to 30 Scotland Yard detectives are investigating after it emerged a third policeman posed as a member of public and falsely claimed to have witnessed the row in an email to Tory deputy chief whip John Randall. Mr Cameron and Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood viewed the footage and concluded that it undermined the email. But the Prime Minister decided not to confront the police who were on the scene and, crucially, did not show the video to Mr Mitchell to use in his defence. Friends of the former chief whip said it was 'mindblowing' that David Cameron, on a visit to Camp Bastion Afghanistan, allowed Andrew Mitchell to resign . Branding it ‘amateur hour’ in No 10, a close friend of Mr Mitchell said: ‘It is just extraordinary they did not release something that could have knocked down the central piece of evidence against him. All they had to do was release 30 seconds of footage. ‘To trade that against a wish not to upset the police seems to me to put expediency so far ahead of a sense of morality as to be mindblowing. ‘It raises serious questions about Cameron’s judgment. The approach was to leave this swinging in the wind rather than raise questions with the police.’ The source said he agreed that the two police officers who made the original claim should be suspended pending the results of the investigation. Another Tory MP said: ‘I don’t understand why the two policemen who wrote the log haven’t been suspended while the inquiry is going on. ‘There are clear discrepancies between their account and the CCTV footage. They seem to have a case to answer.’ Mr Mitchell’s allies have also let it be known that he has little faith in the impartiality of Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe after he said the CCTV evidence did not contradict the police log. But he has been placated by Scotland Yard putting deputy assistant commissioner Pat Gallan in charge of the probe. CCTV from Downing Street, as shown on Channel 4 News, suggests there was not a group of tourists at the gates at the time of the incident . Last night, Downing Street declined to say when Mr Mitchell had been given the video but pointed out that the Prime Minister stood by him for several weeks after the incident, despite repeated calls for his sacking. Mr Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson both backed Mr Hogan-Howe. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has full confidence in the Metropolitan police commissioner and believes the police should be allowed to carry out the investigation.’ Mr Johnson’s spokesman said: ‘The Mayor has absolute confidence in the commissioner, who has assured him that he is determined to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible.’ Yesterday Mr Cameron revealed that he met privately with Mr Mitchell last week and had been keen to keep him. Mr Mitchell’s allies say he would ‘tear Cameron’s arm off’ if he were offered his old job of International Development Secretary back in a reshuffle. Speaking during his visit to Afghanistan, Mr Cameron said: ‘I think there is a lot of sympathy for Andrew because the revelation about the email... has shocked quite a lot of people.’ He said that he spoke to the Sutton Coldfield MP on Monday, adding that he was in a ‘calm and rational mood’ given the ‘disturbing revelations’. Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said Mr Hogan-Howe will answer questions about the affair on January 14. Police Federation chief Paul McKeever has handed control to his successor-elect Steve Williams just over a month before he is officially due to leave the role, due to 'pre-existing leave arrangements'. Announcing a review of the body, he said: 'Recent events have shown that there are issues around the way the Police Federation nationally is able to lead and co-ordinate at a national, regional and local level.' 'As we enter a new era, my first act as chairman is to establish this independent panel to ensure that we as the Federation continue to represent the interests of our members in the most effective and efficient way.'","Andrew Mitchell attacks David Cameron's judgement .

Neighbours have said police later asked questions about Conley as they believed he was hiding at a house next to the Weavers. Ms Weaver told CBS Chicago the police said they had been acting in self-defence when they shot the dog. 'He said ""Ma’am, your dog was getting ready to attack one of my officers.""

Joseph Banks is known as the 'second-hand bandit' for wearing used clothes during his crimes. The 37 year-old was captured by officers without incident. The two men had been on the run for hours before the escape was reported. Banks was convicted the week before the escape of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two others. Authorities say he stole almost $600,000, and most of that still is missing. During trial, he had to be restrained because he threatened to walk out of the courtroom. He acted as his own attorney and verbally sparred with the prosecutor, at times arguing that U.S. law didn't apply to him because he was a sovereign citizen of a group that was above state and federal law.

Risk: The proportion of British men likely to develop cancer in their lifetime will rise from 44 per cent to 50 per cent over the next 15 years, experts predict (FILE PHOTO) The charity said one positive aspect of the bleak projections was that proportionally fewer people are likely to be dying of cancer thanks to improved methods of diagnosis and treatment. Cancer survival rates have doubled over the past 40 years, figures show. The predictions from Cancer Research UK are based on past incidence and death rates and assume a continuation of trends. They do not take into account new forms of treatment, lifestyle and environmental changes that might alter future cancer rates. 'These figures provide a glimpse into the future' Dr Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK . Age is the biggest risk factor for cancer and the increase in incident rates largely reflects the fact that people are living longer, the charity said. It also revealed the cancers set to affect people most in the next 15 years are prostate, bowel and melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer. Cancer Research UK's chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar said: 'These figures provide a glimpse into the future. 'On the plus side, our life expectancy is increasing but this also means more of us are likely to be diagnosed with cancer. 'It's only through research that we will be able to beat cancer. We need to do more work to understand what drives cancer and how we can prevent it, as well as developing new treatments to reduce the number of people who will die from it,' he said. 'Understanding the biology of cancer is rather like completing a complex jigsaw puzzle. Many pieces have already fallen into place but we need more research before we can complete the picture. 'And thanks to the generosity of the public, our world-class scientists are playing a leading role in beating this devastating disease.' Devastating disease: As our life expectancy increases, more of us are expected to be diagnosed with cancer (FILE PHOTO) Data from the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine at Queen Mary, University of London and the Office for National Statistics were used to make the predictions. Forecasts anticipate that the number of diagnosed cases of bowel cancer will rise to more than 54,400 from 41,800 in 2010. The number of prostate cancer cases is expected to rise from 41,000 to 57,000, and malignant melanoma from 12,800 to 20,400. Prostate cancer expert Professor Malcolm Mason, from the University of Cardiff, said: 'Prostate cancer needs research. We have many questions and research is key to providing answers about the disease. As our population ages, growing numbers of men will be diagnosed with the disease. 'Over the last 40 years prostate cancer incidence rates in Great Britain have tripled, and three-quarters of cases are diagnosed in men aged over 65 years.' The report was released before a new Cancer Research UK TV advertising campaign launching on Boxing Day that will highlight the need for more research.","Risk of men developing cancer in their lifetime will rise from 44 per cent to 50 per cent in 15 years time, according to predictions .

Defying her terminal illness, an inspirational and selfless nine-year-old girl has helped to raise nearly a quarter of a million dollars so that 36 other children can have their wish come true. Even though little Gabriella Miller is undergoing grueling chemotherapy and radiation treatments for her inoperable brain tumor, she couldn't stop thinking how lucky she was to be going to Paris through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Determined to help other children have their last wish granted, the Lessburg, Virginia resident decided to spread her own personal motto, 'you might have a bad day today but there's always a bright star to look forward to tomorrow, what's your bright star?' Scroll Down for Video . Little Gabriella Miller inspired a charity drive to have letters sent to Macy's so that they would donate money to the Make-A-Wish Foundation . Diagnosed only last month, Gabriella is looking forward to a dream visit to Paris soon - but thinking of others and not herself, she wanted to let as many children as possible experience the same good fortune as her. Her mother told her about Macy's 'Believe' campaign, in which the retail giant donates one dollar to the Make-A-Wish Foundation for every hand written letter it receives to Santa. Contacting Chris Croll, a family friend and charity worker, a social media campaign was begun on Facebook that spread at an astonishing rate around the Internet and smashed through Gabriella's goal to get 10,000 letters sent to Macy's. The letter's came from as far away as Saudi Arabia - all arriving at a special center set up by Croll in Leesburg. Gabriella with her mother Ellyn and father Mark - the brain tumor she is suffering from causes her to lose some muscle control in her face . Gabriella Miller spoke at a mall in Virginia to explain why she wanted to help raise the money for charity . The nine-year-old who describes herself as 'almost ten' will travel to Paris in the spring and fulfill her dream . They doubled that number within the first ten days and just before Christmas Day, a spectacular 240,983 letters had been sent by children inspired to believe in Father Christmas. In addition to the near $250,000 that they will now donate to the noted children's charity, Macy's will be giving an additional $25,000 in honor of Gabriella. The happy-go-lucky Virginian fourth grader was diagnosed with her rare and aggressive cancer three days before Thanksgiving but the brave girl began her amazing charity quest after telling her parents, Mark and Ellyn Miller that she doesn't like to 'get' without giving something back. Gabriella's campaign resulted in enough funding to pay for 36 more wishes to be granted to seriously ill children. The ambitious girl announced her astounding target at Macy's Dulles Town Center mall on the 23rd of December and brought tears to the crowd with her candid speech. The letters arrived by the bag to the center in Leesburg Virginia which was set up to deal with the influx after Gabriella's campaign was put onto the Internet . Eventually all the letter's were packed onto a truck and taken to Macy's Dulles Town Center mall . 'Dear Santa, I'm Gabriella, the one with the tumor. Make A Wish has really touched me,' said Gabriella as she clutched a microphone. 'I want to say one more thing,' she added during her speech. 'This is my motto and I think you should use it too. You might have a bad day today, but there's always a bright star to look forward to tomorrow. 'Look inside what's your bright star. Thank you. happy holidays.' The generosity of the children has inspired and helped Gabriella through her arduous treatment and led to some touching letters to Santa with Christmas wishes. 'Dear Santa, I have everything I need, just please cure cancer for Christmas,' is one letter that Croll says she has received. Touching: This letter asks for Santa Claus to find a cure for cancer for all the sick people and for girls to stop loving 1 Direction and to stop talking about them . This letter claims to not ask for much for Christmas from Santa - but it still got Macy's to donate $1 to charity to help sick children . Mom Ellyn was touched too by the thoughtfulness of the children. 'Just the sweetness and the innocent of these children writing something down,' said Ellyn.'It was not about Santa Per se, it was about expressing their needs and their desires and their wishes. 'Whatever holiday it is that you celebrate it's just goodness and pure and what can we do to be kind to other people.' The family hope that the treatment that Gabriella is receiving will shrink and destroy the tumorl, which is the size of a walnut. One night recently, Gabriella's father Mark took the family out to buy a packet of walnuts which they lined up in the deck railing outside and together they smashed them with a frying pan and hammer. 'Gabriella’s tumor is pressing on some of her facial nerves, which makes it difficult for her to smile — but she still lights up the room wherever she goes,' Croll said to the Washington Post. The family hope to travel to Paris in the spring and when they do they hope to have heard from some of the families that they have helped see their wish come true.","Gabriella Miller inspired nearly 250,000 hand written letters to be sent to Santa for Macy's 'Believe' campaign - for which the retail giant promised to donate $1 for everyone .

Eating meals together as a family - even just once a week - boosts children’s fruit and veg intake to near the recommended five-a-day, a study has found. Researchers from the University of Leeds found that even just Sunday lunch round the table can help improve the diets. The survey of 2,389 children attending 52 primary schools in London discovered nearly two-thirds of children (63 per . cent) did not consume the World Health Organisation recommended amount . of five portions (400g) of fruit and veg a day. Researchers at the University of Leeds found children who eat meals with their families were much more likely to get their five-a-day . Children who always ate a family meal together at a table consumed 125g (1.5 portions) more fruit and veg on average than children who never ate with their families. Even those who reported eating together only once or twice a week consumed 95g (1.2 portions) more than those who never ate together. The research also suggests parents who eat fruit . and veg themselves and cut up such food for them also boosted how much . their youngsters’ ate. Study supervisor Professor Janet Cade, of the University’s School of Food Science and Nutrition, said: 'Even if it’s just one family meal a week, when children eat together with parents or older siblings they learn about eating. 'Watching the way their parents or siblings eat and the different types of food they eat is pivotal in creating their own food habits and preferences.' In families where parents reported eating fruit and veg every day, children had on average one portion (80g) more than children whose parents never or rarely ate fruit and veg. Meaghan Christian, who conducted the study as part of her PhD, said: 'Modern life often prevents the whole family from sitting round the dinner table, but this research shows that even just Sunday lunch round the table can help improve the diets of our families.' Children whose parents always or sometimes cut up fruit and veg for them ate, on average, half a portion (40g) and quarter of a portion more, respectively, than children of parents who never cut up their fruit and veg. The study found two-thirds of primary school children in London were not eating the recommended amount of fruit and vegetables . Prof Cade added: 'There are more benefits to having a family meal together than just the family’s health. 'They provide conversational time for families, incentives to plan a meal, and an ideal environment for parents to model good manners and behaviour.' It is estimated that one in 10 British children aged two to 10 is obese. Dr Christian added: 'Since dietary habits are established in childhood, the importance of promoting the family meal needs to be more prominent in public health campaigns. 'Future work could be aimed at improving parental intake or encouraging parents to cut up or buy snack-sized fruit and vegetables.' The study includes dietary measurements from 2,389 children attending 52 primary schools from the boroughs of Wandsworth, Tower Hamlets, Greenwich, Sutton, Lewisham, Lambeth, Merton and Newham in Greater London. Diet was assessed using a questionnaire separated into a School Food Diary and a Home Food Diary. The Home Food Diary also included questions about the home food environment and parents attitudes to fruit and vegetables. The study, funded by the National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research (NIHR PHR) Programme, was published in the British Medical Journal’s Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.","Even just Sunday lunch can help improve diet, study shows .

Britain's decision to name a part of Antarctica after the Queen has been met with fury in Argentina. An unnamed official in Buenos Aries said calling the vast disputed territory – twice the size of the UK – Queen Elizabeth Land is a ‘systematic attack within the context of the fight over the Falkland Islands’. The name was announced by Foreign Secretary William Hague to mark the Diamond Jubilee. William Hague announced the new name during the Queen's visit to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office . Honour: Part of British Antarctica has been renamed Queen Elizabeth Land to mark the Jubilee . One Argentine newspaper called it a . ‘provocation’ as the row over the Falklands continues to simmer. Argentina is expected to file a formal complaint. Britain’s claim on the icy, . uninhabited land dates back to 1908 and is maintained via three British . Antarctic Survey research stations. New Zealand, France, Norway, Australia, Chile and Argentina have also lodged claims but most countries do not recognise them. The . Foreign Office announced on Tuesday that a 169,000 square mile part of . British Antarctic Territory had been named in the Queen's honour. Experts said the move by . the British Government to mark the Jubilee year was 'provocative' and . designed to strengthen British interests in the area. Klaus . Dodds, professor of geopolitics at Royal Holloway, University of . London, told The Telegraph it was 'a calculated move to reinforce UK . interests' in the area. He . told the newspaper: 'I think it’s provocative and it’s significant . because place-naming is one of the most powerful ways of reinforcing . your sense of ownership of a territory, and the use of royalty is, in . turn, the most powerful way of cementing a connection with the UK.' It is the latest in a ratcheting up of tensions between the two . countries that has coincided with the 30th anniversary of the Falklands . War. Earlier this year, Falkland residents announced plans for . a referendum in 2013 in an attempt to fend off Argentinian claims to . the territory. The . naming was announced following the Queen's . visit to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and an earlier sit in on . Cabinet. He told . assembled staff: 'As a mark of this country's gratitude to the Queen for . her service, we are naming a part of the British Antarctic Territory in . her honour as Queen Elizabeth Land. 'This is a fitting tribute . at the end of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee year, and I am very proud to . be able to announce it as she visits the Foreign and Commonwealth . Office. Say cheese: Ministers lined up for a a group photograph with the Queen in the Pillared Room in Number 10 to record the historic visit . Queen Elizabeth II took a seat at the famous Cabinet table between David Cameron and Foriegn Secretary William Hague . 'The British Antarctic Territory is a unique and . important member of the network of fourteen UK Overseas Territories. To . be able to recognise the UK's commitment to Antarctica with a permanent . association with Her Majesty is a great honour.' He added the piece of land was previously unnamed. Queen . Elizabeth Land is a barren, landlocked ice and snow-covered area . uninhabited by people and virtually devoid of animal life. It . is ice-cream cone shaped with its tip close to the South Pole and it . lies a few hundred miles from the coast where seals, emperor penguins . and birdlife such as albatrosses are found. The Queen has been on the throne for 60 of the 104 years since the UK claimed territory in Antarctica in 1908. A . spokeswoman for the British Antarctic Survey, responsible for the UK's . scientific activities on the continent, said: 'It's very high altitude . so would be a great deal colder than the coast so you wouldn't get . penguins, it's very mountainous and cold. 'At . the moment it's the summer season there which runs from October to . March so it would be minus 10C inland and minus 25C at the South Pole. 'In the winter time it can get to minus 40C and minus 50C but most of the life is found around the coastline.' Earlier, the Queen visited Downing Street where she attended a Cabinet meeting for the first time. Earlier in the day the Queen met Cabinet - becoming the first peace-time monarch to do so for 231 years. She spoke only twice during the visit, once to suggest . that the Queen’s Speech should be shorter rather than longer, and again . to wish ministers a merry Christmas. The Queen was also presented with a . gift from her Cabinet – a set of 60 place mats, one for each year of her . reign, each bearing an image from Buckingham Palace.

For most seven-year-olds, performing in the school nativity play is something to take for granted. Not so for cancer patient Finn Middleton from Flixton in Greater Manchester. He was desperate to follow in his older brother's footsteps and play one of the three wise men in his school's Christmas play. He had been too ill to take part last year but was now all set for his starring role. However, his dream was almost shattered when surgery was scheduled for the day of the performance. It was only the quick intervention of the child's Macmillan paediatric nurse, Sarah Murphy that saved the day. Finn was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare cancer which develops from muscle tissue, in 2011, when he was five-years-old. His . mother, Jo Middleton, 41, was helping him to get ready for school in . January 2011 when she noticed that his eye had closed up and that he was . experiencing shooting pains in his face. Worried that something could be seriously wrong she rushed him straight to hospital. He was immediately sent for tests while doctors tried to establish what was wrong with him. A . CT scan revealed that he did not have a brain tumour, however, a few . weeks later a second CT scan was carried out and his parents, Jo and . Paul, were given the devastating news that he had rhabdomyosarcoma, a . cancer which affects less than 60 children in the UK each year. Finn underwent 18 months of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy and had to miss two years of school. Mrs Middleton told Mail Online: ‘I didn’t think that anything could be tougher than being told my child had cancer. But, trying to explain to my little boy what was happening to him proved to be tougher still. ‘We told him he had nasty germs in his head, and he needed to take “magic medicine” to make it go away. ‘Every day we were forced to watch our little boy in pain and, as the treatment took its toll, it almost broke us.’ Support: Finn with Sarah, the Macmillian paediatric nurse described as 'our Christmas miracle' by the Middleton family . Jo and Paul with their sons Finn (left) and Jacob: They are looking forward to a cancer-free Christmas after Finn's last two scans came back clear . She added: ‘He had eight weeks of radiotherapy which was horrific. He was so good at getting into the hospital but was terrified of the radiotherapy as he has to be screwed to the table by his head. A cancerous tumour of the muscles that are attached to the bones. They can grow in any part of the body but are most common in the head, neck, bladder and testes. Symptoms of head and neck tumours include swelling of the eye and discharge from the nose. Symptoms of bladder tumours include blood in the urine and difficulty passing urine. Treatment depends on the location and size of the tumours but usually include surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Regular check-ups are needed once the child is in remission. The cause is unknown. ‘He used to play hide and seek when he was in the radiotherapy room and would kick his feet, screaming and terrified. He could only move his feet. It was heart breaking.’ Not only was Finn suffering but his brother, Jacob, 10, was also feeling the effects of the cancer.Jacob became the target of school bullies and was picked on about Finn’s hair failing out. The family hit rock bottom as Finn underwent treatment and Jacob came home from school in tears each day. Mrs Middleton said: ‘Then we were introduced to Sarah, a Macmillan nurse, and bit by bit our lives started to get better. ‘Sarah went to speak to the school to encourage them to think that the cancer affected both brothers. The teachers also spoke to their classes about the situation.’ Now, 18 months later, Finn is on the . road to recovery and was delighted to be offered the role of one of the . kings in the nativity play. However, . disaster almost struck for the budding actor when surgery to remove his . feeding tube was scheduled for the day of the play. Budding actor: Finn (in blue) wore the same costume his big brother Jacob had worn in a previous year . Recovering: Jo (left) said watching her son Finn in pain almost broke her and her husband . On hearing the news Mrs Middleton immediately called Sarah, who works at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, who was able to rearrange the surgery. As a result, Finn was able to take part in the play wearing the costume his brother had worn. His mother said: ‘He was poorly last year so missed being in the play. He was desperate to be in it this year as his brother was in it before and it was still the same costume. ‘He loved it so much he has since joined a drama group and a street dance class.’ Finn has now had two clear scans and there is no evidence of the cancer in his body. He will continue to have scans every three months to make sure the cancer has not returned. Mrs Middleton said: ‘Watching Finn on that stage for the play was the proudest moment of our lives and without Sarah it wouldn’t have been possible – she really was a Christmas miracle.’ For more information about Macmillan Cancer Support visit www.macmillan.org.uk .","Finn, 7, underwent 18 months of gruelling cancer treatment .

The New York Public Library is moving forward with a $300million renovation of its landmark Fifth Avenue building that will more than double its public space and fireproof the majestic main reading room, the library president said on Wednesday. But the plans he presented at a news conference have drawn withering criticism from some respected architecture experts, including Ada Louise Huxtable, who says the grand Beaux Art edifice is embarking on 'its own destruction.' Library President Tony Marx has a different vision for the building completed in 1911. New and improved: This artist rendering shows the entrance to a new lending library in a proposed $300million renovation of the New York Public Library . Design: British architect Norman Foster's vision will open up space in the back of the building that is now occupied by seven floors of stacks, creating a massive space with books, reading areas and desks . 'The driver of this project is to create the single greatest circulating and research library in the most beloved building here in the crossroads of New York,' he said. The institution that first opened in 1854 with money left by business magnate John Jacob Astor will be a more 'functional' facility after the renovation, Marx said. British architect Norman Foster's design will open up space in the back of the building that is now occupied by seven floors of stacks, creating a 100,000-square-foot contemporary space with books, reading areas and desks. A four-story atrium will overlook Bryant Park and Sixth Avenue. The library's Fifth Avenue entrance is to continue through to the atrium. Safety first: Part of the proposed renovation will include fireproofing of the Rose Main Reading Room, pictured . Construction is expected to begin next summer and be completed in 2018. The work will be mostly self-funded, Marx said. About $150 million comes from selling other library property. The renovation plan provoked controversy because the library initially proposed moving millions of books into storage in New Jersey to make room for the new circulating library. In response, officials revised their plan and now say that 3.3 million of the research library's 4.5 million volumes will remain on site, underneath the new space. Huxtable has other reservations. The New York architectural masterpiece 'is about to undertake its own destruction,' she wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal article, adding that 'irreversible changes of this magnitude should not be made in this landmark building.' Project: Construction is expected to begin next summer and be completed in 2018 . Foster, who has won the Pritzker Prize - architecture's equivalent of the Nobel - promises to 'respect' the building's basic structure and leave it intact, while using the kinds of materials already there, like wood, stone and bronze. The wood-paneled main reading room - the subject of many New Yorkers' most poetic memories - will remain intact but will be fireproofed since the open stacks below create a 'chimney effect,' Foster said. 'If there was a fire, the Rose Reading Room would be no more.' The library plan includes details like the conversion of old offices and storage areas on the second floor into space for scholars. A circulating library across Fifth Avenue from the main library is to be sold, as is the Science, Industry and Business Library on Madison Avenue; their contents will be moved to the main building. Get her: The library has been featured in numerous movies, including 1984's Ghostbusters . Can she read that sort of thing without her lipstick? The library was also a film location for Breakfast at Tiffany's . The library president said the resulting $15 million in annual savings will allow the main location to be open longer and will permit the acquisition of more books and the hiring of extra librarians. Marx noted that the city's 1.1 million public schoolchildren also will benefit, with more education resources and greater access to the library's collection. The plan awaits approval from city agencies and the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The library is a New York staple, and has served as the backdrop behind such films as Breakfast at Tiffany's, Ghostbusters and Spider-Man, and such TV shows as Law & Order and Gossip Girl. OMG: The library has also appeared on the small screen in TV shows like Gossip Girl, pictured, and Law & Order .","Renovation will double the historic landmark's public space and fireproof its majestic reading room .

Suspect: A car matching the description of Daniel Sanchez's was found outside the scene of a murder-suicide Tuesday . her what the . police report described as 'her new boyfriend.' According to the police report, she had been friends with the man while the two were dating. Sanchez the man on Silva's phone after taking it from her, then left a threating message and sent a text saying: 'I told you to leave her alone you are going to Pau.' The police report said 'Pau' was a typo that was supposed to be 'pay.' Sanchez also screamed, 'I am going to beat the s*** out of you' in a voicemail. 'Beatriz stated she was very scared of the way Daniel was acting,' the report read. She tried to get out of the truck but Sanchez sped off with her calling her a 'whore' and 'slut.' He took her to a 'dirt farm road' where he asked 'How can you be with someone else if you love me.' Silva later told police she was too scared of him to move. He eventually dropped her off at near the Best Buy near 3 p.m. Questions left: A man places white covers over his shoes while investigating the scene that has so far left its victims unidentified and a motive not known . He'd been abusive several times throughout their four-year relationship. 'He has threatened to hurt her if she ever contacted police or told . anyone about him being abusive,' read Sanchez's arrest report. 'Beatriz stated she has lived in fear and could not get away from Daniel . during their relationship.' The Weld County Sheriff's . Office was called to a home on 6:34 p.m. Saturday because of an 'unwanted party' banging on the door looking for Silva, the police report notes that . The home's address of was not listed police reports. A truck matching the description of Sanchez's white Dodge pickup with Texas plates was parked outside the murder-suicide crime scene. Weld County sheriff's spokesman Tim . Schwartz says dispatchers heard the woman's final cries of 'No, no, no,' before multiple gunshots were fired. Schwartz says a man then grabbed the phone and said he was going to kill himself before dispatchers heard another shot. One of many seen rushing to the scene today was Eddy Silva who identified two of the gunman's victims as her nieces. Ms Silva named Beatriz Cintora-Silva and sister Maria Cintora-Silva as the two women killed though they have yet to be identified by police. She said Beatriz had moved into her sister's home out of fear of Daniels, and that Maria was a newlywed only married a few months. Maria's husband was Max Aguirre. All of the name's Ms Silva gave matched those listed in Sanchez's arrest report. Daniels, Aguirre, Beatriz Cintora-Silva and Maria Cintora-Silva were all found dead in the house after the 911 call. Little known: Neighbors seen outside the home gathered to discuss the grisly scene with those interviewed saying the described young couple who lived in the house kept to themselves . Emotional day: A Weld County sheriff's spokesman said dispatchers heard a woman who called 911 scream just before a gunshot was heard fired, silencing her . Neighbor George Vibbert said that Maria and Max were planning to have children. Eddy Silva told the Post that she didn't know Maria's husband all that well. A . SWAT team entered the home just after 4am MST and found the four bodies . in the subdivision east of Longmont - about 35 miles north of Denver. Schwartz says investigators have a possible motive for the shootings, but he refused to release details. Police don't believe anyone escaped alive. 'I'm very angry and sad,' Eddy Silva told the Post. 'They were good girls. They were responsible. I believed in them.' Schwartz was not sure if there had been any previous calls to police at the home asking for help. A handgun believed to be the murder weapon was recovered with numerous rounds reported fired from it. Police are convinced the gunman was one of the victims. Slaying: Four people were found dead inside this Denver-area home early this morning after what police are saying was a triple-murder homicide . Cries for help: Police say two men and two women were killed with the suspected killer said to have taken a phone used by a victim to call police to inform dispatch of his plans to next kill himself .

'I . heard three pops and after that I heard screaming,' Joyce Vibbert told . The Post. 'I didn't hear any words — it was just screaming.'

A bragging burglary gang who boasted about their crimes by writing raps to each other following their raids has been jailed. The five man group recorded the congratulatory rhymes on their mobile phones, sending them to one another. The raps, largely made up of street slang, reference the sound of a 'patio breaking' and the burglars' craving for 'keys N watches'. Jailed: A rap detailing the burglaries was found on the mobile phone of David Levesconte, left, when police arrested him. Levesconte and Drew McWilliam, right, admitted conspiracy to commit burglary. Both have been jailed for 40 months . Despite the lyrics suggesting that a 'break in takes balls', the group's recordings eventually lead to their arrest. Police discovered a verse on a mobile phone, saying: 'That me n Levo on a break in.' Officers soon realised that 'Levo' was in fact David Levesconte, 22, one of the gang members. An exert of the rap found on David Levesconte's mobile phone . 'Cause I’m cold like snow when I’m flaking, . What’s that the sound of UR patio breaking, . That me n Levo on a break in .

The gang's haul included 24 luxury cars, computers, TVs laptops, games-consoles, watches and jewellery worth £400,000. The criminals were responsible for 65 burglaries across Manchester, Wilmslow and Handforth, Cheshire. Levesconte admitted conspiracy to commit burglary between 1 August 2011 and 30 December 201 at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. Drew McWilliam, 20, and Ryan Condron, 21, also admitted conspiracy to commit burglary at dwellings between the same time period. Each of the gang members was jailed for 40 months. Another trio, Shaquile Brown, 19, Jonathon Snape, 25, Jaymi Walker, 21, admitted handling stolen goods. Brown and Snape were jailed for two years, while Walker was given a 12 month community order.

A man convicted of abducting, molesting and killing a 10-year-old boy has been prevented from changing his name to Manasseh-Invictus Auric Thutmose V after converting to Wiccanism. Charles Jaynes, from Brockton, Massachusetts, had petitioned Plymouth Probate Court to change his name earlier this year claiming it was a 'Wiccan religious tennet.' At a hearing in November he said the name was given to him by God when he chose to follow the Wiccan faith. Petition: Charles Jaynes (left at his arraignment in 1997) was convicted of killing and molesting Jeffrey Curley (right). He has been denied permission to change his name to Manasseh-Invictus Auric Thutmose V . But a judge has ruled that Jaynes' petition for a . name change was 'inconsistent with public interests,' according to the Enterprise News.com of Brockton. The decision also stated that due to . Jaynes’ history of using aliases, concealing his identity and eluding . criminal prosecution, giving him permission to change his name would jeapardize public safety, reports the Enterprise. Jaynes, 37, is currently serving a life . sentence for luring Jeffrey Curley into his car along with another man, . Salvatore Sicari, with the promise of a new bike in 1997. When the boy resisted their sexual advances, Jaynes smothered him with a gasoline-soaked rag, took his body back to his Manchester apartment and molested his remains with Sicari. Plea: Jaynes' petition to change his name, which was filed in June, gave his reason for doing so as 'Wiccan Religious Tennet' The youngster's body was found six days later in a cement-filled container wrapped with duct tape in a river in Maine. On his name-change petition, filed in June, Jaynes listed his address as the Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater and his occupation as inmate. Wicca, also called Witchcraft or The Craft, is described as an underground religion based on natural innate powers by The Church of Wicca. The Neo-Pagan religion was developed in England in the early 20th century and became popularised by a retired British civil servant named Gerald Gardner throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Wicca adherents praise nature and nature's gods and goddesses. They practice outside in parks, gardens or fields. They endeavour to achieve self-awakening through dancing, singing, chanting, and with the use of herbs and incense. Despite some depictions, it has no connections with Satanism. The Wiccan pentacle, a five-pointed star inside a circle, is often confused with symbols of Satanism. In fact, the five points represent the elements of nature - earth, air, fire and water - and the spirit, within the eternal circle of life. The victim's father, Robert Curley, told the Enterprise that he was 'relieved' his son's killer would not be granted a name . change. 'That's very good news,' he said. 'I'll take any good news I can get this . week.' Jaynes and Sicari, then just 21, both blamed the other for the murder of James Curley. Sicari, now 36, was found guilty of first-degree . murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole in November 1998. He is serving his sentence in MCI-Norfolk. Jaynes' peculiar choice of name comes after his conversion to Wiccanism, also . known as Witchcraft. The Church of Wicca describes it as an underground religion based on natural innate . powers. The first part of the new name, Manasseh, means 'causing to forget' in Hebrew. 'Invictus' is invincible in Latin, while 'Auric' means something derived from gold. Thutmose V has the least obvious definition of all the names; it means born of the god Thoth, who served as . a mediating power between good and evil in ancient Egypt. It also could be a nod to Egyptian history, in which there were four Thutmoses who ruled as pharaoh over . the 18th dynasty of Egypt. But Thutmose V never existed; the fifth prince with that name died before he could take over his . father's power, and a younger brother assumed it instead. Gruesome: Jaynes, pictured at his trial, kidnapped Jeffrey Curley with another man on the promise of a new bike. When he resisted their sexual advances, they smothered him and molested his remains . Conversion: Jaynes said the name change is for Wicca, a pagan religion which worships nature (file picture) In December 1998, Jaynes was tried in East Brookfield instead of Cambridge - where Sicari had been tried - because of the publicity surrounding the case. He was found guilty of second-degree murder and kidnapping and sentenced to life in prison at Bridgewater Correctional Facility with parole eligibility after 23 years. In September 2009, he asked to leave prison to attend his father’s funeral in Brockton and was initially granted permission. Yet after public outcry, officials went back on their decision. The high-profile case also prompted talk of restoring the death penalty in Massachusetts.","Charles Jaynes had petitioned to change his name claiming it was a  'Wiccan religious tennet'

Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which has been in in orbit around Saturn for more than eight years, has taken its most stunning view of the planet yet. Engineers painstakingly positioned the craft on Oct. 17, 2012, during its 174th orbit around the gas giant, to take the image. It was deliberately positioned within Saturn’s shadow, a perfect location from which to look in the direction of the Sun and take a backlit view of the rings and the dark side of the planet. A stunning view of Saturn, taken while NASA's Cassini spacecraft was in Saturn's shadow. The cameras were turned toward Saturn and the sun so that the planet and rings are backlit . The images were obtained . with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 17, 2012 at a . distance of approximately 500,000 miles (800,000 kilometers) from . Saturn. Images were taken using infrared, red and violet spectral filters were . combined to create this enhanced-color view. Image scale at Saturn is about 30 miles per pixel (50 kilometers . per pixel). Looking back towards the Sun is a geometry referred to by planetary scientists as 'high solar phase'. This is a very scientifically advantageous and coveted viewing position as it can reveal details about both the rings and atmosphere that cannot be seen in lower solar phase. 'Of all the many glorious images we have . received from Saturn, none are more strikingly unusual than those taken . from Saturn’s shadow,' said Carolyn Porco, Cassini’s imaging team lead . based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado. 'They unveil a . rare splendor seldom seen anywhere else in our solar system.' The mosaic released does not contain Earth. Along with the Sun, our planet is hidden behind . Saturn. However, it was taken when Cassini was closer to Saturn and . therefore shows more detail in the rings than the one taken in 2006. The . new mosaic is composed of 60 images taken in the violet, visible and near . infrared part of the spectrum and processed in false color. Also captured in this image are two of Saturn's moons: Enceladus and Tethys, and both appear on the left side of the planet, below the rings. Enceladus is closer to the rings; Tethys is below and to the left. The last time Cassini had such an unusual perspective on Saturn and its rings, at sufficient distance and with sufficient time to make a full system mosaic, occurred in September 2006 when it captured a mosaic, processed to look like natural color, entitled 'In Saturn’s Shadow-The Pale Blue Dot'  In that mosaic, planet Earth put in a special appearance, making “In Saturn’s Shadow” one of the most popular Cassini images to date.

Copycat: Lizabeth Donohoe is charged with possession of a firearm by a minor and endangering the welfare of children after police recovered two handguns from her son's bedroom . A suburban Philadelphia teenager has been arrested after threatening to carry out a copycat shooting at his high school less than a week after the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Worried police reportedly recovered two handguns from the Council Rock South High Schooler's home after students - and their parents - tipped off  authorities on Thursday to the ninth-grader's ominous threats to harm his peers and teachers. In the teen's bedroom, Northampton Township Police easily discovered two 9 mm handguns in plain sight, according to Detective Sgt. Bill Klein, who added a more thorough search would ensue after the issuance of a search warrant. The student's mother was charged with drug and weapons counts, and a man at the home was also hit with obstruction of justice and resisting arrest raps, Klein said. The unnamed student remains at a juvenile facility. The Council Rock School District is located in Newtown, Pennsylvania which eerily shares the same name as the Connecticut municipality in which gunman Adam Lanza slaughtered 20 elementary school students and six adults Dec. 14. Council Rock South High School is located in nearby Holland. The student didn't reference the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in his own hreats, said Klein, who added, 'The statements were made in school by the juvenile to peers. It spread kind of rapidly.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A timely tip: Police searched the student's home after at least two fellow students - and their parents - alerted authorities to threats he had made during the school day . Easily found: Police searching the student's bedroom discovered the two guns in plain sight. A more thorough search will follow once a search warrant is obtained, police said . Scene of the crime: The Council Rock School District is located in Newtown, Pennsylvania which eerily shares the same name as the Connecticut municipality in which gunman Adam Lanza slaughtered 20 elementary school students and six adults Dec. 14 . Copycats: A spate of 'copycat' threats have swept the region following the Dec. 14 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. 'We determined early on that it was credible,' Klein added, 'We weren't sure he had the means to carry it out, but in affecting the arrest, we found the two handguns and that certainly ramped things up.' Council Rock South High School canceled classes Friday, but Klein said it appears no other students were involved in the 9th-grader's nascent plot. The district said it canceled classes so police could search the school. The incident comes as an alarming spate of such incidents further fray the nerves of an already jittery nation. On Friday, officials closed Emmaus High School in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania after a bomb threat, while police in suburban Pittsburgh took two students into custody after a pair of shooting threats at Hopewell High School. A troubling discovery: Police recovered electronic components and chemicals from inside the home of a 16-year-old Cedar Creek High School (pictured) student in Galloway Township, New Jersey . The perpetrator: This undated photo shows Adam Lanza in a Newtown High School yearbook photo. Meanwhile, police arrested a Mainland Regional High School student in southern New Jersey for an alleged text threat, while Absegami High School, also in southern New Jersey, tightened security following baseless reports of a Facebook 'hit list.' Perhaps most notably, police recovered electronic components and suspicious chemicals earlier in the week inside the home of a 16-year-old Cedar Creek High School student in Galloway Township, New Jersey. The troubling discovery came after the student's teacher reportedly noticed on Tuesday apparent drawings of weapons etched in the teen's notebook, according to The Press of Atlantic City. School officials contacted authorities, which searched the youngster's home. The unidentified teen was charged with possession of an explosive device and placed in Harborfields Juvenile Detention Center. As a precaution, bomb-sniffing dogs swept Cedar Creek High School to no avail. Authorities say students and teachers at the school were never in any danger nor were any threats made.","Police recovered two handguns from 9th grader's home in suburban Phialdelphia .

Ms Bego plunged to her death from the top of the building which housed her own gallery . An 'eccentric' co-owner of a high-end New York art gallery who plunged to her death from her Upper East Side shop had been facing mounting debt and personal problems, it has been revealed. Marijana Bego, 54, was found lying in the middle of Madison Avenue after falling from the top of the five-story building in the Upper East Side, home to her Bego-Ezair gallery on Madison Avenue. Police believe she committed suicide, according to the New York Post. The paper has reported she left a note in which she mentions the financial pressures and personal torment she’d been grappling with in her final weeks, according to a law-enformcent source. Artist Amy Cohen Banker, who saw her exhibit open last week at the gallery, said Ms Bego had been left frustrated after a fall in art sales. She said: 'But I never ever saw this coming. 'She had plans to keep the galleries going. 'It’s hard for me to believe she committed suicide, I feel really shocked that she did that.' Ms Bego, originally from Switzerland, owned two other New York galleries, which were frequently visited by members of high society such as the Hearst family and descendants of Winston Churchill, said the paper. Renowned for featuring up-and-coming talent in her galleries, Ms Bego was in business with real estate executive Khedoury Ezair. News of her death, which detectives at first believed was caused by a hit-and-run accident because if severe injuries to her legs, has sent shockwaves through the New York art scene.

The National Rifle Association on Sunday forcefully stuck to its call for placing armed police officers and security guards in every school as the best way to avoid shootings such as the recent massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Wayne LaPierre, CEO of the vocal gun rights lobbying organization, said the NRA would push Congress to pay for more school security guards and would coordinate efforts to put former military and police offers in schools as volunteer guards. 'If it's crazy to call for putting police and armed security in our schools to protect our children, then call me crazy,' LaPierre said in a broadcast interview. 'I think the American people think it's crazy not to do it. It's the one thing that would keep people safe. Scroll Down for Video . On NBC's Meet the Press National Rifle Association chief Wayne LaPierre Sunday refused to support new gun control legislation and maintained his support for putting armed guards and police in schools . Speaking on NBC's 'Meet the Press' LaPierre also contended that any new efforts by Congress to regulate guns or ammunition would not prevent mass shootings. His comments on NBC's 'Meet the Press' reinforced the position that the NRA took on Friday when it broke its weeklong silence on the shooting rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School. That stand has described by some lawmakers as tone-deaf. Senator Charles Schumer, says LaPierre blames everything but guns for a series of mass shootings in recent years. 'Trying to prevent shootings in schools without talking about guns is like trying to prevent lung cancer without talking about cigarettes,' Schumer said. The NRA plans to develop a school emergency response program that would include volunteers from the group's 4.3 million members to help guard children, and has named former Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., as national director of the program. Hutchinson said local districts should make decisions about armed guards in schools. The National Rifle Association remained defiant amid calls for more gun restrictions in the wake of the Newtown tragedy, calling instead for armed guards in American schools . 'I've made it clear that it should not be a mandatory law, that every school has this. There should be local choice, but absolutely, I believe that protecting our children with an armed guard who is trained is an important part of the equation,' he told ABC's 'This Week.' LaPierre said that now the United States is spending $2 billion to train police in Iraq and asked why federal funds could not be transfered to train school guards to protect schools in the United States. He also spoke about restricting the size of ammunition magazines and clips and said: 'I don't believe that's going to make one difference. There are so many different ways to evade that, even if you had that. 'You had that for 10 years when Senator Dianne Feinstein passed that ban in 1994. It was on the books. Columbine occurred right in the middle of it - it didn't make any difference.' Senator Feinstein was the author of a 1994 ban on semi-automatic weapons which expired in 2004. She has recently announced that she will attempt to write new legislation on those types of weapon next year. No new regulations: NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre broke his organization's silence on Friday rejecting new gun control measures and calling for more security and guns in schools . Divided: Wayne LaPierre's statement was interrupted twice by protests blaming the NRA for a culture of violence . 'I know there’s a media machine in this country that wants to blame guns every time something happens,' LaPierre said, but he insisted that an armed guard might have been able to stop Adam Lanza, the killer in Connecticut. 'If I’m a mom or a dad and I’m dropping my child off at school I’d feel a whole lot safer'. However, the NRA chief did concede that 'nothing is perfect' in the battle to deter crime. LaPierre also trained his sights on mental health care in the United States. 'We have a mental health system in this country that has completely and totally collapsed. We have no national database of these lunatics,' said LaPierre. 'We have a completely cracked mentally ill system that’s got these monsters walking the streets,' The controversial chief said that many states do not put their records of the mentally ill into a national instant check system that is designed to screen them from buying weapons. It's the media: LaPierre blamed violent games like Grand Theft Auto and films like American Psycho for encouraging young people to kill . Hijacked: The NRA broke its silence on Friday but it was a protestor who stole much of the limelight . He also said that the federal gvernment has not invested in a law preventing convicted felons from possessing guns. He said, 'If you want to control violent criminals, take them off the street.' Meanwhile, President Obama has asked Vice President Joe Biden with drawing up new gun legislation - with a deadline of early next month. When asked about this initiative, LaPierre said, 'if it’s a panel that’s just going to be made up of a bunch of people that for the past 20 years has been trying to destroy the Second Amendment, I’m not interested in sitting on that panel…. The NRA is not going to let people lose the Second Amendment in this country.' Passion: Before the NRA's statement on Friday President Obama released a video calling for public support for gun control . Following LaPierre on Meet the Press, Sen. Charles Schumer, D- N.Y., said that the NRA leader is 'so extreme and so tone deaf that he actually helps the cause of us passing sensible gun legislation in the Congress…. He is so doctrinaire and so adamant that I believe gun owners turn against him as well.' Schumer said that LaPierre believes 'the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is good gun with a gun. What about trying to stop the bad guy from getting the gun in the first place? That’s common sense. Most Americans agree with it.' Gun-control advocates reacted with disbelief Friday to LaPierre’s call for armed guards in every school and his blaming of Hollywood films, video games, and popular music for school shootings such as the one in Connecticut.

Mexico City is sponsoring a program offering cash, toys and computer equipment in exchange for guns in a rough neighborhood where a 10-year-old boy was killed by a stray bullet as he sat inside a movie theater. The program in the borough of Iztapalapa is dubbed 'For Your Family: Voluntary Disarmament.'Borough president Jesus Valencia wrote in his Twitter account Monday that residents had turned in 27 rifles and 65 pistols. The borough has been plagued by violent crime and people firing guns into the air during concerts and celebrations. A soldier organizes weapons that were handed over by their owners as part of a government program that exchanges weapons for bicycles, computers, tablets or money . In November, 10-year-old Hendrik Cuacuas was hit in the head by a 9-mm bullet during a visit to a cinema in the city. The shooting happened during a screening of the animated Disney movie ""Wreck-It Ralph"" in the crime-infested Iztapalapa borough. Investigators at first believed the shot had come from inside the theater, even though the boy's father and the cinema chain Cinepolis said that nobody had heard a gunshot or seen any muzzle flash. Authorities say 27 rifles and 65 pistols have already been turned in as part of the scheme . Mexico City's Iztapalapa area is one of it's most violent boroughs . The boy's father, Enrique Cuacuas, told local radio after the incident that he felt something 'whiz' by his ear and then saw his son Hendrick convulsing around 15 minutes after the movie started. But the prosecutor's office said that two holes were discovered in the theater's ceiling along with a 9mm slug on the floor, the same caliber as the bullet found in the boy's head. Drug and gang related violence is a problem across Mexico, with the country's drug trade being responsible for over 12,000 murders in 2011 alone.","Crime infested Iztapalapa seeks to clear streets of gun violence .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 07:16 EST, 20 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:17 EST, 20 December 2012 . British singer Amy Winehouse died in 2011 at the age of 27 . Famous solo artists are twice as likely to die prematurely as stars in bands, according to researchers from the University of Liverpool. The new research, published by online journal BMJ Open, suggests that solo performers in Europe have a one in ten chance of premature death – for American soloists the chance is one in five. The situation is much less dire for band members and researchers believe this could be due to support offered by fellow band mates. The researchers found that solo rock and pop artists from North America have a 22.8 per cent increased risk of dying prematurely compared with a 10.2 per cent increased risk for band members. They said that European solo performers had a 9.8 per cent increased risk compared with a 5.4 per cent increased risk for band members. The researchers raised the question of whether support offered by band mates may be protective. ‘Rock and pop star survival seems to relate to whether they have pursued successful solo careers,’ they wrote. ‘While this may simply be a proxy for level of fame, with solo performers often attracting more attention than, for instance, a drummer or keyboard player in a band, it also raises the issue of peer support as a protective factor. ‘Thus, further research should address whether bands provide a mutual support mechanism that offers protective health effects.’ Honey Langcaster-James, a psychologist who specialises in celebrity behaviour, also believes the support of a band may be protective. Amy Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning in 2011, aged 27 . Whitney Houston died in February this year at the age of 48. She accidentally drowned in the bath due to effects of cocaine use and heart disease . Michael Jackson died in 2009 at the age of 50. He had a heart attack while acutely intoxicated on propofol and benzodiazepine . Jimi Hendrix died in 1970 at the age of 27. He is believed to have choked on his own vomit while on sedatives . She told the BBC: ‘Solo artists in general approach life in a solitary manner - deliberately choosing to go it alone. ‘They can find themselves in a situation where everyone around them are paid employees - the PR guru, their manger - all interested in them from a financial point of view and not in their personal needs - it's hard for the artist to know who to trust. ‘They travel a lot, are away from friends and family for long periods of time and only seen for their public image, not their real self - which can make them feel inferior, isolated and invalidated.' She added that, even for the general population, psychology research has found that people with support have increased lifespan - and those in a band may benefit even more from this - they are all in the same boat. In recent years there have been a number of high profile premature deaths among solo artists including Amy Winehouse, Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson. Both Michael Jackson (left) and Whitney Houston (right) died prematurely. Jackson died at the age of 50 and Houston at 48 . The authors of the research examined data concerning 1,489 rock and pop stars who reached fame between 1956 and 2006. Of . these, 137 stars had died by the research cut-off point in February . 2012. The average age of death was 45.2 for American stars and 39.6 for . the European artists. The authors found that nearly half of those who died as a result of drugs, alcohol or violence had at least one adverse experience in their childhoods, compared with one in four of those dying of other causes. ‘Adverse experiences in early life may leave some predisposed to health-damaging behaviours, with fame and extreme wealth providing greater opportunities to engage in risk-taking,’ they said. ‘Millions of youths wish to emulate their icons. It is important they recognise that substance use and risk-taking may be rooted in childhood adversity rather than seeing them as symbols of success.’","Researchers claim soloists in Europe have a one in ten chance of premature death .

The Vietnamese government has issued a blanket ban on smoking in public places to replace old rules that have been completely ignored. The new law will also outlaw advertising tobacco products as well as the sale of tobacco products to those under 18 - something that has not been stipulated in Vietnam’s laws before. It is intended to beef up widely ignored rules enacted in 2010 that banned lighting up in public areas - including schools, hospitals, office buildings and on public transport. Blanket ban: A man smokes a cigarette outside a temple's wall murals in Hue. The new law will also outlaw advertising tobacco products as well as the sale of tobacco products to those under 18 . Despite the current legislation, bars and kiosks have continued to sell cigarettes on almost every street corner in capital Hanoi. The new law was passed by 440 out of 468 national assembly deputies on Monday and will come into effect in May next year. Flouting the law would incur heavy on-the-spot fines. According to The anti-smoking campaign group Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance (SEATCA), there are currently 15.3 million smokers in Vietnam. About 47.4 per cent of adult males smoke. Tobacco kills 40,000 people per . year in Vietnam and that figure is expected to rise to 70,000 per year . by 2030, according to local media reports. SEATCA welcomed the new law - the full text of which has not yet been released - saying it was a 'historic and important milestone' for the country. 'We are very happy about this development,' SEATCA director Bungon Ritthiphakdee said, adding that the final version of the law was strong and in line with the WHO-Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.","Tobacco advertising and sale to under 18s also banned .

The couple's jeep had got stuck in the snow on November 29 after they decided to go off-roading near the Sierra Nevada mountains. Lane is still recovering from serious frostbite but she said the most excruciating pain is from losing Clifton, who she is hailing a hero for risking his life to save hers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Heartbroken: Paula Lane, pictured, who survived six days in snow recounts her horror of finding her boyfriend's dead body . 'He died trying to save my life,' the mother of twin boys told Fox 40 News, breaking into sobs. She said she discovered Clifton's body days after the couple's jeep got stuck in the freezing wilderness and promised that she wouldn't let him be forgotten. 'I literally came across where he was laying in the middle of the road. He looked peaceful,' she explained, tears flowing. 'I wanted to kiss him but I didn't know if that would be right or not. So I just sat there for about a half hour and I talked to him and thanked him for trying to save my life and told him I would make sure he wasn't forgotten.' My hero: Lane, pictured, wanted to tell people how Roderick Clifton was a hero . Frostbite: Lane, pictured, is still recovering from severe frostbite . The couple got lost when they took a detour through the Sierra Nevada mountains on their way home from Lane's mother's home in California. The next morning, Clifton went to get help, leaving Lane in his Jeep, which was stranded on a secluded forest road. Lane survived six days in the freezing wilderness by sleeping in a hollowed out tree and eating green tomatoes. She was found by her brother, Gary, almost a week after she and Clifton set off on November 29. Lane is now safe at home in Gardnerville, recovering from severe frostbite. She can barely walk because of her injuries and remains in excruciating pain but wanted people to know that her boyfriend was a hero. 'I want people to know what a good person he was and that he would have done anything for anybody and he did not purposefully put me in danger and he risked his life to keep me out of it,' she said.

While she was trapped in the . terrifying snowstorm, Lane left a tearful video for her twin 11-year-old . sons, whom she feared she would never see again. 'I’m so sorry this has happened,' the . shaking, shivering mother said into the camera as she sat huddled in . Clifton's stranded Jeep. 'I just want to come home. As soon as . the sun comes out, I’m going to have to try to make it. It’s seven . miles in six feet of snow. Nobody’s ever going to find me here at . Burnside Lake.' Lane watched the video she recorded during the ordeal on the TODAY Show last week alongside her brother and his friend, Brian Roff. 'It’s really hard,' Lane said about viewing her sheer terror on the video. 'That’s only the fourth time that I’ve seen it. When . I first made the tape, I wanted it to be more of a happy goodbye. I . knew it was going to be a goodbye, I felt. Once I started talking, I . almost felt like somebody else was there with me, and I’m getting to . release to somebody.

Gone: Lane found Roderick Clifton, 44, dead miles from his Jeep after they went off-roading in the Sierra Nevada mountains and were trapped by a snowstorm . Lane recalled the emotional moment . when her boyfriend, Roderick Clifton left the car to get help, saying . that she warned him not to head out into the storm but he dismissed her . pleas. 'It's 9.09 in the morning, I remember . looking at my watch and I said please just wait, let's ride this out . together.

She was not dressed for cold weather and had to . use tissues and tape to make socks. She also huddled in a hollow tree for warmth at night. Lane was finally discovered by her brother when he heard her whistling loudly . as she was crawling towards the highway for help. 'I'd seen her in many different looks in her life and that look right there, that's the best one I'd ever seen,' her brother Gary Lane said of when he finally found his younger sister. Gary and his friend borrowed a front loader that is typically used on construction sites, and they searched throughout the wooded Sierra Nevadas near a campground that Lane used to frequent. The couple spent the first stranded night together in their car, but Clifton insisted on leaving for help the next morning. Lucky to be alive: Paula Lane was missing for six days before she was found crawling along a road in the Sierra Nevada Mountains . Mystery: Authorities are still unsure of Clifton's cause of death . It is believed the couple took their Jeep off-roading when they became stranded in the Sierra Nevada mountains somewhere off Highway 88/89 on November 29. Because of limited cell service in the high altitudes, authorities were unable to track their phones. 'We were told they were off four-wheel driving up that road and got . stuck,' said Citrus Heights spokesman Officer Bryan G. Fritsch. Clifton left the jeep on November 30 in an effort to seek help but he never returned. His body was discovered on Wednesday, several miles away from the highway. He is survived by three daughters. Survivor: It was Paula Lane's brother Gary, left, who found her. She is still recovering from frostbite at home . When her boyfriend failed to return, Lane waited in the vehicle until Monday when she decided to set out to look for him. She told rescuers she found his body as she tried to make her way to the highway. A massive manhunt had been launched on December 1 to search for the pair and her brother, Gary Lane, had rented a front loader and was patrolling the roadway. 'It's been a rough haul, waiting all those days, trying to know if she'd made it or not,' Lane's older sister, Linda Hathaway, said at a news conference at Carson Tahoe Regional Hospital, where Lane was admitted for first-degree frostbite and malnourishment, according to ABC News. Hathaway said they had prepared her sons for the worst. 'She is mighty and she's a survivor and loves life,' Hathaway said about her sister's strength amidst the terrifying ordeal.

A judge has awarded the pageant $5 million in damages . Bitter: Miss Monnin looks on (right) as Trump addresses the crowd at the competition this summer. He has now said he never believed Miss Monnin would take the crown and it is a case of sour grapes . 'I know what I heard, and I know what I in turn witnessed... so I’m prepared to continue to march forward,' Monnin responded on Today. 'I . feel an injustice has been done, not only to the other people who were . not in the top five, but to the thousands of pageant girls across the . country who competed, believing this is an honest system.' But Brez has also come forward to deny she made the claims seriously. 'Backstage . during the pageant, I did see a piece of paper with names on it and . like most people in such frenetic circumstances, joked that they must be . the names of the final contestants,' Brez said. 'It . was a throwaway comment, in the stress of the pageant, and was never . meant as fact. The list I saw didn’t even have the eventual winner on . it.' Monnin told Today she believes Brez changed her story out of fear. 'She looked a little bit scared because . she had just seen something that would potentially, drastically change . the reputation of the Miss Universe Organization,' she said. 'This is a big deal.' Top five: Monnin claims another contestant told her Miss Ohio, Miss Maryland, Miss Rhode Island, Miss Nevada and Miss Georgia would be the top five before they were even read out . Deserved? After the 51 contestants were whittled down, Olivia Culpo from Rhode Island was named the winner . Good answer: Culpo, pictured with hosts Andy Cohen and Giuliana Rancic, impressed during the Q&A round . Well, she didn't know: Culpo is surrounded by fellow contestants after being crowned Miss USA . The latest accuser, who was not identified, said Miss Brez had appeared 'very, very flustered and upset' as the top 15 girls were announced. 'I thought it might be because she . didn’t make the top 15 cut, but at that point she was able to reveal to . me at least four of the five names who went on to be the top girls,' the . contestant told FOX News. 'She couldn’t remember the fifth . because she was so upset. Several of the girls then started hearing . through the grapevine about a list; a lot of people were upset.' 'A lot of the girls now are very upset . about how Pennsylvania is being treated and aggressively attacked by an . organization that claims to empower women,' she said. Top . ten: Monnin said the contestant told her about the discovery as the top . 16 were announced. But organizers have said she resigned because she . was against the new rule allowing transgender contestants . Discovery: Monnin claimed the unidentified contestant saw the top five list backstage before the show . The top 15 girls are decided by preliminary judging in the days before the broadcast, and fan voting determines the 16th. The top ten, top five and winner are decided in the live show, a rep said. The scores for the competition are believed to be entered into a computer system as the show is live. These results are monitored and verified by Ernst & Young. 'In accordance with the rules of the competition, Ernst & Young's tabulation of the judges' votes which determined the final five contestants did not occur until after the evening gown competition had been completed,' a representative said. Judge Joe Jonas tweeted after the accusations: 'All I can say... Is the Miss USA competition was NOT rigged. Miss [Rhode Island] USA won fair and square.' The pageant named Ms Culpo, a 20-year-old cellist, the winner after she made it clear that she embraced all beauty queens - transgender or otherwise - during the interview portion. In the dreaded final question round, Ms . Culpo was faced with the most difficult question of the night: Would it . be fair for a person born a man to be named Miss Universe after becoming . a woman? Final rounds: But organizers said the contestant denied telling Monnin she had seen any such list . Rearly lovely: The pageant was held at the Planet Hollywood casino on the Las Vegas Strip . Ms Culpo never stumbled as she embraced the Miss Universe Organization's recent decision to admit transgender contestants. 'I do think that would be fair,' she said. 'But I could understand how people could be apprehensive to take that road.' It is an opinion that Monnin does not share. In her resignation email, she wrote: 'I refuse to be part of a pageant system that has so far and so completely removed itself from its foundational principles as to allow and support natural born males to compete in it. 'This goes against ever moral fiber of my being.  I believe in integrity, high moral character, and fair play, none of which are part of this system any longer.' Ms Culpo will represent the United States at the 61st Miss Universe pageant on December 19 at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Jacob Zuma is expected to spend at least another five years as President of South Africa after he was re-elected leader of his party yesterday. Zuma – who has been married six times and is estimated to have 20 children – defeated Kgalema Motlanthe, his only challenger for the leadership of the African National Congress, by 2,983 votes to 991. Other parties lack the support enjoyed in the post-apartheid era by the ANC, whose members dominate the National Assembly that elects the nation’s president for a five-year term. Re-elected: South African president Jacob Zuma's reign as leader of his party has been extended . Tycoon Cyril Ramaphosa, a former union leader whose net worth has been estimated at £450million, was elected his party’s No.2. Mr Zuma, who has faced corruption allegations since he became president in 2009, said: ‘What we do … is in the interest, not just of our organisation, but of our country and its people.’ A smiling Zuma came to the stage immediately after the announcement, waving to the cheering crowd with both hands. After his victory he said: 'We can boast that we’re a leader of our society, that therefore we have something to contribute to the democratic life of this country, to this democratic Republic of South Africa.' Ramaphosa is a former union leader who was African National Congress general secretary during the constitutional negotiations that ended apartheid in 1994. He went on to found an investment empire with interests that include a power plant, McDonald’s franchises, a Coca-Cola bottler and mines. In power: Zuma will now almost certainly be president of South Africa for the next five years following his re-election . Ramaphosa has been a leading figure behind the scenes in the ANC, though he shuns interviews and publicly offered no comments on policy or political matters ahead of the vote. His election sent Motlanthe out of the top rungs of power after his challenge. Zuma and Motlanthe later embraced for several seconds and spoke together on stage in view of delegates. Some 4,000 delegates voted in the ANC’s leadership contest at the party’s Mangaung conference, being held in the city also known as Bloemfontein. Defeated: Challenger Motlanthe has been left out of the top rungs of the party after he lost by nearly 2,000 votes . The run-up to the conference has seen disrupted provincial meetings, threats and shootings of local ANC officials, as corruption allegations trail from the smallest local government to Zuma at the top. That has many wondering whether the ANC still remains the party of reconciliation and racial fellowship that icon Nelson Mandela and others envisioned. Zuma, 70, was the favourite heading into the conference after winning the nominations in most provincial ANC polls. He has wide support among Zulus, South Africa’s largest ethnic group, as well as from a loyal cadre of government and party officials.","South African president re-elected as leader of African National Congress .

He is known as 'Sir Hairdryer' for his habit of bawling football players out in the locker room. But the long-serving Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that there is more to his unparalleled success than that - and surprisingly, it involves sensitivity. Sir Alex, the most successful manager in British football history, collaborated with academics at America's prestigious Harvard Business School to give a fascinating insight into his 26-year career running what is one of the world's biggest sports franchises. Back to the classroom: Sir Alex Ferguson flew to American to talk to students at Harvard Business School . And while his technique does undoubtedly involve a lot of shouting badly-performing players out, it also involves compassion and praise. 'For a player - and any human being - there's nothing better than hearing ""Well done"",' Sir Alex told the researchers. 'Those are the two best words ever invented in sports.' There's no doubting his approach works. Sir Alex Ferguson, who will be 71 . on New Year’s Eve, is known as the Premier League's greatest manager, . and the researchers in Boston wanted to assess his hugely successful . management style. Manchester United's chief executive David Gill said: 'Steve Jobs was Apple. Sir Alex Ferguson is Manchester United.' Challenge: Sir Alex Ferguson has had to change his approach over the years . Professor Anita Elberse and . Tom Dye worked with Sir Alex for months to produce their study, entitled Sir Alex Ferguson: Managing Manchester United. It reveals his blueprint for planning the season, match-day rituals, the . players he targets, keeping control of the dressing room and the . mistakes he made. The study also shows how he prepares his team, the way he conducts his team-talks and . how he changes a game's direction at half-time. Sir Alex said: 'Players these days have lived more sheltered lives, so they are much more fragile now than 25 years ago. ‘I was very aggressive all those years ago. I am passionate and want to win all the time. But today I’m more mellow. 'And I can better handle those more fragile players now. There’s all this hype about hairdryers and anger and so on. 'You can't always come in shouting and screaming. That doesn't work. 'But . there’s another side to it, which is more in terms of how I have . fostered relations with people and developed the team over the years.' His longtime secretary Lyn Laffin told researchers: 'If someone knocks on his door and they have a problem, the first thing he does is turn the chair around and say ""Sit down, let's talk"". Sir Alex also visited Harvard to take a class on management. He . told the official college newspaper Harvard Gazette: 'When you're . approached by an institution like Harvard, you know you are dealing with . top quality. 'I had to consider that I was opening myself up to something I've never done before. 'But at this stage of my life, I felt that I'm helping young people progress through their own routes to management, then ultimately that was an important and compelling factor for me. 'The part of the discussion from which I learned the most about myself was when they were discussing the balance between 'fear' and 'love' in my approach to managing people. 'If you look at my history, there's all this hype about hairdryers and anger and so on. 'But the students acknowledged another side to it, which is more apt in terms of how I've fostered relations with people and developed the team over the years.' The Manchester United manager also gave an impromptu pep talk to the college's American football team. Head coach Carl Junot said: 'They were expecting me to come in and given them the practice plan and in walks Alex Ferguson. They were blown away.' Not always 'Sir Hairdryer': Sir Alex Ferguson shows compassion to his players, too . Sir Alex Ferguson was born in 1941 and managed Scottish clubs East Stirlingshire, St Mirren and Aberdeen before taking over from Ron Atkinson at Manchester United in 1986. During his time at the club, he has notched up countless successes, including winning the Champions League twice, the Premier League 12 times, the FA Cup five times, and the League Cup four times. Since 1986 Manchester United has won 37 pieces of silverware, whereas before he took over, the club won 23 trophies in 134 years. In December 2010 Sir Alex overtook Sir Matt Busby to become the longest-serving manager of Manchester United.  Sir Matt was at the helm for 24 years, from 1945-1969. In terms of longest-ever manager, Sir Alex is second only to Fred Everiss, who managed West Bromwich for 46 years from 1902. Overall, Manchester United with Sir Alex in charge has played 1,471 matches, won 878, lost 263, and drawn 330.","Longest-serving Manchester United manager tells secrets of success .

Prosecutors asked a judge to dismiss . the charges Monday, saying their investigation needs more time. The . judge granted the motion. Bunch, 38, was sentenced to 60 years in prison in 1996 after a jury convicted her of pouring kerosene in the bedroom of her three-year-old son, Tony, and setting it on fire. But scientific breakthroughs and new evidence cast doubt on the original conviction. Bunch was greeted by her overjoyed mother Susan Hubbard, 58, and her 16-year-old son, Trenton, after she was released from prison in Greensburg, Indiana, in August. Taking in her first breaths of freedom in 16 years, a jubilant Bunch said she looked forward to doing . the everyday things that most people take for granted, like shopping, . eating out, and using the Internet, which she had never seen. ‘I can learn how to Facebook,’ she said. ‘All my friends tell me they're on Facebook.’ Victim: Tony was three-years-old when he died from carbon monoxide poisoning . She was released after the Indiana . Court of Appeals ruled that the evidence used to convict her was . outdated, weak and wrongly withheld from the defense. A Decatur County judge granted her $5,000 cash bail at the suggestion of prosecutors. On June 30, 1995, firefighters were called to Bunch's Greensburg mobile home to find it fully engulfed in flames. She was standing outside and told crews she tried to get to her son, but the flames were too hot. The body of the three-year-old was found huddled between the ashes of a burned bed and wall in a bedroom. The original trial heard that Bunch . poured kerosene in the bedroom of her son and the living room of their . mobile home before setting it ablaze.

Chicago . attorney Ron Safer told WTLX.com that the new evidence made it . impossible for the fire to have happened the way the state alleged and . that tests were incorrect. In actuality, tests showed Tony died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Had the fire been started in his room, as it was alleged, the child . would have died of burns from the fire rather than smoke inhalation. Bunch likened her experiences to a nightmare that wouldn't end and said . that though she was in a state of shock about being released, she was . joyful that she has the chance to prove the conviction was a mistake.

Two of the guns found at the scene of a recent Mexican drug cartel shoot out- where a beauty queen was found to have both fired at military officers and been used as a shield- were a part of the Fast and Furious gunwalking scandal. CBS News reports that two of the guns that were found at the scene of the fatal shooting in Sinaloa, Mexico last month can be traced to Fast and Furious exchanges, as one was purchased by an American agent involved in the case and another was brought in by a suspect. The closest link was obviously the FN Herstal pistol found near the shooting site that had previously been bought by Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent George Gillett, who was the assistant special agent in charge of the bureau’s Phoenix outpost. Dangerous beauty? Maria Susana Flores Gamez, the Mexican beauty queen killed in a shootout between suspected drug traffickers and soldiers, likely fired a gun during the clash in the Pacific coast state Sinaloa, a federal prosecutor said . Violent region: The gunbattle took place in a village in the drug-plagued western Mexican state of Sinaloa . CBS spoke with Mr Gillett, who still . works for the ATF, and he said that as an avid and informed gun . collector, he was sure to go ‘above and beyond’ the legal requirements . when he checked the immigration status of the man he sold the so-called . ‘cop killer’ gun to months before the shooting. That particular model of pistol is considered a ‘cop killer’ because so many Mexican drug cartels use it against police. The second questionable weapon found . near the shootout had been trafficked by Uriel Patino, a man who had . long been considered a suspect in the Fast and Furious case. Much of the attention surrounding the . fatal shooting that left three dead had been paid to Maria Susana Flores . Gamez, the 20-year-old Mexican beauty queen, who federal prosecutors . believe fired a gun during the clash. 'Innocent': Miss Flores' family says she was . simply a bystander on the way to work when she was caught in the . crossfire and killed. They claim she was not involved with the cartel . Authorities had previously said that . Flores Gamez was likely used as a human shield and that an automatic . rifle had been found near her body on Saturday, November 24. Federal prosecutor Enrique Fedegrino said Tuesday that tests indicate there was gunpowder residue on her hands. Flores Gamez, crowned 2012 Woman of . Sinaloa in February, came out of the car first with a gun in her hands . with the other gunmen hiding behind her, according to the attorney . general's office. The slender 5-foot-7-inch brunette had . competed with seven other contestants for the more prestigious state . beauty contest, Miss Sinaloa, but didn't win. Miss Sinaloa state winners compete for . the Miss Mexico title, whose holder represents the country in the . international Miss Universe pageant.

The 20-year-old state beauty queen died in a gun battle between soldiers and the alleged gang of drug traffickers she was traveling with last week . Local media outlets have continually to misidentified Flores Gamez as Miss Sinaloa. The organizers of the Miss Sinaloa . pageant issued a statement on the pageant's Facebook page, seeking to . make clear Flores Gamez was not their queen. The misidentification 'damages the image and tranquillity of our queens, their families and friends', the statement said. Neither the state nor national pageants responded to requests for comment on Flores Gamez's death. 'A lot of young women are attracted by . the false riches of the drug gangs.

Some men escaped, and the gun battle . continued along a nearby roadway, where the gang's vehicles were . eventually stopped. Six vehicles, drugs and weapons were seized . following the confrontation. Higuera said Flores Gamez's body has been turned over to relatives for burial. Competitive model: The slender, 5-foot-7-inch brunette had competed with seven other contestants for the state beauty contest, Miss Sinaloa, but didn't win . It was at least the fourth documented case of a beauty queen or pageant contestant becoming involved with Mexican drug traffickers, the theme of the critically acclaimed 2011 movie Miss Bala, or Miss Bullet, Mexico's official submission to the Best Foreign Language Film category of Academy Awards. The film tells the story of a young woman competing for Miss Baja California who becomes an unwilling participant in a drug-running ring, finally getting arrested for deeds she was forced into performing. In real life, top Sinaloa cartel drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman married local beauty queen Emma Coronel, who later crossed into the United States to give birth to twin girls in 2011. In 2008, former Miss Sinaloa Laura Zuniga was stripped of her crown in the Hispanoamerican Queen pageant after she was detained that year on suspicion of drug and weapons violations. She was later released without charges.

Three State Department officials, including two who oversaw security decisions at the diplomatic embassy in Benghazi, resigned under pressure Wednesday, less than a day after a damning report blamed management failures for a lack of security at the U.S. building in Libya where militants killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans on Sept. 11. Eric Boswell, the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, and Charlene Lamb, the deputy assistant secretary responsible for embassy security, have stepped down. A third official, who works for the Bureau of Near East Affairs, has also stepped down but hasn't yet been identified. The independent investigation of the Benghazi attack said poor leadership in both bureaus left the Benghazi mission underprotected. It concluded that management . and leadership failures in the State Department led to 'grossly' poor security at the U.S. consulate. Scroll down for video . Resignations: Eric Boswell was responsible for diplomats security and Charlene Lamb was in charge of security for the embassy in Benghazi . Attack: A U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 . 'Systematic . failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels . within two bureaus of the State Department resulted in a Special Mission . security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly . inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,' the panel said. The report singled out the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near East Affairs for criticism, saying there appeared to be a lack of cooperation and confusion over protection at the mission in Benghazi, a city in Eastern Libya that was relatively lawless after the revolution that toppled Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Despite those failures, the Accountability Review Board determined that no individual officials ignored or violated their duties and recommended no disciplinary action now. But it also said poor performance by senior managers should be grounds for disciplinary recommendations in the future. The report appeared to break little new ground about the timeline of the Benghazi attack during which Libyan Ambassador Chris Stevens, information specialist Sean Smith and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - who were contractors working for the CIA - were killed. Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the consulate in Benghazi . Stevens' slaying was the first of a U.S. ambassador since 1988. But it confirmed that contrary to initial accounts, there was no protest outside the consulate and said responsibility for the incident rested entirely with the terrorists who attacked the mission. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, administration officials linked the attack to the spreading protests over an American-made, anti-Islamic film that had begun in Cairo earlier that day. Those comments came after evidence already pointed to a distinct militant attack. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on numerous TV talk shows the Sunday after the attack and used the administration talking points linking it to the film. Derailed: Susan Rice appeared on numerous talk shows after the attack and used talking points linking it to the anti-Islam film . An ensuing brouhaha in the heat of the presidential campaign eventually led her to withdraw her name from consideration to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state in President Obama's second term. The review board determined that there had been no immediate, specific tactical warning of a potential attack on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. However, the report said there had been several worrisome incidents in the run-up to the attack that should have set off warning bells. While criticizing State Department management in Washington along with the local militia force and contract guards that the mission depended on for protection, the report said U.S. personnel on the ground in Benghazi 'performed with courage and readiness to risk their lives to protect their colleagues in a near-impossible situation.' It said the response by Diplomatic Security agents on the scene and CIA operatives at a nearby compound that later came under attack itself had been 'timely and appropriate' but absolved the military from any blame. 'There was simply not enough time for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference.' The State Department sent a classified version of the report to lawmakers on Tuesday and shortly thereafter released an unclassified version. The report made 29 recommendations to improve embassy security, particularly at high threat posts. In an accompanying letter to Congress, Clinton thanked the board for its 'clear-eyed, serious look at serious systemic challenges' and said she accepted all the recommendations. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died of smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle with insurgents . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . Some of those challenges were revealed in earlier congressional hearings when several State Department officials discussed competing demands for security and cost prohibitions. Clinton said the department had already begun to implement some of the recommendations. They include increasing by several hundred the number of Marine guards stationed at diplomatic missions throughout the world, relying less on local security forces for protection at embassies, consulates and other offices, and increasing hiring and deployment of highly trained Diplomatic Security agents at at-risk posts. Members of local Libyan militias provided some security around the consulate, but in the attack it became unclear whose side they were on. The report also called on Congress to . fully fund the State Department's security initiative, noting that . budget constraints in the past had led some management officials to . emphasize savings over security despite numerous requests from the . Benghazi mission and embassy in Tripoli for enhanced protection. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . 'For many years the State Department has been engaged in a struggle to obtain the resources necessary to carry out its work with varying degrees of success,' it said. This has led to efficiencies but also 'had the effect of conditioning a few State Department managers to favor restricting the use of resources as a general orientation.' It said the number of Diplomatic Security staff in Benghazi before and on the day of the attack 'was inadequate despite repeated requests ... for additional staffing.' 'The solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department needs, which, in total, constitute a small percentage of the full national budget and that spent for national security,' it said. 'Congress must do its part to meet this challenge and provide necessary resources.' On her way out: In a letter to lawmakers, Clinton urged Congress to support the State Department's security requests . Congress has denied some funding requests from the State Department for more security. In her letter to lawmakers, Clinton urged Congress to support the department's security requests, noting that 'all of us ... have a responsibility to provide the men and women serving this country with the best possible security and support.' Retired Ambassador Thomas Pickering and a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Adm Mike Mullen, led the independent review, studying thousands of pages of cables and other documents, hours of video and intelligence and interviewing more than 100 people, including survivors.

Christmas letters from German Second World War soldiers have finally been delivered 71 years after they were stolen during the occupation of Jersey. The 86 cards and letters, written by Nazi soldiers to their loved ones back home, were discovered five years ago hidden in the back of a piano. After months of painstaking research the greetings, dated December 16 and 17, 1941, have finally been handed to their intended recipients. Emotional: Michael McNally, from Jersey Post, and Klaus Kaiser from Deutsche Post deliver a 71-year-old letter to farmer Engelbert Bergmann . It took months of research to find relatives such as Engelbert Bergmann, left . Engelbert Bergmann said it was 'very important' for such letters to be delivered for the families of the soldiers . Moving: One of the lost Christmas cards . Stolen: The cards lay hidden inside a piano after they were stolen by a group of teenagers during the occupation of Jersey . Michael McNally, head of international development at Jersey Post, which worked with their German counterparts on the project, said delivering the Christmas gift as ‘a really emotional experience for all’. Ten of the ninety letters were delivered on Tuesday - the date they would originally have been received. One letter said: ‘I wish you a merry Christmas and all the best for the New Year. ‘But what I hope most is that the war will come to an end soon, so that we can all enjoy life again.’ Farmer Engelbert Bergmann, 55, of Frankfurt, received a letter written by soldier Emil Adam, a neighbour of his grandfather. He . said: ‘I feel it is very important to have the other letters delivered . in these cases where family or sons and daughters are still around.’ Michael McNally of Jersey Post said being able to deliver ten of the lost letters was 'beyond our hopes' Another from Lance-Corporal Lothar Wilhelm's fiancee Kaete Schwartz read: 'Christmas won't be so happy for me this yer, because I'm only happy when I'm with you. God grant that we can spend next year's Christmas together again', according to The Times. They were delivered to her grandchildren. The bag of letters were stolen by a group of teenage boys from a German Army post office in St Helier in 1941 - 18 months after the invasion of the Channel Island. It was one of a number of small acts of resistance carried out by islanders. But even that small act could have resulted in deportation or even death. They remained hidden in the piano until 2007 when they were handed to the Jersey Archive by an anonymous man. Although the teenagers survived the war they vowed to never speak of the theft again. Jersey Post spokesman told The Times a 16-year-old friend had been asked to hold onto the letters and still feels 'very strongly' that it will be wrong to talk about it now. Handwriting experts, the German military and the German Red Cross were all consulted by Jersey Post and Deutsche Post during their research. One of the festive cards that never made it back to Germany . This envelope features a Nazi stamp . Ten of the 86 lost cards and letters have already been delivered . German soldiers stationed in Jersey during the occupation . Felix Blaich, from Deutsche Post, said finding the recipients was difficult because many had moved or were no longer alive, some were addressed to PO Box numbers which no longer existed and others were marked for places which were not part of modern Germany. He said: ‘We had to translate the old street names into the 2012 addresses. ‘Then we found out that not many of the addresses had people living with the same name any more so we used our address expertise, our databases, our military mail experts as well as registry offices.’ Mr McNally said: ‘When we were first asked to help we thought it would be an impossible task. So much time has passed and Germany has changed considerably, both geographically and demographically. ‘When we started out on this journey we thought it would be fantastic if we could find members of just one of the families involved to find ten is beyond our hopes. 'That’s the power of receiving something hand-written from someone close to you.' At the time of the theft, islanders were beginning to be prosecuted for small acts of resistance and insulting the authorities. The Channel Islands surrendered to Nazi forces in 1940 without a fight as Winston Churchill deemed them indefensible. In Guernsey children of school age were evacuated and most of Aldernay's residents chose to leave. In Sark islanders were encouraged to stay. In Jersey most islanders stayed, either through choice or because they could not get out. Shortly before the invasion, 23,000 people queued in St Helier for days to register for the few boats travelling to the mainland. Only about 7,000 managed to flee before the German invasion. The Channel Islands, including Herm, became heavily militarised as Adolf Hitler saw them as a strategic point from which to launch an invasion of France. During the occupation, the courts and the government were taken over and a register of the island's Jews was created. A curfew was also imposed on the islanders and people aged 14 or over had to carry identification cards. Radios were confiscated but many had been hidden to allow residents to listen to the BBC. Towards the end of the occupation, islanders were faced with starvation when routes to the islands were cut off following the D-Day landings. It was only averted when the Red Cross was permitted to drop off drastically needed food and supplies. The islands were liberated on May 9, 1945.","Teenagers took the bag of Christmas greetings as act of resistance in 1941 .

"Government planned to sell port to help pay off record debts . Transport minister Simon Burns cited public opposition in his decision to keep it . Dame Vera Lynn supported campaign to keep Dover 'forever England' By . Hayley Dixon . PUBLISHED: . 07:26 EST, 21 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:09 EST, 21 December 2012 . For generations Dover has stood as an indomitable symbol of Britain's . freedom and independence. And now residents have proved they have earned the reputation after forcing the government to remove the port from their list of assets up for grabs. The town, with its white cliffs, port and sprawling castle stood at the very edge of the nation's frontier with the Continent but it was nearly flogged to our former age-old enemy - France. Scroll down for video . Dover, Europe's busiest port, was going to be sold off to help pay of the Government's record debt levels but was saved after massive local opposition . But now Dame Vera Lynn can relax as in the face of public opposition the port has been saved from the prospect of falling under French control as the government scrapped plans to sell it off to the highest bidder – rumoured to be the local authority of Calais. Transport minister Simon Burns withdrew Dover from the table of trophy assets -  including the UK's air traffic control . system, the student loans company and the Tote bookmaker - which are being sold  to help cut the country's record £1.1trillion debt . Europe's busiest passenger port Dover handles 13 million passengers and 5milion vehicles, transporting £50billion worth of goods year on year. In a ministerial statement accompanying the decision Mr Burn's said he could not guarantee 'sufficient level of enduring community participation in the port' if it was sold off. Transport minister Simon Burns announced that the port was no longer on the table and referred to petitions and campaigns in his letter of explanation . He wrote in a letter explaining his decision: 'The secretary of state also noted the strength of local opposition to the proposed sale and that this might create uncertainty about a sale at this time. 'It is uncertain what price would be achieved in the current climate.' The leading bidder was rumoured to be Nord-pas-de-Calais regional council, which also owns Calais. The French port is just 21 miles away across the Channel . The Dover People’s Port Trust Ltd, which demonstrates the local opposition, has some 1,200 paid up members and 97.5 per cent of them opposed the sell off plans. They campaigned for ""Keeping the nation's gateway forever England"" and had a string of celebrity supporters including Dame Vera . Mr Burns also recognised that more than 770 people and organisations had made formal representations and more than 6,500 had signed three separate petitions against the sale when making his decision. The letter said key concerns were 'security, immigration and its historic significance'. In order to avoid the port falling into foreign hands some of the local residents had clubbed together to propose buying it for the community. Dover's Conservative MP, Charlie Elphicke, told the Guardian that the town's ""magnificent victory"" saving the port for the nation was the ""best Christmas present the people of Dover could have"". He said: ""The port of Dover is the gateway to our nation and should be forever England as much as Stonehenge and Buckingham Palace. The whole community is absolutely delighted that it won't end up owned by the French or the Chinese or anyone else. ""Think of the port and the white cliffs and you think of freedom and victory over tyranny."" The chalk cliffs at Dover are treasured natural landmarks and were once named in a poll as Britain's fifth greatest natural wonder . But the chief executive of the Port of Dover, Bob Goldfield, warned that the would have brought  a £10million winfall to the local community and brought in millions more over the next few years. The Dover Harbour Board, which own the port, had applied for privitisation in 2010 and it is said the cash was needed to invest in infrastructure. When Gordon Brown first announced proposals to sell the port he was greeted with an angry reaction and accused of having ""no sense of the history"" but it was believed it could have netted up to £ 350million for the Treasury. Since the decision was announced the local residents have fought long and hard to keep the port in the hands of the British. The sale to the French company . would have marked a dramatic reversal in the fortunes of the two towns. Calais was captured by the English under Edward III in 1347, and the . occupation lasted for more than two centuries. From 1536, the town sent . MPs to Parliament but the French recaptured the town in 1558. Other major ports were sold off under the 1991 Ports Act, but Dover was . retained because of uncertainty over how construction of the Channel . Tunnel might affect it.","Government planned to sell port to help pay off record debts .

A shamed senior nurse who performed Nazi salutes in front of a Jewish colleague and groped a female co-worker has been struck off. Stephen Johnson, 54, also sent an explicit photo to the woman at a mental health unit in Colchester, Essex. A Nursing and Midwifery disciplinary panel was told that father-of-two Johnson - a deputy manager at the Severalls House unit - had goose-stepped around a room of patients. He also reduced a patient, who was specifically targeted by Johnson and believed that the nurse of 28 years experience was Adolf Hitler, to tears. Appalled former colleagues told the hearing how Johnson created a 'culture of fear' in the unit, with staff too frightened to reveal what was happening in case they lost their jobs. Eventually two members of staff plucked up the courage to make a complaint but Johnson claimed he had been made a scapegoat by management. But he was found guilty of serious misconduct and struck off the nursing register for life. The panel heard how Johnson grabbed one female colleague several times, tried to kiss her and sent an explicit image to her phone. Staff were regularly shocked by Johnson's behaviour at the rehabilitation centre for adults with serious and long term mental health illnesses. Karen Russell, a healthcare assistant, told the panel how Johnson - who did not like anyone who was not English - encouraged a patient to goose-step and make Nazi salutes. He told one shocked foreign nurse: ""BNP, go home"" and made a Nazi salute in front of a Polish colleague. She also described how her twisted colleague would regularly fondle the genitals of a male patient. Hospital: Stephen Johnson worked at The Severalls, in Colchester, Essex, pictured . The hearing in London also heard how he made racist comments to a Ukrainian Jewish healthcare assistant, calling him names of Arab terrorist groups. Johnson was reported to the police after one incident where he allegedly attempted to grab the healthcare assistant's genitals but no charges were brought against him due to a lack of evidence. The panel found him guilty of eight charges relating to the incidents which tools place between January 2008 and October 2009. James Spencer, chairman of the disciplinary committee, said: 'Mr Johnson abused his position of power and authority with staff and patients. 'He was guilty of discrimination on racial and disability grounds. Johnson, who had been suspended and later resigned following the allegations, was struck off in order to 'protect the public'.","Stephen Johnson was banned from nursing for life by a disciplinary panel .

"Dookhan is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court . By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:00 EST, 20 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:58 EST, 20 December 2012 . A former Massachusetts drug lab chemist at the center of a scandal that threatens to unravel thousands of criminal cases pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges including perjury and evidence tampering. Annie Dookhan, 35, also convinced a judge at her arraignment on Thursday to push her 6 p.m. curfew back to 10 p.m. because it was crimping on her social life. Dookhan's arraignment on 15 charges in Suffolk Superior Court could be the first in a series of arraignments in other counties following a 27-count grand jury indictment Monday. Busted: Annie Dookhan was indicted Monday, December 17, 2012 on 27 charges, including obstruction of justice, tampering with evidence, perjury and pretending to hold a college degree . Doesn't stop here: Many more cases could be affected because authorities have said Dookhan tested more than 60,000 samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at the lab . State prosecutors allege Dookhan . fabricated test results and tampered with drug evidence while testing . substances for criminal cases. Judges have released about 200 defendants . from custody in the last few months and put those cases on hold. Many . more cases could be affected. Authorities say Dookhan tested more . than 60,000 samples involving 34,000 defendants during her nine years at . the lab. State police shut down the lab in August. Dookhan made no comment to the media outside the Boston courtroom . after she pleaded not guilty to eight counts of evidence tampering, five . counts of witness intimidation, one count of perjury and one count of . making a false claim of holding a master's degree. In court, the Franklin woman stood behind her lawyer and blinked . repeatedly while looking toward the magistrate's bench. 'Not guilty,' she replied to his questions about the 15 counts. Magistrate Judge Gary Wilson agreed to change Dookhan's nightly curfew . hour from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. after her lawyer said the earlier hour was . hampering the social life of a defendant who already was on GPS . monitoring and had no criminal record. 'She's not a flight risk. It's certainly putting a damper on her ability . to have any kind of a social life, interact with the neighbors and . family and friends,' defense lawyer Nicolas Gordon said. Dookhan also remained free on $10,000 bail. 'Ripple effects': Dookhan's 'alleged actions have sent ripple effects throughout the criminal justice system' state Attorney General Martha Coakley said . Afterward, Gordon said he hasn't seen all of the government's evidence 'so it's too soon to comment' on aspects of the case. 'I'm told there's thousands of emails out there and I haven't seen them yet,' he said. Authorities alleged in court records Thursday that Dookhan once emailed a . fake test result to a prosecutor for use in a criminal case, relying on . a sample that had been gone from the lab for about six months. Authorities have said Dookhan admitted to investigators she sometimes . would 'dry lab' samples, meaning she would test some samples for drugs . and assume the others were positive. She also allegedly admitted she . sometimes added a known narcotic to a sample to turn it positive if it . tested negative. In addition, authorities claimed Thursday that Dookhan testified 14 . times that she had a master's degree in chemistry from the University of . Massachusetts-Boston although investigators found she was never . enrolled in classes at that level. The only potential motive authorities say they can offer in the case is Dookhan's desire to be seen as a good worker. Career ambitions: The only motive authorities have described is that Dookhan wanted to be seen as a good worker . 'Messed up bad': 'I screwed up big-time,' Dookhan is quoted as saying. 'I messed up bad; it's my fault. I don't want the lab to get in trouble' Dookhan faced suspension from her lab duties in June 2011. Authorities . alleged that dozens of drug samples weren't properly checked out of a . safe and that Dookhan forged a colleague's initials to try to cover her . misconduct. She resigned in March during a Department of Public Health internal . investigation. Amid that probe, state police took over the lab in July . as part of a state budget directive. nnie Dookhan, 35, of Franklin, was . indicted by a grand jury on 17 counts of obstruction of justice, eight . counts of tampering with evidence, perjury and pretending to hold a . college degree. ‘We . allege that Annie Dookhan tampered with drug evidence and fabricated . test results on multiple occasions,’ state Attorney General Martha . Coakley said. ‘Her alleged actions have sent ripple effects throughout . the criminal justice system.’ Repercussions: Dookhan's alleged misconduct led state police to shut down a state lab used by police departments to test drugs in criminal cases .","Annie Dookhan, 35, accused of deliberately faking test results on drug samples in criminal cases .

Town halls should stop spending a fortune on expensive leadership training courses run by groups such as Common Purpose, Eric Pickles has said. The Local Government Secretary called on councils to spend less on the organisation, described as the Left’s answer to the old boys’ network, which provides leadership advice. He said it was wrong that town halls spent thousands of pounds sending staff and councillors on such courses at a time when front-line services were under threat. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has launched a booklet for councils called '50 Ways To Save Money' The advice was contained in a booklet, 50 Ways to Save, which includes ideas from Mr Pickles on how to make deeper cuts without affecting public services. Other ideas include spending less on translating documents, and ending the collection of ‘intrusive’ questionnaires from suppliers and residents about their sexuality and religion. Mr Pickles said: ‘Every bit of the public sector needs to do their bit to pay off the budget deficit inherited from the last administration. ‘Councils should focus on cutting waste and making sensible savings to protect frontline services and keep council tax down.’ Last month the Daily Mail revealed that Common Purpose had direct or indirect links to three of the assessors to the Leveson inquiry, including Sir David Bell. He is one of the trustees of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which carried out the botched investigation into child abuse at a Welsh care home which led to the naming online of former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine. The 50 Ways to Save document says: ‘End expensive leadership courses. Councils could review spending money on sending staff and councillors to expensive “leadership” training courses, such as Common Purpose. Such training courses can often run into tens of thousands of pounds.’ Mr Pickles also called on town halls to stop spending thousands of pounds translating papers into other languages, saying it encourages segregation. He added: ‘Similarly, do not give community grants to organisations which promote segregation or division in society.’ The document also calls on town halls to end ‘lifestyle and equality questionnaires’. ‘Some councils spend time and money on asking suppliers and residents to fill out intrusive questionnaires about their sexuality, religion and other personal details – be it to take out a library book or make a planning application. ‘This is simply not necessary. Similarly, councils do not need to routinely spend time and money on equality impact assessments on everything they do.’ Mr Pickles said senior staff pay should be cut, recruitment should be frozen, first-class travel should be banned, and spending on outside consultants slashed. Labour introduced the gold-plated pensions on September 12, 2001 – the day after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York – in an infamous attempt to ‘bury bad news’. More than 4,500 councillors have signed up, at a cost to taxpayers of £7million a year. Now the Coalition is proposing that, from 2014, the entitlement will be axed and councillors will no longer be able to enrol on the scheme. They say it will stop the trend of councillors seeing their position as a job, rather than something they do for the good of the community. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It will also restore faith that councillors are there to represent residents rather than forge a career as a professional politician.’ Councillors are to be banned from having taxpayer-funded pensions. Ministers are propose stop allowing councillors’ access to the Local Government Pension Scheme, saving £7million-a-year. More than 4,500 councillors signed up to the gold-plated pension scheme by 2010-11. Local . government minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Every bit of the public sector . need to do its bit to help pay off the unsustainable deficit left by . the Labour Party. ‘Conservatives . believe that councillors are civic volunteers undertaking public . service; they are not, and should not be, state employees of the council . dependent on the municipal payroll.’ The policy of give councillors pensions paid for by the taxpayer was introduced by the Labour government. It was the ‘bad news’ announcement that spin doctor Jo Moore wanted to ‘bury’ on the day of the 9/11 terror attacks in the US. She emailed: ‘It is now a very good day to get out anything we want to bury. Councillors expenses?’","Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to spend less on the organisation .

An Alabama woman slept soundly on her couch on Friday while a tornado ripped off part of her roof and damaged most of her home. She finally awoke when firefighters and neighbors came to check on her. Betty Russell, who will turn 77 on December 26, said she slept through the violent storm Thursday night after she dozed off on the sofa watching TV. Wrecked: Homeowner Betty Russell described how her Paris Avenue home was damaged after severe weather snapped pine trees that crashed into the house . Deep sleeper: Betty Russell of Alabama slept soundly while a tornado ripped off part of her roof and damaged most of her home . She was woken by sirens from rescuers in the area after the tornado passed. ‘I didn't know I was that heavy a sleeper,’ she said. ‘It had caved in the south side of my house and honestly I didn't hear it. I cannot believe I didn't hear it but I didn't.’ Russell walked threw her debris-strewn house and looked at the hole in the ceiling of her bedroom, where she usually sleeps. ‘There is a huge hole right where her bed is,’ her grandson, Scott Russell, 13, said. ‘She usually goes to sleep in that bedroom, but for some reason she didn't do it this time and she was saved.’ Betty Russell believes angels helped keep her safe. She collects small statues of angels and has them displayed on bookshelves, tables and glass cases throughout the home where she has lived since 1962. Russell said her two most important angels are her husband and son, who died at different times both within weeks of Christmas. Whirlwind: A tornado caused pine trees to come crashing down aroud Russell's house . Where it happened: The tornado swept through Dauphine Acres, Alabama, where Russell, 76, lives . ‘I love angels and I was just in Rome last month in November and I just enjoyed the basilicas and other places we toured with paintings and statues of little chubby angels,’ she said. ‘Personally, I feel like I have two angels, my son and my husband, so feel like I was looked after.’ She doesn't know when she will start repairs to her roof, bedroom and the outside of her home. She plans to go ahead and spend Christmas with family in Colorado, something she was looking forward to before the storm. Devastation: The storm pulled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs . In the meantime, she is counting her blessing that she wasn't harmed. ‘I am so thankful to God,’ she said. As passersby stopped to check out the massive trees that smashed into the house and crushed a neighbor's SUV, the Russell family quietly salvaged what they could and marveled that she wasn't hurt. ‘She was actually woken up by the sirens and didn't know what happened until the fireman escorted her outside,’ daughter-in-law Phyllis Russell said. ‘We are just so thankful that she is OK. She is a strong woman and she is definitely a role model.’","Betty Russell, 76, of Alabama slept while a tornado ripped off part of her roof and damaged most of her home .

Dedicated to the Claus: Britain's longest serving Santa Ron Horniblew, has set up his own Santa school after 48 years of playing father Christmas . The top toys on children's wish lists might change every Christmas, but each year there is one constant that brings joy to youngsters around the world - Santa Claus. And one Father Christmas has become something of an ever present just like the real thing. At 77, Ron Horniblew, or Santa Ron as he is known, is Britain's longest serving Santa. For the past 48 years, Ron of Luton, Bedfordshire, has been donning his red suit and putting a smile on the face of thousands of youngsters - he has even won awards for his Santa skills. His Christmassy career started when he dressed up as a novel way of delivering presents to his son back in 1964. But he enjoyed it so much that he began dressing up as Santa for his friend's children too, before moving into grottos and using his jolly demeanour to raise money for charity. Over the decades, Santa Ron has raised thousands of pounds for charity and delivered sack loads of gifts to youngsters. He has even visited children at an orphanage in the Bahamas, attended Santa conferences and competitions in Sweden, Norway and Denmark and was crowned the World's Best Santa in 2004. To mark his dedication to Christmas, Ron has been awarded a 40-Year-Service award and is one of the only British Santa's entitled to wear the official Santa badge after being authorised by Santa Claus of Greenland. He said: 'I started dressing up as Santa when my son Graham was young, friends of mine then asked if I could come round and visit their children and it just snowballed from there. 'I just loved seeing the surprise and happiness I could bring to people. Early days: Ron, now 77, pictured in 1964, recieved a 40-year-service award and is one of the few British Father Christmases to be allowed to wear an official Santa badge .

'On Christmas morning I visit lots of different families I leave around 7.30am and I'm home in time for my Christmas dinner at 2.30pm. 'During my Christmas visits I arrive ringing my bell, the parents usually leave the presents in the porch or on the doorstep for me and I put them in my sack and deliver them to the children. 'To see the look on their faces when I arrive is wonderful, I spend time chatting to the children and pose for photos with the family. 'It just makes Christmas morning that little bit more magical, when I leave the house and everyone is smiling it makes it all worthwhile. 'I really enjoyed competing in the competitions, I have both a bronze and a gold medal. And being named World's Best Santa was a proud moment. World renowned: Ron, pictured left, with a troop of other Santas, was once crowned World's Best Santa at a global competition in 2004 . Well trained: Ron says there is more to being a successful Santa than dressing in red and saying Ho, Ho, Ho. He says it's about listening to the children and making them feel special. He's pictured at the Bakken Santa Claus Annual Congress which he attended in 2004, 2006 and 2008 . 'But the highlight of my career has to be seeing the smiles on the faces of the children I visited at an orphanage in the Bahamas. 'They were the most fantastic children I've ever came across, they were so loving and appreciative.' Even though Ron no longer enters competitions, he has launched his own Santa school in the hope of teaching would-be Father Christmasses. He said: 'I take my job as Santa very seriously, it isn't just about dressing up in a red suit and saying Ho Ho Ho! 'Being Santa is about about listening to the children and making them feel special.

He's pictured here at the Gällivare Santa Claus Winter Games, which he attended in 2004 . 'You have to be as excited and enthusiastic with the last child you see on a day as you were with the first. It's important you don't wain. 'It's jolly hard work you have to make sure each child leaves thinking Father Christmas is wonderful. 'A good Santa mustn't use bad language and should never smoke or drink in their suit, there's nothing worse than a smelly Santa. 'They should always look their best and be a jolly good listener. 'I'm hoping to launch officially next year, I have a lot of experience to pass on and it would be nice to train others to continue my legacy.'","Ron Horniblew, from Luton, Bedfordshire, first started dressing as Santa in 1964 .

"By . Stephen Wright . PUBLISHED: . 20:11 EST, 26 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:12 EST, 26 December 2012 . The Stephen Lawrence case was engulfed in a secrecy row last night after court officials refused to reveal how much legal aid his killers claimed. Gary Dobson, 37, and David Norris, 36, are believed to have spent up to £1million of public money on defence costs before and during their murder trial. But the Legal Services Commission has blocked a request for information about how much taxpayers’ money they used. It argues that publication of the amount could ‘compromise the litigation’ – meaning the pair would be unable to receive a fair trial in the unlikely event that an appeal results in a retrial. Guilty of murder: Gary Dobson (left) and David Norris (right) are believed to have spent up to £1million of public money on defence costs . This is despite the fact the men have already been convicted of the teenager’s murder – more than a decade after both Dobson and Norris were among five men named by the Daily Mail in 1997 as Stephen’s killers. Critics say the ruling is further evidence of Britain’s secrecy culture, following controversy over secret courts and inquests, restricted access to family courts and the police clamp-down on how much information they release in the post-Leveson era. After a six-week trial, an Old Bailey jury ruled in January that Dobson and Norris were guilty of the race-hate murder of Stephen Lawrence, 18, in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993 . After a six-week trial, an Old Bailey jury ruled in January that Dobson and Norris were guilty of the race-hate murder of Stephen, 18, in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993. They were jailed for life. The pair immediately appealed against their convictions, saying the trial had been unfair. But in August their written applications were thrown out by a single Appeal Court judge, who ruled there were no grounds to grant them leave to appeal. Dobson and Norris, part of a gang of five racists who stabbed Stephen to death, have since launched a new appeal against their convictions. A decision on whether they will be granted leave to appeal is not expected for several months.Pending this, the Mail last month submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Legal Services Commission, asking for details of the amount of legal aid claimed by Norris and Dobson at their murder trial. Both men had large legal teams, led by experienced QCs. Before the trial, Dobson – who was prosecuted under new double jeopardy laws – tried to get the charge thrown out at a hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice. After considering the Mail’s FoI request for three weeks, a spokesman for the LSC said: ‘Since receiving your request, it has been confirmed to the LSC that both David Norris and Gary Dobson have renewed their application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal against their convictions. ‘As this case remains on-going it is considered that the disclosure of the costs associated with the case to date would be likely to compromise the litigation, if the appeal resulted in a retrial before a jury. The Mail on January 4, 2012 - the day after the killers were jailed . This is because it could influence the decision of a jury given the high-profile nature of the case and the Press attention it has generated, thus potentially prejudicing the outcome of the case.’ Officials are to carry out an internal review of the decision after the Mail appealed against the LSC’s ruling. In a letter of complaint, solicitors Reynolds Porter Chamberlain pointed out that no new trial is pending for Dobson and Norris. It said: ‘Legal aid is funded by the British taxpayer. There is a clear public interest in the disclosure of information pertaining to how much legal aid was awarded to convicted criminals which far outweighs the hypothetical and remote chance of prejudice you have identified.’ In January, Dobson was ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years and two months, while Norris was given a minimum of 14 years and three months.","Murderers Gary Dobson, 37, and David Norris, 36, are believed to have spent the sum on defence costs .

Police are tonight investigating the death of a woman who plummeted down a flight of stairs at a Christmas party at a Premier League stadium hotel. The 22-year-old woman had been celebrating Christmas at an office party held at the hotel on the same complex as the Madejski Stadium, home to Reading Football Club. Police were called after the woman's body was discovered at the foot of a stairwell in the Millennium Madejski Hotel which backs onto the Royals' home ground in Berkshire. Police are investigating the death of a woman who plummeted down a flight of stairs at a Christmas party at Madejski Stadium, home to Reading Football Club . She had sustained serious head injuries and although paramedics rushed to the hotel to try and save her, the woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family have been told of the tragedy but police have not yet formally identified her. Officers were today treating the woman's death as unexplained, and police would not be drawn on whether she may have fallen down the stairs, or whether there were any suspicious circumstances surrounding her fatal plunge.

She had sustained serious head injuries and although paramedics rushed to the hotel to try and save her, the woman was pronounced dead at the scene .

An ambulance spokesman confirmed that paramedics were called to the incident, but the woman was pronounced dead at the four star hotel. 'We were called at 34 minutes past midnight on December 22 to attend to a female in her 20s,' she said. 'We had an ambulance, an ambulance officer and a crew on the scene.
