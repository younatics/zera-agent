"FIFA will not be taking action against Arjen Robben after he admitted diving during Holland's 2-1 win over Mexico. Robben reportedly apologised for diving on one occasion in the game - but not for the decisive penalty in stoppage time which he said was 'definitely a foul'.

Slow start: Tiger Woods of the United States walks off the ninth green his final hole of the the first round . Comeback: Woods had not played since late March because of a back injury . Beginning on the back nine, Woods found the bunker at the par-three 10th and missed a 15-foot putt for par. There was another bogey at the 11th, as a 40-foot birdie attempt made it only half way to the hole. Woods’ first birdie came at the 467-yard 14th, where he nailed a three-wood to within 10 feet, but he gave that shot back at the next with a poor drive into the left rough. A five-foot birdie putt at the next lipped out and he three-putted the 17th for bogey. After another dropped shot at the 18th he was four over at the turn. Back-to-back bogeys at the second and third left him six over. Woods then birdied the fourth, seventh and eighth to recover to three over. However, he was still eight shots off the early lead set by Greg Chalmers. VIDEO Tigers slow start . Tiger Woods watches his shot from the second tee at the Quicken Loans National .

"A monstrous burger weighing almost five stone and believed to be the biggest in the UK has been created by a record-breaking pub chef. Graham Harker, from The George, in Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, created the 67lbs burger from 48lbs of beef and two 20-inch-wide burger buns. Four pounds of cheese, 1lb of red onions, 2lbs of lettuce, 2lbs of tomatoes and 2lbs of mayonnaise were also needed to beat the previous record - a 45lb whopper created by The Bond Hotel in Blackpool in June. Scroll down for video . Chef Graham Harker, from The George, in Stockton-on-Tees, Cleveland, created the 67lbs burger . Pub landlord Craig Harker said that the burger was meant to weigh 60lbs but the chef got 'carried away' Craig Harker, landlord of The George, said: 'We were aiming to do a burger that weighed around 60lbs but Graham got carried away. 'The hardest bit was getting two 20-inch buns specially made - we rang loads of places but no one thought they would be able to do it. 'Luckily we managed to find a bakery in Hartlepool that had an oven that was big enough. 'Each burger patty weighing 16lbs each took nearly five hours to cook. We had to time it perfectly so we could reveal it on Friday evening. 'The pub was absolutely packed. We shared out the burger - it was not just cooked to perfection but tasted amazing as well. The monstrous meat patty was encased in two 20-inch buns which were specially made in Hartlepool . Big burger: Each burger patty weighing 16lbs each took nearly five hours to cook . 'Although it fed more than 40 people there was about two-thirds left. The dogs ate well that night.' Ian Gowing, from Stockton, said: 'It is only three burgers in a bun, but then you look at the tomatoes and realise how big it actually is.' It is not the first time the family-run pub has entered the record books. Last year The George created a 20-foot parmo (breaded cutlet dish) using 100 breaded chicken breasts.

"Today's Millennials could be tomorrow's very sweaty retirees thanks to temperatures and humidity levels that are rising so fast that, by the end of this century, simply going outside could be deadly. ‘As temperatures rise, toward the end of the century, less than an hour of activity outdoors in the shade could cause a moderately fit individual to suffer heat stroke,’ said climatologist Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, lead scientific author of the shocking report 'Risky Business.' ‘That's something that doesn't exist anywhere in the world today.’ The study's alarming findings put into sharp perspective not just what rising global temperatures can mean to today's youth but also how the overlooked factor of rising humidity--which makes already killer temperatures even deadlier--will also come to make summertime progressively miserable and dangerous. Sooner than you think: The study found that huge regions of the U.S. will have humity/heat levels so high that even moderately fit individuals will not be able to safely go outdoors by 2200 if carbon emissions continue at today's levels . The body's capacity to cool down in hot weather depends on the evaporation of sweat. That keeps skin temperature below 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius). Above that, core temperature rises past 98.6F. But if humidity is also high, sweat cannot evaporate, and core temperature can increase until the person collapses from heat stroke. ‘If it's humid you can't sweat, and if you can't sweat you can't maintain core body temperature in the heat, and you die,’ said Dr Al Sommer, dean emeritus of the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University and author of a chapter on health effects in the new report. The highest heat-plus-humidity reading in the United States was in 1995 in Appleton, Wisconsin, when the outside temperature was 101F. While the Upper Midwest is not known for tropical conditions, climate research shows that it will experience more warming than lower latitudes as well as more humidity. As a result, the deadliest heat-and-humidity combinations are expected to center around that region, with threads reaching to the Eastern Seaboard and islands of dangerous conditions along the northwest Pacific coast. Sweaty retirement: Study researchers created this graphic, which indicates how many days per year there will be temperatures of 95F or above in the United States as today's Millennials age into tomorrow's retirees . The study found that if you're between 4 and 33-years-old today, dozens or hundreds of days (depending where you live) each year will have temperatures at or above a sweltering 95F. As humidity rises along with temperature, the Midwest especially will become espcially dangerous as even moderately fit individuals staying in the shade could suffer heat stroke within an hour. With the air fully saturated with water, humans can no longer sweat as a means of evaporating off body heat. Under those extreme conditions, heat stroke can occur. The symptoms of this condition include dizziness, disorientation, confusion and sluggishness, skin the is dry and hot, rapid heartbeat and hallucinations. For the young, sick and elderly, the problem will be compounded. Startling maps released with the study show how over time a wider and larger portion of the United States will see more and more days of the year in which the conditions are simply too dangerous to go outdoors. If emissions continue unabated at their current rate, heat and humidity will be so high across nearly all the United States east of the Mississippi that people will not be able to safely leave their air conditioned homes for 10 percent of the year by 2200. With a medium reduction in emissions, the maps appears far less startling, with dangerous humidity-heat days down to around three of five per year, mostly in the Midwest. With large emissions reductions now, the study claims that all the U.S. will be safe from those dangerous years in 2200. Dangers: This National Weather Service heat index charts the deadly duo of heat and humidity, a tragic team that Americans will likely see affecting them more and more . If climate change continues on its current trajectory, the report concluded, Midwesterners could see deadly heat-and-humidity pairings (which meteorologists call ‘wet-bulb temperature’) two days every year by later this century. ‘It will be functionally impossible to be outside, including for things like construction work and farming, as well as recreation,’ said climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer of Princeton University. Even without killer humidity, heat waves are expected to take a larger and larger toll. The Southeast is expected to be hit with an additional 17 to 52 extremely hot days per year by mid-century and an additional 48 to 130 days by 2100. That could prove deadly for thousands: ‘Risky Business’ projects an additional 15 to 21 deaths per 100,000 people every year from the heat, or 11,000 to 36,000 additional deaths at current population levels.","'Risky Business' study was a first because it analyzed rising world temperatures as well as the potentially deadly effects of rising humidity .
Today's Millennials will face as many as two hundred 95F days per year in the South and Southwest when they're tomorrow's retirees .
America's Midwestern states are expected to get hit the hardest as heat and humidity are both rising fast ion the region .
Toward the end of this century, even moderately fit individuals could suffer heat stroke from less than an hour of outdoor activity in the shade ."

"On trial: Jessica Cruz, pictured upon her arrest aged 19, is charged with murdering her newborn son . A woman accused of murdering her newborn son has admitted to wrapping the baby in a plastic bag and dumping him in a trash can. Jessica Cruz, of Streamwood, Illinois, is pleading not guilty to the murder of her baby boy in a Salvation Army store in 2011. Cruz, who was 19 at the time, told police she panicked after giving birth in the shop's bathroom because her mother, from whom she had been hiding her pregnancy, was waiting outside. Employees at the Salvation Army store in Streamwood found the 6lbs 11oz baby dead in the trash, wrapped in a plastic bag. A videotape where Cruz admits killing the baby was played to the jury in Cook County's Rolling Meadows branch court on Wednesday. During the hour-long interview filmed shortly after her 2011 arrest, Cruz repeatedly mentions the fear of her mother finding out about the pregnancy. When a policeman asks Cruz if the baby was still alive when it was born, she replies 'I think so'. When asked if she took the boy's life, she replies, 'Yes, but I don't remember tying him up like that.' Assistant Public Defender Dan Naranjo told the court earlier that the baby because it was stillborn, the Chicago Tribune reported. Cruz walked into the Salvation Army store around 10am on November 4, 2011, and asked to use the bathroom. Witnesses said they saw Cruz leaving the bathroom covered in blood about an hour after she walked in. The cause of death of the baby boy was ruled as homicide by strangulation. It is believed the boy suffered a neck haemorrhage. Cruz told police she had not told anyone she was pregnant except for the boy's father, even though she lived with her mother through the pregnancy. Killing: Cruz gave birth in the bathroom of this Salvation Army store in Streamwood, Illinois, and panicked because her mother, from whom she had been hiding her pregnancy, was waiting outside . Search: Police released this photo sketch to try to find Cruz after employees at the Salvation Army store in Streamwood found the 6lbs 11oz baby dead in the trash, wrapped in a plastic bag . 'I didn't want to tell (my mother about the pregnancy) because she had told me I had done a lot of bad things to her,' Cruz said in the videotape, according to the Chicago Tribune. 'I don't want to give her any more grief. She's given me everything.' Cruz, who has been held without bond since her arrest on November 8, 2011, is charged with murder and concealment of a homicide. If found guilty, the 22-year-old, who has a young daughter from before her arrest, could face life in prison.","Jessica Cruz, then 19, gave birth to a boy in a charity shop toilet in 2011 .

"The parents of an eight-year-old schoolboy in remission from cancer are facing a school holiday fine for going on a charity-funded trip to Center Parcs. Max Davies, from Beighton in Sheffield, has been battling cancer for more than a year and was offered the free trip, which is taking place this week, along with his 11-year-old sister Lily and their parents. But school chiefs refused permission to allow the youngsters to be absent from classes and have threatened the family with a £60 fine. Scroll down for video . The parents of cancer survivor Max Davies, aged eight, (pictured) face holiday fines after school bosses refused permission to take Max and his sister on a charity trip to Center Parcs this week . Max (pictured above with his mother Sarah) is now in remission from combat non-Hodgkins lymphoma . The trip has been paid for by Amy's Retreat, a Sheffield-based charity which pays for breaks for families affected by cancer. Max is currently in remission following intensive treatment for combat non-Hodgkins lymphoma after being diagnosed in March last year. Parents Sarah and Craig Davies say they were 'delighted' when they were invited on the trip to Center Parcs, in Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire. Last winter, during his treatment, the family were given permission to take the children out of school for a dream trip to Lapland.

The family face fines for taking their children on a charity trip to Center Parcs in Sherwood Forest (pictured) The trip has been paid for by a Sheffield-based charity which pays for breaks for families affected by cancer . Now, the children's schools - Brook House Juniors and Westfield secondary school, both in Sheffield - say no final decision has yet been made on whether to impose the penalty. But Mrs Davies said the schools are failing to show any compassion by refusing to give permission for the holiday. She said: 'Max was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma in his bowel in March last year, and has fought really hard and is now in remission. 'It's great that Amy's Retreat have offered to pay for this break, which they want us to take in term time as it uses up less of their funds. 'But when we approached Brook House they initially refused the time off, saying Max had already enjoyed a once-in-a-lifetime trip in school time when he went to Lapland for a day last year.' Max won a SuperKids award last year from his local newspaper for his bravery while battling cancer . Mrs Davies says if the fine is imposed for Max and Lily she and her husband will refuse to pay it . Mrs Davies said she knew schools were potentially left with no room to manoeuvre due to tough Government guidelines, which only allow extra time off in 'exceptional circumstances'. She added: 'I just wish they'd use their common sense more than anything and show a bit of understanding. We are going to refuse to pay the fines if they are imposed.' Brook House headteacher Mark Hinchliffe and Westfield headteacher Andy Ireland issued a joint statement on the case. In it, they said: 'We take the welfare and health of all our children seriously and are thrilled that Max is now in remission from non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 'Max and his family have been supported by his friends and teachers at Brook House during his treatment and we were happy to approve time out of school last year when Max was offered a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Lapland. Max and his family went on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Lapland last year during his cancer treatment . Brook House Junior school (pictured) says it has not yet decided whether to impose the fine for Max's absence . 'No decision has yet been made by both schools about whether the family will incur a fine for an unauthorised school absence following their trip to Center Parcs. 'However, both schools are guided by the Government regulation relating to term-time holidays, and we would support the principle that all children should attend school consistently so they can benefit from the learning we provide.' Max won a SuperKids award, run by his local newspaper The Star, last year for his bravery while fighting for his life against cancer. Since Michael Gove introduced the holiday ban in September last year, more than 60,000 families have been fined by councils for taking children out of school without approval. Under new guidelines parents are able to take their children out of school during term time for special occasions in a relaxation of the holiday ban introduced by Michael Gove in September last year. After a string of controversial cases, the new guidelines drawn up by head teachers make it clear when families can take children away from classes The rules have been backed by new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, and will allow children to attend family weddings or funerals, recover after a personal or family crisis, attend a religious event or visiting a relative who is seriously ill . Under the new guidelines parents will still be prevented from taking advantage of cheap holiday breaks in term time  Until September 2013 heads could grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays in 'special circumstances' But under Mr Gove head teachers could grant absence outside school holidays only in 'exceptional circumstances' It leaves parents facing fines of £60 per pupil if they take children out of school for a cheap term time holiday and those who refuse to pay can be fined up to £2,500 by the courts and could even be jailed for up to three months . The rules are aimed at preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education, but became one of Mr Gove's most unpopular policies . In the year before the new legislation was introduced, the number of parents hit with fines soared by nearly 70 per cent . Some 63,837 penalties were issued to parents in the academic year to July 2014 in England, compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months .","Max Davies, eight, is in remission after fighting non-Hodgkins lymphoma .

"The Meredith Kercher murder case will be heard in Italy’s highest court of appeal in March next year, more than a year after the second guilty verdict. Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were re-convicted of killing the 21-year-old British exchange student by a Florence court in January this year. If the verdict is upheld, Italian officials are expected to start the process of extraditing 27-year-old Knox from the US. Final verdict: More than a year after being re-convicted of killing Meredith Kercher, Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito's case will be heard in Italy's highest court of appeal . The case will be heard by the Court of Cassation in Rome on March 25th, the highest appeals court in Italy. A court of cassation does not re-examine the facts of the case, but will only rule on the interpretation of the law in the guilty verdict by the Florence court. Meredith Kercher, was found dead in 2007, at the age of 21, in the apartment she shared with American student Knox in Perugia, Italy. Knox and her Italian then-boyfriend Sollecito were initially found guilty of Kercher's murder and sentenced to 26 and 25 years in prison. Murder: Meredith Kercher, 21, was found with her throat cut in the home she shared with Knox in the idyllic central Italian city of Perugia in 2007 . An extradition procedure for Amanda Knox, seen out in New York with new boyfriend last week, can only be launched following a definitive ruling from the supreme court, which could take months or years. End of a long journey:  Meredith's siblings Stephanie and Lyle, pictured in January after the re-conviction . After four years behind bars, the pair were acquitted on appeal and Knox returned to her Washington state hometown. Knox has since won a creative writing degree and was recently pictured in Brooklyn, New York, on a date with her new rocker boyfriend. She has vowed that she will never 'willingly' return to Italy if the verdict is upheld . In July her 30-year-old ex and fellow convict graduated from Verona University after writing a thesis describing how he is innocent of Meredith’s murder. Earlier in the summer, Sollecito gave a press conference in Rome in which he appeared to distance himself from Knox, saying he was 'not a guarantor' for her, adding that he could not be sure if she was with him the whole night when the murder took place.","Meredith Kercher case will reach highest court of appeal in Italy .

"Police say they are becoming 'increasingly concerned' over a missing fitness instructor who is at the centre of a search after she failed to arrive at work today. Katie Bell was believed to be driving her black Fiat Bravo when she went missing earlier today. The alarm was raised by a family member after the 28-year-old left a house in Banstead in Surrey to travel to work but didn't arrive. Police say they are increasingly concerned for the welfare of Katie Bell, pictured, who was last seen leaving the house in her black Fiat Bravo to go to work . Detectives are now understood to be examining automatic number plate recognition cameras in a bid to discover where he may have been heading. Miss Bell is a zumba instructor at Fiesta Fitness, based in Morden, Surrey, and teaches classes in Chessington. A spokesman for Surrey Police said: 'Her disappearance is completely out of character - we do not believe she has ever gone missing before. 'The police are growing increasingly concerned for the welfare Katie Bell, who was reported missing this morning after she failed to turn up for work. Miss Bell, is a fitness instructor at Fitness First in Morden, Surrey but failed to arrive at work this morning . 'She drives a black Fiat Bravo with the registration number starting in KM09', the spokesman added. However, the spokesman said police were refusing to disclose the full details of her car. Miss Bell is described as white, with shoulder-length blonde hair and is around five foot two inches tall and of slim to medium build. The police spokesman added: 'Officers are urging anyone who has seen Katie who has links to Epsom, Ewell and Chessington to contact them with information. 'Katie can also contact officers, friends and family through the charity Missing People by calling or texting 116 000 . It was not believed she had any medical problems which could be associated with her disappearance.","Katie Bell left her house in Banstead, Surrey this morning to go to work .

"A single father was left red-faced when he received an anonymous note at a playground which accused him of being a poor parent. Quills, the father-of-two, had taken his children out to a park in Sydney's inner west on Thursday morning while anxious about trying to find a place to live by next Saturday. The 26-year-old believes a cowardly act was prompted by him spending time on his mobile phone to search for future homes while his son was asleep in his pram and his daughter was playing with other kids. However this was unbeknownst to the scribe who left a note to the father, reading: 'Dear Mummys and Daddys, Please Get off Your Phones. Thank You! Your Kid.' Single father Quills pictured with his son Jasper at Camperdown Memorial Rest Park in Newtown - Sydney's inner west - just before he received an offensive note from a bystander . The note was written on a paper plate and left on the empty pram while Quills took his son to play with his sister . Quills, who became a single father this year, says the note made him feel 'violated'. 'For me it seems ridiculous because the person was being judgemental for no reason,' he told Daily Mail Australia. When his one-year-old son Jasper awoke from his nap at Camperdown Memorial Rest Park in Newtown, Quills picked him up and took him over to play with his three-year-old sister Indigo while he quickly tried to finish off a message he was writing to a potential landlord. 'Then as I was walking back to the pram, sitting on the seat was a paper plate,' Quills said. 'There were a lot of people at the park - a lot of them on phones too - so I looked around, trying to see if anyone claimed responsibility for the note. 'No one did so I tore it up because I knew there was a good chance that the person was looking at me and I wanted to show them that it wasn't a worthwhile message.' The note was a huge insult to Quills, a professional artist, as he's been trying hard for the last four months to make ends meet. 'I've been looking for a place online hoping to find somewhere to stay because I don't want to put my stuff on the street,' he said. 'But it's been a bit of a struggle because it's quite difficult to find a share house that will take in two kids. 'At one point I couldn't afford to feed myself and buy nappies or baby formula for my kids.' The single father pictured with three-year-old daughter Indigo (left) and Jasper (right) Since Quills was evicted from his last Sydney home nearly four months ago, he's lived at three temporary homes. While he is required to move out by next Saturday, the father-of-two hopes to finally settle down in his fourth home - for the sake of his kids. For a single parent who only gains little support from his family, Quills said he's always been committed to being a good father. 'My dad was absent most of my life,' he said. 'So I've always wanted to be around my kids to play a role in their lives – a role that I wanted my dad to have in mine.' But since him and his partner of five years separated, the split custody of their children has left Quills shattered. The 26-year-old says being a good father has always been top priority to him . Quills took to Facebook and shared his thoughts on the recent incident . 'It's devastating for me that I only get to spend half the time with my kids now,' he said. 'Both of them were planned and at the time my partner and I were prepared for them. 'But one of the big changes in my life since becoming a single dad is that I often feel I am no longer allowed to engage with other people's children. People, particularly traditional mothers, tend to assume the worst of a lone young man taking an interest in their charges.' So the recent incident has added salt to the wound, leaving Quills indignant which brought him to post his thoughts on social media. 'I just received this obscene gesture from some person,' he wrote. 'Maybe if you didn't have such rigid ideas about parenting you would realise that the world is actually a pretty nice place. 'I think that it is, despite being typecast as a pervert or a distant parent for no good reason. It must be awful walking around making negative snap judgments about people all the time.' Quills further told Daily Mail Australia that he hopes others think before they made judgements about single fathers. 'I think a lot of other parents agree with me that they often get judged too harshly for the way we choose to raise our children,' he said. 'I think people generally have their own idea of parenting and an idolised notion of it until they become one.'","A single father-of-two was at a playground in Sydney's inner west on Thursday when he received the anonymous note .

"A federal jury convicted a man of working with others to expand the cocaine-trafficking empire of one of the world's most notorious drug networks into northern New England and Europe. Rafael Humberto Celaya Valenzuela, a member of Mexico's violent Sinaloa cartel was convicted by a jury in New Hampshire. He was charged with conspiracy to distribute more than 2,200 pounds of cocaine, plus heroin and methamphetamine, in the United States. Convicted: The jury in New Hampshire convicted Rafael Humberto Celaya Valenzuela, a member of Mexico's violent Sinaloa cartel . Two others arrested with Valenzuela in 2012 have pleaded guilty to working with the Sinaloa cartel. One of them, Jesus Gutierrez-Guzman, is a cousin of the cartel's notorious leader, Joaquin Guzman, known as 'El Chapo.' Joaquin Guzman escaped prison in 2001 and ran the enterprise from a series of hideouts and safe houses across Mexico. He was earning billions of dollars moving tons of cocaine and other drugs to the United States, prosecutors have said. He was recaptured in February and has been indicted in numerous states besides New Hampshire, but it is unclear if he will be extradited. In court, secret video and audio recordings showed Valenzuela conspiring with fellow cartel members and undercover FBI agents, who passed themselves off as members of a European criminal syndicate, to expand the gang's cocaine empire into the United States and Europe. Prosecutors said Valenzuela held himself out as an attorney and financial planner for the cartel. His lawyers argued that he should be acquitted because he never reached an agreement with the Sinaloa cartel to move drugs, meaning there was no conspiracy. They also argued that there was no overt act in New Hampshire so there were no grounds to try him here. Feared: Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, is pictured here in handcuffs, his cousin Jesus Gutierrez-Guzman was arrested with Valenzuela in 2012 . His lead lawyer, Jeffrey Feiler of Miami, was traveling after the verdict and could not be reached. Assistant U.S. Attorney Donald Feith said Valenzuela and other members of the cartel met over the course of three years in New Castle, New Hampshire, Madrid, the Virgin Islands, Miami and elsewhere. The conspirators and undercover agents at first discussed shipments of 1,000 kilos of cocaine with one of the cartel members promising they could deliver 20 tons. 'Today's guilty verdict, together with the guilty pleas of the defendant's co-conspirators, demonstrates the Department of Justice's commitment to disrupting and dismantling international drug-trafficking organizations wherever they seek to peddle their poison,' U.S. Attorney John Kacavas said. Before the trial started, both sides acknowledged that Valenzuela had turned down a plea agreement that would have gotten him 10 to 20 years in prison, instead of the 10 years to life he faces after conviction. He is set to be sentenced in January.

"But a new study suggests that people who believe they have a guardian angel (illustrated) take fewer risks and live less adventurous lives . You might think that people who believe they have an all-powerful protective spirit watching over them would take lots of risks. But a new study suggests that those who think they have a guardian angel take fewer risks and live less adventurous lives. The finding is the opposite of what researchers expected. David Etkin, Professor of Disaster and Emergency Management at York University, Canada, examined the link between belief and risk-taking behaviour. ‘We hypothesised that a belief in guardian spirits would tend to be associated with a decreased risk perception and therefore an increase in risk-taking behaviour. ‘However, we found that instead of this belief making people able to take more risks because they feel protected, the results clearly indicated that those who believe in guardian angels are more likely to be risk-averse. Professor Etkin and his team interviewed 198 people for the study. They noted how interviewees viewed risk, what sort of risky behaviour they participated in and why they chose to do so. They found that 68 per cent of participants who indicated a belief in guardian spirits said it affects how they take risks, with a clear majority indicating that they are more risk-averse than non-believers, according to the paper published in the journal SAGE open. For example, volunteers were asked to rate breaking the speed limit by 13 mph (20kph) on a scale of one to five in terms of risk and believers rated it riskier than non-believers. ‘It appears that the dominant cause-and-effect relationship is opposite to the one we originally hypothesised,’ Professor Etkin said. ‘We think that those who are more risk-averse use belief in guardian spirits as a coping mechanism to deal with their fear and anxiety over perceived risks in their environment.’ Nearly a third of Britons - 29 per cent - believe that a guardian angel is always watching over them, according to research published in 2010. A slightly higher number - 31 per cent - admitted they believe in angels, while one in 20 said they have actually seen or heard one. Just 17 per cent said they are not sure what to believe. London had the highest levels of believers at 40 per cent, according to the survey by the Bible Society and Christian Research. The North East scored the lowest, at 17 per cent. People in the capital also scored the highest for believing a guardian angel watches over them, at 37 per cent, compared with 22 per cent in Scotland and the North East. The survey showed that 45 per cent of people interviewed from Oxford and 43 per cent of those from Hull believed they have a guardian angel. This figure fell to 16 per cent for those in Edinburgh and Plymouth. But researchers warned that the city results were based on small numbers – with just 17 people interviewed from Oxford, 19 from Hull, 39 from Edinburgh and 27 from Plymouth. The researchers found that 68 per cent of participants who indicated a belief in guardian spirits said it affects how they take risks (stock image), with a  majority indicating  they are more risk-averse than non-believers .","Study by York University, Canada, looked at belief and risk-taking behaviour .

"A 25-year-old Maine mother accused of drugging and smothering her young daughter to death is going on trial today after changing her plea to not guilty by reason of insanity in September. Leanna Norris was arrested last year after the body her 2-year-old daughter, Loh Grenda, was found in the front seat of her car in Stetson, Maine, on June 23, 2013. Norris initially pleaded not guilty to murder, but two documents released by Penobscot County Superior Court shortly after her arrest stated that she confessed to the killing. Murder trial: Leanna Norris (left), 25, is on trial for allegedly killing her 2-year-old daughter, Loh Grenada (right), in June 2013 . Late last month, Norris changed her plea to not guilty by reason of insanity and waived her right to a jury trial, meaning that a judge will decide her fate, Bangor Daily News reported. According to her affidavit by . Detective Thomas Pickering of the Maine State Police, on June 27, 2013, the . Auburn woman said she gave her daughter Loh Grenda two or three doses of . Benadryl, before putting black duct tape over her mouth and covering her with . a blanket so she 'would not have to look at Loh's eyes'. 'Leanna Norris said that she killed . Loh Grenda; that Leanna Norris put her hand over Loh Grenda’s face and . suffocated her,' the affidavit said. Benadryl is an antihistamine, which can also cause drowsiness. Norris, who had been on her way to . visit her parents in Stetson, said she killed her daughter by covering . the child's face with her hand, then removed the tape 'so it would not . look so horrible', according to Portland Press Herald. Cowardly act: Norris allegedly gave her daughter Benadryl, duct-taped her mouth and covered her with a blanket so she 'would not have to look at Loh's eyes' Failed suicide: The mother attempted to take her own life by overdosing on Advil, but she survived . After allegedly killing her child, Norris told police she drove to a cemetery in Stetson, where she overdosed on Advil in an attempt to take her own life. But, after vomiting, the 24-year-old allegedly called her father, Steven Norris, and then drove to his house. Mr Norris told detectives his daughter had called at 2.47am telling him 'she killed her baby and wanted to die', according to the document. He told detectives that when she arrived . at his home, he found his granddaughter dead under a blanket, and said . his daughter begged him for a gun so she could kill herself. Tragic: Loh Grenada's small lifeless body was discovered inside her mother's car . When police arrived they found the . body of the child in a car and a note on the dashboard, but police have . not said what it contained, BDN Maine reported. Norris' trial is expected to last five days. Superior Court Justice Ann Murray will issue a verdict at a later date. If convicted of murder, the 25-year-old mother faces 25 years to life. If the judge chooses to acquit Norris by reason of insanity, she will be sent to a psychiatric hospital for treatment.","Leanna Norris, 25, charged with killing her 2-year-old daughter, Loh Grenada, in June 2013 .

"Patients who dare to complain about poor NHS care are made to feel frightened and left exhausted and disheartened, a report warns. Many of those who raised concerns were confronted by hostile staff who denied doing anything wrong. Others said they feared that pursuing the complaint would cause staff to treat them even worse out of spite. Patients are scared they will be victimised when they complain to the NHS, according to Patients Association . The Patients Association report found that half of complaints were not handled well and warned that the culture of secrecy in the NHS had barely changed since the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal, in which hundreds died due to neglect. An inquiry 18 months ago led by Sir Robert Francis QC called for sweeping reforms to the Health Service to make it more transparent. But the charity says that, based on patients’ experiences, there is little evidence of a culture shift. Figures show that more than 3,300 complaints are made against NHS hospitals and GP surgeries by patients and their families every week – up by 5 per cent in a year, partly because the public are becoming more inclined to speak up. The Patients Association surveyed 1,200 people who had all complained about poor care experienced by themselves or a loved-one. Nearly half said the issue was poorly handled and a quarter said staff were unhelpful or defensive. Half were concerned that following up the complaint would make staff deliberately treat them or their loved-ones badly. The report found more than half of those that did complain said that it was not handled well and were confronted by hostile staff . More than half said they were unhappy with the final outcome, including a third who were ‘very dissatisfied’. One patient said the ordeal of trying to find out what went wrong was ‘exhausting’ and left him feeling scared to go back to hospital. Another described the ‘sheer dishonesty’ and ‘lack of transparency’ among staff who had dismissed his case instantly. A third said his doctor had urged him not to complain as it ‘would take up too much time’. Patients Association chief executive Katherine Murphy said: ‘Patients continue to face huge barriers when complaining. There is little evidence of the promised total culture shift in the NHS. Much more needs to be done to ensure patients, relatives and carers feel confident, supported and their concerns welcomed.’ The report adds: ‘It is a sad indictment of our NHS that patients, relatives and carers continue to find making a complaint an uncomfortable and distressing process.’ The charity is urging all NHS hospitals to introduce a basic set of rules to make it easier for patients to raise concerns. Yesterday, the General Medical Council told doctors and nurses to be more honest and own up to mistakes.","Half of complaints were not handled well, says the Patients Association .

"Police in Connecticut are on the hunt for a brazen wedding crasher who they say pilfered gifts from the bride and groom while posing as a guest at the reception. The suspect, a white male in his mid-20s or 30s, fled the Inn at Longshore in Westport Saturday night with a silver birdcage filled with wedding cards, many apparently containing cash for the newlyweds. Police used K-9 dogs to try to track the man, but they only recovered the empty birdcage. Scroll down for video . Wedding crasher: This unidentified man posed as a guest at a wedding  in Connecticut to steal a birdcage filled with gift cards intended for the newlywed couple . On the run: The thief was caught on camera bolting out of the wedding venue with the gift box in his hands . Party spoiled: The heist took place at the Inn at Longshore, a reception hall and bed and breakfast situated on a golf course in Westport, Connecticut . Unwelcome guest: Police say the thief posed as either a guest at the wedding celebration or at the hotel . The uninvited guest was caught on surveillance camera at the venue, which captured him talking on his cellphone before bolting out of the building with birdcage in hand. Investigators have released screen grabs in the hope somebody might recognize him, NBC New York reported. Police were called the upscale wedding venue and golf course at 260 Compo Road South in Westport at around 7pm Saturday after getting reports of a robbery. An investigation has revealed that the thief was posing as either a guest at the reception or the bed and breakfast. Cameras in the lobby captured the moment the suspect fled the hotel with the silver gift box, nearly knocking over a couch in the process. Norwalk police officer Rich Montanez and his K-9 partner, Kai, searched the perimeter of the venue and found the discarded empty birdcage about 300 yards from the reception hall, according to The Hour. Hot on the trail: A K-9 officer found the empty birdcage 300 yards from the inn . Wanted: The suspect was described as a man in his mid-20s or 30s, clean shaven with close-cropped light-brown hair . ‘I haven't seen anything like this happen,’ Westport Lt. Ryan Paulsson told the station WFSB. ‘I think it says a lot about the world that we live in.’ The newlyweds whose special day was marred by the theft have since left on their honeymoon, and police are hoping to have some good news for them by the time they return home.

"Blood appears as a bright stain on white ice as a family of polar bears tuck into dinner. The striking pictures were taken on Ellesmere Island, Canada, as a mother polar bear and her two cubs feasted on what is believed to be a seal. Justin Hofman, 31, was aboard the Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic ship for a three week-voyage through the Canadian High Arctic.

The cubs would occasionally walk away from the kill to clean ice and roll around as a way to get some of the blood and gore off of their fur.' Justin was also lucky enough to witness the Northern Lights dance in the night sky over a clear stretch of Arctic ocean. He added: 'After seeing these otherworldly lights in the sky, I can understand how ancient cultures without knowledge of science and the cosmos could develop the mythos that eventually became religion.'

Wine specialist Nerea Perez was watching the fermenting process at the cellar in the Spanish village of Salas de los Barrios, in the north west of the country.

"Sam Irwin-Hill was a long way from home when the University of Arkansas punter scored the cheekiest touchdown seen in recent years. In the Arkansas U away game against Texas A&M Aggies this week, Bendigo born and raised Irwin-Hill was all lined up to punt from just inside his half of the field. Instead, after the block formed a clear flank for the Australian native, he took his opportunity and maneuvered his way through a jaw-dropping 51-yard touchdown for the Arkansas Razorbacks. Aussies are known for their unconventional behaviour,and Irwin-Hill was no exception in this trick play punt fake. Born and raised in Bendigo, 23-year-old Irwin-Hill maneuvered his way through the 51-yard touchdown using a trick play punt fake. Opening up a clear path, the block formed a flank for Number 92 Irwin-Hill to run all the way to the end zone, scoring the jaw-dropping touchdown for the Arkansas Razorbacks. Texas A&M graduate Johnny Manziel was spotted wincing and biting his hand on the sidelines of the field, as surprised by the trick play as many of the spectators. The nationally televised match was watched by thousands across the United States, with Irwin-Hill drawing praise from commentators and fans alike. Last year, Irwin-Hill, or number 92, averaged 44.3 yards for punting, and recorded an astonishing 79 yard punt during the season. The former Catholic College Bendigo student joined the Razorbacks in 2013 on a scholarship, after spending the two previous years in a junior college competition with the City College of San Francisco Rams. Irwin-Hill's mother Susan said that he called her as soon as he arrived back from Texas, and was overwhelmed by the reaction he had received for the move. The nationally televised match was watched by thousands across the United States, with Irwin-Hill drawing praise from commentators and fans alike. The touchdown pushed the Arkansas Razorbacks ahead to a 21-14 lead in the second quarter, but saw less luck for the rest of the game, losing to the A&M Aggies 35-28 in the end. The former Catholic College Bendigo student joined the Razorbacks in 2013 on a scholarship, after spending the two previous years in a junior college competition with the City College of San Francisco Rams. 'He said his phone had been ringing hot and he had to do interviews after the game. He was so excited,' Susan told Fairfax. 'Everyone in the US doesn't expect punters to run the football like Sam did.' 'His Aussie Rules background certainly helped him with the way he took on the tacklers.' 'We are so thrilled for him... after all the hard work he's put in, he deserves everything he gets.' The touchdown pushed the Arkansas Razorbacks ahead to a 21-14 lead in the second quarter, but saw less luck for the rest of the game, losing to the A&M Aggies 35-28 in the end.

"A 51-year-old Briton was subject to a hate campaign that led to a heart attack after he was wrongly accused of owning a film of a woman having sex with a tiger. Bus driver Andrew Holland was sent the video by friends as a joke but spent six months on bail after being charged with possession of an extreme pornographic image. As a result Mr Holland, who claims to have watched just six seconds of the video, was subject to ridicule, sent poison pen letters, branded a paedophile and targeted by vigilantes. A 51-year-old was subject to a hate campaign that led to a heart attack after he was wrongly accused of owning a film of a woman having sex with a tiger. File picture . However, prosecutors dropped the case in December 2009 after realising the 'tiger' was actually just a man dressed in a costume. According to The Independent, officials at the Crown Prosecution Service realised their mistaken when the costumed man said: 'That's grrrrrreat' - the catchphrase of Frosties cereal mascot Tony the Tiger. Mr Holland, who was denied contact with his young daughter for more than a year, said: 'I lost my job, I had to move and I ended up having a heart attack with all the stress of it,' he said. 'People were ringing me in the middle of the night. The offence of possession of extreme pornographic images came into force in January 2009. File picture . 'Three young lads turned up at my door and were calling me everything. I was threatened on more than one occasion.' Now he is trying to get the law on extreme pornography changed to prevent 'harmless but crude' jokes from going to court. His lawyers have written to the Director of Public Prosecutions and will go to the High Court if they are unsuccessful. The offence of possession of extreme pornographic images came into force in January 2009 and make it an offence to possess pornographic images that depict acts which threaten a person's life; acts which result in or are likely to result in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals; bestiality; or necrophilia. It has resulted in more than 5,500 prosecutions, mainly for bestiality images and footage. The prosecution has to prove that the image is 'pornographic; grossly offensive, disgusting, or otherwise of an obscene character'. Freedom campaigners say the act criminalises people who exchange dirty jokes or images by phone or the internet.","Bus driver Andrew Holland was sent the video by friends as a joke .

"Jim Bob Duggar is seen giving Ben Seewald permission to propose to daughter Jessa in a clip from tonight's episode of TLC's 19 Kids and Counting. Ben, 19, is seen  broaching the subject with the family patriarch in Jim Bob's Tontitown, Arkansas, workshop where he is currently employed. He admits in a voiceover: 'I've been thinking of marrying Jessa for quite a while. We have a lot of the same passions and goals in life. She's like, indescribably amazing.' Talking man to man: Ben Seewald (right) nervously asks Jim Bob Duggar (left) for permission to propose to Jessa in tonight's episode of 19 Kids and Counting . Regardless, the teenager seems nervous when he finally gets around to asking the question. 'Since me and Jessa have been spending more time together and gotten closer together, I really believe she's the one that I would like to spend the rest of my life with,' he says. 'I was just wondering if I have your permission to ask Jessa's permission to marry her.' There is little sympathy from Jim Bob though, who admits he didn't want to make the process too easy for Ben. His reply comes with long pauses and a dose of advice. 'It's really a big step,' the father-of-19 replies. Success! The couple announced their engagement in August and wed last weekend. Tonight's episode will show the moment Ben proposed to Jessa in a surprise scavenger hunt . 'You know, I think the most important thing is when a couple can do more for the Lord together than they can apart, [and when] a husband can provide for his wife financially and take care of her.' But having already welcomed Ben into his home, Jim Bob has been witness to the couple's courtship and growing affection for one another. 'I know Jessa feels the same way about you, Ben,' he says. 'I think y'all make a great couple, and I think the Lord's in this. You have Michelle and I's blessing.' The relief on Ben's face is clear as he shakes hands with Jim Bob, who adds: 'Jessa knew this was coming sometime but she didn't know exactly when.' Ben admits: 'I've been thinking of a few ideas so we'll see if I can surprise her - I'll do my best!' And surprise her he did: the proposal took the form of a scavenger hunt, with each challenge relating to a special moment in their courtship. Mulling it over: There is a lengthy pause from Jim Bob after Ben asks for Jessa's hand in marriage . Relief! Ben's face when Jim Bob finally grants permission for him to propose to Jessa . Explaining the tradition, Jim Bob's wife, Michelle says: 'It's just understood that they're getting that clearance from the father because Daddy has their heart. And then he's the one who's gonna give that heart away to another man.' Ben and Jessa's wedding actually took place last Saturday and the ceremony will feature in a future episode of 19 Kids and Counting. But unlike her sister Jill, whose televised wedding garnered TLC's highest-ever viewing figures, Jessa did not have her first kiss after the 'I Do's' in front of her wedding guests. According to People, they didn't share their first kiss at the ceremony, but rather waited till the reception. 'They wanted their very first kiss ever to be in private,' Pastor Mike Schadt said. 'It was important to the both of them.' The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's 17 and Counting, a series that followed the lives of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17 - now 19 - children. They are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement, which 'teaches that children are God's blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.' 19 Kids and Counting airs Tuesdays on TLC at 9/8c .","The highlight of tonight's episode will be the moment Ben, 19, pops the question to Jessa, 21 .

"Apple is to unveil new iPads and new Mac computers on 16th October at its California HQ. The new gadgets could go on sale on the 24 October - with new Mac software, called Yosemite, available as a free download even earlier. Last week, rumours suggested Apple was putting the finishing touches to a new version of it's iPad Air - including a gold version. Apple's invite for the event tells journalist's 'It's been way too long' - even though their last event was only last month. The small event is likely to be in stark contrast to the star-studded launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which saw U2 playing before the firm controversially gave away the band's new album. An apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned, next-generation iPad Air has surfaced from Vietnam showing a more trim profile, recessed volume buttons, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor to the home button. According to Tinhte.vn  the device comes in at just 7 millimeters thick, the same thickness as the iPhone 6. In addition to a redesigned speaker grille, the unit also sports a small hole where the mute/orientation lock switch appears on existing iPad units. The move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full-size tablets, which are in decline. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours. An apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned, next-generation iPad Air has surfaced from Vietnam showing a more trim profile, recessed volume buttons, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor to the home button. The iPads have a new sleek design and are thinner . Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales. The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads this month. 'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. 'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved Wi-Fi antennas,' it says. The firm will also launch a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite. The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their iPhone is in another room. The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser. New versions of the 9.7-inch tablet could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the iPad Air, ‘people familiar with the matter’ told Bloomberg. The new iPads are also predicted to sport a thinner, more rounded design, similar to the iPhone 6. Hidden code in the latest iOS 8.1 beta software hints that the iPads will feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay functionality. The code states that users can 'pay with iPad using Touch ID. With Apple Pay, you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information.' However, it is not clear whether the new iPad will come with NFC functionality, which is used for contactless payments, as it relies on a Wi-Fi or mobile connection. Apple Pay has only been announced in the US, so if the iPads do get the feature, it may be limited to only American buyers. Apple is also rumoured to be launching a larger iPad with a 12.9-inch screen next year, which if true, could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models. The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen. Sales of iPads have slumped for two quarters, after climbing from $5 billion (£3 billion) when they were launched in 2010, to $30 billion (£19 billion)  in 2012 and $32 billion in 2013 (£20 billion). The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini, and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens, including recently, Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen. The new iPads are expected to have a rounded design similar to the recently released iPhone 6 . The new iPads are also expected to include Touch ID sensors . Apple is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales. In 1999 it rolled out different coloured iMacs which were successful, but sales of its iPhone 5C – a ‘budget’ version of the iPhone 5S – have not sold as well as the company hoped. The company is expected to unveil the new iPads at the same time as a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales. The new line of iMacs is rumoured to have ultra high-resolution Retina Displays, a thin profile and faster processors as well as improved Wi-Fi antennas.

"Scientists said Mary Berry is a role model as she makes high calorie cakes but then only eats small amounts of them . Though she is famed for her calorific cakes, Great British Bake off presenter Mary Berry is a role model for people wanting to eat a healthy diet, scientists have said. While she is renowned for getting contestants on the BBC show to make high-fat masterpieces, the 79-year old food writer's attitude should be praised as she only eats a small amount of such foods. The group of leading nutritional scientists said that a diet low in saturated fat, along with keeping active, is key to a healthy lifestyle, and criticised a recent study which played down links between saturated fat and risk of heart disease. Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London said: 'Mary Berry, I always like her, she cooks these cakes with everything we think is awful - sugar, saturated fat and cream - but she said, ""I only eat a little bit of it"", and I think that is the key to it.' Speaking at London's Science Media Centre, scientists said that more needs to be done to counteract the marketing of high-calorie snack foods and coffees which have boomed in recent years. While the average UK diet contains less saturated fat than it did 40 years ago, obesity continues to rise. They said this is because while people have changed the way they eat at home - for example, eating less red meat - they are more sedentary. The foods they eat while out - in restaurants or as snacks - have got bigger in portion size and calorie count, they added. Professor Sanders added that 'susceptible' people are having food 'pushed on to them' and could not say no. He said: 'It is the ""what else?"" culture. It doesn't help. 'You go and get a coffee and you are asked, ""Would you like a muffin with the coffee?"" Or if I buy a magazine ... I'm offered a 100g bar of chocolate which I don't need. 'There is a whole thing about the marketing of food. I have referred to one retailer where you have to queue up as being the 'walk of shame' - you have all the high-calorie, high-sugar, high-fat snacks in the way and I think that is part of the problem.' The balance between diet, alcohol intake and exercise level is the key to keeping your weight down and lowering the risk of heart disease and diabetes, scientists said. Christine Williams, professor of human nutrition at the University of Reading, called for the government to give people advice about healthy snacking, because of the growth of food and drink being available around the clock. Scientists called for the government to give people advice about healthy snacking, because of the growth of food and drink being available around the clock . She said: 'You can see it, you only have to go to a station. There didn't used to be five or six different coffee shops, you sometimes couldn't get a snack on your way home from work. 'Alcohol - pubs are open, food is available 24 hours a day and people probably feel that if it is available it should be okay if I have it. 'Some people are less able to control that and make sense of it than others.' She added: 'A lot of the problems are to do with foods that don't ever see a plate - they are not considered to be food, they are a snack. 'They have gone straight from the hand to the mouth, the coffee is just warming you up in the middle of the day when you are tired, it is all subconscious. And yet it is all very calorific.'","Mary Berry is a role model because of her attitude to food, scientists say .

"This is the moment the world's only surviving set of giant panda triplets opened their eyes for the first time - more than a month after their birth. The trio were hailed as a 'miracle' because of the animal's famously low reproductive rate. Mother panda Ju Xiao, meaning 'chrysanthemum smile', delivered the triplets at Guangzhou's Chimelong Safari Park in the early hours of July 29. Scroll down for video . The extremely rare panda triplets were born at Chimelong Safari Park, Guangzhou, China, on July 29 . They were conceived after she was paired with 17-year-old Lin Lin in March. A video from the zoo showed the three cubs now covered with white and black fur squealing and moving about with their eyes open. 'The panda triplets have all opened their eyes and are in good, healthy condition,' according to a statement from Chimelong Safari Park. 'Each one is starting to show its own individuality. For example, the third one is the most lively,' They are now  living in wooden boxes. The cubs were conceived when Ju Xiao, 12, was paired with 17-year-old Lin Lin in March . The second panda to be born was the first to open their eyes, followed by the lastborn and then the firstborn . The second panda to be born was the first to open their eyes, followed by the lastborn and then the firstborn. They all weigh between 5.9 and 6.3 pounds, but the gender of the cubs cannot be determined until they grow older. A naming competition is already underway and will end in mid-October. The first known case of triplets from a giant panda was recorded in 1999, when a 15-year-old mother gave birth following artificial insemination in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu. But the youngest of the trio died after living for just three days because of a bladder disorder. The birth of rare panda triplets is a further success for China's artificial breeding program. A naming competition is for the 'miracle triplets' is already underway and will end in mid-October . They all weigh between 5.9 and 6.3 pounds, but the gender cannot be determined until they grow older . Giant pandas have an insatiable appetite for bamboo and they eat 12 out of every 24 hours. It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary needs and they will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well. Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) to feed on higher slopes in the summer season. Adults can grow to between 4ft and 6ft long, weighing up to 160kg. Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them. They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers. Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring. Female can only conceive during their two to three day  estrous period, which occurs just once a year in the spring. After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces (142 grams) at birth and cannot crawl until they reach three months of age. They are born white, and develop their much loved coloring later. There are only about 1,000 giant pandas left in the wild, with around 100 pandas living in zoos .","The world's only surviving set of panda triplets have opened their eyes .

"Snatched:  Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, a 22-year-old nurse from Philadelphia, was abducted Sunday on her way home from visiting her godson. Her bank card was used Tuesday morning in Aberdeen, Maryland . Police have released still photos from a surveillance video shot inside a Maryland bank showing a man using an ATM card belonging to a woman who was violently abducted in Philadelphia just hours earlier. Detectives say the grainy footage shows a black male in a dark hooded jacket withdrawing money from a PNC bank in Aberdeen, Maryland, using Carlesha Freeland-Gaither's card at 6.01am Monday. The bank in question is located more than 70 miles southwest of the Germantown section of Philadelphia where the 22-year-old nurse was last seen fighting for her life against her assailant. While police would not say whether the man seen using Freeland-Gaither's bank card is the same person who was captured on another surveillance video forcing her into a car Sunday, they believe he has a similar description as the kidnapper, Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told NBC Philadelphia. As police are working to enhance the surveillance footage of the victim's abduction, Freeland-Gaither's family have spoken out about a former boyfriend who was allegedly 'obsessed' with the young nurse. Freeland-Gaither grew up in Maryland, where she attended high school and lived with her grandmother. Two years ago, she moved to Philadelphia, where she has been working with cancer patients. A relative told ABC 7 News Tuesday that a former boyfriend from Maryland became obsessed with Carelsha. 'It scared her so she backed off from him, but her found her. When she came up here her found her,' the unnamed family member said. Scroll down for video . First look: Police have released this grainy still shot from a bank surveillance video showing a person of interest in the abduction of Carlesha Freeland-Gaither . Different angle: The man used the kidnapped woman's ATM card at 6.01am Monday at a PNC bank in Aberdeen, Maryland . The above map shows the distance between Philadelphia, where Freeland-Gaither was snatched on Sunday, and Aberdeen, Maryland, where her bank card was used Tuesday morning . Ana Murelo, Freeland-Gaither's grandmother, told the station that the grainy image of the person of interest in the ATM may bear some resemblance to the ex-boyfriend, whom she described as having a light complexion. 'The picture was not very clear, but if I had to say, it's a ppossibility' she said. The FBI is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect. That's in addition to rewards totaling $22,000 from local officials, bringing the total to $47,000 as of Tuesday evening. A witness reported seeing a woman identified as Freeland-Gaither screaming for help as she was forced into a dark gray four-door vehicle at about 9:40pm Sunday. Police said Freeland-Gaither's glasses and cellphone were dropped on the street and she appeared to kick out several windows in the back of the vehicle. Stalked: A family member said Carlesha's ex-boyfriend was 'obsessed' with her and tracked her down in Philadelphia . The entire incident was captured on a surveillance video, which the Philadelphia Police Department released on YouTube Monday in a bid to generate tips. The black-and-white footage, which is not accompanied by audio, begins with the suspect’s car coming to a stop in the 100 block of West Coulter Street. A few seconds later, a man emerges from the vehicle, crosses the street and walks up the block, where he encounters the victim. The woman is seen trying to get away from the suspect by crossing the street at the end of the block, but the man catches up with her on the corner and grabs her. A struggle ensues, forcing the suspected kidnapper to drag Ms Freeland-Gaither kicking and screaming to the waiting car. The 22-year-old puts up a valiant fight, at one point dropping to the ground in a desperate attempt to prevent her abductor from forcing her into the backseat, but the man overpowers the victim and shoves her inside the car. On Tuesday, the family held a press conference to plead for her return. Above Freeland-Gaither's grandfather Dereck Alston receives a hug from his daughter at the press conference . Keisha Gaither, left, mother of kidnapping victim Carlesha Freeland-Gaither is comforted during a news conference in Philadelphia on Tuesday . In the course of the struggle, another vehicle drives up to the suspect’s car but hurriedly backs away and makes a U-turn, allowing the kidnapper and his victim to get away. The unidentified kidnapper is described as a black male, 5 feet 10 inches tall with medium-heavy build, between 25 and 30 years old. He was last seen wearing a dark-colored jacket with a hood, possibly a hooded sweatshirt and a hat. Police are also looking for the vehicle used in the kidnapping, which is believed to be a 2000-2002 dark-gray metallic four-door Ford Taurus with a Pennsylvania license plate, a rear spoiler, and windows broken out on the driver’s and passenger‘s side. The sought sedan was last seen traveling west on Coulter Street towards Knox Street. Freeland-Gaither is a 5-foot-3, 125-pound black female with brown eyes and braided hair. She was last seen wearing a light-blue denim jacket, a gray and white sweater, blue jeans and tan and green shoes, and she was carrying a black backpack. Ambush: A Surveilance camera captured the suspect's Ford Taurus pull up in the 100 block of West Coulter Street in Germantown at 9.39pm Sunday . Suspect: The alleged kidnapper, a black male in his mid-20s or early 30s, exited the vehicle and crossed the street . Approach: The man walked after Freeland-Gaither and caught up with her at the end of the block (pictured top right) Dragged away: The man was captured grabbing the 22-year-old woman and pulling her the length of the block to the waiting car . Fighting for her life: Freeland-Gaither was heard by a witness screaming for help and she reportedly attempted to fight off the assailant . Last-ditch effort: The frightened woman dropped down to the ground trying to prevent the abductor from throwing her into the backseat of the vehicle . Overpowered: The suspect was able to subdue the woman enough to force her inside the car . Missed opportunity: During the struggle, another car drove up to the suspect's vehicle, but the driver quickly retreated and took off from the scene . Her family say Gaither, who works as a nurse, was returning home from visiting her godson Sunday night, and they believe she may have been followed. On Tuesday, held a press conference to address her captors, begging for her release. 'Just release her,' her father, Carl Freeland, said. 'I’m not asking for anything else.' 'It was sickening and that’s the only thing you can say. It looks like that he even knew that she was coming around that corner because he parked his car and then went back for her,' aunt Latesha Tucker-Felder said. Alston was one of the family members to speak before reports on Tuesday, two days after his granddaughter's abduction . Police spokesman Lt. John Stanford told Philly.com it appears from the video the suspect had been watching Freeland-Gaither and laying in wait for her, and that she likely did not know him. Crime scene investigators who were seen working at the site of the kidnapping Monday recovered a glove and a knife. Detectives say it does not look like the abduction was drug-related. City police are now working with state law enforcement and the FBI to locate the kidnapped woman and her abductor. Sought: Police are looking for the vehicle used during the kidnapping, which is believed to be a 2000-2002 dark-gray metallic four-door Ford Taurus with a Pennsylvania license plate, a rear spoiler, and windows broken out on the driver’s and passenger‘s side. The nurse’s father, Carl Freeland, appealed to his daughter’s kidnapper begging him to release Carlesha unharmed. ‘Please just send her back home,’ he told CBS News. ‘Just let my daughter go. Whatever you want, whatever you're asking for, I'll give it to you.’ On Monday evening, police announced that Mayor Michael Nutter has approved $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in this case. Anyone with information about the kidnapping of Freeland-Gaither's whereabouts is being asked to call Philadelphia police at 215-686-3353.","Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, a 22-year-old nurse from Philadelphia, was abducted Sunday on her way home from visiting her godson .

"Radio DJ Neil 'Dr' Fox was arrested at his studio in London today over claims that he sexually assaulted two women. The former Pop Idol judge was held on suspicion of four alleged offences just moments after he finished presenting his breakfast show on Magic FM. The married father-of-three was taken to a central London police station where he was questioned for more than seven hours. Scroll down for video . Radio DJ Neil 'Dr' Fox was arrested at the studios of Magic FM in Soho, London, just moments after he finished presenting his breakfast show this morning. He was being questioned at a central London police station . The broadcaster has been married to wife Vicky, pictured together in 2012 (left) and last year, since 1999. He is being questioned over alleged historical sex offences against two women, according to police . Fox (far right) is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. He has also presented a Channel 5 show based on the Top 40 Chart . Scotland Yard said three of the claims were 'historical' while a fourth is alleged to have taken place earlier this year. He has now been bailed, pending further police inquiries. The 53-year-old, who has been married to wife Vicky since 1999, has presented Magic FM's breakfast show for nine years. He was arrested by Westminster Police in front of colleagues at the station's studios in Soho, London, shortly after coming off air this morning. Bauer Media, which owns Magic FM, confirmed the arrest in a statement and said his show would be off air for the foreseeable future while the claims are dealt with. It said: 'Bauer Media can confirm that Neil Fox, presenter of the Magic Radio breakfast show, was today arrested by Westminster Police. He is currently being questioned about various allegations. 'In the circumstances Neil will be off air from tomorrow to enable him to devote his full attention to dealing with these matters. All other aspects of his contract will remain unchanged while matters are resolved. We can make no further comment at this stage.' Earlier this month Neil Fox hosted Magic FM's London's Biggest Breakfast which was attended by Mayor Boris Johnson, who hosted a breakfast club at the event. He joined the commercial radio station in 2005 . A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard did not name the broadcaster, but said officers had searched addresses in Fulham, west London and in the area of Littlehampton, West Sussex. The probe is the latest in a long line of high-profile and sensitive inquiries into the conduct of ageing celebrities up to 40 years ago. But his arrest is not part of high profile sex crime investigation Operation Yewtree, which was set up in the wake of revelations about BBC presenter Jimmy Savile. A spokeswoman for Scotland Yard said: 'Officers from Westminster this morning arrested a 53-year-old man following allegations of historical sexual assault relating to two women. Mr Fox, pictured left in 2011, who is known by nicknames 'Doctor Fox' and 'Foxy', started his career in local radio. Right: With Pamela Anderson at the National Television Awards in 2002, where Pop Idol won . 'Three of these are described as historic, though we have no time frame on them, and one allegation is from earlier this year. 'The man was arrested at a business address in central London and taken to a central London police station. 'He has now been bailed, pending further inquiries, to return in early December. 'Officers today searched two addresses, one in Fulham, and another in the Littlehampton area of West Sussex.' Mr Fox, who is known by nicknames 'Doctor Fox' and 'Foxy, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM. There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon. The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival. He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans. Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career. But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman. The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade. Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since.

"A Brazilian woman has miraculously survived after being stabbed through the forehead with a huge kitchen knife by her ex-boyfriend. Police officers  found 22-year-old Alcileide Rodrigues dos Santos with the knife still embedded several inches into her skull as she sat on a bench in San Pedro Town, Sao Paolo state. Despite the shocking nature of her injuries, Miss Santos remained perfectly lucid throughout the ordeal and was able to explain to investigators exactly what happened, and even name her 19-year-old former boyfriend Roberto Martins dos Anjos as the alleged culprit. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Horrific: Police officers found 22-year-old Alcileide Rodrigues dos Santos with the knife still embedded several inches into her skull as she sat on a bench in San Pedro Town, Sao Paolo state . Ms Santos said she was attacked by her former boyfriend at about 5pm on Tuesday, but did not reveal the nature of their argument, nor did she explain why it escalated so dramatically. After being stabbed, the 22-year-old sought refuge on a nearby bench, where passing police officers noticed her covered in blood, with the large, white-handled knife still sticking out of her right eyebrow. Officers took her in their car for emergency first aid treatment at the nearby PM Central Police Station, before she was transferred by ambulance to the Hospital Estadual Mário Covas. Unbelievably, despite the knife entering several inches into Ms Santos' skull, it is not thought to have hit her brain, meaning the injuries - dramatic as they appeared - were purely superficial. Attacked: Despite the shocking nature of her injuries, Miss Santos remained perfectly lucid throughout the ordeal and was able to explain to investigators exactly what happened . Treatment: Officers took Alcileide Rodrigues dos Santos for emergency first aid at the nearby PM Central Police Station, before she was transferred by ambulance to the Hospital Estadual Mário Covas (pictured). Now that Ms Santos is expected to make a full recovery, local police are turning their attention to investigating the case. Prime suspect Mr Anjos is said to still be at large and, although the case was first registered by local officers in the municipality of São Bernardo do Campo, the task of tracking him down has now been passed over to Sao Paolo state's military police force. Domestic violence is considered a growing problem in Brazil, with one woman assaulted every 15 seconds and one killed every two hours, according to statistics released last year. Brazil has the seventh highest rate of violence against women in the world and within the past three decades, at least 92,000 women have been killed inside their homes.","Alcileide Rodrigues dos Santos was found with large knife embedded in head .

"Hubbard said the charges - which come just weeks before the November vote in which he is favored for re-election - constitute 'a political witch hunt' Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard has been arrested on 'ethics' charges, with accusations that he has been using public office for his own personal gain. He was indicted by a grand jury on 23 charges accusing him of misusing his speaker's office and his previous post as chairman of the Alabama Republican Party. If convicted, the Speaker faces from two to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $300,000 on each count. Hubbard, 52, said the charges - which come just weeks before the November vote in which he is favored for re-election - constitute 'a political witch hunt'. The speaker, who represents the 79th district in Lee County, insisted that his party had made big changes in 'cleaning up the way things are done in Montgomery'. He said: 'The fact is we have been very successful at getting big things done in Lee County including 3000 new jobs over he past four years.' 'I'm sleeping well at night because I know the people of Lee County can see this for what it is and that's  Hubbard added. The Republican led the GOP's takeover of the Legislature in 2010, ending 136 years of Democratic control. He became the first Republican house speaker since Reconstruction. House Minority Leader Craig Ford argued that it is 'obvious' that the charges are not politically motivated 'because it is a Republican Attorney General leading the investigation'. 'You never like to hear about things like this,' he said in a statement. 'You never want to see anything like this happen to anyone. It shakes the peoples' faith in their elected leaders. 'It is sad to see that, in less than four years, our leaders have embraced the culture of corruption that they ran against in 2010.' The charges brought against Hubbard include 11 counts of soliciting or receiving a thing of value from a lobbyist or principal, four counts of lobbying an executive department or agency for a fee and four counts of using of his office as chairman of the Alabama Republican Party for personal gain. He also faces two counts of using his office as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives for personal gain, one count of voting for legislation with a conflict of interest and a single count of using state equipment, materials, etc. for private gain. Republican Alabama House Speaker Mike Hubbard, 52, has been arrested on 'ethics' charges, with accusations that he has using public office for his own personal gain . According to Fox 6, in a statement, Hubbard's attorney, J. Mark White vowed to fight the charges leveled against his client, insisting Hubbard 'expressly and emphatically denies any wrongdoing'. Describing the authorities who brought the charges as 'rogue prosecutors', he states: Mike Hubbard and his family have been intentionally subjected to a political persecution led by individuals whose defined agenda does not include seeking either justice or truth.' He adds: 'Mike has used his office appropriately, and he has worked to advance the cause of ethics reform in this state; in fact, ethics reforms which had been sought for decades were passed almost immediately after Mike's colleagues selected him as their leader. 'We look forward to bringing the great wrongs committed against Mike Hubbard and violations of his constitutionally-assured rights out of the secrecy and shadows and into the light of day.' The charges are the latest corruption allegations against Alabama politicians to come to light. In early April, Greg Wren resigned his position in the Alabama House of Representatives and pleaded guilty to using his office for personal gain.","Mike Hubbard, 52, is accused of using public office for his own personal gain .

"The Prime Minister announced plans for the new HS3 rail line despite holding a review into the cost of HS2 . Plans for another high-speed rail line in the North will go ahead, say ministers – but they admitted last night they had no idea how much it would cost. On the day the Government confirmed it would hold an official ‘review’ of the spiralling costs of the controversial HS2 line, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor announced their backing for HS3. They claim the line – which will link Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull – could boost the nation’s economy by cutting travel times between the cities by half. But the Government was last night unable to say how much HS3 would cost – claiming it was ‘too early’ to put a figure on the project. They said detailed work on costs and timetable will be published by March. However, the Chancellor has in the past speculated that such a line could cost as much as £6-7billion – leading to claims that further money was being wasted on what many believe is a misconceived and unaffordable project. While northern council chiefs and business leaders welcomed the decision, furious rail protesters said the Government was ‘throwing good money after bad’. It is estimated HS2 – a high-speed line linking from London to the Midlands and the North – could end up costing as much as £50billion. And Stop HS2 campaign manager Joe Rukin said HS3 would be ‘even more expensive per mile than HS2’. The Government says the new East-West HS3 line – connecting with the Y-shaped HS2 at Manchester in the West and Leeds in the East – will provide an engine of economic growth for the region and the UK as a whole. Scroll down for video . Details of the plan were published last night in a report by Sir David Higgins called ‘Rebalancing Britain’. It looked at how the second phase of HS2 high-speed rail project from London to the Midlands and the North could act as a ‘catalyst’ for regeneration in the North. Journey times between Leeds and Manchester could be slashed in half from up to an hour to 26 minutes, while journeys between Leeds and Liverpool could be cut from nearly two hours to just one. George Osborne previously hinted the cost of the project could be around £7billion. He is pictured with Sir David Higgins who compiled the report which detailed the new plans . New plans are also being drawn up to extend the original HS2 into Scotland, Sir David also reveals. Mr Osborne said he was ‘delighted’ with Sir David’s report, adding: ‘Today we take another big step forward in delivering both the HS2 links from north to south and the HS3 link across the Pennines.’ Downing Street’s official statement announced a ‘green light’ for HS3. At the same time Number 10 announced it was launching a ‘review’ of the costs and time-scales of all of the high-speed schemes. Labour’s transport spokesman Mary Creagh, while supporting the schemes in principle, demanded ‘value for money for the taxpayer’. Stop HS2’s Mr Rukin said: ‘If you want to help regenerate the North, you would spend the money there, and the very last thing you would do is make it quicker to get to London.’","Plans for HS3 announced as part 'long term economic plan for the north'

"A five-year-old girl's internal organs and skin began burning from the inside out after suffering a million-to-one toxic reaction to antibiotics she was given for a high temperature. Lydia Lal from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, was put on a life support machine and doctors said she would not survive after an allergy to penicillin triggered an extremely rare illness. She was struck down by TENS, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome, which caused severe burns to her kidneys, liver and lungs as well as painful blisters leaving Lydia without nails, hair or skin. Lydia Lal, five, was put on a life support machine and doctors said she would not survive after an allergy to penicillin triggered an extremely rare illness . The disease causes the top layers of skin to detach from the lower layers all over the body, and can lead to multiple-organ failure. Her mother Asha, 44, said: 'Lydia just didn't look like herself, it was horrible. Her skin was falling off and to start with they couldn't even bandage her. 'Everything was burning and blistering, inside and out. It was just the worst experience of our lives. 'They told me she wouldn't survive and she was put on a life support machine. Three doses of the penicillin overnight very nearly killed my daughter. 'It started on a Saturday and by the time she was taken to a third hospital on the following Thursday doctors were saying she wasn't going to make it through the night. She was treated at Birmingham Children's Hospital for three months and will have to be fed through a tube until next year . Her mother Asha (right) said: 'Lydia just didn't look like herself, it was horrible. Her skin was falling off and to start with they couldn't even bandage her' 'But I never lost my faith throughout. At times that is all we had left. We prayed so much, and phoned all the local churches to get them to pray for Lydia too. 'It didn't matter what they were telling me, I wasn't going home without my daughter. She is a little miracle.' The five-year-old has spent three months in hospital and will have to be fed through a tube until next year. Lydia was prescribed with antibiotics which contained penicillin in May after she went to her GP with a temperature. Her mother had no idea that Lydia was allergic to it, so the youngster took the antibiotics without a second thought. But by the evening, Lydia's skin was blistering and her temperature was dangerously high. The youngster was rushed to University Hospital of North Stafford, in Stoke, where a doctor diagnosed TENS and told the family that the condition affects less than one-in-a-million. Ms Lal said: 'At one point she stopped breathing and we thought we'd lost her. It was the most horrendous time. 'But we had to have faith. Lydia's name means 'hope' and we prayed she would pull through.' Her mother prayed for her little girl to recover and said she received support from Birmingham Children's Hospital Chaplain Kathryn Darby (left) Doctors did not think Lydia would make it through to the next morning, but her mother kept believing. She said: 'I remember Lydia was barely conscious, but she spoke to me, saying she was 'with Jesus' and that he had given her some bread. 'She told me 'I love you'. Bread to us signifies healing and from that day on, no matter what anyone said, I knew she would be okay.' Lydia spent three months in Birmingham Children's Hospital fighting for her life and  her condition has now stabilised. But the school girl has been left with 100 per cent burns on her body. her mother said: 'All she had was a temperature and the next thing she was fighting for her life. 'We were told she wouldn't eat, walk or even see again, but amazingly she pulled through. 'There isn't a part of Lydia's body where she hasn't been burnt but her skin, hair and nails have all grown back and she is a little fighter. 'We have to bathe her skin every day and apply creams to her but she is doing well and is over the worst.' Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, also know as TENS, is a potentially deadly skin disease that usually results from a drug reaction. Another form of the disease is called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and again this usually results from a drug-related reaction. Both can be deadly as well as very painful and distressing. In most cases, these disorders are caused by a reaction to drugs, such as Bextra and the antibiotic, penicillin. This condition can be extremely serious, and can lead to massive discomfort and pain, and in some cases the infection that can be contracted through this disease can result in the death of the patient. The most common cause of death in the case of TENS is infection, which can be contracted through the exposed areas where the skin has come away from the flesh. The skin on patients that have this disease can resemble badly burned skin because of the extent to which it can flay, and exposed areas can seep fluids and become quickly infected.","Lydia Lal, five, almost died after a penicillin allergy triggered a rare illness .

Ms Nex suffered only minor cuts and declined medical attention. At around 9.30p, a 40-year-old man with a deep cut on his hand entered a Dollar Street on Mukilteo Speedway asking for help. When police arrived on the scene, the victim told officers that he was attacked by a sword-wielding man. Ayling's swordplay has sent two people to the hospital suffering from serious injuries . History of violence: His criminal record includes previous arrests on charges of disorderly conduct and possessing and displaying a dangerous weapon . Brandin Ayling was arrested at a home on Fender Drive. He was booked into jail early Thursday and is due in court Friday. Ayling, a graduate of Aces High School who had worked as a hardwood floor technician, has had multiple run-ins with the law over the years. His criminal record includes previous arrests on charges of disorderly conduct and possessing and displaying a dangerous weapon. Ayling's friends told the news station that the 24-year-old has several swords in his Lynnwood home. There is no word at this time on a possible motive behind the attacks .","Brandin Ayling, 24, arrested in three sword attacks in Lynnwood, Washington .

"Researchers are investigating whether a simple eye test could be used to identify the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. A three-year £1.1 million project will look at whether warning signs can be detected using special computer software to analyse high-definition images of the eye. Evidence suggests that changes in the patterns of ocular veins and arteries can be linked to other disease such as stroke and cardiovascular disease. Researchers are examining whether an eye test may be able to point out the early signs of dementia (file image) A team at the University of Dundee’s school of computing have developed the software - known as Vampire - with colleagues at the University of Edinburgh. Project co-ordinator Emanuele Trucco, professor of computational vision at the University of Dundee, said: 'If you can look into someone’s eyes using an inexpensive machine and discover something which may suggest a risk of developing dementia, then that’s a very interesting proposition. 'There is the promise of early warning in a non-invasive way and there is also the fact that we even might be able to use the test to differentiate between different types of dementia.' Researchers will compare measurements of thousands of images with medical histories stored at Dundee’s Ninewells Hospital to see if a relationship can be established. Mr Trucco said: 'When changes occur in some parts of the body, you can see differences in the retinal vessels, e.g. in width, some vessels become thinner; some become larger; differences in the tortuosity, or how wriggly the vessels become; there are also differences in the angles when vessels split in two. Researchers believe the tests could help diagnose dementia, among other ailments, sooner (file image) 'These measurements can indicate a huge amount but to take them by hand is an extremely time-consuming, tedious process. 'The Vampire software interface allows researchers to take these measures repeatedly, reliably, and efficiently even when working with a large number of images.' The Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (EPSRC) has funded the project as part an £8 million investment in research at 11 UK universities. Professor Philip Nelson, EPSRC’s chief executive, said, 'The UK faces a huge challenge over the coming decades, we have an ageing population and a likely rise in the numbers of people suffering from dementias. 'These research projects will improve our abilities to detect and understand dementias and how the disease progresses.'","Three-year project will examine whether signs can be detected in eye tests .

"The head of the UN mission to fight Ebola has said he does not have the resources to defeat the disease which is still accelerating in some areas of Africa. Anthony Banbury said more help is urgently needed as some villages have still received no help, despite significant contributions from the UK, China, Cuba and the US.

He said his organisation does not yet have the capacity to defeat the disease. 'We definitely do not have the response capability on the ground now for the international community to defeat this disease yet,' he said.

"They tour the world, party whenever they want and live truly lavish lifestyles but the hedonistic habits of musicians have a serious downside – they are likely to die younger than their vocally challenged counterparts. A professor at Sydney University has studied seven decades of popular musicians’ lifespans and found they were up to 25 years shorter than the comparable US population, in findings published on The Conversation. Dianna Kenny, Professor of Psychology and Music at University of Sydney, was eager to find out why so many pop stars die young and examined 12,665 stars from all popular genres who died between 1950 and June 2014. Tragic: Amy Winehouse, seen here performing in Los Angeles in 2007, died at the age of 27 from alcohol poisoning on 23 July 2011. The British singer had suffered from years of drug and alcohol abuse . Astonishingly 90 per cent of them, 11,478, also happened to be male. Much has been debated about the existence of a ‘27 club’, an age when a whole host of talented musicians at the height of their fame have died, often through suicide involving drug or alcohol misuse. After Kurt Cobain, who struggled with heroin addiction, illness and depression, was found dead - having shot himself in the head in April 1994 - the devastating effect fame had on his happiness was revealed. Before him, came the likes of Rolling Stones rocker Brian Jones in 1969, Alan Wilson, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin in 1970 and Jim Morrison in 1971. Jimi Hendrix, one of the most talented electric guitarists in history, died in London in 1970 at the age of 27 . Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's body was found in a greenhouse above the garage of his Seattle home in 1994. He shot himself in the head at the age of 27 . When British singer Amy Winehouse also died at the age of 27 from alcohol poisoning, on 23 July 2011, following years of alcohol and drug addiction, the theory was compounded. Professor Kenny found that the early 1990s were the peak years for death by suicide for musicians, with the amount of stars taking their own lives rising from 5.9 per cent in the decade before to 9.5 per cent. But she also discovered that over the six decades she studied, suicide rates were between two and seven times greater in musicians than the US population. American rock singer Janis Joplin was found dead in her Los Angeles hotel room, apparently of a drug overdose, on October 4, 1970. She was also 27 . American singer-songwriter and guitarist Jeff Buckley, seen here performing at Glastonbury in 1995, drowned in 1997 while swimming fully clothed . Brian Jones, the founder and original bandleader of iconic rock group the Rolling Stones who fell into drug and alcohol addiction, died at the age of 27 in 1969. He drowned in the swimming pool at his home in Sussex, England, after splitting from the band . As well as suicide, murder is also a big risk for musicians. The academic revealed that homicide rates were up to eight times greater amongst musicians than the US population. The fatal shootings of Tupac Shakar, who died in 1996 when he was just 25-years-old during a drive-by shooting, and The Notorious B.I.G who died at the age of 24 in 1997, are just two examples from the staggering statistics. Musician homicide rates peaked at 6.6 per cent in the 1990s after it was just 4 per cent in the 1980s and 5.9 per cent in and around 1970. Contrastingly, in the 50s and 60s more musicians died from accidents such as plane and car crashes, such as Buddy Holly and Otis Redding. Whitney Houston - the most awarded female act of all time, who sold over 200 million records worldwide – died at the age of 48 on February 11, 2012. Her body was found in a bath tub at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California . Lead singer of The Doors Jim Morrison died at the age of 27 in Paris after an alleged heroin overdose . Michael Jackson, seen here at London's Wembley stadium during his Bad world tour in 1988, died at the age of 50 while he was preparing for his comeback tour This Is It . Alan Wilson, leader of the the American blues band Canned Heat, died at the age of 27. An autopsy identified his cause of death as accidental acute barbiturate intoxication . According to Professor Kenny’s research female musicians tend to die in their early 60s rather than their 80s like the rest of us. Whereas male musicians die in their late 50s compared to non-rock stars who die around 75. Whitney Houston - the most awarded female act of all time, who sold over 200 million records worldwide – died at the age of 48 on February 11, 2012. Coroner’s ruled she had accidentally drowned in the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factor, but her struggle with fame, drink and drugs over the decades was well documented. Rapper Tupac Shakur died when he was just 25-years-old during a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas . Rival rapper The Notorious B.I.G died in LA in 1997 in a drive-by shooting at the age of 24. He had feared for his life for some time as part of an ongoing East Coast–West Coast feud and because of his level of fame . Meanwhile, Michael Jackson also tragically died before his time at the age of 50 in 2009. The singer was preparing for his comeback tour This Is It when he died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The coroner ruled his death a homicide and his personal physician Conrad Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Professor Kenny concluded that the reason musicians die younger than those that don’t make a living out of singing on stage is because the ‘pop music “scene” fails to provide boundaries and to model and expect acceptable behaviour’. She claims their lifestyle ‘valorises outrageous behaviour and the acting out of aggressive, sexual and destructive impulses that most of us dare only live out in fantasy’.","Popular musicians' lifespans are up to 25 years shorter than the comparable US population .

"One in ten Britons are now making money from a hobby, research shows. Millions of people are turning their passion into part-time businesses, with the average hobby entrepreneur earning £1,815 a year from their venture. These part-time businesses contribute £8billion a year to the UK economy, according to Visa Europe. Sweet success: Imogen Hawthorne, 29, started her own cake-making business three years ago . In its report on the rise of ‘micro-entrepreneurship’, it found more than half of UK adults have a hobby or business idea they would like to turn into a money-making venture. One in ten have already done so. A quarter of this group said they has launched their own sideline because they liked being their own boss, while the same number also said it enabled them to do something they were passionate about. The internet has boosted numbers, with many selling their products online and more than half advertising their goods on Twitter or Facebook, Visa said. Hobby entrepreneurs working in design earned the most at £3,700 per year, while photographers were close behind earning £2,400. Builders and decorators earned £2,300, but jewellery makers made just £300 – even less than bloggers at £400. Optometrist Imogen Hawthorne, 29, started her own cake-making business three years ago. Miss Hawthorne had always baked cakes for family and friends but began to make a profit from her hobby when she was asked to make 600 cupcakes for a large Asian wedding. Miss Hawthorne, who works as an optometrist, said she has always baked cakes for family and friends but began to make a profit from her hobby when she was asked to make 600 cupcakes for a wedding . 1) Design - £3,707 . 2) Sports - £2,764 . 3) Photography - £2,405 . 4) Building and decorating - £2,353 . 5) Teaching and tutoring - £2,258 . 6) Baking and cooking - £1,643 . 7) Arts and crafts - £1,443 . 8) Beauty and fashion - £1,300 . 9) Blogging - £418 . 10) Jewellery/accessory making - £300 . She said: ‘A friend asked me if I could make some cupcakes – 600 of them. I said ‘err, of course I can’, not really thinking. ‘It took me 12 hours to bake them, ice them and make individual icing butterflies for the top, but another four nights to put 600 favours boxes together for them to go in.’ She soon received more orders through word-of-mouth and started to sell her cakes at a local food market under the name Immy Paisley. Her pudding-in-a-jar – including panna cotta and cheesecake – are particularly popular, she said. Like many hobby entrepreneurs, she barely broke even in the first year as she invested in equipment, but now earns almost £2,000 a year. This is above the national average for part-time baking businesses at £1,600. Miss Hawthorne, who works at Wolverhampton Eye Infirmary and lives with her comic book illustrator boyfriend Adam Bolton in Birmingham, said: ‘I think for a lot of people, part-time businesses are about scratching a creative itch. ‘I love my job as an optometrist but I wanted to do something creative with my spare time. ‘I bake in my evenings and weekends, although I try to give myself Sunday off when I can. Having my own business means it’s a hobby which pays for itself.’ Kevin Jenkins, of Visa UK & Ireland, which commissioned the survey of 2,000 UK adults, said: ‘Hobbies have always provided the first step to starting a micro-business. ‘Now, the breadth of opportunity is accelerating. Hobby entrepreneurs are no longer limited to their neighbourhood audience or word-of-mouth marketing. ‘Selling and marketing via the internet opens up the market to everyone. ‘It is a chance for anyone and everyone to be in business with an idea or craft they are passionate about.’","Half of UK's adults have hobby they'd like to turn into money-making venture .

"A letter thought to mark the beginning of the warm relationship between Margaret Thatcher and Jimmy Savile has been made public for the first time. But other correspondence between the pair has been censored, raising questions over what it contains. The Top Of The Pops presenter sent an adoring letter to the then prime minister in 1980, singing her praises and declaring his love for her. Warm relationship: The letter is thought to mark the beginning of a close friendship between Jimmy Savile and Margaret Thatcher. But further correspondence between the pair has been censored because it is 'personal' or 'confidential' Correspondence: A handwritten letter from Jimmy Savile in which he declared his 'love' for Margaret Thatcher after being invited to lunch with her was released by the National Archives under the 30-year rule . She responded by inviting the now-disgraced DJ to lunch at Chequers, spending 11 consecutive New Year’s Eves with him and overseeing his knighthood. The letter, part of a Savile file released under the 30-year rule by the National Archives at Kew today, reveals how well connected to the establishment he was. But parts of some exchanges between Savile and Mrs Thatcher were censored in October this year – eight days after claims that he had sexually abused people surfaced in an ITV documentary. The text of a letter from Savile to Mrs Thatcher and a phone message that he left for her were deleted from the file under the Freedom of Information Act on October 11. The information is exempt because it is ‘personal’ or ‘confidential’. But the timing raises the question of whether the information was redacted in light of the negative headlines. Correspondence remaining in the file includes the gushing letter Savile sent to Mrs Thatcher after a lunch meeting to discuss funding for Stoke Mandeville Hospital. In it, he also hints at becoming a knight, something arranged during Mrs Thatcher’s tenure and awarded in the New Year’s Honours in 1990, a month after she left office. Close: The note, written in February 1980, is signed with kisses and bears Savile¿s distinctive signature, with a smiley face in the J of his name . The letter reads: ‘I waited a week . before writing to thank you for my lunch invitation because I had such a . superb time I didn’t want to be too effusive. ‘My . girl patients pretended to be madly jealous and wanted to know what you . wore and what you ate. All the paralysed lads called me “Sir James” all . week. They all love you. Me too!!’ The . note, written in February 1980, is signed with kisses and bears . Savile’s distinctive signature, with a smiley face in the J of his name. There . is no record of Mrs Thatcher’s reply, but a later memo to her from her . personal secretary asks in a worried tone whether she has agreed to . appear on Jim’ll Fix It. In the message dated March 9, 1981, . after the DJ had lunch with Mrs Thatcher at Chequers, Caroline Stephens . wrote: ‘Can you kindly let me know if you made any promises to Jimmy . Savile when he lunched with you yesterday, for instance: . ‘(i) Did you offer him any money for Stoke Mandeville? ‘(ii) Did you tell him that you would appear on Jim’ll Fix It?’ In felt pen, Mrs Thatcher replies to the first saying: ‘Will tell you in detail. MT.’ To the second, she simply writes: ‘No.’ Censored: The text of a letter from Savile to Mrs . Thatcher and a phone message that he left for her were deleted from the . file under the Freedom of Information Act on October 11 . Pariah: Savile was invited to lunches at Chequers, spending 11 consecutive New Year's Eves with Mrs Thatcher who also oversaw his knighthood . Praised . during his life for his charity work, especially at Stoke Mandeville, . Savile has now been unmasked as a serial child abuser. More than 450 people have made allegations of abuse by the DJ, who died last year aged 84. The . papers released by the National Archive today include an entire Savile . file devoted to his correspondence with Mrs Thatcher and her aides about . his charity work and pleas for Government money for his projects. There are also a number of redactions made in October – other files released today were edited much earlier in the year. In . the 1981 section of the file, there are discussions about Savile’s . suggestion of a Government contribution to Stoke Mandeville during a . meeting with Mrs Thatcher. No . 10 private secretary Mike Pattison wrote: ‘The Prime Minister said was . he thinking of a million pounds and Mr Savile replied that they would be . grateful for any sum.’ In December 1981, the Government announced that it would give £500,000 to the Stoke Mandeville Appeal.","Letter from Jimmy Savile to former PM released under 30-year rule .

"An inquest into the deaths of three babies who were born at home has begun in Perth. The West Australian Coroner's Court heard on Tuesday that an infant, known as Baby C for legal reasons, started grunting and struggling to breathe within the first hour of his life in February 2010. The home birth had been attended by two registered midwives, although one of them had not met the mother before she went into labour. An inquest into the deaths of three babies who died during home births began at the The West Australian Coroner's Court on Tuesday. Picture posed by model . They decided to rush the baby to Fremantle Hospital and despite efforts to revive him, he was pronounced dead just over an hour later, with one of the causes of death determined to be Group B streptococcal infection. The inquest seeks to clarify the circumstances in which he died, given little is known about what information was provided to his parents about home birthing risks, why the mother was not transferred to hospital sooner and what may have led to the baby becoming infected with the bacteria. In the case of Baby B, the inquest seeks to clarify, among other things, why an obstetrician at King Edward Memorial Hospital (KEMH) who had determined the mother should not have a home birth due to previous foetal complications was not told of her plan to go ahead with it. He had expressed his concerns to the publicly-funded Community Midwifery Program, but no one got back in touch with him. Before the mother gave birth, she complained of a headache and ringing in her ears, and was advised by the midwife to go to KEMH, where she was tested. An infant known as 'Baby C' started grunting and struggling to breathe within the first hour of his life in February 2010, and later died in hospital after contracting a bacterial infection. Picture posed by model . After being discharged home in May 2010, she gave birth, but the baby was floppy and not breathing, and the midwives could not feel a heartbeat. They moved to resuscitate him and he was rushed by ambulance to Armadale Hospital. While he was breathing when he arrived, he was displaying seizure-like behaviour and was diagnosed with hypoxic brain damage. Because of the extent of the damage, he was sent home and died three days later. The inquest will seek to clarify the circumstances in which the woman was released home from hospital after complaining about feeling ill. In the case of Baby P, the mother employed a woman who was not a registered midwife, but who she believed to be fully qualified, to handle her birth of twins at home in July 2011. Inquest seeks to clarify the circumstances in which he died, given little is known about what his parents understood about home birthing risks. Picture posed by model . The first baby was healthy, whereas Baby P was not breathing and did not have a heartbeat. The unregistered midwife and a registered midwife who was helping her tried to resuscitate him, but had to call an ambulance, which arrived 18 minutes later. On arrival at hospital, resuscitation continued and the baby was repeatedly given adrenaline. Eventually a slow and faint pulse of 70 beats per minute was heard, but dropped to 30. Notwithstanding these measurements, resuscitation ceased and the baby was considered a still birth. A neonatologist provided an opinion to the court that it was possible that the baby may have responded to such resuscitation had he been born in a hospital. The inquest continues.","Inquest into deaths of three babies who were born at home begins in Perth .

"A northern New Mexico sheriff's deputy shot and killed a fellow deputy at a hotel Tuesday after transporting a prisoner to Arizona, authorities said. The shooting took place just after midnight at the Hotel Encanto in the southern New Mexico city of Las Cruces, police said. Officials said the two Santa Fe County deputies—Tai Chan, 27, and Jeremy Martin, 29—had dropped off the prisoner and were heading back to Santa Fe, nearly 300 miles from the hotel, Albuquerque Journal reported. Deputy Tai Chan (left) allegedly killed fellow deputy Jeremy Martin, a father of three, after a night of drinking . Police tape is seen in the lobby of the Hotel Encanto, where Deputy Tai Chan, 27,  allegedly shot fellow deputy Jeremy Martin, 29 . The Las Cruces PD investigate the shooting  at Hotel Encanto . The two had been drinking at the Dublin's Street Pub and started arguing, police said. They headed back to their room and, at some point, the argument got even more heated. That's when Chan allegedly fired several rounds from a semi-automatic gun as Martin ran away toward the elevator, cops said. Martin was bleeding heavily outside the elevator in the lobby with several shots in his back and arms. He was rushed to Mountain View Regional Medical Center, where he died. Martin, who was married and had three children, had been been a deputy for two years. Detectives found Chan in a stairwell near the roof of Hotel Encanto. Chan, who had four years in the Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office, was being questioned Tuesday morning. Chan is being interrogated by police after he allegedly shot a colleague in the back . Investigators gather evidence from a deputy's vehicle in the parking lot of Hotel Encanto . Martin's wife, Sarah Martin, told the Journal he 'was a great dad, a great husband, a family guy, well grounded. 'I am still kind of processing,' said Sarah Martin, with whom the deputy had three children ages 4, 9, and 11. 'I think everyone is quite shocked … he (Jeremy) was a self-sacrificing kind of a person and put everyone else first,' she told the newspaper. 'He was very well-balanced as far as family and career. 'He had a big heart and gave everyone the benefit of the doubt.' Detectives search Chan's car on Tuesday in the hours following the shooting of Deputy Martin . Santa Fe County Sheriff Robert Garcia said his department was grieving and that he was at a loss for words, describing the shooting as a 'major shock.' 'I have grief counselors or crisis counselors here now meeting with a lot of my personnel, but it's a grieving law enforcement agency,' Garcia said. 'In this line of work, you worry about something like this happening daily, but not from one deputy to another,' he told the Los Angeles Times. 'I haven't dealt with anything in my 34-year career like this.' Sheriff Robert Garcia (center) says the shooting has been incredibly tough on his department . Garcia told the Times that the deputies didn't usually work together, but he was unaware of any animosity between them. 'There was nothing to ever indicate that something like this would ever take place,' Garcia told the newspaper. 'Now I have an agency that needs to support each other through the grieving process.'

"A woman whose severely disabled son died after alcohol was put in his IV was released from jail Tuesday after a judge set bail, saying prosecutors couldn't prove she intended to kill the child. Judge Robert Bent said prosecutors have 'a viable manslaughter case' against Melissa Robitille in the August 22 death of 13-year-old Isaac Robitille, but not a second-degree murder case. Intent is necessary for a second-degree murder charge. Robitille's attorney, Robert Sussman, said she was released Tuesday afternoon, hours after Bent set her $25,000 unsecured bail. Freed: Prosecutors say they have 'a viable manslaughter case' against Melissa Robitille in the August 22 death of 13-year-old son Isaac, but not a second-degree murder case . Loss: Isaac, who was born with a brain abnormality, is pictured with Walter Richters. He passed away on August 22 after Richters put vodka in the boy's IV drip . Isaac was born with significant disabilities that required the assistance of caretakers for up to 80 hours a week. Feeding tubes supplied him with a diet of a pediatric nutritional drink, baby formula, water and vitamins. 'The state has failed to present evidence sufficient to meet its burden as to proof of the defendant's intent to kill Issac, a child who she had been taking care of under trying circumstances,' the judge wrote Tuesday following a Monday hearing to determine if she should be held without bail. The judge did not throw out the more serious second-degree murder charge, however, saying that was not the purpose of the hearing. Robitille, 39, had been held without bail since her arrest earlier this month. Isaac was born with significant disabilities that required the assistance of caretakers for up to 80 hours a week. Feeding tubes supplied him with a diet of a pediatric nutritional drink, baby formula, water and vitamins. Police say Robitille's boyfriend, Walter Richters, told them he poured vodka in the boy's feeding tube to quiet him after asking Robitille if it would be OK. She answered that it wouldn't hurt. Accused: Robitille told authorities she hadn't wanted an autopsy on her son, her fiance said. The medical examiner found that the boy had a blood alcohol level twice the legal driving limit in the state . Arrests: Melissa Robitille, right, and Walter Richters III, left, both 38, allegedly put alcohol in her disabled son's IV tube, killing him. They were charged after the autopsy was completed . Deputy Caledonia County States Attorney Maria Byford said the evidence shows Robitille knew that changes to her son's feeding could be harmful to him, the Caledonian Record reported. 'We have a defendant that said she's nervous when she switches up the juice that she gives to him,' Byford said. But the judge was not convinced. 'You have to have something that says that these folks knew this was gonna kill,' Bent said in court Monday. 'You've got to show me what these people knew in advance, that they were conscious of it ... as opposed to being a mistake.'

"WIN journalist Lincoln Humphries has joined the ranks of Australians posting pictures of themselves in the hopes of winning $10,000 in an online competition to find the 'hottest selfie'. The competition, run by Brisbane-based company Serious Selfie, offers the cash prize for the most likes on a photo, and has attracted hundreds of photos from men and women all around the country, including Humphries. The journalist has a different take on the competition than most, posting a photo of himself pulling a face similar to a recognisable meme where two animals appear to be pulling the same expression. Under the caption 'Hey bebz, Vote 4 me. Xox', Humphries originally promised that he would use the $10,000 prize money on a 'sweet party for everyone', and a pug dog, but decided to put the money towards charity if he won.

Xox', Humphries originally promised that he would use the $10,000 prize money on a 'sweet party for everyone', and a pug dog, but decided to put the money towards charity if he won . Some entrants have taken a similar tack to Humphries, poking fun at the selfie competition . The journalist garnered media attention earlier in the year when he refused to take part in the ice bucket challenge, when a private video that showed Humphries, on the set of WIN news, urging viewers to ‘stop wasting ice’ and donate to charities helping areas with water shortages instead. 'I saw the competition and thought it was novel, a bit strange,' Humphries told Daily Mail Australia. 'I thought it would be pretty funny to enter, and obviously enough people agree with me there. I think there are always things we can take less seriously, and this is one of them.' Several Facebook users suggested Humphries employ some of the tactics used in many of the Hot Selfie photo entrants. 'Maybe you should get your cleavage out and go a little heavier on the eye makeup and pouting? You are also an 11/10. Just got accentuate your assets there, Linc.' one user posted. Another wrote, 'The very nature of the competition will attract luvvoes, who think they're hot s**t, and who love to strike a pose for their own camera. Can't imagine any of the contestants are very deep or complex individuals.' So far, entrants into the competition include cast members from Australia's production of musical Grease, Gretel Scarlett and Bobby Fox - who recently recorded a song with model Miranda Kerr. Currently Humphries' selfie has 256 likes on the Hot Selfie competition page, behind Rochelle Wilkie, who has 520 likes who is in the lead. Rochelle Wilkie is currently in the lead for the Hot Selfie competition with 520 likes . 'I'm a bit concerned about the stiff competition,' he joked. On his Facebook page, Humphries wrote 'Currently some sheila with genuine narcissistic principles is winning this, so-called, 'Hot Selfie Competition.' That's a bit lame.' Rochelle, who entered after being prompted by her sister, said that if she won she was going to donate half of the money to the Royal Perth Hospital ICU where her father was hospitalised recently for two months after complication from catching pneumonia. 'I want to say thank you for the work they have done over the past months,' Rochelle told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was physically and mentally draining for my Mum and myself, but the support we had from his nurses who watched him 24 hours a day was incredible.' 'I know it isn't a lot but a little can go a long way.' 'Everyone that knows me, knows that I love taking a selfie whether it be a smile, duck face or pulling a horrible face that only my mother would love. I think it's awesome to see people take enough pride in themselves and how they look to share it online for everyone to see.' Rochelle said she had seen Humphries selfie, and not only thought it was funny, but voted for it to win. 'His photo is awesome, I love it. I actually voted for his photo and commented suggesting he donates the money to Royal Perth Hospital if he wins,' she said. Australian residents over the age of 16 can enter and entrants have the option to enter one selfie for $4.99 or three selfies for $9.99 . entrants into the competition include cast members from Australia's production of musical Grease, Gretel Scarlett and Bobby Fox - who recently recorded a song with model Miranda Kerr . Humphries has promised to donate the money to the charity of choice of the person who's suggestion on his Facebook garnered the most likes, which he referred to as 'democratising the donation'. 'I'm interested in who is actually financing this debacle. Where is the $10,000 coming from?' he asked. The WIN journalist said that he wished the best for Rochelle, especially considering her father's recent health issues. 'At the end of the day, if the money helps someone, that's a great thing.' A spokeswoman for Serious Selfie said the snaps were so legitimate these days that they could launch careers. 'From bikini a day to Australia’s Next Top Model, selfies are forging careers for would-be models and lifestyle bloggers,' she said. Rochelle said that some of the money might go towards paying off her credit card and costs from her 21st birthday celebrations next weekend. 'I think at the end of the day regardless of what people say, everyone loves a little attention (after all that's why we take selfies) so it doesn't bother me at all,' she said.

"Salador Dali spoof: Online jokers have posted images mocking the bendy iPhone 6 . More than £12billion was wiped off the value of Apple yesterday after its latest iPhone was rendered unusable by a software update. The 3.5 per cent drop in the share price meant the company’s stock lost all gains it had made since launching the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus last week. Users of the brand new devices were cut off from telephone signal and data networks, meaning they could not make or receive calls and text messages or go on the internet away from wifi signal. The update for the iOS 8.0.1 operating system also killed off the Touch ID function, a much-trumpeted feature that allows users to log on to their phone using their fingerprint. It prompted the technology giant to take the unusual step of withdrawing the software completely, rather than issuing a fix. Before the latest drama the group was worth around $600billion, or £367.7billion, but as shares slipped, some $20million, or £12.2billion was lost from its value. It is the second major issue with Apple’s latest mobile phones, which cost between £539 and £789. This week hundreds of users have complained that the devices – the slimmest Apple phones yet – are prone to bending in the pocket. The apparent fault has sparked a social media storm in the last 24 hours, with terms such as #BendGate trending on Twitter, while internet spoofs have gone viral. One, entitled the Dali edition, has mocked up an iPhone bending over the edge of a table like the melting clocks in Salvador Dali’s painting The Persistence Of Memory. The iOS 8.0.1 update was issued to solve glitches discovered within the iOS 8 package sold with every new phone. An article in yesterday's Daily Mail about Apple's bendy iPhone mishap . Virals: Images have been circling the web mocking the bandy iPhone, including one with magician Uri Geller bending it like a spoon (left) and a spoof advert (right) The problems also affected users of older iPhones and some iPads, who complained that battery life disappeared in just four hours, while others reported problems connecting to wifi, using apps and said their devices were running slowly and kept on freezing. As a result Apple support forums were flooded with complaints. An iPad mini owner claimed their four-month-old tablet had been ‘wrecked’ by the software, adding: ‘These are like problems you have on an ancient computer.’ Another said that both their iPad 2 and iPhone 5 were playing up, saying: ‘It is horrible to use. It is so frustrating.’ Costly error: People have taken to Twitter to make jokes about the new iPhone - its faults have led to Apple's shares plummeting by £12billion . The iOS 8.0.1 update was withdrawn less than an hour after it was made available, after users started complaining late on Wednesday night. This time it appears to have affected users of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, rather than users of older iPhones and iPads. Apple said in a statement: ‘We apologise for the great inconvenience experienced by users, and are working around the clock to prepare iOS 8.0.2 with a fix for the issue, and will release it as soon as it is ready in the next few days.’ They also published a step-by-step guide on how to re-install the old software to make phones usable.","The huge losses equate to a 3.5 per cent drop in share price .

"Devin Nottis, 19, of Pascagoula, Mississippi, was charged with grand larceny after stealing a flamingo . A college student has been arrested after a bungled prank led to the deaths of two Chilean flamingos at the Hattiesburg Zoo. Devin Nottis, 19, of Pascagoula, Mississippi, is charged with grand larceny, Hattiesburg police spokesman Lt. Jon Traxler said on Thursday. The University of Southern Mississippi student was arrested on Wednesday night for stealing a female flamingo. Police said that during a scavenger hunt for new pledges, Nottis took a flamingo instead of taking a picture of the bird. The executive director of the organization that runs the Hattiesburg Zoo says a female bird was taken at 1.08am on Tuesday and found later that morning, several miles away. Rick Taylor says it was returned to the zoo and had to be euthanized because of its injuries. Officials said a second flamingo was injured in the incident and died on Wednesday. The male flamingo was the mate of the female and sustained his injuries by defending his mate. The zoo posted surveillance footage from the park on its Facebook page on Tuesday with an appeal for anyone with information to come forward. The message said: 'An eye witness also saw a group of people scaling the Zoo fence around the same time last night, carrying what appeared to be a large bird.' Scroll down for video . Two flamingos had to be put down at the Mississippi zoo (the flamingo enclosure is pictured) following the frat boys prank gone wrong in the early hours of Tuesday . The zoo said that the death of the female flamingo cut its ability to breed more of the exotic birds by 25 per cent. In a statement to MailOnline today, The University of Southern Mississippi said it had indefinitely suspended the Delta Mu Chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity (PIKE) at the school, following the arrest of one of its pledges . The student has also been placed on interim suspension by the University. During that suspension, the 19-year-old is barred from being on the university campus for any reason other than to go to the Dean's office. 'The University is taking swift and appropriate action in response to this incident,' said Southern Miss Vice President for Student Affairs Dr. Joe Paul. 'This is a terrible and heinous act that has occurred, and inconsistent with the values of our institution.' Hattiesburg Zoo released surveillance footage on Tuesday to catch the culprits who broke into the zoo and stole a pink flamingo which eventually led to the death of that bird and another . Four individuals could be seen on security tape covering their faces. Devin Nottis, who attends Southern Mississippi university has since been arrested . As Nottis allegedly pulled a female flamingo from its enclosure, its mate sustained fatal injuries trying to defend the other bird .","Devin Nottis, 19, of Pascagoula, Mississippi, is charged with grand larceny .

"A disabled woman with a weak bladder was left 'totally humiliated' when she wet herself in the middle of a JobCentre reception because staff refused to let her use the toilet. Rebecca Weston, who suffers from cerebral palsy, wanted the ground to swallow her up after the incident at the JobCentrePlus in Mitcham, south London. The former nursery worker for Mitcham Council had to go to the centre  for an interview to have a benefits review meeting with a member of staff on September 29. Rebecca Weston, who suffers from cerebral palsy, is angry at Mitcham JobCentre after she wet herself because staff refused to let her use their toilet . But soon after she arrived at the London Road building she quickly realised she needed the toilet. She said: 'I asked the security guard if I could use the toilet and he just said no. 'I told him 'I'm registered disabled and have a weak bladder which is unlikely to hold'. I asked him to please let me in or else I was going to wet myself on his floor. 'He thought I was threatening to wet myself and he just said 'you're not using it. 'He told me to go to the coffee shop next door but I was desperate and I told him 'I'm not going to make it.' Miss Weston attempted to make her way to the coffee shop but before she even reached the JobCentre door she said she could feel urine running down her leg. The incident happened at the JobCentre in London Road, Mitcham, South London . 'When I wet myself I really wet myself and it was pouring down and running off my shoes,' she said . 'My feet were squelching. It was the most humiliating moment of my life. I wanted the ground to swallow me up, I just wanted to die.' She said other  JobCentre clients were left speechless by the incident. 'It is bad enough when this happens to me in private but there were people watching - it was awful,' she said. 'It is the attitude that upsets me. He (the security guard) thought I was just some stupid little girl being difficult but that wasn't the case.' Miss Weston was diagnosed with her crippling condition at the age of two and suffers poor balance and pain in her legs. She said  the way she was treated by staff as she stood shaking in the reception was 'appalling'. 'I was horrified by this point. I was hyperventilating and in a right old state,' she said. 'Then the woman I was due to be meeting came from behind her desk and said 'well obviously I'm not going to see you in this state so you will have to go home'. 'I was totally humiliated. It hurts me every day.' A spokesman for the JobCentre said the site does not have a public toilet and Ms Weston was advised to go to a nearby cafe. Ms Weston admitted swearing  following the incident, but said she was frustrated by the attitude of staff. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'Jobcentres don't have public toilets, but our staff will always try to accommodate people's individual needs where possible. 'However people should also be aware that we do not tolerate abusive behaviour towards our staff.'","Cerebral Palsy sufferer  was not allowed to use toilet despite weak bladder .

"A mobile payment service backed by Wal-Mart, Best Buy and other leading retailers is defending its practice of prohibiting its members from accepting alternatives such as Apple Pay. However, Merchant Customer Exchange shopped short of giving a reason for requiring exclusivity. The rivalry is heating up as more Americans choose to shop and spend time on their mobile devices. Eddy Cue, Apple Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, demonstrates the new Apple Pay mobile payment system at a Whole Foods store in Cupertino. A consortium of retailers called Merchant Customer Exchange plans to offer a rival mobile payment system next year. Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. But officials say retailers may choose to leave without penalty, so they could accept those alternatives, which are based on a wireless technology called near-field communication, or NFC. CVS and Rite Aid this week joined a long list of the world's largest retailers who will not be accepting Apple Pay. At its launch, Apple boasted there are 200,000 retail stores now ready and willing to let you give them your cash using just a flick of your iPhone and a tap of your finger to prove your identity. But retail giants Walmart, Target, Kohl's. Dunkin' Donuts are not among them. These retail giants and dozens more are part of a group developing their own mobile payment scheme. 'Merchants make their own choices about their commitment to MCX and make their own choices about other forms of payment,' said Dekkers Davidson, the group's CEO. However, an MCX blog post earlier said that when merchants choose MCX, 'they choose to do so exclusively.' MCX is testing its CurrentC system and plans to launch it in 2015. The service has garnered criticism as some of the group's biggest members, including CVS, 7-Eleven, Best Buy and Wal-Mart, are refusing NFC payments even though their stores have the equipment. MCX was also the target of a hack. In Wednesday's call, MCX said a small number of email addresses were obtained in a breach, but no other identifying information or any financial information was obtained. The CurrentC app itself was not affected, and the organization has contacted everyone whose email address was affected. The Apple Pay service can store Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information. Apple said shops like Macy's and Bloomingdales, drugstores including Walgreen's and Duane Reade, and other stores including McDonald's, Staples, Subway and Whole Foods are participating in Apple Pay. When Apple Pay launched on Oct. 20, retailer resistance had been expected because Apple hasn't offered incentives to install new point-of-sale terminals and train staff on its new mobile payment system. But this week it became clear that many large retailers declined to accept Apple Pay because they were part of MCX, which requires exclusivity. On Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Apple Pay had over 1 million activations in the first three days after it became available and is now more widely used than any competing payment system. He called the dispute with retailers a 'skirmish.' Drugstore chains CVS and Rite Aid both last week stopped customers using the new service which lets users pay for goods by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal. But Mr Cook said there were plenty of other retailers around the world signing up, claiming Apple Pay already totes up more transactions than all other 'contactless' payment methods combined. Davidson said it was 'entirely possible' that in the future merchants can accept both MCX and the other forms of mobile payments, although did not give a timeline for when that might occur. CurrentC lets users pay through a checking account, a store-brand card or a gift card, in addition to regular credit and debit cards. In that sense, it is different than Apple Pay, which lets users pay only through credit and debit cards. Merchants save transaction fees when customers use something other than a credit or debit card. Davidson said MCX was in talks with other 'substantial financial institutions' and said 'over time we expect all cards will be welcome at CurrentC.' Officials said that MCX, which uses barcode technology, also might expand to include NFC, which Apple Pay uses, if it deems that necessary in the future. There are more than 200,000 payment terminals that should accept Apple Pay in the U.S. Apple has announced about two dozen leading retail chains accepting Apple Pay at launch, and others are planning to do so by the end of the year. Apple said it has worked with several retailers to make sure most of their stores, if not all of them, were ready at Monday's launch: Aeropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Babies R Us, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Champs Sports, Chevron and Texaco retail stores including ExtraMile, Disney Store, Duane Reade, Footaction, Foot Locker, House of Hoops by Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Macy's, McDonald's, Nike, Office Depot, Panera Bread, Petco, RadioShack, RUN by Foot Locker, SIX:02, Sports Authority, Subway, Toys R Us, Unleashed by Petco, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods Market. Bright side: Dozens of retailers will be accepting Apple Pay, the biggest of which include Subway, Whole Fooods, Walgreens, McDonald's and Macy's . Apple also said that the following merchants plan to add support by the end of the year: Anthropologie, Free People, Sephora, Staples, Urban Outfitters and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. For online payments, Apple said the following merchants have apps ready for Apple Pay: Chairish, Fancy, Groupon, HotelTonight, Houzz, Instacart, Lyft, OpenTable, Panera Bread, Spring, Staples, Target and Uber. Others expected by year's end include: Airbnb, Disney Store, Eventbrite, JackThreads, Levi's Stadium by VenueNext, Sephora, Starbucks, StubHub, Ticketmaster and Tickets.com. Of course, Apple's retail stores and the Apple Store app will also take Apple Pay.","MCX mobile payment service backed by Wal-Mart, Best Buy and other leading retailers .

"Ed Miliband, who has been openly attacked by Labour MPs rattled by a fall in the party's ratings . Ed Miliband has been openly attacked by Labour MPs rattled by a fall in the party’s ratings following David Cameron’s Tory conference speech. John Mann said a poll conducted last week, which showed the Tories in the lead for the first time in nearly three years, should be a ‘wake-up call’ and accused his leader of ‘complacency’. The poll was taken immediately after Mr Cameron’s pledge to cut taxes, and put the Tories on 35 per cent and Labour one point behind. In his outspoken remarks, Mr Mann said he hoped the results would galvanise Mr Miliband into improving his performance. ‘This highlights the extraordinary level of complacency that permeates the top of the party,’ said the Bassetlaw MP. ‘It should serve as a massive wake-up call. Ed should get out and mix with real voters to discover what they really care about, and then come up with policies on immigration and the economy which genuinely resonate with the electorate.’ Mr Mann claimed that many backbenchers were infuriated by the so-called ‘35 per cent strategy’ – targeting core Labour supporters in order to get to that position in the polls and then rely on the party’s inbuilt advantage in the electoral system to deliver a small majority. ‘They seem to think we need just one more small push and we will limp over the line to victory,’ he added. Another Labour MP said: ‘If I were to put into words publicly what I think about Ed Miliband right now I would be kicked out of the party’. Labour MPs left their party conference feeling gloomy about their Election prospects after a lacklustre speech by Mr Miliband, in which he forgot to mention either the deficit or immigration. By contrast, Tory MPs were buoyed by Mr Cameron’s confident performance and promise to deliver £7 billion in tax cuts. Although Labour has been narrowly ahead in most polls until last week, Mr Miliband’s personal ratings on leadership and the economy are at rock bottom. Yesterday, a former adviser to Tony Blair and Gordon Brown added his voice to the criticisms. The poll was taken immediately after Mr Cameron’s pledge to cut taxes, and put the Tories on 35 per cent and Labour one point behind . Patrick Diamond warned that simply appealing to Labour’s traditional voters and disillusioned Lib Dems could prevent the party from winning key marginal seats. ‘It is the Conservatives who look confident despite the pressure exerted by Ukip, while it is Labour that appears politically on the back foot,’ he said. ‘David Cameron has been forced to the Right, but he still appears determined to make a wide national appeal.’ Mr Diamond added: ‘Key figures in the Labour Party fear that the party is reaching the limits of the 35 per cent strategy, having inexplicably abandoned a One Nation agenda. ‘They worry that the 35 per cent strategy is damaging Labour in the English marginals.’","Labour MPs have rounded on their leader after Tories took lead in polls .

"Morning commuters were stunned to see a hot air balloon, which had been enjoying a scenic flight over Melbourne, descend in the middle of a car park on Monday. 'Light and variable winds' forced the pilot and his nine passengers to land outside Footscray Town Hall on Monday at around 7am, not far from a busy railway line. According to Mike, a caller on 3AW Radio who witnessed the landing, there was 'a mild scene of panic as crew and people who were on the balloon madly tried to pack up the balloon'. Onlookers were stunned when a red hot-air balloon landed in the empty car park at Footscray Town Hall on Hyde St in Melbourne's west on Monday morning at around 7am . According to Mike, a caller on 3AW Radio who witnessed the landing, 'a mild scene of panic as crew and people who were on the balloon madly tried to pack up the balloon' But Damian Crock, director of Picture This Ballooning, told Daily Mail Australia that the landing was 'routine' and safety was the pilot's priority. 'The winds became light and there was not much reliable steerage. Rather than using up lots of fuel, the pilot found a safe and available landing spot', he said. Mr Crock said the hour-long flight was close to its end when it landed in the car park. The balloon displaying the Fujitsu logo allegedly landed 25-metres away from a railway line connecting Footscray and Seddon train stations. A driver snapped this image moments before the Fujitsu balloon landed in the Footscray car park . Thankfully, no one was injured during the impromptu landing. 'Everyone had a ball and they all went back to breakfast at level 35 at the Sofitel Hotel. They all had a marvellous time', Mr Crock said. Action shots taken from onlookers show the red balloon making its way down from the sky to the empty car park, as the balloon slowly deflated to the ground.

Mr Crock said Melbourne was the first city in the world to begin flying commercial hot air balloons and now balloons fly nearly 150 days a year. Earlier this year, another Fujitsu balloon was forced to make an emergency landing in a home's front yard in Hawthorn, Melbourne. The pilot was forced to land after winds took control of the balloon, 3AW reported. The Fujitsu balloon was flying for nearly an hour before it made a 'routine landing'.

"A woman whose nude photos were posted online by a bitter ex-boyfriend has spoken out about her struggle to remove the shots from the internet which cost her thousands of dollars. Anisa Salmi, 27, found the images of her after a friend told her to type her name in Google.

Angry: Anisa Salmi, 27, was told she is to blame for the photos emerging as she consented to them . But despite going to the police in Richmond, Canada, Salmi was told she was to blame because she shared the photos with her former partner willingly. She has now paid $2,000 to remove the shots from the internet but lawyers warn she will struggle to make a legal case against her ex under the current laws. If she decided to sue on the grounds of defamation, cyberbullying, breach of privacy and a violation of copyright, the civil case could cost Salmi $30,000. 'I felt helpless,' the occupational therapist told The Vancouver Province. 'If anybody — an employer or client — were to Google my name and were to find these photos and the posts and the comments that were made about me, I felt it would jeopardize my integrity.' Salmi's ordeal came at the same time celebrities' nude photos were leaked on the blogging site 4Chan. Trauma: The occupational therapist has spent $2,000 taking the images offline to preserve her reputation . Legal holes: Criminal lawyer Deanne Gaffar said victims of image leaks are not properly protected by law . The America-based celebrities face the same legal struggles as Salmi: the offense is not a criminal one. More than a dozen of the hacked stars are now suing Google for breach of copyright. Criminal lawyer Deanne Gaffar, based in Vancouver, said: 'The problem that exists right now is there is a gap in the jurisdiction. 'In this day and age, with Internet and digital images which can be shared in a millisecond, you lose control over those things if you're placing the trust in someone else.' Canada's House of Commons will soon debate a voyeurism bill which could give victims of hacking and leaked photos rights. If Bill C-13 passed, it will criminalize the publication of intimate images without the consent of the subject of those images.","Anisa Salmi, 27, found intimate images she had sent to a boyfriend online .

"TV sitcoms like 'The Office' in which characters make jokes at someone else's expense are no laughing matter for older adults, according to new research. A new study has found that while young and middle-aged people think that ‘aggressive humour’ is funny, senior citizens aren’t amused. Instead, the older generation prefer ‘affiliative humour,’ in which a number of characters share and deal with an awkward situation. Scroll down for video . A new study has found that while young and middle-aged people think that ‘aggressive humour’ is funny, senior citizens aren’t amused . The study was undertaken by University of Akron researchers who showed young, middle-aged and older adults different clips from The Office, Golden Girls, Mr Bean and Curb Your Enthusiasm. The Ohio-based team, led by Jennifer Tehan Stanley, studied the reaction of participants as they watched 14 video clips. They noted how often each volunteer smiled and laughed. They also had electrodes attached to their faces to detect muscle movements made by smiling. Scientists are trying to harness the unintentional humour of autocorrect mistakes by teaching computers to be funny. The researchers in Finland and France took thousands of real text messages and tried to change them slightly like an autocorrect would - before asking people online to rate the humour. University of Helsinki professor Hannu Toivonen and his colleagues found taboo words increase the chance of texts becoming funny - as well as those where they are normal until the very end. Professor Toivonen said he decided to carry out the study following an autocorrect error that had seen him sign off an email with the phrase ‘best retards’, rather than ‘best regards’. He told The Times: ‘It is about understanding what mechanisms lie behind humour. Texts are a particularly good mechanism for that. There is a research field called 'computational creativity'. ‘It is about how to make computers more creative. Telling jokes is one sort of creativity. Some of the applications for this line of work could be in computer dialogue systems, to make them more humanlike.’ The paper also found ‘Meet at the bum stop’ is a funny autocorrected text, although ‘Just off from berk ... sorry I mean work’ is not so humorous. The study involved 30 participants 17-21 years old, 22 who were 35-56 years old and 29 who were 64-84 years old. The 64-to-84-year-olds found clips from The Office around 23 per cent less funny than the middle-aged people did, and about 19 per cent less funny than the 17-to-21-year-olds did. Young adults were also more likely to laugh at the self-deprecating humor, found in clips of episodes such as Curb Your Enthusiasm. Professor Stanley said she finds both types of humour funny, but that the study has made her rethink the jokes she makes in her lectures. ‘The study raises some intriguing questions about our concept of what is funny,’ she said. ‘Is that concept based on factors peculiar to generations, or does it evolve over time as we age and, perhaps, mellow? ‘Those possibilities will need to be explored in a future episode of humour research.’","The study studied reactions of young, middle-aged and older adults .

"Two vandals have been caught on camera spraying anti-Muslim graffiti - on the walls of a Sikh temple. The CCTV footage shows a girl, dressed in black clothing and with a hood covering her face, climbing on to the shoulders of another girl so she can reach a camera and spray it with paint at 1.30am on Wednesday at the Sikh Gurdwara temple in Beechboro, Perth.

'All Sikhs, wherever in the world they have settled, they are very faithful to the country where they settle. 'It hurts me, and I believe it's insulting to the Australian community and the people.' Following the anti-terrorism raids, Sikhs have reported a rise in abuse in Australia from people mistaking them for hardline Muslims. Community leaders from around the country have reported rising tensions - and now Sikhs, who wear turbans and long beards, say they have been targeted. Early last month, the nation experienced its' largest counter-terror raids in Australia's history, as police detained 16 people across Sydney and Brisbane.

"Baby Gammy's Australian parents have allegedly paid nothing towards supporting their unwanted child they left abandoned in Thailand nine months ago. American agent Antonia Frattaroli, who handled the surrogacy, claims David and Wendy Farnell 'havent paid a cent' since instructing the agent to abandon Gammy outside a temple or ophanage when they were told it couldn't be aborted. Mr Frattaroli said the Farnells agreed to a $2000 lump some and a monthly allowance to help with the biological mother's costs of caring for her Down syndrome baby. Wendy Farnell has taken her healthy daughter Pipah to China while the WA Government investigates the parents for caring for her . An employee of Surrogacy Thailand says David Farnell (right) wanted to abandon Gammy 'outside a temple' The Australian parents also told their surrogacy agent to give their child up to an orphanage in Thailand . 'He never sent her money once he got back to Australia,' Mr Frattaroli said. The allegations against the Farnells come as Mr Frattaroli claims he was made to do the Farnell's 'dirty work,' such as separating the baby and mother from the Australian parents so they 'didnt have to see them.' 'They asked me if I could put the Down Syndrome baby in a different room so they wouldn’t have to look at them,' Mr Fratolli told 9NEWS. He also alleges that the couple wanted the baby terminanted at five months - but when told 'you can't kill a baby at five months' instructed it to be abandoned outside a Thai temple or orphanage. The explosive claims come nine months after the Farnells left Thailand with Gammy's healthy twin sister Pipah, leaving him behind. In an email reportedly sent by Mr Farnell a month before the birth he wrote they had chosen 'to go with option 2'. Mr Frattaroli said it was also agreed that the Farnells would  pay Ms Chanbua about $2000 a month as child costs, but as yet, have not paid a cent. 'He never sent her money once he got back to Australia,' Mr Frattaroli said. Bioligical mother Pattaramon Chanbua has been given the responsibilityof caring for the nine month old since he was abandoned by Australian his parents . He said he regrets having ever allowed the surrogacy to take place after admitting he did not screen the Farnells, which had he done would have revealed David's criminal past. 'I did not screen them, that’s my biggest mistake and I’ll admit that to the whole world,' he said. Mr Frattaroli got into the surrogacy business after he and his wife used a surrogate themselves for their baby boys, but his agency Surrogacy Thailand is no longer in operation following this scandal. He says he wanted to help others and never imagined encountering a situation like this. The new light surrounding the surrogacy saga comes following revelations that baby Gammy was offered to another couple,  Kim and Brendan Cross, who themselves had been struggling to conceive a child for years and had turned to Thai surrogacy officials for help. The Cross's were clients of Thailand Surrogacy for two years when they received an email from the company asking if they wanted Gammy, according to the ABC's 7.30 program. 'The email asked us if we wanted the baby ourselves. My assumption of why I was asked or why we were asked is because of the fact that we had been through this clinic for two years and without a successful pregnancy and maybe they thought this was an easy option for us to take this child instead of continuing on our path to have our own biological child. 'That’s just my opinion' she said, 'but of course we can’t accept someone else's child. The Cross couple are now proud parents of four week old Braxton, born via a Thai surrogate and egg donor. Kim Cross says she was 'mortified' by the way the Farnell family had treated  the baby . The Cross couple said the offer was one of several proposals from American Antonio Frattaroli, the boss of Surrogacy Thailand, who has gone to ground since the story went global. The ABC reported that Mr Frattaroli denies any knowledge of Gammy being offered to another Australian couple and he is shocked by the suggestion. The ABC also spoke with a colleague of Mr Frattaroli, who said that the baby's biological father Mr Farnell had asked for the baby to be bleft outside a Thai temple. 'He did not want the baby. He just wanted to do anything so that he would not have that baby,' she said. Mr Farnell has previously denied that he wanted the child aborted. The surrogacy worker alleges he asked: 'There is a normal one, can I take the normal one? 'Can you leave the abnormal one at the temple? Can you leave him in Bangkok? Nobody will know about this' She says the company denied his proposal, and reportedly showed an email to ABC which showed Mr Frattaroli said: . 'They beg me to drop baby Gammy at the temple at night and run away. They told me, 'don't worry, Antonio, the monk will take care of the baby.' Antonio Frattaroli, who owns Surrogacy Thailand, (centre) denies his company offerred Gammy to the Cross couple . Kim and Brendan Cross say they were offered Gammy by Surrogacy Thailand, but the owner of the company Antonio Frattaroli denies the claim .","Surrogate agent claims  parents of Gammy have paid nothing to support the biological mother, Pattaramon Chanbua .

"When Eric Barrett was born his mother was devastated as she was told he might not survive, and would be imprisoned in his own body - unable to walk or talk. He was put in intensive care for a couple of months before eventually being diagnosed with cerebral palsy, a physical disability that affects movement and posture. But on Monday the 16-year-old surprised everyone when he climbed 1,437 steps to the summit of Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge. Thanks to sheer determination and years spent learning to walk from scratch, Eric stood 134m above sea level with 30 of his closest friends and family, with his achievement screened live on national TV by Channel 10. 'It felt surreal and amazing to reach the top,’ Eric told Daily Mail Australia after walking for the longest time in his life so far. Scroll down for video . Eric Barrett (front left) climbed the Sydney Harbour Bridge with Studio 10 reporter David Robinson (back right) on Monday after his mum Karen (front right) was told when he was born he would never be able to walk . His mother Karen was by his side for every one of the remarkable steps over the two and a half hours. 'It was absolutely exhilarating, it was just a bit surreal that we got there to be honest,’ she added. ‘I didn’t think he would ever walk. I had no thought about it all because I didn’t want to disappoint him at all or myself. ‘He’s exhausted now and he’s not saying much. You know Eric is tired when he stops talking,’ she laughed, as they drove back to their home inTerrigal, a suburb on the Central Coast region of New South Wales. Doctors told Karen that her son would be imprisoned in his own body after he was born . Eric was diagnosed with cerebral palsy - a physical disability that affects movement and posture . Karen came up with the idea for Eric to climb the Harbour Bridge around six months ago, four years after he took his first step, because she wanted do 'something that was a bit of challenge for him and also give back to the community’.  Network Ten's morning show Studio 10 helped make his dream a reality. Karen doesn't get treatment for Eric from the doctors who once told her that her son would never walk, instead opting  to use alternative treatments and therapist Luke Waters - who started working with him many years ago. She says doctors are amazed when Eric returns for his yearly X-rays and shows them just how far he has come. Eric trained with Luke for six days a week, in the gym and walking up stairs, to climb the bridge. ‘He put in a lot of hard work,’ Karen said. Karen said her son always had a sparkle in his eye even as a baby . While growing up, Eric had to learn how to crawl properly before he could even contemplate learning to walk . However, the teen has essentially been training his whole life - since he had to learn how to crawl properly again and eventually take his first steps just four years ago. ‘We went left off field and right back to the basics, retraining the brain pathways and repeating movements over and over again. He used to bunny hop when he crawled around and we had to teach him to crawl properly,’ Karen explained. ‘With every bit he got he had to learn the next step… He built on everything he did every step of the way,’ she added. Eric climbed the bridge with 30 of his friends and family. Here he is shown with his younger sister Presley and a younger brother Tommie . The 16-year-old has a passion for sports, especially basketball, and wanted to raise money for young athletes . Eric's mum (second left) says 'he put in a lot of hard work' to learn to walk . Eric spent 12 years of his life in a wheelchair and now that wheelchair is stowed away in the garage gathering dust. Surgery and therapy helped him along the way but Karen points out 'there is no magic pill'. She attributes his unbelievable achievement to his determination and strong character. ‘He never complains about training sessions, he looks forward to them and wants to do it. If he had a personality that whinged he wouldn't be up on his feet – he’s the one that’s done it.' Eric was joined on the Harbour Bridge by Studio 10 reporter David 'Robbo' Robinson. He told Robbo 'the views are amazing' and therapist Luke said 'the smile on his face says enough'. All funds raised by the walk will go to the Donnica Clarke Foundation, which offers financial and moral support to young athletes, across all sports from the Central Coast region of New South Wales.

One angry passenger on flight VA2 posted his disgust on Twitter . Flight VA2 was scheduled to depart LA at 7.55pm, local time, on Monday and landed safely back at the same airport at 4.09am on Tuesday. The aircraft had been inspected by engineers who tested the water from the sink and found no human waste traces.  It was then cleared to return to service. All passengers were accommodated overnight in LA, and Virgin Australia said it worked to get them to their destination as soon as possible. The flight landed in Sydney at 6.47am on Wednesday morning. News.com.au reported the blockage was caused by a toothpaste cap. A passenger on the VA2 Virgin flight took to social media to vent his disgust at what had happened on the flight. 'Virgin Airlines toilet explodes on its way from LAX TO MELBOURNE plane turned back and I was on the flight,' he said on his Twitter account. 'Vomit on VA2 Virgin Australia.

"The extraordinary number of foreign criminals hiding in Britain was dramatically revealed yesterday after police arrested more than 700 suspects travelling on our roads in just 48 hours. As a row raged over a report which showed the £1billion-a-year failure of successive governments to guard Britain’s borders, police launched the biggest-ever blitz on overseas offenders, rounding up 1,687 suspects in two days. Using number plate recognition technology to spot foreign-registered vehicles potentially associated with criminal activity, police stopped 2,304 cars, arresting 729 immigrants. They include gangsters and thugs wanted in their own countries for crimes such as human trafficking, robbery, fraud, drug smuggling, assault and domestic abuse. Scroll down for video . Police officers bash down a door as they conduct a raid on a property in Coventry yesterday . Raids across Britain in the past two days have netted more than 700 foreign criminals . One 28-year-old Czech fugitive wanted on a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) for 23 offences, including robbery, was spotted in Birmingham city centre. The automatic number plate recognition cameras also identified a 51-year-old Polish man in Smethwick, West Midlands, who is suspected of a £11,500 fraud. The week-long crackdown – involving 43 forces in England and Wales – has seen raids carried out targeting foreign criminals across the UK. Police also handed out 958 fines and cautions to overseas motorists for driving without a licence, insurance or tax and using rebated fuel, known as red diesel. West Midlands Police, which is co-ordinating Operation Trivium, gathered intelligence from 14 countries on their most wanted offenders in Britain. A list of 3,500 number plates associated with crime was distributed to traffic officers, who were instructed to pull over any matching vehicles. Meanwhile, 30 police officers from 14 European countries ran checks on the drivers on their own databases at a Birmingham control centre. A 24-year-old Polish man was arrested in Worcester just hours after an EAW was authorised for crimes including domestic abuse, assault and theft in his homeland. Suspected robbers, fraudsters and drug traffickers were all caught in the police raids . Police found another wanted man from Slovakia living in Handsworth, where he was running a human trafficking ring. In some cases, the offenders could be deported within ten days if they do not oppose extradition on an EAW. Others arrested for crimes committed in the UK could face trial in Britain, where a judge will decide whether they should be deported at the end of their sentence. Officers said the ‘show of strength’ had yielded an unprecedented number of arrests by turning Birmingham into ‘the headquarters for a European Union police force’. The crackdown came as ministers refused to name dozens of high-risk foreign criminals on the run for more than five years. A damning National Audit Office report has revealed that foreign offenders are able to walk into the country unchecked, commit new offences, then cheat removal on human rights grounds once their jail terms are complete. It claimed that 58 ‘high harm’ offenders – a category including rapists, killers and drug dealers – absconded after being released from prison. One in six of the 4,200 foreign criminals freed from jail have fled, and police routinely fail to check if arrested foreign nationals have a criminal record at home. The report prompted Paul Houston, whose daughter Amy was run over and killed by an illegal immigrant in 2003, to accuse politicians of having ‘blood on their hands’. But yesterday David Cameron stressed that 22,000 foreign national offenders had been removed from Britain since he entered Downing Street, adding: ‘We’re making progress, the buck does stop with me but I wouldn’t mind a bit of cross-party support for the actions we need to take.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘These people are the subject of ongoing investigation and we are determined to hunt them down and remove them.’","More than 700 foreign criminals have been arrested across UK in 48 hours .

"Millions of people were cramming themselves aboard trains on Bangladesh's huge rail network yesterday, desperate to make it home in time for the Eid holiday. With most boats and trains full to overflowing, there were serious safety fears. These were realised in at least one spot where a man was killed after falling under a train. Horrified onlookers, including several children, crowded around the victim's remains, which were scattered in at least two places along the tracks near Airport Railway Station in Dhaka, the capital. Scroll down for video . Commuter horror: Onlookers, including several children, stand around a dead man lying on the tracks completely cut in half near the Airport Railway Station in Dhaka after he was run over by a speeding train . Chaos: With millions of passengers cramming on to Bangladesh's rail network, including many simply perching on top of the carriages as they speed from stop to stop, it's easy to see how the accident might have happened . Holiday time: Most of these passengers at Airport Railway Station are hoping to get home in time to be with their families for the feast of Eid al-Adha, commemorating Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to God . But the tragedy did not seem to scare anyone off their perilous journeys, with most passengers perched atop speeding railway carriages taking them from work in the cities to rural hometowns. With nearly Muslims comprising 90 per cent of Bangladesh's 160million people and a population density higher than the tiny island of Jersey, the scale of the exodus is beyond biblical. Eid al-Adha, Islam's 'Festival of the sacrifice', commemorates's Abraham's willingness to kill his own son in submission to God's command. It begins tonight and lasts for four days. This year the preparations for the holiday have been thrown into controversy after officials warned millions of cows set for slaughter have been fattened up with banned steroids. Industry officials told the AFP news agency at least ten million cows and goats are expected to be slaughtered during the festival. But experts fear many have been fattened with cancer-causing steroids in a bid to cash in on the surging demand for meat. 'In our estimate some 20 per cent of the cattle to be sold during Eid are being fattened with banned steroids such as dexamethasone,' said Muzaffar Hossain, a professor of animal science at the Bangladesh Agriculture University. Cows fattened with such steroids can help farmers earn an extra $400-$1,000 per animal but can cause serious health problems for consumers, he said. 'As a result, the use of steroids and other harmful drugs has become rampant all over the country,' he told AFP. Everyone's on the move: With nearly Muslims comprising 90 per cent of Bangladesh's 160million people and a population density higher than the tiny island of Jersey, the scale of the exodus is beyond biblical . Anywhere there's space: Men and youths clamber aboard this train, or hang on to the doorts . Helping hands: People help a man to escape the sweltering carriage and climb up to the fresh air on the roof . Ali Noor, joint secretary at the livestock ministry, said only a small number of farmers were using the steroids, with the vast majority using a government-prescribed natural cow fattening formula. But he said authorities have deployed 20 medical teams in Dhaka's cattle markets to try to detect sick animals and more teams were being sent to major markets across the country. 'We are also asking the authorities to deploy magistrates to act against the use of steroids to fatten cows. These magistrates will set up mobile courts to hand out sentences against the perpetrators,' he told AFP. On Monday the mass-circulation Daily Star ran an investigative report that said almost every farm in the country's northwest, the main cattle region, was using the banned steroids. 'If someone consumes the meat of the cattle fattened with such steroids, it may cause cancer and kidney failure,' Abdus Samad, a professor of Bangladesh Agriculture University, told the paper. Acting on a petition, the High Court on Monday asked the government to investigate the racket and prepare guidelines for its control. They're off: The lush vegetation of the fertile Bengal Delta whips past these passengers on the train roof . Not quite a refreshments trolley: But it's still possible to get a snack on the roof of the Eid express . Eid al-Adha is the second of Islam's two Eid holidays, after Eid al-Fitr, and marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Like Eid al-Fitr, the holiday involves special religious observances, charitable donations, social and family get-togethers, gift giving and traditional South Asian feasting. But, reflecting its scriptural basis, there is also the added element of sacrifice, with many families offering up a sheep, goat or even a cow - with one third of the meat given to the poor and the needy.","Eid al-Adha is Islam's 'Festival of the sacrifice'

"David Cameron's ‘right-hand man’ in Brussels has provoked fury by insisting Britain will definitely remain in the EU after the promised referendum in 2017. Lord Hill suggested that the result of the vote was a foregone conclusion. Ukip claimed the Tory peer had ‘let the cat out of the bag’, saying the comments proved that the Prime Minister’s real plan was to keep us in the EU no matter what. Lord Hill told MEPs that the EU will remain a family of 28 member states in 2019 - including the United Kingdom . Downing Street insists that the only way to get a plebiscite on EU membership is to vote Conservative at the next election. Lord Hill made his prediction as he was grilled for a second time by MEPs, who had to ratify his appointment as EU commissioner for financial services. He set out his vision for Europe in 2019 to show how he would work to beef up the EU. He said: ‘Big picture for 2019: the European Union is stronger and more cohesive – and more responsive to the economic and political concerns of its citizens. And our Union, by the way, remains a family of 28 member states – including the United Kingdom.’ Mr Cameron has pledged tough negotiations to claw back powers from Brussels, such as controls on movement across the continent. An in-out referendum would then be held by the end of 2017. But Ukip’s Douglas Carswell said Lord Hill’s confident prediction that Britain will remain in the EU showed that the vote was a sham. Mr Carswell, who defected from the Tories to Ukip and is standing in tomorrow’s Clacton by-election, said: ‘This confirms what I said when I resigned: that the inner clique have an underhand plan to keep us in the EU. ‘They are promising us a referendum and they are talking the language of change – but in reality they are doing everything they can to keep us in. His lordship has let the cat out of the bag. ‘One of the reasons I left the Conservative Party was when I realised it was all smoke and mirrors. I couldn’t be part of it any longer.’ Eurosceptic Conservatives were also angered by the comments. Ukip's Douglas Carswell, pictured, said the proposed referendum by David Cameron was 'a sham' Conservative MP Peter Bone, pictured, said the future of Britain in Europe will be down to the electorate . Peter Bone, MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Whilst Lord Hill is entitled to his opinion, frankly under David Cameron’s referendum it will not be Lord Hill who decides – it’ll be the British people. ‘I’ll have a 10p bet with Lord Hill that come 2017 we’ll be out of Europe and the country will be heading for a better future. ‘It seems as though Lord Hill will make an excellent EU commissioner because he is already talking the language of the EU elite, because he thinks his views matter more than the British people.’ After a first hearing last week, Lord Hill was summoned back to the European Parliament because MEPs wanted further assurances that he would not solely fight Britain and the City’s corner after taking up his commission post on November 1. Under pressure from MEPs, he has distanced himself from ‘double majority’ voting in the EU’s banking authority, a key concession won by Britain last year. It means that for important banking regulation to pass, a ‘double majority’ of eurozone and non-eurozone countries must support it, protecting the City from discrimination by Frankfurt or Paris. The measure was introduced after a protracted battle by Chancellor George Osborne to prevent the eurozone acting as a voting bloc on financial regulation following last year’s ‘banking union’ for members of the single currency. The Conservative peer wrote to MEPs: ‘If confirmed, I will be a European commissioner, serving the general interest, not any one member state’s interest.’ But Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP, said: ‘He is too close to Cameron and can’t do this job. There needs to be a reshuffle to move him elsewhere.’","Lord Hill said the UK will still be in the EU after a proposed in-out referedum .

"A few immature callers have gone and ruined a decades-long free figure drawing class. The University of Oregon has ended a weekly class for community artists to sketch nude models, saying it could not afford the increasing cost of keeping the popular classes secure. During the past two and a half weeks, the art school saw a marked increase in phone calls and emails inquiring about the sessions, Rocco Luiere, the school's associate dean for finance said. Some of the callers were asking 'off-color' questions, some dealing with the appearance of the models, he said. Cover up, class is cancelled: A figure drawing class has been cancelled at the University of Oregon, after the school started receiving 'off-color' calls about the models. Above, a figure sketch drawn by Farley Craig, one of the community members who attended the class . 'That's not somebody who's looking to come in for art,' Luiere said. 'As we start to get calls on that, we have to take a step back and say we're running this program, we have an ethical responsibility to make sure we're doing this in a safe environment. And we did not feel we could provide that at this point.' The calls started after someone posted fliers seeking models, he said. However, artists who participated in the class say they never saw any inappropriate behavior. 'There were oddballs. But of the harmless type. Artists,' local Farley Craig told MailOnline. 'One model ( a student there) even relayed how she had never experienced a bad time at the session, but she had had bad experiences posing for the University's classes,' Mr Craig added. Classes with nude models are part of the curriculum in the School of Architecture and Allied Arts. But those classes aren't open to the general public. On Saturdays, 30 to 35 people from a group known as the Saturday Figure Drawing Group regularly show up to draw a nude model, said artist Will Mitchell, the group's volunteer coordinator. The group has been meeting since the mid-1990s, participants told the Eugene Register-Guard in a story Wednesday. 'Figure drawing is a very mild activity,' Mitchell said. 'Kind of slow and quiet.' The university gave the Register-Guard a letter sent to the Saturday participants from Brook Muller, acting dean of the school. Long-standing: The Saturday figure drawing class offered for free to community members has been held at the University of Oregon since the mid-1990s . 'As these sessions have increased in prominence, they have had the unfortunate consequence of drawing unwanted attention to the fact that nude models can be found on the UO campus in an unstructured and unmonitored environment,' Muller wrote. She said a limited budget has prevented the university from putting more resources into security that would allow the sessions to continue. However, Muller said drawing nudes has value and purpose in the creation of art and the development of artistic ability, and she pointed out nonprofit art centers where community members could do such work. The models get $15 an hour and earn five hours of pay for each three-hour session because it's on weekends, Mitchell said. Some models who work in the classrooms also work at the Saturday sessions. Lindsey Belleau, 27, told the Register-Guard that modeling at the Saturday sessions had helped her grow. 'I'd have to say that group helped me become a person who realizes how safe I am,' she said. 'It really inspires a person like me, who can't draw. It's a group of people who get together doing what they love. And they're so respectful of each other.'","The University of Oregon has cancelled a free figure drawing class open to the community after getting several 'off-color' calls .

"Country legend Johnny Cash and his enduring musical legacy are being celebrated in the city of Folsom following the grand opening of the first section of the $3.8 million Johnny Cash Trail and Overpass at the weekend. The release of Cash's 1968 album At Folsom Prison firmly established the singer as an international country music star and his song Folsom Prison Blues catapulted the California city to enduring notoriety. City officials unveiled the first section of the 2.5-mile trail on Saturday. The centerpiece is a pedestrian and bike bridge especially designed to look like the east gate guard towers at Folsom State Prison. Folsom city officials and Rosanne Cash, holding the scissors, unveiled the first section of the 2.5-mile Johnny Cash Trial and Overpass on Saturday . The centerpiece is a pedestrian and bike bridge especially designed to look like the east gate guard towers at Folsom State Prison . Johnny cash's legendary performance at Folsom State Prison in 1968 provided the live album which helped established the singer as an international country music star . 'People around the world know Folsom because of that very famous song,' Folsom Mayor Kerri Howell told The Sacramento Bee. The trail will traverse prison property and link to other area trails. Next the city is planning a $3 million fundraising drive to pay for a two-acre park next to the bridge. It will feature art installations along the trail including a 40-foot steel statue of Cash, a large replica of a guitar pick that will include a trail map and a Ring Of Fire display made up of swirling red guitar picks. Federal and state funds paid for the trail and bridge, but officials say donations will be a more appropriate source of money for the art celebrating the singer nicknamed the Man in Black because of his trademark black stage outfit. ‘There's some kind of beautiful connection between this and the prison, you know?’ Cash's daughter Rosanne said. ‘Just, to involve nature and healing and exercise.’ No stranger to prison: Country star Johnny Cash, center, is flanked by a bondsman and a US Marshall as he was transferred from El Paso County Jail to the Federal Courthouse in 1965 . Rosanne Cash, the musician's daughter, attended Saturday's ceremony and cut a ribbon to officially open the overpass. ‘There's some kind of beautiful connection between this and the prison, you know?’ she told ABC. ‘Just, to involve nature and healing and exercise.’ Even before his 1968 album, Cash had sung about the area in his 1955 song Folsom Prison Blues. It is a Cash classic and features one of his most famous lines: ‘But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.’ ‘I sat with my pen in my hand, trying to think up the worst reason a person could have for killing another person, and that's what came to mind,’ he said years later. The song was inspired by the movie Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison. Cash had first sung about the area in his 1955 song Folsom Prison Blues which features the famous line: 'But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die' I Walk The Line: The city is planning a $3 million fundraising drive to pay for a two-acre park next to the bridge and to build a 40-foot steel statue of Cash. A miniature model was on display on Saturday . Cash had intent was to play his first prison concert at San Quentin, but the warden was out when his manager called, so he ended up at Folsom first. The song was the first on the At Folsom Prison album, although the cheering from the audience following the 'But I shot a man in Reno' line was added in post-production. The atmosphere at the prison was tense during the concert because the inmates were ordered to stay in their seats throughout the concert, the result of a guard being kidnapped two weeks earlier. In August, Cash's childhood home in Dyess, Arkansas was opened to the public. Rosanne Cash said that the Arkansas State University-led scheme was launched to help boost the local economy in Dyess, which has struggled in recent years. 'We have lost many other such places of historic significance because of a lack of funds, [no interest] or ignorance,' she said. 'I am so happy ASU stepped in when they did. There were only around 35 cottages left and my dad's, though dilapidated, was one of those.' Other works of art commissioned for the proposed park include a large replica of a guitar pick that will include a trail map and a Ring Of Fire display made up of swirling red guitar picks .","The country music legend famously sung the Folsom Prison Blues, but now the city has opened a trail and overpass in his honor .

"A man in the U.S. has been arrested over claims he sexually assaulted and squeezed to death a 67-year-old mental health patient after a chance meeting with the woman in a local shop. Miguel Piedra, 49, was brought into custody on Wednesday at his home in Fort Worth, Texas, on a murder charge, police said. He was being held with bail set at $500,000 (£310,000 pounds). Officers said the remains of the woman, whose identity has not been released, were found last Sunday afternoon just outside a local park by a passerby, according to the Star-Telegram. Texas police officers said that it was unclear whether Miguel Piedra, 49 (pictured) had offered the woman a lift . Investigators believe Mr Piedra came across the woman early last Saturday morning at a local shop near where the 67-year-old resided in a mental health home. Sgt. Joe Loughman said CCTV cameras outside the store captured the woman getting into Mr Piedra's car, and she appeared to get into the vehicle voluntarily. Sgt Loughman said: 'It is unclear if he offered her a ride or if she asked him for a ride. He exited his vehicle and spoke to the victim without being spoken to by the victim.' Authorities are still trying to reach the woman's next of kin. Sgt Loughman declined to detail how officers linked Mr Piedra to the murder, only saying that he was arrested at his Fort Worth home. Court records show Mr Piedra was convicted in 2007 of driving while drunk and sentenced to 45 days in jail.","Miguel Piedra, 49, was taken into custody at his home in Fort Worth, Texas .

"Some people live to lift the burden of others. Dr Catherine Hamlin, who has been nominated this year for the Nobel Peace Prize, is a living testament to this idea. For over half a century, Dr Hamlin has made it her mission to cure the unfortunate women who suffer from obstetric fistula, a horrific condition resulting from obstructed labour. While obstetric fistula was eradicated in the western world in the 1920s, many developing countries still have hundreds of thousands of women who suffer from the injury. Dr Hamlin with a group of her patients: Hamlin has cured Ethiopian women suffering from obstetric fistula for over half a century . Hamlin and her patients: Head of the Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia in Australia Lucy Perry says Dr Hamlin is close with all of her patients and staff . In the 1950s, Hamlin travelled to Ethiopia from her stomping grounds of northern Sydney. It was there she established the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital and the Hamlin College of Midwives, then expanded the operations to five other hospitals. Since then, Dr Hamlin has treated over 40,000 women with obstetric injury. She has perfected the modern technique for obstetric fistula surgery and has a more than a 90 per cent success rate. Despite having reached the ripe old age of 90, Hamlin still works almost every day towards her goal of eradicating fistula injury. A significant part of Hamlin's operation is international charity work, which fuels the organisations she founded in Ethiopia. In 2012, Dr Hamlin appointed Lucy Perry as the Chief Executive Officer of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia in Australia. Perry told Daily Mail Australia that Dr Hamlin was humbled by her nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. 'Catherine was delighted. She was nominated by her friend Dr Tedros, the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia.' 'She's a very humble person, and never looks for accolades, but she's thrilled because the nomination has shined light on obstetric fistula injuries.' 'Her only qualm was that she wishes  all of the staff who have helped her make the mission possible could be nominated with her.' Perry's Australian branch of Dr Hamlin's charity raises money for the various operations. Despite there being multiple other countries who contribute, Perry says Australia is the driving force of donations. 'Australia provides 90 per cent of the funds to the company. This year, we're set on track to double our income to 6 million.' Old images of Catherine Hamlin, who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her contributions to women suffering from obstetric injury . The patient hostel at the Princess Tsehai Memorial Hospital in Addis Ababa circa 1965.. Dr Hamlin has treated over 40,000 women with the disease . Catherine Hamlin, ages 18. Ms Perry says the doctor is incredibly humble and 'never looks for accolades' Ms Perry explained that Dr Hamlin remains highly dedicated to her mission, despite her impressive age. 'Catherine was still performing surgery until very recently, which is incredible. She still works six days of the week, waking at six and going to bed at 11.' 'Catherine works on the wards, and also writes thousands of letters: she remains incredibly active.' Obstetric fistula injury can result in agonising labour that lasts for days. Babies rarely survive the birth and the mothers are left with horrific internal injuries, including chronic incontinence and irreversible damage. But perhaps the most difficult feature is the societal stigma. 50 per cent of woman suffering from the disease are divorced, and victims are often shunned by their own families. Many are even considered a curse. To combat this, Hamlin trains midwives to work in the villages of Ethiopia, teaching locals how to avoid the injury and finding victims to admit into her hospitals. An old image of the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital where Dr Hamlin has perfected the modern technique for obstetric fistula surgery and has a more than a 90 per cent success rate. Dr Hamlin said her only qualm was that she wish she could have the award granted to all of the staff who have helped her make the mission possible . When asked if she thought Dr Hamlin would take the award, Perry said 'Catherine's nomination was released early because it was posted on social media. 'There is on way of knowing if she will win, since the rest of the nominees have yet to be announced, but there's no question she deserves the award for longevity.' 'Winning would help to secure Catherine's legacy: to fund her organisation until the occurrence of fistula injury is eradicated. It would also be fantastic to put the condition on a global stage.'

"An al Qaeda splinter group said it launched a rocket toward the U.S. embassy in Sanaa on Saturday, wounding several guards, to retaliate for a purported U.S. drone strike in a northern province of Yemen the day before. The U.S. State Department said it had no indication that the embassy was the target of the attack and that none of its staff were wounded. The rocket landed 200 meters from the heavily fortified embassy, hitting members of the Yemeni special police force who guard the site. At least two were wounded, police said.

Dangerous times: A Shi'ite Houthi rebel mans a checkpoint in Sanaa September 27, 2014 where violence continues to plague the divided region . Targeted the U.S. embassy: Mohamed Zahawi, head of the Benghazi brigade of Ansar al-Sharia, a group who said they fired a rocket at the U.S embassy on September 27 . Militants say they fired in retaliation: Shi'ite Houthi rebels bury comrades, who were killed in recent fighting against government forces, in Sanaa September 26 . The attacker fired the rocket from a car using a M72 light anti-tank weapon before speeding away, a police source told Reuters. Several hours after the attack, Ansar al-Sharia, an affiliate of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), said on its Twitter account it had targeted the embassy with a rocket, injuring several guards and damaging a vehicle. The group said the attack was revenge for a drone strike on Friday that had seriously wounded children in the northern al Jawf province. Tribal sources confirmed that a drone strike killed two al Qaeda members and wounded two more in al Jawf on Friday, and that there were reports of some children having been wounded. The United States regularly uses drones to attack Islamist militants in countries such as Yemen as part of a strategy to combat al Qaeda militants without committing troops on the ground.

Washington acknowledges using drones in Yemen but does not comment publicly on the practice. Al Qaeda and its affiliates in Yemen are among the most active wings of the network founded by Osama bin Laden. Sanaa is already in turmoil after Shi'ite Muslim rebels seized control of much of the capital last week, hours before the accord was signed with other political parties providing for the creation of a new government. Earlier on Saturday, Houthi rebels attacked the home of Yemen's intelligence chief in Sanaa, in a sign of the fragility the power-sharing accord. The takeover of the capital has given the Houthis unprecedented political power in Yemen, a U.S.-allied country whose political, tribal and sectarian unrest poses risks to the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia next door. President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi has said Yemen may be heading for civil war. The attempted attack on the embassy comes a day after the United States told its citizens to leave Yemen and said it was reducing the number of U.S. government staff there due to political unrest and fears of a possible military escalation. The U.S. embassy has been the target of several attacks in recent years, including one in 2008 by al Qaeda affiliated militants in which 18 died. In 2012, demonstrators angry at U.S.-made film they considered blasphemous attempted to storm the compound and in May this year, the embassy said armed individuals had attempted to kidnap two of its officers at a small commercial business in Sanaa.

"Military police were required to intervene when almost 1,800 pensioners gridlocked traffic and besieged a doctors' surgery during a vaccination day. Traffic became gridlocked and tempers flared as the Creffield Medical Centre, in Colchester, Essex, held its annual vaccination day. Military police stepped in to control traffic as hordes of pensioners caused the nearby roads to become completely jammed. David Wilkin, 63, was dropping someone off for their appointment when he got caught up in the chaos for nearly an hour. Scroll down for video . David Wilkin said the area was 'bedlam' when hundreds of pensioners swarmed on the local medical centre during its annual vaccination day . The problems were caused by cars parking on both sides of the road, including on double yellow lines. Passing Royal Military Police officers spotted the chaos and stopped to direct traffic. Mr Wilkin said: 'It was absolute bedlam. 'People were just abandoning their vehicles to make their appointments. 'There were an awful lot of people getting very irritated.' He called for stricter traffic control in the area. Ann Read, practice manager at the medical centre, said she apologised to anyone who was inconvenienced by the congestion and will be reviewing its plans next year. She said: 'We try very hard to ensure we maximise the opportunity to get people vaccinated as early as we can before winter. 'We have found designating a specific day ensures we get maximum coverage for our patients, and invite patients to attend at 15 minutes intervals to try to maintain a steady flow. Military police helped control the crowds after 1,800 pensioners descended on Creffield Medical Centre (pictured) in Colchester, Essex . 'We also secured offsite parking for the staff and had two car park attendants working for most of the day. 'We did not observe the problems in the surrounding roads but anecdotal evidence suggested it was mainly in the hour before lunch, which coincided with when the heavy rain stopped.' The medical centre raised more than £2,000 for charity during its flu day. A spokesman for the North Essex Parking Partnership advised businesses or organisations who anticipate parking problems to let them know in advance so they can send traffic wardens.","Tempers flared during pensioners' vaccination day at Essex medical centre .

"Former Brazilian FIFA World Cup star Adriano has been charged over his alleged connection to drug trafficker in his native Rio de Janeiro. Prosecutors claim the 32-year-old former footballer bought a motorbike and gave it to a known drug dealer in the shantytown where he grew up. It is understood the former striker could face up to ten years in prison if convicted. Former Brazilian World Cup star Adriano, left, has been charged over his alleged connection with a drug trafficking gang in his native Rio de Janeiro, the striker, pictured right in Brazil's colours, last played for his country in 2010 . Prosecutors on Tuesday did not request Adriano's arrest but asked him to surrender his passport because the player has enough money to try to flee the country. Adriano and his lawyers could not be immediately contacted for comment. The 32-year-old forward reportedly has been negotiating with second-division French club Le Havre to return to football after several months without a club. He traveled to France recently to meet with club officials, and French media reported that a deal was close. Adriano played a few games with Brazilian club Atletico Paranaense earlier this year after being out of action for nearly two years because of injuries and off-field problems. The former striker has been in negotiation with French team Le Harve about resuming his professional career . He began his career with Flamengo and played for Inter Milan and AS Roma, among other clubs. He won four Serie A titles with Inter Milan early in his career, and with Brazil he won the 2004 Copa America and the 2005 Confederations Cup. He was in the starting lineup for Brazil at the 2006 World Cup, when the team was eliminated in the quarterfinals. Adriano was touted to make the team in 2010 in South Africa after leading Flamengo to the national title a year earlier, but was not included in the final squad.

Paz, known as Mica, was believed to have been part of the Red Command which controlled the favela where Adrianon had grown up. Police believe that the motorbike had been used to transport drugs through the area. When the allegations first surfaced, Adriano denied the claims.

'She loved putting her little tutu on and ballet shoes,' remembers her mother, fondly. 'She was always so excited every Saturday morning. Stars of the show: Dance teacher and former Brookside star Jennifer Ellison surrounded by her young charges . 'Chloe loves to dance,' she adds. 'She never stops -  she dances at home, in school... She doesn't walk down the street, she dances down it.' But while McConville has big ambitions for her daughter, she says the competitive world of dance mothers can sometimes be a bit too much. 'There is real competitiveness in the dance world,' she reveals. 'I do think competition is healthy and  it makes Chloe work harder to achieve her goals and get results but there are some mums out there that can take it to the extreme. Not, she hastens to add, that she ever has. 'I would say the most outrageous thing I have ever done to boost Chloe's chances is to be a part of Dance Mums,' she chuckles. 'I've never done anything like this before. Being on television frightens the life out of me and it wasn't for Chloe's determination, I don't think I could have done it.' Big plans: Serena McConville and daughter Chloe, eight, (left) and Danielle Simpson with daughter Aleah, nine . DANIELLE SIMPSON, 31 . Daughter: Aleah, nine . Ambition: For Aleah to be 'the next Jennifer Ellison' Fight potential: Nine - in part due to her friendship with the fiery Charlotte . Tall, blonde and pretty, Danielle Simpson looks every inch the glamorous yummy mummy. But this mother-of-five has more on her mind than making cupcakes. A former dance wannabe herself, Simpson admits that she lives vicariously through daughter Aleah, nine, and says her little star-in-the-making has the talent to make it to the top. 'I want to see Aleah be on stage and win trophies in the dance competitions,' she says. 'A career in the West End one day... that’s my biggest hope for my daughter.' Like McConville, she readily admits to finding the dance world a competitive place and also says that there's little she wouldn't do for her daughter - even if that means getting involved in an argument with Aleah's dance teacher, former Brookside actress, Jennifer Ellison. 'We do go against Jennifer’s rules at times,' she confesses, before adding: 'Actually, it’s not the other mums that go against Jen’s rules, it’s me. Fight! Danielle and best friend Charlotte Traynor aren't shy of putting their opinions to dance teacher Jennifer . Paying attention: The mums keep a close eye on proceedings as Jennifer gets a class underway . 'It’s never the mums, they’re very good, lovely mums – it’s me. I don’t always agree with what Jennifer Ellison has to say to the kids. 'Don’t get me wrong, she’s a brilliant teacher. I do love her too, she’s done everything for my daughter but there are times we don’t agree and there are times when we do agree. 'It’s definitely a love/hate relationship between us.' Unsurprisingly, the antics of Simpson and best friend Charlotte Traynor make for excellent TV, with Ellison, in one scene, left squawking indignantly at what she sees as the pair's lack of respect. 'The disrespect that that they have is just unbelievable,' she fumes. 'Sam [Charlotte's daughter] is hysterically crying, while Charlotte is screaming at me like a docker. Battling it out: Danielle with her best friend Charlotte Traynor, both of whom know how to ruffle feathers . 'To be honest, I don't care if I see her ever again!' Despite her best efforts to wind up Ellison, Simpson says everything she does is designed to give her daughter's career a boost. 'I want her to become one of the best dancers in the world and go on the West End or to TV,' she says. 'I’m hoping that people will recognise her and that she will become well known. I don’t want to be on this show and then see it just slip away and no one knows who Aleah Simpson is.' Star pupil: Maxine Kelly is mother to Jennifer Ellison's star pupil, Tayluer Amos . MAXINE KELLY, 44 . Daughter: Tayluer Amos,13 . Ambition: For Tayluer to be happy . Fight potential: Six -as the mother of the show's best dancer, Maxine attracts a lot of jealous comments . Of all the mothers to appear on Dance Mums, Maxine Kelly is the gentlest and least controversial. But when you're the mother of the star dancer, taking a more laissez faire approach to dancing is easy - as Kelly is all too well aware. 'My hopes for Tayleur is for her to lead a happy, healthy life and enjoy what she does best which is dancing,' she beams. 'Tayleur has done a lot of television work in the past: she’s been on Got To Dance, danced in front of the royal family, has been a special guest at the Royal Albert Hall and she’s star billed at the Empire.' Tayleur, it seems, is one child who doesn't need any extra help from her mother, although that hasn't stopped Kelly from pulling off the odd stunt in a bid to boost her career. 'She represented England in Portugal this year and I jumped out of a plane to raise money to get her out there,' says Kelly. 'I’d do anything for Tayleur. Tayleur’s talents are definitely what she needs to get to the top and not her mum being a lunatic. 'I would do anything to help her out, but I don't want to embarrass her so that's where I'd draw the line.' But while Kelly has no plans to embarrass her daughter, the other mothers are a different story and she admits to being worried about the hostile reception she and her talented daughter occasionally get. 'I get along with the other mums but them getting along with me... That's a different story. I wouldn’t connive against anybody,' she adds, 'and I would hate it if someone did it to me or Tayleur. She pauses and adds, 'I really hope no one will be nasty to Tayleur or myself.'","Maxine Kelly, Danielle Simpson and Serena McConville are 'dance mums'

"Alastair Cook could scarcely believe his eyes as Marais Erasmus bizarrely hitched up his trousers before raising his finger and sending the England captain on his way. He had gone so far towards the Test century that would mean more to him than any of his other 25, but ultimately he had fallen just five runs short. The South African umpire had quite rightly detected the thinnest of bottom edges through to MS Dhoni as Cook had shaped to pull the spin of Ravindra Jadeja and cut short the innings that had done so much to salvage his career. It did not stop the Ageas Bowl crowd giving Cook a rousing reception in keeping with the support he has received throughout his struggles, but it was a cruel moment for a captain who had battled so hard to keep his reign afloat. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alastair Cook give his reaction to finding batting form vs India . Agonsing: Cook was out for 95 on day one of the third Investec Test against India at the Ageas Bowl . On his way: The England captain trudges off after falling five runs short of a century . Contribution: The England captain's 95 helped his team into a strong position after day one . Hard work: India toiled away on an excellent day for England's batsmen at the Ageas Bowl . This was a performance made under . extreme pressure from Cook, crafted from the depths of having virtually . every former England captain who voices a public opinion calling for him . to quit after the quite shocking second Test defeat. If . Lord’s felt like rock bottom for the ‘new’ England and their captain . then the first day of the third Test was perhaps the start of the climb . back up, with Cook showing he is not going to give up on his leadership . without one hell of a fight. A . score of 247 for two, with Gary Ballance continuing the impressive . start to his Test career with another hundred, is not exactly a cause to . crack open the champagne but, for an England side in desperate need of a . boost, it is a start. At . the centre of it was Cook who, after a run of 27 innings without a . hundred and growing concerns about his captaincy ability, surely could . not have survived another failure here whatever the rest of this Test . has in store for his team. Cook . could have taken the easy way out after winning the toss on another . greenish pitch and bowled first, particularly with a four-man seam . attack freshened by the inclusion of Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes at . his disposal. Yet it was a . measure of his mettle that he faced up to his moment of destiny and . realised that if England could get through the first morning then there . should be runs to be had on what looks an excellent Ageas Bowl surface. He . would have known that England’s supporters are still with him as a roar . greeted his march to the crease with Sam Robson to face an India side . without their Lord’s tormentor Ishant Sharma, who pulled out with an . ankle injury. Yet those . calls for Cook’s head would reached a crescendo had he been caught by . Jadeja, as he should have been, on 15. Luck, for once, was on his side . and what followed was an innings similar to the century against Pakistan . four years ago at the Oval that saved him at a similarly low ebb. It . was not exactly a flawless display, with Cook driving Mohammed Shami . loosely through gully on 33 and then almost running himself out on 68, . but it was full of the cussed character that lurks within such a . mild-mannered exterior. Loud: The Indian fielders appeal after Cook edged a Ravindra Jadeja delivery behind . Colourful: Fans in fancy dress enjoy themselves on the first day of the third Test . Focus: Cook was given a couple of chances, but fought hard for his 95 runs . Alastair Cook overtook Kevin Pietersen and David Gower to become England’s third-highest Test run-scorer with his 95 on Sunday. Graham Gooch      8900Alec Stewart          8463Alastair Cook         8257David Gower          8231Kevin Pietersen     8181 . 8 - Alastair Cook and Sam Robson finally recorded their first half-century partnership, after eight innings opening together . 2,000 - Cook became the ninth player to score 2,000 Test runs as England captain. Mike Atherton has the most (3,815). When . he reached 22, Cook went past the Test run-tally of Kevin Pietersen, . whose sacking after the Ashes horror show continues to cast such a giant . shadow over England’s attempts to move on without him. Then, . when he had scored 70, Cook moved past David Gower to leave only Alec . Stewart and Graham Gooch ahead of him, a measure of the player he has . been for England and still, at 29, should be in the future. Maybe now he . will have regained the confidence to believe that he is back on course . to overtake Gooch and go on to become the first England batsman to score . 10,000 Test runs. That . elusive 26th Test century, one that has looked further and further away . as failure has followed failure, looked assured on Sunday until, . understandably, he displayed some nerves in the 90s and missed two . golden opportunities on his favourite cut shot to hurry towards three . figures. Heat: Phil Tufnell (left) loses his shirt as the BBC commentary team feel the heat on the balcony . Relief: Cook won the toss and decided to bat first on a greenish looking pitch in Southampton . VIDEO A great day for England - Cook . Rare: The match at the Ageas Bowl marked the first time in English cricket that a Test began on a Sunday . Centurion: Gary Ballance was unbeaten on 104 as he continued his strong international start . Moment: England's No 3 punches the air after scoring his third century in six Tests . Cook was denied a century when he edged a ball from Ravindra Jadeja — a fact confirmed by Snicko, though he was dropped on 15. Jadeja then ensured . it was not to be but if Cook can get back to leading by example, as he . did when England won in India, then perhaps everything else will fall . into place. He will certainly take to the field when India bat in much . more positive mind. A big . total to defend would help and Ballance, who is scoring prolifically for . England without yet tasting victory, has taken them a long way towards . the sort of score that would allow Cook and England to call the shots. Ballance . was tested to the full, with giant Indian debutant Pankaj Singh . impressing in Ishant’s place, in a nervy passage after Robson had again . played at a ball he could have left outside off-stump and fallen to . Shami. But clearly Ballance . has the right temperament for Test cricket and came through to reach the . century, his third in just six Tests along with two other half . centuries, that Cook would dearly have loved to record. Troubles: Sam Robson was caught by Ravindra Jadeja in the slips for 26 in the morning session . Ovation: England's under-pressure captain received a warm reception from the crowd . He . too could have fell early and was grateful for another excellent . umpiring decision, this time when Rod Tucker turned down appeals for a . caught behind with Ballance on 10, but grew in assurance during a stand . of 158 with Cook. The one . umpiring glitch came late on when Ian Bell was highly fortunate to . escape being lbw before he had scored, but he survived until the close . and has the chance to follow Cook’s example and fight his way out of . trouble on Monday. England’s . scoring rate means they are not yet in command but they have the . potential to be by close on day two and that position and his own . contribution would have made Cook sleep more soundly.","Alastair Cook caught behind for 95 on day one of third Test at Ageas Bowl .

She . responded by breaking an eight-year-old Commonwealth Games record to . reach the final and then obliterated her Australian opponent, Annette . Edmondson, to win England’s first able-bodied cycling gold medal of . these Games. Cometh the hour, cometh the woman. Rowsell, . 25, said she had been inspired watching her flatmates in the athletes’ village, Sophie Thornhill and pilot Helen Scott, win the para-sport . sprint tandem on Thursday night, as England  finished the opening day in . the velodrome with one gold, two silvers and a bronze for Jess Varnish in the 500m time trial.

But, . such has been the success of British cyclists over the past decade, we . are not used to settling for silver. Rowsell, the world . individual and team pursuit champion, duly provided a welcome reminder . of why the nation’s cyclists have been such a dominant force — and why . great rivals Australia may have to keep quiet for a while longer. Trott . and King had already missed out on the chance to ride for a medal after . they could only post the sixth and eighth fastest times respectively . in qualification, meaning the onus was on Rowsell to boost or bust . English hopes in the event. She responded gallantly, setting a Games . record of 3min 29.038sec, catching and overtaking her opponent Lauren . Ellis of New Zealand in the process, and then lapping up the applause of . the generous Scottish crowd. She . then produced another stunning ride in the final. Edmondson, whose . younger brother Alex also had to settle for silver in the 4,000m . individual pursuit, was nearly four seconds behind Rowsell as she staggered over the line.

"Alberto Contador faces surgery after suffering a fractured shin as he crashed out of the Tour de France on Monday as Vincenzo Nibali took full advantage with a scintillating victory at La Planche des Belles Filles which saw him reclaim the yellow jersey. Two-time winner Contador crashed on the 161.5-kilometre 10th stage from Mulhouse and, after struggling on for 20km in an effort to play catch-up, gave up and withdrew to his Tinkoff-Saxo team car. Contador sustained a fractured tibia (shin bone), Tinkoff-Saxo team manager Bjarne Riis revealed. VIDEO Scroll down to see Contador crashes out highlights .

'It's not a complicated fracture but it probably requires surgery,' Riis said in a Tinkoff-Saxo statement. 'He . will stay with us tonight (Monday) and tomorrow (Tuesday) he will travel back to Madrid to . undergo further examinations and a surgery if necessary. 'Alberto . was in the shape of his life and the entire team had our eyes fixed on . the podium in Paris and the work we would have to do to get there.' The . Spaniard's departure deprives the race of another previous winner after . 2013 champion Chris Froome (Team Sky) withdrew with fractures to his . left wrist and right hand on stage five last Wednesday. Andy . Schleck (Trek Factory Racing), who inherited the 2010 title from . Contador following an anti-doping infringement, quit the race with a . knee injury last Tuesday, although the Luxembourg rider is a shadow of . his former self. None of the . remaining riders have won the event, but Nibali took a significant step . in his bid to succeed Froome as champion in Paris on July 27. Nibali, . who relinquished the lead on stage nine to Frenchman Tony Gallopin . (Lotto-Belisol), surged to a second Tour stage win to take control of . the race. Nibali holds a . lead of 2:23 from second-placed Richie Porte (Team Sky), who was 25 . seconds behind in seventh on the day. Alejandro Valverde (Movistar) is . third, 2:47 behind. Nibali's advantage is so commanding that three-time champion Greg LeMond believes it is unlikely the Italian will be beaten. Thumbs up: Vincenzo Nibali has a unique celebration as he crosses the finish line . Back in yellow: Nibali has regained the lead after his stage 10 victory on Bastille Day . 'Personally I don't think there's much of a challenge any more,' he told British Eurosport. 'If he does have a bad day, I think it's the only time anyone has a chance. I think it's wishful thinking, but it could happen.' Nibali refuses to take his lead for granted, knowing he too could crash out and that Porte and Valverde are lurking. 'This is a wonderful victory,' Nibali said on letour.com. 'This was the hardest stage I've ever done in a Grand Tour, with seven climbs and so many crashes. 'I . feel sorry for Alberto Contador. He crashed just in front of me and . I've been scared that I'd go down as well but I don't know why he . crashed. 'I'll try to keep the yellow jersey but I won't be left without rivals. Richie Porte and Alejandro Valverde are up there. I'll have to handle my advantage.' The . race heads towards the Alps on its resumption on Wednesday with the . 187.5km 11th stage from Besancon to Oyonnax, but without another leading . protagonist following Mark Cavendish's crash on day one and the exits . of Froome and Schleck. Contador, the 2007 and 2009 winner, crashed on the descent of the Petit Ballon on a damp day in the Vosges Mountains. Called it a day: Froome abandoned the Tour during the fifth stage between Ypres to Arenburg Porte du Hinaut . Attention: Defending champion Froome gets help after his third crash in two days and abandons the Tour . He received strapping to his right knee, swapped bikes and lost four minutes as a result of the delay. Nibali's . Astana team led the main bunch and waited, but it soon became apparent . Contador would not be returning and the pursuit of the day's breakaway . resumed in earnest. Riis . said: 'Alberto crashed on a fast and straight part of the descent. He . was reaching for his pocket and the bike was swept away under him . probably because of a bump or hole in the road.' Contador's . withdrawal could see him refocus on the Vuelta a Espana, which begins . in Jerez on August 23. It could be Froome and Sir Bradley Wiggins also . ride the Tour of Spain. Froome wrote on Twitter: 'Big loss for the TDF today. Recover well @albertocontador & I hope to see you at the Vuelta.' Riis . added: 'It's too early to say anything about the possibility of Alberto . riding Vuelta a Espana. It depends on his recovery.' The finish at La Planche des Belles Filles was a reminder to Britons of the absent Froome and Wiggins. Froome . won at the summit of the 'climb of the beautiful girls' in 2012 as . Wiggins took the yellow jersey he held until Paris, when he became the . first British winner of the race. Nibali . finished third two years ago, won the 2013 Giro d'Italia and took a . major step towards Tour victory by attacking with 3km to go. He surged past Joaquim Rodriguez (Katusha), the last of the day's breakaway riders, as Porte tried to follow. Thibaut Pinot (FDJ) was 15 seconds behind in second and Valverde third. Porte told ITV4: 'Vincenzo goes you have to respond. He's got enough time already so you don't really want him to get any more.'

"A shocking video claims to show the cruel method used to catch tuna that unnecessarily kills hundreds and thousands of sharks, dolphins, turtles and other species every year. Australian consumers of tinned and fresh tuna have no way of knowing whether or not the tuna they eat is caught using this method, unless the tuna brand elects to state it on their label. And Greenpeace has warned that the popular 'dolphin friendly' tag used by many tuna brands is 'meaningless' because it is not regulated. Scroll down for video . A Greenpeace video claims to show the harmful 'FAD method' of fishing tuna and its effect on other species . Hundreds and thousands of sharks, dolphins, turtles and other species are killed every year when they are unintentionally caught in nets after being attracted by fish aggregating devices (FADs) In the video released by Greenpeace, fisheries from France, the UK and Italy are shown using fish aggregating devices (FADs) and  nets to catch tuna in the Indian Ocean. Marine animals including whale sharks, silky sharks, marlins, rays, oceanic whitetip sharks, olive ridley sea turtles, mako sharks and other mixed species of fish - some of which are threatened species - are seen caught up in the nets and cast aside by fisherman. At the end of the video the dead marine animals are dumped back into the ocean. Greenpeace oceans campaigner Nathaniel Pelle said the purse seine nets pictured in the video – which are nets that circle around schools of fish before being drawn up like a purse – were not necessarily harmful when used on their own but were problematic when used with FADs. 'The fish aggregating devices are designed to attract tuna but they also attract all sorts of other marine life,' Mr Pelle told Daily Mail Australia. 'When you use those two methods in combination you end up catching large amounts of incidental species you don't mean to catch.' A tuna fisherman on a boat in the Indian Ocean is pictured with a dead mariln . Australian fishing companies have not been linked to the video but Australian consumers may eat fish caught using this method without knowing because it does not need to be stated on the label of tuna cans . In the video released by Greenpeace, fisheries from France, the UK and Italy are shown using fish aggregating devices (FADs) and purse seine nets to catch tuna in the Indian Ocean . Australian consumers have no way of knowing where their canned tuna comes from because food labelling laws in Australia only require that canned tuna companies state where the fish is packed (usually Thailand) and not where it is caught. Greenpeace says 90 percent of tuna caught in the Indian Ocean is caught using FADs. Most tuna caught in the western Pacific Ocean is caught using the less harmful 'pole and line' method or using purse seine nets without FADs. Around 800,000 tonnes of tuna are caught in the Indian Ocean, where the video was taken, each year. Around 2.6 million tonnes are caught in the western Pacific Ocean. 'Most tuna in the Pacific is caught using purse seine nets, which is  a fairly clean way of fishing because giant schools of tuna tend to swim on their own,' Mr Pelle said. 'They don't tend to catch as many sharks, turtles or other species as you would using this device.' Mr Pelle said every major Australian canned tuna brand has committed to removing fish aggregation devices from their supply chains by the end of next year, but the organisation is still calling for clearer labelling laws. 'We've been asking for all seafood in Australia to be labelled where it's caught, not where it's put in a tin,' Mr Pelle said. 'So Australian consumers can make an informed choice about whether they want to buy tuna that results in killing hundreds of thousands of sharks, dolphins, whales and turtles.' Mr Pelle added that 'dolphin friendly' labels on tuna cans were 'relatively meaningless'. 'It's not regulated; some people put their own dolphin friendly label on their tins without any official body giving them that logo,' he said. 'And just because it's so-called dolphin friendly it doesn't mean it's not killing sharks or other species as well.' Marine animals affected include whale sharks, silky sharks, marlins, rays, oceanic whitetip sharks, olive ridley sea turtles, mako sharks and other mixed species of fish - some of which are threatened species . Australian consumers of tinned and fresh tuna have no way of knowing whether or not the tuna they are eating is caught using the FAD method . A spokeswoman for Food Standards Australia New Zealand said dolphin-free labelling isn't covered by the Food Standards Code, but consumer law comes into play regarding misleading or deceptive claims. Mr Pelle said there were also issues for conscious consumers when they eat fresh tuna from supermarkets or restaurants. 'In supermarkets customers need to be told where it was imported from, but it could be caught anywhere in the world and brought to Indonesia or Thailand to be packed,' he said. 'In a restaurant they don't have to tell you anything whatsoever, you could be looking at your sashimi or red tuna steak with no way of knowing where it's come from.' Matthew Evans, host of new documentary series What's The Catch which starts screening this Thursday on SBS, said consumers should look for the label 'pole and line caught'. 'As a consumer in this country foreign labelling laws make it virtually impossible for you know what you're eating,' Mr Evans told Daily Mail Australia. 'If I'm looking for tinned tuna I'd be looking for pole and line caught, because even if you don't know where it's come from you know how it's caught.' Mr Evans added that tuna fisheries in Australia were well managed. Brian Jeffriess, CEO of the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association, said Australian tuna fishers only supply fresh tuna, and have not produced tuna for use in cans since the 1990s. Mr Jeffriess said 96 percent of tuna in Australia was caught by the 'ranching' method, in which tuna is caught live using purse seine nets and towed to farms to grow larger for six months. He said the other 4 percent was caught using the 'pole and line' method, which sees fish caught using lines with about 1200 baited hooks attached. Pictured is a transponder and FAD in the Indian Ocean . Purse seine nets  circle around schools of fish before being drawn up like a purse . Mr Jeffriess added that Australian tuna fishers do not use FADs and the practice is banned in local waters. 'We don't need to use FADs, we catch a high quality premium tuna which swims in schools naturally in clean areas,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We use planes to see the movement of fish and we use bait to attract it.' Mr Jeffriess said it was easy for tuna brands to say they were dolphin friendly because dolphins did not tend to swim near most species of tuna.

"Former Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison's plans to turn his Hawaiian island paradise into a major eco-tourism destination have been delayed. The billionaire software guru spent $300 million buying a 97 per cent stake in the island of Lanai in 2012 which has a population of 3,200 people. Under ambitious plans announced soon after the purchase, Ellison announced that he wanted to develop a third resort hotel on the island as well as building  a new desalination plant to provide fresh water. He also wanted to expand the island's airport, allowing direct flights from the United States. Former Oracle Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison, pictured, spent $300 million on the island of Lanai . Ellison bought a 97 per cent stake in the island, pictured, which is in the Hawaiian island chain . Ellison is planning to turn the island into a major eco-tourism destination with additional holiday resorts . He also had plans for developing renewable energy and sustainable agriculture on the island. According to the New York Times within four months of Ellison's purchase, unemployment on the island had dropped to just 1.2 per cent. In the past, the island was owned by the company behind Dole pineapples and was one of the world's largest producers of the fruit, until the market changed making the plantations unsustainable. Initially, local residents were overwhelmingly supportive of the new plans, after Ellison bought 87,000 of the island's 90,000 acres, but that optimism soon turned to disillusionment. One anonymous young man told the New York Times: ' There’s a lot of complainers — some people aren’t happy — but they don’t realize how much they have. It’s just awesome!' However, the mini boom caused by the takeover has led to a shortage of housing and some residents have concerns about the future of the island. Larry Ellison, with girlfriend Nikita Khan at Wimbledon watching the Mens' singles final in July . Lanai native Zane de la Cruz complained that communication under the Ellison regime is actually worse than it had been previously. He said: 'They give out a lot worthless information. They give you buzzwords.' Retired schoolteacher Pierce Myers added: 'The hope is real. The potential is fantastic. This place was developed on the backs of humble people; people who cared for each other. When you live on an island, you can’t afford to make enemies. A compassion grows from that. Now it feels like everything’s being driven from outside by some force that is not part of that tradition.' However, local residents have noticed that some of the planned redevelopments or improvements have not been made or have stalled. A golf course overlooking Lanai City has been allowed to get overgrown and fish in the ornamental ponds have been allowed to die. According to locals that development has been delayed until 2015 or possibly 2016. Also construction of the planned desalination plant was halted on September 12. The plant is needed to allow further construction on the island as there is a shortage of fresh drinking water. Resident Gail Allen told the New York TImes: 'I don’t think Mr. Ellison’s trying to hurt people, but I don’t think he realizes what a delicate little ecosystem the economy is here.' School teacher Karen de Brum said: 'At the end of the day, Mr Ellison can and will do what he wants. He asks for input, but that’s like me asking for input on what to do with my backyard. I own my backyard.' Over the past two years retired French Canadian hypnotherapist Henry Jolicoeur has followed the story of Lanai and travelled out to the tropical island to interview the residents about their view of the takeover. In the past, Lanai was one of the largest exporters of pineapples until the trade collapsed in the 1990s . Ellison wants to develop the south side of the island creating a new hotel complex and luxury villas . Bill and Melissa Gates married at the Manele Bay Hotel, pictured, on January 1, 1994 on Lanai . Mr Jolicoeur interviewed residents in Lanai City about the man who now owned a third of all their houses and apartments. Mr Jolicoeur spent three weeks interviewing residents shortly after news of Mr Ellison's purchase became public. As well as hotel resorts, the former Oracle CEO now owned the island's graveyard, Only a gas station, car rental company, two banks, a credit union and a coffee shop are not owned by the billionaire. One fishing boat captain told Mr Jolicoeur: 'I want to thank Mr. Ellison. He’s got a vision, and he’s taking care of us over here on Lanai.' Others wanted to thank the businessman for bringing plenty of work to the island and providng them with a future. The space shuttle Endeavour mapped Lanai, right, during its mission in February 2000 . Even the local Catholic church is supportive of the new investor. One priest said: 'Heavenly father... We ask for your blessings for Mr Ellison, particularly, and those who work with him, that all the good plans and intentions that he has for Lanai be fruitful.' In a public meeting in 2013 to discuss the billionaire's plan for the island, a spokesman told residents that Ellison was planning 'the first economically viable, 100 per cent green community'. He wanted renewable energy and electric cars. When the island was put up for sale in 2011, its residents were concerned that it might be bought by a Russian oligarch or a middle eastern sheikh.","Larry Ellison paid $300 million for a 97 per cent stake in the island of Lanai .

"AT&T wireless customers may want to take a closer look at their old phone bills because they may have money coming back to them. The Federal Trade Commission said Wednesday that AT&T Mobility LLC, a subsidiary of the telecom giant, has agreed to a hefty $105 million settlement after the government accused the company of unlawfully billing customers for hundreds of millions of dollars in bogus charges - a practice known as cramming. The multi-agency settlement includes $80 million that will be paid to the FTC for consumer refunds. One state attorney general compared what AT&T did as amounting to picking the pockets of consumers. Dallas HQ: AT&T has been ordered to pay fines and compensation totaling $105 million to the public and all 50 states . According to the complaint, the charges appeared on AT&T phone bills but were from third-party companies for services people never asked to receive or were duped into subscribing to - things like horoscope texts, celebrity gossip or flirting tips. The fees were usually around $9.99 a month and were not easy for customers to find on their bills. The FTC says AT&T kept at least 35 percent of the unauthorized charges it imposed on customers. Plenty of consumers complained. In 2011 alone, AT&T received more than 1.3 million calls to its customer service department about the charges, the commission said. 'This should have and, in fact, did ring alarm bells at AT&T,' FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said at the settlement announcement. 'But instead of acting to stop the charges, AT&T continued to make hundreds of millions of dollars from the practice.' FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said the settlement should serve as notice to wireless carriers that unauthorized charges on phone bills will not be tolerated. In a statement, company spokesman Fletcher Cook said the settlement resolves 'claims that some of our wireless customers were billed for charges from third-parties that the customers did not authorize.' He said AT&T last year discontinued third-party billing for premium short messaging services. Those services offer ringtones or messaging programs provided by other companies and typically rely on text messages sent to consumers to initiate charges. From the settlement, an additional $20 million in penalties and fees will go to 50 states and the District of Columbia. Another $5 million will be paid to the Federal Communications Commission. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said the settlement should serve as notice to wireless carriers that unauthorized charges on phone bills will not be tolerated. The third-party fees were listed on wireless bills as 'AT&T Monthly Subscriptions,' leading customers to believe the charges were part of services provided by AT&T. Sometimes, third-party companies randomly pick phone numbers of people to sign up for their ringtones or texts without their knowledge or consent. FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said consumers were often hit with $9.99 charges lumped together into ""AT&T monthly subscriptions"" on their bills. Other cramming might involve third-party vendors who offer gift cards, telling would-be recipients that they need to enter a contest for the card by providing their cell number and texting back a certain pin number. The vendors then would start charging customers' phone accounts for recurring charges unrelated to the gift-card offer. Under terms of the settlement, AT&T will be required to get consumers' consent before placing any third-party charges on their bills. Customers also must have the option to block any third-party charges from being placed on their bills. Consumers seeking refunds should go to the FTC's website, where they can make a claim for charges dating back to 2009. People will need to submit their nae, phone number and account number if they have it. Refund representatives can then search bills for unauthorized charges. This is the FTC's seventh mobile cramming case since 2013. In July, the commission sued T-Mobile in federal court in Seattle, accusing the mobile provider of wrongly charging customers for premium services they never authorized. T-Mobile has said it was already offering refunds to customers for those charges.","AT&T will pay $105 million to settle allegations that it put unauthorized charges on customers' cell phone bills, a practice known as cramming .

"Mississippi has finally abolished slavery 148 years after the 13th Amendment was first passed by the Senate - thanks to movie-goers at the University of Mississippi. Dr Ranjan Batra, an associate professor of neurobiology and anatomical sciences at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, saw the Oscar-nominated Steven Spielberg movie Lincoln in November. The movie left him wondering what happened next when each state voted on ratifying the amendment. He discovered that Mississippi was the only state that had not officially voted in favour of the change. A note on the US Constitution website said: 'Mississippi ratified the amendment in 1995, but because the state never officially notified the US Archivist, the ratification is not official.' Scroll down for video . A medical professor saw Steven Spielberg's Lincoln, starring Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th US president, and decided to look into what happened state-by-state after the 13th Amendment had been ratified by Congress . The 13th Amendment, seen here in a the Tennessee State Museum with the signature of Abraham Lincoln, had been ratified by Mississippi in 1995 but nobody filed the correct paperwork . Dr Batra, who became a US citizen in 2008 after immigrating from India, told colleague Ken Sullivan about his discovery, and Mr Sullivan remembered the 1995 vote from when he was a high school senior. Mr Sullivan found out what paperwork was required from the National Archives' Office of the Federal Register. The same weekend, Mr Sullivan saw the movie for himself with his wife Kris. He told the Clarion-Ledger: 'People stood up and applauded at the end of it. That’s the first time I ever saw an audience do that. 'I felt very connected to the history.' Mr Sullivan tracked down a copy of the 1995 resolution, which had passed the Mississippi Senate and House. It had been introduced by state senator Hillman Frazier, who was upset when he learned his state had never ratified the 13th Amendment. Some lawmakers had abstained from the vote, but nobody voted against it. It is not known why the copy of the amendment was not sent in 1995. The film Lincoln prompted Dr Ranjan Batra to discuss Mississippi's ratification of the 13th Amendment with colleague Ken Sullivan, who got in touch with Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann . Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann filed the paperwork on January 30 this year after being approached by Mr Sullivan. On February 7, the director of the Federal Register Charles A Barth wrote back. His letter said: 'With this action, the State of Mississippi has ratified the 13th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.' Hosemann told the Clarion-Ledger: 'It was long overdue.' Frazier said: 'We finally got it right.' Last week, Mr and Mrs Sullivan and their daughters met Secretary Hosemann and posed for photographs with the documents for the state's official ratification. The 13th Amendment, introduced under President Abraham Lincoln, states: 'Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.' Before Mississippi corrected its oversight, the last state to ratify the amendment was Kentucky in 1976. The 13th Amendment required 27 of the then-36 states to give their approval after it had been passed by Congress. The 27th state to vote in its favour was Georgia in December 1865. At the time, Mississippi rejected the 13th Amendment, alongside states such as Kentucky and Delaware.","Dr Ranjan Batra investigated what happened after the film's conclusion .

"Pretty in a navy and blue lace dress and with her glossy red hair swinging around her shoulders, Princess Beatrice was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for a charity dinner in London last night.

Princess Beatrice, 26, is the patron of the charity and in her profile on its website, expands on her love of Africa and her passion for good causes. The event, which also included an auction, saw singers Jamelia and Lucy Kay lend their support to the cause, with Ms Kay later performing.

Now fit and healthy, the Duchess has had more good news in recent weeks after it was revealed that the Queen allowed her to hold a charity gala at Windsor Castle - a sign, say royal watchers, of a return to the royal fold. While the Queen has long been said to have remained fond of her former daughter-in-law, Prince Philip is said to be baffled by Fergie and Prince Andrew's relationship.

"Doctors have removed a 10cm long steel fork from inside a man’s penis, after a sexual adventure went horribly wrong. The 70-year-old visited Canberra Hospital’s emergency department complaining of bleeding genitalia. He then promptly admitted that he had inserted a piece of cutlery into his urethra in an attempt to pleasure himself. Unfortunately the attempt backfired and it became stuck, leaving him in considerable pain. Despite this, it took him 12 hours to pluck up the courage to seek medical help. Sharp pain: The elderly man had entirely lost the steel piece of cutlery inside his body and had waited 12 hours to seek help . The fork was so firmly lodged inside the man's body that doctors could not initially see the cause of the discomfort, according to the report in The International Journal of Surgery. However, once it had been located, ‘multiple retrieval methods were contemplated with success . achieved via forceps traction and copious lubrication.’ Needles . Pencils . Ball point pens, .

Source: The International Journal of Surgery . The procedure was successful and the elderly man was sent home with no long-term damage. According to the article, entitled ‘An Unusual Urethral Foreign Body’, it is very rare to find alien objects lodged in the lower urinary tract. But, it said, many unexpected objects have been retrieved from other parts of the body. These include toothbrushes, pencils, allen keys, plastic cups, light bulbs, thermometers, plants and vegetables, leeches, snakes, wax and glue. Doctors Krishanth Naidu, Maurice Mulcahy and Amanda Chung said they chose to publish the unusual case 'to create discussion among the medical fraternity given the great management challenge faced by the oddity and infrequency with which a fork is encountered in the penile urethra'. The added that the motives for inserting objects into such a sensitive region were difficult to comprehend. According to the report, in a series of 20 adult cases over 9 years, foreign body insertions into the lower urinary tract have a low incidence, with men 1.7 times more likely to engage in the behaviour than women. They said that practice tends to occur 'during states of pathological masturbation, substance abuse and intoxication'. In most cases embarrassed patients attempted to retrieve the item themselves, risking injury and foreign body migration. The real danger was infection leading to death, because ashamed patients often delay medical treatment, they said. Doctors generally try to avoid surgery in such situations, instead choosing an option that would minimise trauma and preserve erectile function. According to the report, typical symptoms after having inserted a foreign object into the male urethra include lower abdominal pain, penile pain, swelling of glans or body of penis, inflammation of the urethra, dyspareunia (pain during sex), blood-stained urine, pyuria (pus in urine), increased urinary frequency, inability to urinate and fever.","Doctors from Canberra, Australia,  have published a case in which an elderly man 'lost' and entire piece of cutlery inside his body .

"A New Zealand team of designers has created a desk made out of 100 per cent recyclable material that can be adjusted to standing or sitting height and then packed-up and taken anywhere. Designed by Refold, three recent university graduates from Wellington - Fraser Callaway, Oliver Ward and Matt Innes - the Portable Cardboard Standing Desk is made entirely of cardboard and yet can hold up the weight of an adult. Weighing only 6.5kg, it is designed to be fitted together in as little as two minutes and then folded down into its self-formed carry case. Made out of 100 per cent recyclable materials, the desk can be adjusted to sitting or standing height . It was created by Refold: three recently graduated university students from Wellington named Fraser Callaway, Oliver Ward and Matt Innes . 'It is made completely from a single material – 7mm twin cushion kraft cardboard, which means it's 100% recyclable and can be put out with your household recycling,' Refold explains. 'Each leg is constructed from three pieces of cardboard laminated together with environmentally friendly glue. 'For maximum strength the flute direction alternates with a horizontal flute sandwiched between two verticals.' However, one of the most important design aspects of the desk according to its creators is its ability to be easily adjusted for its users to either sit or stand. Refold says one of the desk's most important features is the ability to allow users to stand . 'Research shows that when you're standing you're more likely to engage with others, share your ideas and work together,'they said . As recent studies have suggested that sitting down for hours at a time each day is leading to heart disease and early deaths, Refold have put forward their design as an easy solution. But the desk's flexibility also offers a range of options for work places that want to increase the productivity and collaboration in their spaces. 'Research shows that when you're standing you're more likely to engage with others, share your ideas and work together,' Refold claims, adding that their desks can be re-arranged and moved to suit any environment or space in moments. It also allows for flexible working areas to be created and is suitable for a variety of spaces . The team have also been working alongside UNICEF New Zealand  to help improve education in the Pacific Islands by trialling the desks in less fortunate schools . The inspiration behind the innovative design came to the team when they were trying to organise work experience for graphic design students who were transitioning from university into the workplace. The program was repeatedly road-blocked by studios that claimed to love the concept, but have no physical desk space for the students to participate in their activities. Frustrated, they created the recyclable desks which are made through digital fabrication – allowing each desk to have the option of drastically differing in its design in order to fit to individuals and their needs. The inspiration behind the idea came from the team's inability to organise work experience for graphic design students due to studios claiming they did not have the physical desk space for the students to participate . Weighing only 6.5kg, it is designed to be fitted together in as little as two minutes and then folded down into its self-formed carry case . The team have since recognised the opportunities that a flexible desk can not only provide in an office space, but in an educational setting. 'We see these desks as a product to instigate positive change in the schools of those who are less fortunate,' the team have said.

"In a society saturated with lotions and potions promising to turn back the clock, it comes as little surprise that women are paranoid about ageing. In fact, so concerned are British women about the onset of wrinkles that a third view 45 as being 'over the hill' - and believe they look old at this age. Over half of women (52 per cent) cited 45 as the age when they would consider using Botox or other injectables and a further 28 per cent of women said they would consider having more drastic cosmetic surgery, such as face lifts. Scroll down for video . Dreaded age: A new survey reveals that women are so concerned about the onset of wrinkles that a third view 45 as being over the hill - the same age as Renee Zellwegger, pictured, left, last week and, right, when she shot to fame as Bridget Jones ten years ago . Bridget Jones actress Renee Zellweger, who is 45, appeared at an event in Los Angeles looking drastically different to how she looked in the hit film. The star credits her healthy new lifestyle for her new appearance but the vast majority of women (86 per cent) surveyed are convinced that Renee now looks much older than her true age and believe she looked more beautiful in the 2001 film. Most of the women cite Jennifer Aniston as someone who has aged gracefully and they think the A-list actress looks at least ten years younger than her age of 45. Paranoia: Over half of women (52 per cent) cited 45 as the age when they would consider using Botox or other injectables and a further 28 per cent of women said they would consider having more drastic cosmetic surgery, such as face lifts . Ageing gracefully: The survey also revealed that women rate Jennifer Aniston, left, who they think looks at least ten years younger than her age of 45, and also think Dame Helen Mirren, right, 69, looks great . A spokesperson for Escentual.com, who commissioned the research, said: 'It’s a common fear for the Bridget Jones generation to fear hitting their mid 40s, and at that point several women said they would take ""drastic"" measures to turn back the beauty clock. 'Many said they worried about being seen as old, and getting lines and wrinkles but the fact is that if you look after your skin from your late teens with good skincare products, then there really is no need to fear turning 45. 'You only have to look at actresses like Jennifer Aniston to know that you can still look fabulous at that age if you take care of your skin. 'The worst thing to do is to get to 45 and then feel the need to take drastic measures, which can sometimes really backfire.' Plastic and Cosmetic Surgeon Dr Alex Karidis from London’s Karidis Clinic told MailOnline he believes Renee may have had an upper eye lift as ‘the distance between the brow and her eye is much smaller than before.’ Alex also explained there is more of her eyelid showing and her eyes look much bigger, however her brows are not higher, which suggests she hasn’t had a brow lift. ‘Her forehead is smooth - you would expect more expressive wrinkles when she smiles which indicates a possible small dose of Botox between eyelid and eye,’ he said. He also suggested she could have had 'non-surgical treatments such as ultrasound therapy to firm the skin and medical grade facial to get rid of dead skin cells.’","Women think they're at their prime at age 29 .

"A recent plague of feral cats could mean Australia's native bilbies are on the verge of extinction, with only 200 marsupials left in a Queensland national park . A recent plague of feral cats could mean Australia's native bilbies are on the verge of extinction, with only 200 marsupials left in a Queensland national park. Astrebla Downs National Park, west of Brisbane, Queensland, is the 'state's most important wild population of the greater bilby', according to Queensland's Department of National Parks, which homed around 700 bilbies in recent times. Now, Andrew Powell, Queensland Environment and Heritage Minister, has told Radio National's Background Briefing that bilbies are diminishing due to feral cat attacks, the ABC reported. Despite Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service attempt to kill off more than 3,000 feral cats by spending $350,000 to shoot them, the bilby population is still heading for extinction. But Minister Powell insists his department will not let that happen. 'As a state we will do what we can and we'll continue to put funds towards their management and obviously any additional funds that come from the Federal Government would be welcome,' he said . 'We have seen feral cats occurring in plague proportions over the last few years, particularly in key areas such as the habitat of the greater bilby which has had dire consequences.' In the radio interview Minister Powell declares war on feral cats. The high number of feral cats appeared when a plague of longhaired rats entered the 176,000 hectare property, home to hundreds of protected bilbies. Once all the rats had been eaten, the feral cats began to feed on the marsupials and between 2012 and 2014 over 120 bilbies were found inside feral cats. Frank Manthey, co-founder of Save the Bilby said the government needs to spend more time on this 'heartbreaking' problem . Astrebla Downs National Park, west of Brisbane, Queensland, is the 'state's most important wild population of the greater bilby', according to Queensland's Department of National Parks, homing around 700 bilbies in recent times . Frank Manthey, co-founder of Save the Bilby said the government needs to spend more time on this 'heartbreaking' problem. He said the bilbies that were pulled out of the dissected feral cats were young and inexperienced, making it even more devastating for the bilby population. Mr Manthey believes government officials and conservation groups should get involved in a summit and figure out a solution before it is too late. Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt agreed with Mr Manthey and said that next year he will plans to host the summit and will suggest government parties sign a 10-year plan to stop bilby extinction. He said the bilbies that were pulled out of the dissected feral cats were young and inexperienced, making it even more devastating for the bilby population .

"The former Wallabies business manager who quit her role after receiving crude text messages from  star player Kurtley Beale previously attempted to sue an employer for $600,000 after being bitten by a spider. Di Patston took out a lawsuit against Maroochy Shire Council, on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, in 2008 after she was allegedly bitten after making coffee. Ms Patston's lawyers claimed her injuries were the result of 'negligence and or breach of contract and breach of duty of carel', in the legal claim lodged with the Queensland Supreme Court, the Sydney Morning Herald revealed. She was working as an administrative officer for the council in 2003 when the alleged injury occurred and claimed that it caused her major depressive episodes, panic and lymphoedema, a lymphatic obstruction that can cause swelling. Scroll down for video . Di Patston (left) claimed she was bitten by a spider (stock photo shown) in 2003, in a 2008 law suit against Maroochy Shire Council, on the Sunshine Coast, Queensland . The former Wallabies business manager is now at the centre of a controversy surrounding Kurtley Beale . The Sydney Morning Herald reports the matter was settled in 2010 but Ms Patston received far less than $600,000. Now, 11 years later, she is at the centre of a controversy surrounding  Beale. On Monday, the emotional anguish felt by Ms Patston was revealed following the news that she quit her role on Friday  following a mid-air row with Beale last month. The full text message exchange which sparked that bust-up and her leaving her post - and Beale being stood down indefinitely - was reported in The Daily Telegraph. Ms Patston told of the hurt she felt at being the subject of the texts and asked Beale why she has been targeted. 'What did I do to you? I have barely known you a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this,' Ms Patston texted to Beale. 'Don't you think my job is hard enough with this?' Wallabies coach Ewan McKenzie has defended his relationship with Ms Patston, with whom he  worked at the Queensland Reds . Beale replied four minutes later, apologising for the message, telling Ms Patston she had done nothing wrong and that he does 'stupid things for no reason'. Ms Patston fired back that she wants the player to leave him alone. The emotional string of texts were exchanged in June while the team were in a Brisbane hotel before the first Test against France. The contents of Beale's offensive text messages about Ms Patston were revealed earlier this week, when a letter from the Australian Rugby Union to Beale was leaked. The letter, reportedly sent on Wednesday, referenced two messages containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?' The Sunday Telegraph reported. Ms Patston contacted Beale after she received the images, telling him, 'I can't stop crying.' 'I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female at this level,' she wrote. 'If I complain then I make it hard for women in rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake. 'Do you realise the situation I am in? Just leave me alone please.' After a further apology from Beale, Ms Patston asked whether he was sorry for sending the message - or for being caught. Around two hours after their  exchange began, Ms Patston and Beale met to discuss the matter in a hotel room with three Wallabies players present. Ms Patston forgave Beale, promising to keep the offending texts secret - but swore she would only keep her silence if no other incidents occurred. After they met, she messaged him to assure him the ARU would not find out about the texts. 'I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter... and how they would feel seeing what you sent me,' Ms Patston wrote to Beale after their meeting. 'I'll never know who you sent them to or why, but everybody deserves a chance.' 'You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' PATSTON (1:08pm) 'I am sitting here in the team room doing my job and I can't stop crying. What did I do to you? You have barely known me a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this. Don't you think my job is hard enough without this? This is how the only female staff member is treated? I am so embarrassed by this I am leaving for my room I can't stop crying thanks a lot.' BEALE (1.12pm) 'We all see how hard you work for us. I just do stupid things for no reason... I hate that I have done this to you & I am so sorry di.' PATSTON (1.15pm) 'Just leave me alone this is not ok. Do you realise the situation you've put me in? I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female and this level. If I complain then I make it hard for women in Rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.' After Kurtley Beale and Di Patston met in a Brisbane hotel room . PATSTON (3.44pm) 'Glad we got the chance to catch up and talk it through. I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter (all those things we discussed) and how they would feel seeing what you sent me. I'll never know who you sent them to or why; but everyone deserves a chance. You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' BEALE (3.48pm) 'I can't believe you're not going to tell Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me & I have learned my lesson I promise you. You have been evry kind to me di and I'll never do anything like this again. Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve better you do so much & work so hard. Wish I could take it back. Thankyou di.' Edited transcripts of text messages . The rugby star promised the then-business manager he would 'never do anything like this again.' 'I can't believe you're not going to Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me,' he replied. 'I have learned my lesson I promise you.' 'Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve so much more.' However, Beale broke that promise when he verbally abused Patston on a flight from South Africa to South America last month, leading to Ms Patston's resignation due to stress. The team was flying to Mendoza after their 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town. Beale is believed to have made a sarcastic comment to Ms Patston when she asked him to change into an item of Wallabies team gear, which sparked a heated exchange. Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina . The Integrity Unit announced an investigation into the matter and Beale was not selected to play against Argentina the following Saturday, which resulted in a 21-17 loss. After Beale's second offence, Ms Patston is understood to have notified Ewen McKenzie and ARU officials about the offending texts Beale had sent four months earlier. Beale's playing future is in doubt, as he prepares to face two separate code of conduct hearings. The first hearing will take place early this week, to exclusively address the text messages. It's expected the matter will result in the termination of Beale's Wallaby contract, which is due to expire at the end of the year. Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked. 'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper. 'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.'","The Wallabies former business manager used to work for Maroochy Shire Council, in Queensland, in 2003 .

"Roger Delano Hinkins the founder of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness has died at the age of 80, it was announced on Wednesday. Known as the 'Mystical Traveler' by his followers, who include Arianna Huffington and Carol Wilson of the Beach Boys before his death, the news of Hinkins' passing was published on his organizations website. There was no cause of death given for the spiritualist who was living in Los Angeles at the time of his passing. Dr. John-Roger Hinkins, writer Arianna Huffington and producer Norman Lear (l-r) chat at the launch party for Huffington's new book ""Fanatics and Fools : The Game Plan For Winning Back America"" on April 7, 2004 at a private residence in Beverly Hills, California . Devotion: Roger Delano Hinkins was able to count on more than 5,000 followers of the church he founded in 1971 . A brief statement was posted online early this morning saying that 'Our beloved John-Roger made his transition today from the physical body into the spirit.' 'While we are, of course, greatly saddened by this loss we are also aware that this a particularly sensitive and sacred time to use what we have learned to go within and connect with John-Roger, and the Christ, in Spirit. 'J-R's loving spiritual presence is with us, perhaps more than ever, and will comfort and guide us as we allow it.' The controversial group is known for its aversion to garlic, publishing specialist cook-books of garlic free Italian and French recipes for its followers. Hinkins most prominent follower is the Huffington Post founder, who is reportedly an ordained 'Minister of Light' in the group and who once described the spiritualist as her 'way-shower'. Controversial: Roger Hinkins was dogged by rumors he would make inappropriate advances on young male members of MSIA . Born in 1934 and raised a Mormon in Rains, Utah, Hinkins claimed that despite having a normal childhood, he was able to discern auras - colorful fields around the human body - that some believe surround us. Graduating the Universtiy of Utah with a degree in psychology in 1958, Hinkins moved to Los Angeles and it was there in 1963 that he had a near-death experience during surgery for kidney stones and fell into a coma. During this time unconscious he came to realize there was a higher consciousness, he dubbed the 'Mystical Traveler' and claimed he now understood the universe better. Given the keys to 'anchor' the Mystical Traveler on earth after his coma experience, Hinkins founded the Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness in 1971. In its almost 45-years of existence, the MSIA has faced accusations of being cult and of Hinkins making unwanted sexual advances toward male members. Specifically claims were made that in the early 1980s, Hinkins would threaten young men at MSIA with spiritual exclusion from the group if they didn't have sex with him. Susan and Wendell Whitmore spoke out in 1988 to claim that MSIA members were told that Hinkins had taken a vow of celibacy, which meant they did not question the young men who stayed in his house. 'He always had someone sleeping in his bedroom at night, supposedly to protect his body while he was out of it,' said Whitmore to People Magazine more than 25 years ago. This circle of attractive young male ministers was known as 'the Guys' according to an LA Times series of articles dating from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. Leader: Claims were made that in the early 1980s, Hinkins would threaten young men at MSIA with spiritual exclusion from the group if they didn't have sex with him. Wendell Whitmore's twin brother Wesley, alleged that Hinkin would act odd in behind closed doors, describing him as 'often angry, vindictive and bizarre, occasionally shouting that he was under attack from negative forces.' The Whitmore's all left the MSIA and claimed in the aftermath they had their cars vandalized by persons unknown and letters sent to them accusing them of being gay, eventually culminating in threats on their lives. Psychologist Steven Hassan took part in an interview in the 1980s for ABC News Nightline's hosted by Ted Koppel and was asked if MSIA qualified as a cult and replied: . 'In my professional opinion it does. It's a pyramid-structured authoritarian regime that uses deception in recruitment and mind control techniques to keep people dependent and obedient. People are instilled with phobias that if they ever question John-Roger or if they ever leave the group terrible things will happen to them.' Hinkins also faced accusations that he stole the central core beliefs of MSIA from another spiritualist group. These claims center on the close similarity between Hinkins writings and those of Paul Twitcehll's book, Echankar. In 2008, Arianna Huffington was questioned by the New Yorker for a profile piece about what role MSIA had in Huffington Post's development. Barbara Walters told the magazine about being introduced to John-Roger by Huffington in the eighties. 'I did not take to him the same way that she had,' she told the reporter. 'That caused a pause in our relationship, and, I think, of some others.'","Spiritualist leader known as John-Roger had more than 5,000 followers .

"Jose Mourinho has spoken of the bond between himself and his new rival at Manchester United, Louis van Gaal, ahead of the upcoming season. The Chelsea boss was assistant to the then Barcelona manager between 1997 and 2000, before Mourinho took up his first managerial post at Benfica and Van Gaal left for his first stint as Holland coach. And although Mourinho admits contact between the pair has been limited since their spell at the Nou Camp, he told Sport magazine of his utmost respect for his former mentor. VIDEO Scroll down to watch A happy Louis liking his players in training . Master and the apprentice: Mourinho (right) shares his views with Van Gaal in 1999 . 'We worked together, then we went our separate professional ways,' said the 51-year-old Portuguese. 'But there will always be a fantastic relation between us. I like him a lot and I know he likes me a lot too.' Seventh-placed United finished 18 points behind Mourinho's third-placed Blues last season and Van Gaal will be eager at the very least to significantly reduce that gap in his first season at Old Trafford. Mourinho watched the Dutchman's first United press conference and drew some insightful conclusions from the words and demeanour of the man he met in the 2010 Champions League final when his Inter Milan side beat Van Gaal's Bayern Munich. 'I think he was very Louis,' said Mourinho. 'The Louis I know, by which I mean he was very honest, very pragmatic.

'Sometimes people say there is a bit of arrogance but no, when you are honest and direct and say what you want and what you think you are not arrogant - you are just honest.' Mourinho has often used a similar defence for himself when he has been labelled as arrogant by his critics, but he insists that, despite their similarities, he is not an exact replica of Van Gaal. 'Louis is Louis and I am Jose and each one is unique,' added Mourinho. 'There are no points to compare us. Reunion: The pair before the 2010 Champions League final, which Mourinho's Inter won 2-0 . 'But the training philosophy and methodology... well, I learn with him. I also developed a lot of my own ideas, but I would lie if I didn't say I learned something with Louis, because I did.'

"A student has set himself the goal of meeting every one of his 1088 Facebook friends for a cup of coffee. Matt Kuleza, from Melbourne, has not seen many of his social media 'friends' for years but thought rather than delete them, he would try and catch up with one a day until he's met them all - a task that will take him about three years. The 28-year-old spoke with Daily Mail Australia about his motivation for the project, which he has dubbed 1000+ Coffees, and his related blog. Coffee #4: Joshua Poly-Goldschläger (friends on Facebook since December 2013, 71 mutual friends). Matt (left) explains on his project's blog, 'Josh and I met last year at Meredith Music Festival. We were camping together thanks to mutual friends and I remember instantly hitting it off with him the moment we met.' Coffee #5: Jason Waterfalls AKA Nick Bourke AKA Bourkey (friends on Facebook since June 2008, 145 mutual friends). Matt said on his blog, 'Bourkey is one of my best friends and we hang out every week, but neither of us have any idea exactly how and when we met, but it was around the time I was living in a warehouse in Abbotsford and having lots of parties.' Coffee #7: Clementine Bastow (friends on Facebook 2.0 since November 2013, 46 mutual friends). 'Today Clem and I caught up on our families, chatted about pop-culture and the time she rapped Die Antwoord’s remix of ‘Orinoco Flow' to a room of gobsmacked LA-types,' said Matt. 'It’s a very simple idea, really. I literally just asked myself, ""Who are these one thousand apparent friends I have?"", who'd I accumulated over about seven years,' said Matt. 'I was just going to do a cull to get rid of people, but then I thought that I should see if I could get to know them instead. It seemed like a cool social experiment, and amazingly has changed my life for the better.' Starting the project in early September, Matt has had at least one coffee date per day for the past three weeks, and has already met up with 23 of his Facebook- and now soon to be real- friends, with some interesting results. 'I've been keeping a very open mind. I caught up with an ex-girlfriend from five years ago, which went really well. We both have partners now, but we just slipped into old habits of chatting. I'm assuming other people psych themselves out over their relationships with other people, but I'm so glad that I have this catalyst to meet people,' said Matt. 'Everyone I've met up with has been interested in it. It's a basic idea but has already had such a positive effect on my life.' Coffee #10: Juliana Park (friends on Facebook since May 2014, no mutual friends). Matt said on his blog, 'Today I caught up with the lovely Jules, a new friend that I met at university towards the end of last semester. Jules and I both took a class on World Religions and got chatting one day after she found out I was studying Korean.' Matt said, 'Coffee #11: Rfc Tru aka Robert Coleman (friends on Facebook since September 2007, 84 mutual friends)Last night I strapped myself in for the experience of catching up with the hurricane of a human and old friend that I really need to make more time for, Robbie Coleman.' Coffee #14: Sally Humble (friends on Facebook since September 2011, 53 mutual friends). 'Sally was in the year level above me in high school and also happens to be my sister’s best friend’s sister, so we had been friendly with each other for years.' said Matt on his project website. Matt sees the meet-ups as less of an opportunity to talk about himself, and much more a way to hear about other people's lives. 'I guess I see myself as more in an interviewing role,' he said. 'The experiment is a type of document about other people as well as the experience of stepping out of comfort zones. Every person has something interesting and amazing to say.' 'I caught up with a friend from primary school who I haven't seen since 1998. He's an amazing professional photographer and is going to take me diving.' 'I've also had my taro read, which I've never done before. Really, this experience has just opened up a whole new universe of people that I wouldn't have been exposed to.' Matt has had a few snarky comments left on his blog, but he says that despite a little bit of tension, overwhelmingly the response has been supportive. 'The theme of the project is for me, and others, to step out of the prescribed role of social media, and to spark something different. It seems that social media has evolved into everyone staring at their screens instead of interacting with those who are right in front of them,' he said. 'I used to work in hospitality and I was always so intrigued by the groups of people who would sit at the table staring at their phones without being in the moment. Worse, they would put their phones on the table, waiting and ready for some fascinating development.' Despite being a full-time student, Matt has been offered two jobs by people he has met up with during the project. He is now working several days a week as a digital strategist working on social media campaigns, and is also about to start working for the School of Life, running workshops on having meaningful conversations. 'Both the jobs are pretty fitting to the whole theme of the experiment,' Matt said. 'I've had to start getting up two to three hours early each day to fit the coffee dates in, but even though I've got more on my plate now, I'm determined to keep going.' 'The whole process has just changed my life so completely, and has had such a positive impact.'

"Liverpool are on the brink of concluding a £20million deal to make Dejan Lovren the most expensive defender in their history. Brendan Rodgers has been pursuing the Croatia international all summer and though Southampton - who have already sold Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert to Liverpool - were reluctant to do business there has been resolution; the transfer will take Liverpool’s summer spending past £80m. And the Anfield club are set to further boost their ranks - by concluding the £8.5m signing of striker Loic Remy over the weekend.

Loic Remy’s protracted £8.5million move from Queens Park Rangers should also be finally made official over the weekend.

"Andrew Chamberlain, 50, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm and jailed for three years . A charity worker who broke his neighbour’s arm in three places with a four foot scaffolding pole during a row over a parking space has been jailed. Andrew Chamberlain, 50, became ‘abusive and threatening’ after 24-year-old Daniel Morgan parked outside his home on the terraced street in Blackwood, South Wales. The carer, who has 42 previous convictions including an offence of making a threat to kill in 2004, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and jailed for three years on Friday. A jury at Cardiff Crown Court was told an argument erupted and Chamberlain took a large metal pole from his garden, raised it above his head and struck Mr Morgan - who blocked the blow with arm. Mr Morgan said: ‘It made a hell of a thud – the pain was excruciating. ‘He then brought the bar back as if he was going to hit me again.’ But Chamberlain claimed in an earlier hearing that he had been threatened by Mr Morgan and was using the pole to defend himself. He also said he needed regular access to the house where he lives with his 82-year-old mother because she suffers from severe arthritis and he needed to assist her. Mr Morgan said there were no official parking restrictions in the street but he would not have parked there if he’s known about Chamberlain’s mother’s health problems. The court heard parking was a 'contentious issue' on the street and residents had agreed to only park outside their own homes in Greenfield Terrace. Chamberlain has a string of convictions including aiming an air pistol at a woman’s head and threatening to shoot her, for which he was jailed for three and a half years. James Evans, defending, said he had ‘turned his life around’ and was a volunteer worker for a charity. Recorder Peter Griffiths told Chamberlain: ‘It is no pleasure for me to do the duty I have to perform. ‘You have turned your life around in the past 10 years. I was immensely impressed by the testimonials submitted in your behalf.’ The judge said despite the fact he is a carer for his mother he had to follow sentencing guidelines and an immediate custodial sentence was inevitable.

"Two Champions League-winning sides came together to celebrate Portuguese midfielder Deco's testimonial on Friday, marking the end of the career of one of Europe's greatest midfielders of the 21st century. The game, featuring the likes of Lionel Messi, Eidur Gudjohnsen, Benni McCarthy and Paulo Ferreira, ended 4-4, with Samuel Eto'o scoring twice and Deco getting the decisive strike for Porto having played for both sides. On an emotional occasion the Portuguese playmaker nipped in with a tidy finish in the 89th minute, which proved to be the last touch of the game. But Eto'o's cheeky antics were what had most people talking. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Samuel Eto'o's brilliantly cheeky finish and his messing around during the pre match pleasantries .

The centre forward, who spearheaded Barca's attack in 2006, was on top form. The first of his two goals came after he waited on the goalline for a defender to catch him before tapping in. And even before the game he was posing for the camera's as the camera panned across the assembled stars, which bizarrely included Edgar Davids despite him only playing for Barcelona in 2004. But the evening was all about Deco - he ended up scoring and setting up goals for both sides on a fitting end to a trophy-heavy career that took in time with both of these sides as well as Chelsea. Derlei, Benni McCarthy scored for Porto as they raced into a 2-0 first half lead, and Edgaras Jankauskas also bagged for the Portuguese side. Messi scored Barcelona's third on the night, converting a rare header from an Eto'o cross. But it was of course left to Deco to finish it off, placing a brilliant finish off the the underside of the bar (in a Porto shirt this time) to make it 4-4 before the referee recognised the ideal time to blow the final whistle and pull the curtain down on Deco's time in football. Afterwards, Messi paid tribute to the man of the occasion. 'Deco deserved this, both as a footballer and as a person,' he said. 'He’s a player I learned a lot from, as did so many other team-mates. There was no way I was going to miss this event.'","Host of stars turn out for game between Portuguese midfielder's two Champions League-winning teams .

Witnesses claimed Ballance, partying with team-mates Jimmy Anderson, Joe Root and Liam Plunkett, was carried from the bar at the Pandora’s Box club on Sunday night and was heard shouting: ‘I’m not a cricketer tonight.

"Barcelona forward Cristian Tello has joined Porto on a two-year-loan deal, the La Liga club said on Wednesday. The 22-year-old made only a handful of first team appearances last season and following the arrival of Luis Suarez from Liverpool, those chances were expected to dry up further and hence prompted the move.

"Microsoft is to drop both the Nokia and Windows Phone brand names in favour of just using Lumia. The company is beginning a transition to change all of its branding to simply Microsoft Lumia, just in time for the holiday season. The Finnish firm Nokia will live on as a separate company, though, focusing on mapping and network infrastructure. A report by The Verge says Microsoft is preparing to axe the Nokia name. The change by the Washington firm will see phones simply called Microsoft Lumia from now on (Lumia 730 shown). Both the Nokia brand name and Windows Phone are being dropped in the shake-up of Microsoft's phone business . The change was first reported by The Verge and has now been confirmed by Nokia France on their Facebook page. They wrote: 'In the coming days, you will receive a Facebook message regarding the change of name of this page. 'We are on the verge of becoming ""Microsoft Lumia!"" 'Stay-tuned for more soon.' The move brings an end to Nokia’s name being on mobile phones, a long run that stretches back into the 1980s. 'Some of today’s press reports related to rumours about Microsoft dropping the Nokia brand have declared the death of the Nokia brand,' said Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs. 'But, to paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of our death are an exaggeration.” 'Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength. 'We have one of the world’s best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere. 'Remember, Nokia started almost 150 years ago with just one paper mill. Over time we have repeatedly and successfully reinvented ourselves. 'We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!' It was first hinted at when Microsoft moved Nokia.com to be hosted on Microsoft’s own site. Each country will gradually see branding changed from Nokia to Microsoft Lumia across various social media accounts, beginning with Nokia France. Microsoft bought Nokia’s phone business in April in a £4.5 billion ($7.2 billion) deal. It’s unclear if the changes will affect existing Microsoft smartphones though, or only ones set to be released in the future. Nokia phones will likely elicit fond memories for many, though, with the Nokia 3310 in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age. First released towards the end of 2000, the phone went on to sell 126 million units world wide and continues to enjoy a cult status. Nokia has been quick to assure customers that the company will live on, albeit no longer in the mobile phone business. In a blog post back in September Barry French, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Corporate Affairs at Nokia said: ‘To paraphrase Mark Twain, “reports of our death are an exaggeration.” ‘Yes, we have sold our mobile phone business to Microsoft. But the Nokia of today is financially robust and has moved from weakness to strength. ‘We have one of the world’s best telecom infrastructure businesses, a global leader in the mapping and location business, a stellar intellectual property portfolio and some of the finest innovation capabilities of any company anywhere.’ He continued: ‘We may not be the same Nokia of several years ago, but we are here, we are strong, and our brand is very much still alive. Not to mention kicking!’ When reached for comment by MailOnline Microsoft was yet to confirm or deny the rumours. The move brings to an end nearly three decades of Nokia phones, which will likely elicit fond memories for many, with the Nokia 3310 (shown) in particular being one of the defining phones at the dawn of the cell phone age. But it's unclear if the change will affect existing phones or just new releases .

"A British warship that served in the Falklands conflict could soon become a floating museum under plans lodged by Hull City Council. Council bosses have spent £540,000 on a bid to bring the recently decommissioned HMS Illustrious to the city. The proposal, part of the council's plans to turn Hull in to an international cruise terminal, is one of two being considered by the Ministry of Defence. Scroll down for video . HMS Illustrious could soon become a floating museum under plans lodged by Hull City Council . A previous bid from Portsmouth City Council to turn the 22,000-tonne ship into a tourist attraction in her home port was rejected. It is not yet known which is the third city to have made a bid. Illustrious, nicknamed Lusty, was decommissioned in July after 32 years’ of active service. It served in Bosnia and the Gulf as well as helping with the aid mission in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan, which claimed more than 6,000 lives. It was decommissioned at a service at Portsmouth Naval Base in July. HMS Illustrious, nicknamed Lusty, was decommissioned in July after 32 years’ of active service . Last year, the ship was involved in efforts to distribute relief in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines . The ship served in the Bosnian, Iraq and Sierra Leone conflicts, and  evacuated Britons during the Lebanon war . Lady Sarah Chatto, daughter of Princess Margaret who launched HMS Illustrious in 1978, was at the event with hundreds of veterans. Negotiations are currently taking place to sell the ship and the Ministry of Defence has insisted that any buyer must keep HMS Illustrious in the UK. Dr Duncan Redford, senior research fellow in modern naval history at the National Museum of the Royal Navy, said it would be interesting to see where it ends up. He said: ‘The ministers in government have made it clear that they would like to see a heritage option in the disposal plans. ‘Illustrious is a big ship - there are going to be a limited number of ports and cities that will have the infrastructure that will be able to support her.’ Hull City Council confirmed it had put in a bid to try to turn HMS Illustrious into a floating maritime museum .

It was only later that she realised the nine carat gold diamond and aquamarine engagement ring had gone from her finger. Today Miss Hardy-Pickering, who is to marry her fiancé Ian Callister next month, pleaded for the ring, worth several hundred pounds, to be returned to her. She said: 'I feel really violated and upset. During and after a seizure I'm at my most vulnerable and someone has taken advantage of that.' Mr Callister, a drain maintenance worker, gave her the ring when he proposed to her last June. She said: 'I was cutting through North Park to get to Bootle train station to meet my mum and go swimming in Formby. 'All I can remember is waking up on the grass by the playground. 'After a seizure I'm confused and out of sorts, and it's very scary. I saw a woman to my right holding my bags: she smiled at me and was really reassuring and asked me if I needed an ambulance. 'But there was a guy to my left who made me feel uncomfortable. He smelt of booze and he was playing with my hand. I could feel my ring going up and down my finger. 'He said I shouldn't worry and he was just making sure my hand was clean. I wanted to tell him to get off but I couldn't because my voice wasn't back yet. North Park, Bootle: Miss Hardy-Pickering was walking through this park when she suffered a seizure . 'I just looked back at the woman and her reassuring eyes, then I looked back at the man and he had gone. 'I only realised my engagement ring was missing when I was on the train afterwards.' She said she didn't believe the woman who helped her was with the man, and wanted to thank her for coming to her aid and ask her for help in tracking the man down. Miss Hardy-Pickering is unable to work due to her epilepsy and had to give up her dream of becoming a teacher because of the condition, which was diagnosed when she was 11. She said: 'I have three different kinds of seizures. I have two daily and one type, the bigger 'tonic-clonic' seizure, sometimes known as grand mal, which this one was. 'It's a degenerative form, so it's only going to get worse.' A Merseyside Police spokesman said: 'This is a despicable crime which has left the victim very upset. 'I would urge anyone with information that could help our enquiry into the incident on Tuesday to get in touch.'","Charlotte Hardy-Pickering, 23, suffered a seizure in North Park, Bootle .

"Amazing new pictures have been released which capture the stories behind the far-flung resting places of Commonwealth soldiers who died during the First World War. The images, which feature in a new photographic book, show war graves and memorials from around the world in what is being billed as photographic tribute to the unsung heroes of the Great War. It also honours the work of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC), which maintains graves at more than 23,000 locations across the world. The Anzac beach cemetery in Gallipoli, Turkey, which also features in the new book. The cemetery has 391 casualties buried there, mainly from the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. The eight month campaign in Gallipoli was fought by Commonwealth and French forces in an attempt to force Turkey out of the war in April 1915. The cemetery was created on the first day of the Anzac landings until the evacuation. There are 369 identified casualties buried there, as well as 33, who have never been identified. The Trekkopje Cemetery in Nambia, where nine Commonwealth soldiers are buried. The cemetery, one of the smallest war grave cemeteries in the world, is situated on railway property adjacent to the now abandoned Trekkopje station in the African country. The nine casualties buried at the cemetery were victims of an attack by German forces on South African railway protection troops on April 26, 1915. The youngest man to die in the attack was 19-year-old William Ernest Anderson, while the oldest was George Stirrit Reid, aged 63. The Guisancourt farm cemetery in France, where 150 Commonwealth soldiers from the First World War are buried. The cemetery was made shortly after the farm in northern France was captured in October 1918 with mainly British casualties buried there. The farm, near the town of Gouy, was secured by the 11th Sherwood Foresters and the 1st/6th Royal Warwicks (25th Division). Of the casualties buried here, 15 are unidentified with all but one falling in October, 1918. The Beaumont-Hamel Memorial Park in the Somme, pictured, in northern France. The town of Beaumont-Hamel was reached in July 1916, but could not be held. It took until November of that year before the town could be secured. The cemetery is the burial site of British casualties, including some whose remains were taken to the site after the Armistice in November 1918. A total of 179 soldiers are buried at the cemetery, with 82 of those buried there still unidentified . In the book, photo journalist Michael St Maur Sheil visited hundreds of sites to bring to life the stories behind them - from a soldier buried alongside his twin, who died the same day, in Saskatchewan in Canada to the memorial by the Tower of London dedicated to 12,000 men lost at sea. Accompanied by a commentary from Peter Francis, from the CWGC, the photos are hoped to give an insight into the sheer number and spread of war graves and the commission’s work in maintaining them. United Kingdom - 781, 858 . Canada - 60, 260 . Australia - 59, 508 . India - 52, 229 . New Zealand - 16, 693 . South Africa - 8,940 . From headstones in the remote Namib Desert to those in the undergrowth of Buff Bay in Jamaica,and from an isolated grave on a tiny island on Loch Shiel to the 72,000 names on the Thiepval Memorial in France, the book aims to commemorate some of history’s greatest and most devastating battles and the men and women who fought and died in them. Mr Sheil said he wanted to 'make each picture count'. He explained: 'I did not want the book to be just a collection of stones and crosses but rather wanted to show the cemeteries within the landscape. 'The CWGC works in an amazing range of climatic and geographical regions so I wanted show that extent and show the landscapes where these men died. 'They were all equal places of death and my job was really to reflect the extent of CWGC work in caring for these graves wherever they may be. 'The handful of men buried at Trekkopje in the Namib desert are just as ‘dead’ and were just as missed by their families as the mass of men in Tyne Cot.' He said the most memorable spot for him was the grave of Donald Pollack, who is buried alongside his twin brother in the remote hills of Saskatchewan. The Osmandwall cemetery in Orkney, off the coast of Scotland, pictured, is the burial site of Royal British Navy members, who died during the early part of the First World War. It was used by the Navy from the outbreak of war in 1914, until 1915 before the creation of Lyness Cemetery elsewhere on Orkney. There are 42 casualties buried there, many of them in the eastern part of the site in a plot marked by a war cross . The St Finnan's Isle Burial Ground is a tiny island in Loch Shiel, near Fort William known locally as the 'Green Isle'. It is surrounded by a ruined chapel and ancient burial sites. There are only two graves, one of which is that of a D. Grant who lived in the tiny hamlet of Dalelia, across the loch from the island and who died in 1916. The other is of Mary MacDonald, a 23-year-old, who died during the Second World War . The burial site is on an island in the middle of Loch Shiel, close to Fort William in Inverness-shire. The cemetery is privately owned and is only accessible by boat.  Author of the new book Michael St Maur Sheil said he wanted to make Mr Sheil 'each picture count' and aims to tell the story behind the cemeteries and about the soldiers and people who are buried there . The Gretna Memorial in Edinburgh's Rosebank Cemetery contains 270 First World War burials. Most died in the Gretna railway disaster, when two trains collided at Quintinshill Junction near Gretna on May 22, 1915, killing 210 officers and men of the 1st/7th Royal Scots on their way to embark for Gallipoli. Victims of the disaster are buried in the Memorial Ground. During the war, the port of Leith in Edinburgh was used by hospital ships from north Russia and about 4,500 officers and men passed through it . More than 180 men who fell during the First World War are buried at Queensferry Cemetery in West Lothian, pictured, with almost all of them serving in the Royal Navy. The headstone was erected by the people of South Queensferry in memory of those died during the Battle of Jutland, a naval battle during 1916, where the British defeated the German forces . 'It is a lovely tranquil spot though the farmstead has long been abandoned. One can only imagine the happy scene as he returned from the war to be greeted by his family and especially his twin brother, Alexander', explained Mr Sheil. 'And one can only imagine the horror and misery for his mother as he fell sick with influenza and infected his brother: how terrible it must have been for her to watch her two sons, born on the same day, dying on the same day. 'The Spanish flu was a vicious killer where you literally drowned in your own bodily fluids and to have this happen in such a remote place, so far from help after the joy of home-coming is such a cruel irony.' The book, For The Fallen by photojournalist Michael St MaurSheil, who visited hundreds of Commonwealth War Graves sites to bring to life the stories behind them . Mr Sheil, who has been documenting battlefields of the Great War since 2006, said he hoped the book would help people realise that the First World War was fought far beyond Europe. He added: 'I would like people to realise that the First World War was exactly that, namely a World War: we tend to think of it just being in France but we ignore its territorial range and the collateral loss of life. 'The loss of life in Africa is estimated to have been over one million people largely through famine and disease and it helped generate the terrible pandemic of Spanish flu. 'I think that cemeteries tend to ‘bend’ history in that it is easy to research and tell the stories of the men in the cemeteries whereas it is often impossible to tell the story of those who survived and never again spoke of their experiences so those who vied are often forgotten about.'","New images show the resting places around the world of Commonwealth soliders who died during World War One .

"A council is putting the final touches to next week’s Bonfire Night celebrations - without a bonfire. Portsmouth City Council's £20,000 fireworks display will still go ahead - but it cannot afford to have a traditional pyre with a Guy Fawkes effigy on top, because ensuring the health and safety of the public would be too expensive. Officials at the local authority in Hampshire claimed a bonfire at the King George V playing fields in the Cosham area of the city next Wednesday would cost £4,600 - which they cannot afford. Aerial view: Council officials claimed a bonfire at the King George V playing fields (pictured) in the Cosham area of Portsmouth next Wednesday would cost £4,600 - which they cannot afford . They said the cost would involve them having to ‘secure’ the area around the bonfire, buy ‘clean’ wood which has no harmful chemicals on it, and re-seed the grass afterwards. Cosham ward councillor Aiden Gray, of the Labour party, said: ‘It is disappointing that the bonfire will be missing from such a popular family event. It is a terrible shame to see the bonfire cut. ‘I know the council has to make cuts but it is such an important event for a lot of people in the city. I am disappointed the decision is not being looked into more.’ He said other organisations such as the local Rotary Club could have been called upon to help fund the event, and then the proceeds from the night given to a charity. Tradition: Portsmouth City Council said  a £20,000 fireworks display at the fields will go ahead (file picture) Mr Gray added: ‘It is such a wonderful event that I think the budget for it needed to be balanced better. They could have had fewer or cheaper fireworks, so they could still have the bonfire. Bonfire Night in Peterlee, County Durham, was cancelled by councillors in May, with the  leader saying this was down to health and safety, and congestion caused by heavy traffic. But other councillors suggested it was due to cost-cutting, with the event expected to have come in with a bill of up to £7,000. And Bonfire Night celebrations last October in Littlehampton, West Sussex, were cancelled due to dangerous weather conditions. The Met Office had warned of winds peaking at 80mph at the time, with the local bonfire society saying they had calling off the event in the interests of public safety. Organisers later said they faced a ‘disgraceful’ torrent of abuse for cancelling the display. In 2011, a Bonfire Night in Birmingham was called off because it was too expensive to put on - but they still had a firework display. The eventual bill for the event was £30,000 rather than the forecast £60,000 with the bonfire. And earlier this month the Bonfire Night in Uplawmoor, East Renfrewshire, was cancelled due to 'time required to gain all appropriate approvals from relevant authorities'. ‘But I don’t think much was said about it when the decision was made. The council could have called on the community to help. They should have been able to empower the community to take it on.' Conservative councillors - who blame the previous Liberal Democrat administration - say scrapping the bonfire will save £4,600 and they hope to find sponsors to reinstate it next year. A Tory minority has been running the council since elections in May. Lib Dem councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson, former leader of the council, said: ‘It was a cross-party decision to cut the bonfire. ‘If some councillors wanted to get community groups involved, they have had a whole year to do it. The amount of money government has cut from council budgets over the years has been very great and we had to try to find ways of saving money to balance the books.’ Current council leader Donna Jones said: ‘When economic times are tough it’s easy to overlook events like this, but the feel-good factor they create is not to be under-estimated. 'We’d consider approaching local businesses for sponsorship and support for the bonfire next year.’ The free-to-watch firework event, which will cost about £19,600, will be funded by the council, along with donations of £1,120 from transport company Stagecoach and local travel campaign My Journey. A Portsmouth City Council spokesman told MailOnline: 'It's not about health and safety. This is a really popular event we put on every year - and the bonfire was the most expensive part.'","Portsmouth City Council says £20,000 fireworks display will still go ahead .

"Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone's lawyers held talks with German prosecutors on Tuesday to try to settle a bribery trial that threatens his grip on the motor sport. Ecclestone, 83, went on trial in Munich in April over allegations he bribed a former German banker as part of the sale of a major stake in the motor sport business eight years ago. If convicted, the British billionaire could face up to 10 years in jail. On trial: Ecclestone went on trial in Munich in April to face allegations of bribery relating to eight years ago . 'Public prosecutors and the defence are discussing the possibility of an agreement,' a spokesman for the German authorities said. Media reports said Ecclestone, who denies wrongdoing, offered to pay German state-owned bank BayernLB 25 million euros ($33.5 million) to help settle the case. There was no immediate comment from his defence team. Prosecutors have rejected a request from the defence to drop proceedings on the grounds of a lack of evidence. Under German law, a settlement payment to a party involved would not necessarily bring a criminal case to an end. The court said in a statement that talks on an agreement could continue, but it also scheduled a further hearing in the case for next Tuesday. Ecclestone is required to attend every session, but hearings are held only a couple of times a week to fit in with his globe-trotting schedule as chief executive of the motor racing business. Ecclestone is accused of channelling $44 million to jailed BayernLB banker Gerhard Gribkowsky to smooth the sale of a major stake in the business by the bank to private equity fund CVC, which became the largest shareholder in Formula One in 2006. F1 supremo: If convicted Ecclestone could face up to 10 years in prison and lose control of Formula One . The prosecution alleges that Ecclestone wanted CVC to take control because this meant he could stay on as chief executive of a business he had been instrumental in building. Gribkowsky had been chief risk officer at state-owned bank BayernLB, which became a major shareholder in Formula One following the collapse of the Kirch media group in 2002. Ecclestone says he paid off Gribkowsky as an 'insurance policy' after the German threatened to make damaging false claims about his tax affairs. He funded the payment with a commission taken from BayernLB after the sale to CVC. Under German law, judges, prosecutors and the defence can agree to dismiss a case or settle it with a light punishment, although terms for such an agreement are strictly defined. Ecclestone has previously offered to pay money back to BayernLB in 2012 to try to prevent the case from going ahead but that proposal was rejected.

"Wales' Francesca Jones finished her competitive rhythmic gymnastics career by winning her first Commonwealth gold and five silver medals at her third and final Games in Glasgow. The 23-year-old claimed gold in the last final of the competition with the ribbon after winning silver medals in the hoop, ball and clubs to follow up Friday's individual all-around and Thursday's team success. Speaking on BBC One ,she said: 'It is beyond words. I have had the most amazing few days, I literally can't believe that we just got to have the Welsh flag flying - it is phenomenal, I am so proud of myself. Golden girl: Francesca Jones receives the first Commonwealth Games gold of her career in her final event . Career high: Welsh gymnast Francesca Jones won gold in the ribbon final on Saturday afternoon . What a way to go: Jones had already won five silver medals before her victory with the ribbon . 'Everybody who supported me to get . here - Sport Wales, Welsh Gymnastics, my coaches - they have been here . every step of the way and I would not be here today without all of . them.' Jones' team-mate Laura Halford added to her all-around bronze by winning the same colour medal in the ball final. Canada's Patricia Bezzoubenko looked set to take a clean sweep of all six golds on offer at the Hydro including in the team event and all-around in what was a dominant performance, only for Jones to see off her challenge after a stunning routine. Jones scored 14.500 with the ribbon but had to wait to find out if the gold was hers after Bezzoubenko, the penultimate gymnast to perform, launched an enquiry into her score of 13.800. The appeal was rejected meaning the gold went to Wales, with Malaysia's Wong Poh San taking silver with 14.250 and Bezzoubenko bronze. Jones, who also won silver with the hoop in the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, was beaten to top spot in the first final of the day by Bezzoubenko, who won her third gold with a routine of 14.800 with the apparatus. Jones took second place just 0.05 marks behind Bezzoubenko with 14.750, while Poh San won bronze with 14.650. Silver lining: Wales rhythmic gymnast won her third medal of the Games on Saturday morning . The Welsh gymnast then added to her silver collection and Halford claimed bronze in the second final of the day with the ball. Bezzoubenko . claimed her fourth gold medal of the event with a routine of 15.250 . ahead of Jones who won her fourth silver with a routine of 14.875, while . team-mate Halford won bronze with 14.550. Jones would have claimed gold but for . the dominance of Bezzoubenko, who was the last gymnast out and . performed an impressive routine which well surpassed her mark in . qualifying. The Canadian won her fifth gold shortly after with a 15.350 score in the clubs final. Bezzoubenko's . dominance could not be halted by Jones, who claimed her fifth silver . behind the 17-year-old after being awarded a mark of 14.800, while . Cyprus' Themida Christodouli took bronze after being the first to . perform a routine which scored 14.300.

Legote . was awarded a mark of 13.100 but Jones was forced to wait to see if she . was destined for the top step on the podium following an enquiry by . Bezzoubenko.

"Louis van Gaal will arrive in Manchester next week as a winner after . heaping more misery on Brazil’s wretched World Cup campaign. Van Gaal . is set to be unveiled at Old Trafford on Thursday with his reputation . enhanced from a rewarding month in South America that saw Holland . qualify from the Group of Death and last night complete an impressive . third-place finish. For Brazil, while they weren’t thrashed quite as . badly as they had been against Germany in Tuesday night’s historic . semi-final, a second successive heavy defeat on home soil was a . devastating end to a campaign which promised so much. VIDEO Scroll down to watch More heartache for Brazil fans as Holland win 3-0 . Celebration: Holland players show off their medals after beating Brazil in third place play-off . Winner: Holland coach Van Gaal (left) receives medal from FIFA president Sepp Blatter . Dream start: Van Persie scores from the spot against Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Cesar in the third minute . Brazil: Cesar 6, Maicon 6, Luiz 5, Thiago Silva 6, Maxwell 6; Gustavo 5 (Fernandinho 45 6), Ramires 6 (Hulk 70  5), Paulinho 5 (Hernanes 57 6); Oscar 7, Willian 6; Jo 5. Booked: Thiago Silva, Oscar .

Booked: Robben, de Guzman. Goals: Van Persie 3, Blind 17, Wijnaldum 90 . Manager: Louis van Gaal 7 . Ref: Djamel Haimoudi  (Algeria) 7 . Att: 68,034 . Manager Felipe Scolari, a World Cup winner in 2002, surely won’t be able to survive this. He’s been accused by 200 million people of picking the wrong players and choosing the wrong tactics. On last night’s evidence in Brasilia, they aren’t all be wrong. Holland carried on where Germany left off with two goals in the opening 17 minutes – both the result of blunders from Brazilian centre-backs Thiago Silva and David Luiz. The South Americans huffed and puffed after that without ever suggesting . they had the quality to launch a fightback and Georgino Wijnaldum . completed the humiliation in injury-time. Scolari made six changes . from the team humiliated by Germany for a third-place play-off which for . once carried some meaning. Van Gaal stuck with his big guns Arjen . Robben and Robin van Persie though Wesley Sneijder didn’t last beyond . the warm-up after tweaking a hamstring and had to be replaced by . Jonathan de Guzman of Swansea City. Cracker: Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar fails to save penalty from Robin van Persie in third minute . Joy: Robin van Persie celebrates with team-mate Dirk Kuyt (up) after scoring the opening goal . Any hope among supporters in . Brazil’s capital city that their team could restore national pride after . the infamous 7-1 beating by Germany lasted less than three minutes. Silva, . who missed the semi-final debacle through suspension, wasn’t strong . enough to stop van Persie from turning midway in the Brazilian half and . releasing Robben. As the Bayern forward sped towards the penalty . area, Silva gave a despairing tug at the back of his shirt. The . connection probably happened just outside the penalty area but Robben . fell inside, and referee Djamel Halmoudi awarded a penalty that van . Persie converted high and hard. Clinical: Holland defender Daley Blind lashes the ball into the net for second goal against Brazil . The only consolation for Brazil was . that Silva escaped with just a yellow card when he’d clearly denied . Robben a goalscoring opportunity. By 17 minutes, Brazil had conceded again leading to fears of another humiliating drubbing. Luiz . was again the fall-guy, heading a clearance straight to Daley Blind who . had time to take two touches to control the ball with his left foot and . then dispatch a finish with his right into the roof of the net past . Julio Cesar. All together now: Daley Blind (second left) celebrates scoring Holland's second goal against Brazil . Brazil looked shellshocked but while Germany were hungry . for more goals on Tuesday night, the Dutch were happy to sit back until . they got opportunities to hit the hosts on the counter-attack. Oscar . started to see more of the ball and was unlucky that his whipped-in . free-kick didn’t get a decisive touch off Chelsea team-mate Willian or . Jo. One solo run and shot by Oscar was saved by Jasper Cillessen – Brazil’s only effort on target in the entire first half. Blow: Holland defender Daley Blind was injured in challenge on Brazil's Oscar (left) Even . in low gear, Holland seemed more likely to score. Van Persie had a low . shot saved by Julio Cesar and when the Dutch broke, they met little . resistance from a woeful Brazilian midfield. Scolari, whose job looks . certain end sooner rather than later, made a change at the interval . with Manchester City’s Fernandinho replacing Luis Gustavo. Gustavo’s . only contribution of the opening 45 minutes had been to leave Dirk Kuyt . with a nasty gash on the back of his head with a wayward arm. Agony: Injured defender Daley Blind is carried off on a stretcher . But it . didn’t improve much for Brazil after half-time. The harder poor Luiz . tried, the worse it got for him as he gave the ball away with . regularity. The scorer of an incredible free-kick against Colombia . couldn’t beat Cillessen with a relatively tame effort when given a . shooting chance from 25 yards. Jose Mourinho must be thinking he’s a genius for selling the shaggy-haired defender for £40million before the World Cup. Clincher: Holland midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum seals victory with injury-time strike . His . former Chelsea team-mate Oscar didn’t fare much better. He was booked . for diving when he ran into Blind and then somersaulted in the air . looking for a penalty.  Poor Blind had to be carried off with a hurt . knee as a result of the coming-together and Daryl Janmaat replaced him . for the last 20 minutes. By the time Scolari introduced Hulk for the latter stages, you knew he and the entire nation were desperate. It . was no surprise when the muscular forward got himself into a good . shooting position and then took a wild swipe at the ball to send it . wide. Down and out: Georginio Wijnaldum scored the 10th goal against Brazil in two games - a new low . Van Gaal was angry that Robben – who admitted diving earlier in the tournament – had two decent penalty appeals turned down. But . ultimately, it didn’t matter. In fact, Janmaat crossed for Wijaldum to . make it 3-0 and van Gaal was able to send on third-choice goalkeeper . Michel Vorm to ensure all 23 of his players in Brazil had tasted some . action - a nice touch. The contrast between the relaxed way Holland’s . players found space and knocked the ball around compared to the . hypertension in Brazil’s game was evident. If van Gaal can replicate it at Old Trafford, the fallen champions will be more than happy.

"Being accused of brutally murdering her college roommate apparently hasn't impacted Amanda Knox's love life, as the 27-year-old was spotted out this weekend with a new boyfriend in New York. Knox was last known living in Seattle with her classical guitarist boyfriend James Terrano, but it appears she has moved on to another musician - an aspiring rocker named Colin Sutherland, 27. The new couple were pictured passionately kissing on the beach and on the boardwalk during a day-trip to Coney Island, and holding hands while shopping vintage stores with a female friend in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick. Knox and Terrano were last pictured together in July, when she was seen handing over $100 in cash to her boyfriend, in an emotional meeting in which she both sobbed and laughed.

A LinkedIn profile for Sutherland - who goes by the name 'Thunderstrike after the Marvel comic-book character - says he studied French at Sarah Lawrence and lives in Brooklyn. It's unclear if Knox has moved to New York to be with her new man, or if she was just visiting. She was set to graduate from the University of Washington this past June with a degree in creative writing.

Close: Knox and her new boyfriend appeared comfortable together, as they held hands walking in Brooklyn . Alone time: Knox spent some time away from her new boyfriend when she was pictured shopping at vintage store Urban Jungle in Bushwick . These new pictures are surfacing just one year after Knox was pictured hugging  her 30-year-old ex-boyfriend, Italian Raffaelle Sollecito, on another trip to the Big Apple. The two have since been re-convicted in the murder case of British student Meredith Kercher, who was found dead in 2007 at the age of 21 in the apartment she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy. Sollecito and Knox were initially found guilty in Kercher's death but cleared on appeal in 2011, when Knox returned to her Washington state hometown. However, the case was brought up again last year and the two found guilty once more. The former couple are currently awaiting an Italian appeal court's decision whether to stand by the decision or overturn it. If the appeal court confirms the conviction, she may be called back to Italy to face prison time but that's only if the U.S. agrees to extradite her. Was it a break up? Knox was last known to be dating classical guitarist James Terrano, who she reportedly lived with in Seattle, Washington. They were last pictured together in July (above), when Knox was seen handing over $100 in cash to Terrano, before sobbing and then laughing in a clearly emotional meeting . Guilty? Knox and Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito (pictured together, left) were initially found guilty in the 2007 murder of Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher (right). They were released in 2011 on appeal, when Knox returned to the U.S. However, the two were re-convicted this year when the case was brought up again .","The 27-year-old was seen this weekend holding hands and kissing musician Colin Sutherland on the beach in Coney Island .

"A man has landed an 11-foot, 809-pound Mako shark - using a bow and arrow. Jeff Thomason, host of hunting show Predator Pursuit, only had one shot to strike the record-sized fish. He spent 30 minutes coaxing it towards his boat off the coast of Los Angeles, California, before opening fire. World record: Jeff Thomason proudly posed with the Mako shark and the bow he used to land it last month . Finally, he took aim and struck the shark through the back. Five crew members were needed to haul the fish back to shore. And after weighing it, Thomason learned he had broken a bowfishing world record by 300 pounds. He then donated 400 pounds of the meat to a homeless shelter nearby. 'It was one of those days when everything went right,' the Texan angler told Lone Star Outdoor News of the event on August 27. Mako sharks are notoriously hard to catch as they are the fastest sharks in the world, with a top swimming speed of 60mph and an average of 35mph. Efforts: It took five crew members 30 minutes to coax the fish to the boat off the shore of Los Angeles . They are known to viciously attack people and animals. Bowfishing is an ancient practice dating back to the Filipino Negritos, who shot freshwater fish with barbed arrows from canoes. Now, anglers used specialized archery equipment to catch their targets. The complex practise requires fishermen to be within feet of the selected fish, and many anglers spend years studying the best angle to shoot from - and where to aim. Professional: Thomason is known for his hunting as he presents the cable show Predator Pursuit . Excursions: The Texan angler has made several trips from his home to the California shore to fish . 'They've got to be about three feet from the boat to get the arrow to stick, so we threw a fish on a line and teased him to the boat,' Thomason told Lone Star Outdoor News. 'I try and shoot for the top of the back. As soon as the arrow hit, all hell broke loose. 'We freaked out because I spined him and we thought he might sink.' The largest Mako shark ever caught weighed 1,221 pounds and was landed using a rod and reel off the coast of Massachusetts in 2001.","Jeff Thomason spent 30 minutes coaxing the Mako shark to his boat .

"Rocker Jon Bon Jovi is part of a Toronto group that has submitted paperwork expressing interest in buying the Buffalo Bills. It is unclear if the group would eventually want to move the NFL team to Toronto, but the franchise is on the market after Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson died in March. An Associated Press source confirmed that Bon Jovi discussed his interests during a restaurant meeting last month with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. In line: Jon Bon Jovi is part of a Toronto group eager to buy the Buffalo Bills . Still rocking: Bon Jovi, pictured with wife Dorothea Hurley, has submitted paperwork regarding Buffalo Bills . The Bills most recently were valued by Forbes at $870million. They are projected to be sold for at least $1billion, partly because NFL teams rarely go on the market. The team is essentially locked into playing at Ralph Wilson Stadium through the 2019 season because of a strict nonrelocation clause included in a 10-year lease agreement reached with the state and county in December 2012. The Bills would incur a $400m penalty by even broaching the prospect of moving during the lease’s term. There is a one-time exception that would allow the Bills to break the lease for just under $28.4m in 2020. The group also includes Larry Tanenbaum and the Rogers family. Tanenbaum is chairman of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which controls the NHL’s Maple Leafs and NBA’s Raptors. The Rogers family includes Edward Rogers, who is deputy chairman of Rogers, the Toronto communications giant. The group is on a list of prospective buyers who have submitted a nondisclosure agreement form to Morgan Stanley, the banking firm overseeing the Bills sale. The Toronto group has retained the Goldman Sachs banking firm to assist in the bid. Bon Jovi previously expressed interest in owning an NFL franchise but never specifically mentioned the Bills. This is the first real indication linking him to Tanenbaum and Rogers. Run: The Bills are on the market after Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson unfortunately died in March . Kicking off: The Bills are projected to be sold for at least $1BILLION because NFL teams rarely go on sale .

"Police have found 12 suspected illegal immigrants in the back of a refrigerated lorry after receiving a panicked 999 call from one of them. Officers from the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) stopped the HGV after receiving a call from a man in the back just before 9am. The call was traced to a lorry travelling northbound on the M6 and it was stopped between Hilton Park services and junction 10a near Birmingham. Scroll down for video . Police found 12 suspected illegal immigrants in the back of a refrigerated lorry on the M6 (pictured) after receiving a panicked 999 call from one of them . A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'Just before 9am a distressed call was received from a man travelling in the back of a refrigerated lorry on the M6 northbound. 'He was requesting urgent assistance for himself and his companions. 'As a result of the information received officers from the Central Motorway Police Group (CMPG) co-ordinated a regional response, which included officers from Staffordshire Police, West Midlands Police and Highways Agency colleagues. 'CMPG officers were able to successfully stop the lorry between Hilton services and J10a. 'The 12 individuals, located within the vehicle, are now being seen by colleagues from the ambulance service should they require medical attention, and where appropriate will be taken into custody. 'We will now be working with our colleagues in immigration and border control to establish the exact circumstances of how these individuals came to be in the back of the lorry.' Both sides of the motorway were closed for two hours while police and ambulance crews examined the people in the back of the lorry. It is not yet clear where the lorry had been travelling from or whether it had crossed the Channel to Britain. Last month, thirteen suspected illegal immigrants from Ethiopia were spotted running from the back of a lorry on another busy motorway. There are currently around 2000 migrants sleeping rough in the French port of Calais as they try and get aboard ferries to Britain (file picture) Rush-hour traffic had to be slowed between junctions 12 and 13 of the M25 in Surrey as police dealt with the incident. The 13 men and women were later found walking along the motorway and were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences. In the same month a woman returned to her home in Elvington, near Dover after a trip to Tesco to find an illegal immigrant sitting in her driveway. There are currently around 2000 migrants sleeping rough in the French port of Calais as they try to get aboard ferries to Britain. Over the summer, Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart threatened to close the docks following an attempt by scores of mainly Eritreans and Sudanese to storm a ferry. Ms Bouchart said she wanted ‘far more help from the British government’ to deal with people attempting to cross the Channel illegally. The number of migrants in Calais has increased sharply in the past few months, and hundreds more are also camping out in other Channel ports including Dunkirk and Cherbourg. All play a nightly game of cat-and-mouse with the police as they attempt to break into lorries in an attempt to get to the UK. The migrants are mainly from Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea, and have travelled from north Africa to mainland Europe, usually through Italy.","Police stopped the refrigerated lorry after call from someone inside vehicle .

"Now here’s a creepy bit of news: employers are thinking outside the box, going beyond offering staff the company car, bonus scheme, health insurance and workplace gym. The offer — don’t all rush now, girls! — is of a bout of invasive surgery and a cold-store for your hopes of a future family. Deep in Silicon Valley, where the best and worst ideas come from, we hear word that Facebook and Apple are offering female employees a hideous new perk. Scroll down for video . Companies are going beyond offering staff a company car and now keeping female employees eggs frozen . ‘Harvest’ your unused ova in your 20s or 30s, and delay motherhood until after your fastest-moving career years. The company will keep the eggs frozen for you and pay the $20,000-odd medical bill for hoicking them out and storing them. Then, later on, you can draw them out, like a pension, and have a go at getting pregnant. How’s that for a deal? Terrible, I’d say. Big, ruthless companies always did have a knack for sounding generous while snapping leg-irons on their employees. Even lavishly gilded handcuffs can be man-traps — or, in this case, woman-traps. It is not difficult to work out that the really cold thing in this equation is the heart of the corporate boss. It seems that women, the pesky critters, are now leaving high-tech companies at twice the rate of men. Presumably (though this may not have occurred to the management), this is because the intensity of the business is hostile to any kind of decent human family life. Women working for Facebook can receive £12,500 a time for freezing their eggs so they work longer . One spokesman for a company offering this new service says it ‘cares deeply about our employees and their families’ and simply desires to ‘empower women to do the best work of their lives’. Well, one might diffidently suggest that there are other ways in which you can do this empowering thing. Embrace flexibility, job-shares, distance-working, creches. Set up your own nursery and primary school on site — you’re certainly rich enough! Or just take a more benign attitude to women coming back after a five-year maternity break, and be sure to provide technical catch-up and mentoring during that break. These cutting-edge companies could pioneer fantastic ways of keeping mothers included in the workforce without ruining their lives or playing God with their biology and life plan. But no: with absurdly touching faith in a newish technology, they decide to set up an in-house cryopreservation and egg-storage programme, so they can keep every young woman’s nose to the grindstone, developing apps or networked solar-powered cyber-baseball-caps or whatever. And then, once the dear old thing is slowing down a bit, streaking past 40, creaking a little, running out of cool, young ideas — just hand over the freezer-bags and send her hobbling off down the mommy-track. The technology for bringing forth pregnancies from frozen female eggs is indeed remarkable. It was developed to help women with cancer, whose reproductive kit was about to be blasted by chemo and radiotherapy. That was a merciful idea, but even so it has never been a simple, pat answer. One gung-ho American doctor is quoted as saying it is a ‘tried and true’ method, and that wealthy parents sometimes pay for their ambitious daughters to have their eggs frozen for distant future use. The eggs will be put in deep freeze so women can continue their careers, according to the technology giants . But think about it: the process begins with an operation, and probably hormone treatment. And then, years later, it isn’t just a matter of getting these ancient eggs out and hatching a baby. It involves more hormones and in-vitro fertilisation, which itself has a limited success rate (ah, the years, the tears we have all seen friends enduring under this regime!). And using pre-frozen eggs has an even lower success rate, according to latest figures — barely 25 per cent, if you’re lucky. For any company to imply otherwise, when dealing with young, ambitious employees eager for promotion, is disingenuous. If not bordering on downright wicked. Imagine a talented employee in her late-20s, looking at men powering ahead through their fourth decade, working stupid hours, giving everything to the company. She wonders whether she has to make a choice between career advancement and having babies of her own. She’s in a quandary. Her boss is holding out tempting possibilities. And here’s a company leaflet with some doctor, high on technology, blithely suggesting that she can delay the baby thing for as long as she likes, and have it all. Might she be tempted? One spokesman for a company offering the new service says it ‘cares deeply about our employees and their families’ and simply desires to ‘empower women to do the best work of their lives’ Or, indeed, terrified. For — more sinisterly — who can guarantee that opting for the egg-freezing ‘perk’ will not become an unofficial prerequisite for a young woman who hopes for promotion? Will the firm’s Welfare Department keep the list of freezers secret from Human Resources? Or will there be an unspoken nod given to promotion of the egg-storer — ‘great girl, very dedicated’ — and an indifferent head-shake directed at those who are thought likely to get pregnant naturally? Naturally! Because it is a natural thing, an ancient thing, this desire to give birth at the moment when it feels emotionally and physically right, even if not professionally convenient. Of course, fertility technology — for those who truly need it — is marvellous, life-enhancing, blessed. But never forget what a lovely thing it is to produce a child as a result of making love, of a night with a trusted partner in the drowsy or passionate warmth of your own bed, at home. Who would choose, deliberately and in full health, to give this up in favour of operations, anxiety, dependence on white coats and sterile laboratories? To break, unnecessarily, the link with thousands of years of our foremothers who — in the privacy of their own love — made new life and then confided its beginnings to their men? Using pre-frozen eggs has a low success rate, according to latest figures — barely 25 per cent, if you’re lucky . So no, it’s not a perk. It’s creepy, and corporate, and dry-hearted, and impractical: a particular kind of silliness which, if I may be sexist for a moment, is quintessentially male. Schoolboy sci-fi stuff. It’s also another example of something familiar in less exotic places and trades: the attitude of big business that hey, even if these damn women insist on joining the party, even if you really do need their talents, they’ve gotta toe the line, fit the template. The little ladies, God bless ’em, must be ruthlessly fitted into a pattern and culture which has been set over decades by a workforce of males. And, what is more, those males are culturally unaccustomed to paying much attention to their children, or indeed to their own mental health and human values. Sunrise industries? Some hope. Sounds as though Apple and Facebook are embracing the old, musty principles of the dark ages.","Employers in Silicon Valley are going beyond offering staff company car .

"A trip to Santa Maria di Castellabate requires willpower. Tottering along Italy's vertiginous Amalfi Coast, temptation lurks at every turn. Starry Positano, ravishing Ravello and that old favourite Sorrento are all en route. A gentle version of the seaside: Santa Maria di Castellabate sits on Italy's Cilento Coast in charming style . We resist the siren calls - and our reward is the Cilento coast. This is one of the more secluded parts of Campania and all the better for it. Porcelain sandy beaches, clear waters (Positano boasts neither of these), meals for the price of an Amalfi sundowner, no American tourists - and our very own castle. Well, a palazzo - a 17th-century grand dame called Palazzo Belmonte, perched on the shoreline of Santa Maria Castellabate. Once favoured by the kings of Italy and Spain as a hunting lodge where they took pot-shots at wild boar and quail, it's also the home and ancestral seat of the Prince of Belmonte. He is an affable gentleman who welcomes guests with all the effortless style you'd expect from an Italian aristo. He has quite a bloodline, with three popes, three saints and one King of Sicily in the family tree. The exquisite palazzo does his pedigree justice. Sweeping gravel drive, grand stone arched entrance and there you are in the courtyard of the original palace, now part of the hotel, where swags of jasmine, honeysuckle and roses scent the air. Following a theme: Two great Italian loves - religion and sunbathing - are visible on the town's lovely beach . A walk through the substantial gardens brings you to a wooden door leading to the hotel's own beach, which is as pristine as the Caribbean. Pompeii and all its ashy wonders can be admired if you're happy to hurtle back up the winding A3 motorway. Closer to Castellabate are the ruins of Paestum, a Graeco-Roman city dating back to the 7th century BC. It was abandoned, not because of volcanic explosions, but thanks to a spate of malarial outbreaks which saw off many of its residents. Its wonders were only discovered some 400 years ago when the thick undergrowth concealing it was hacked away, revealing Doric Greek temples. Little wonder Goethe, Shelley, Hemingway and other literary greats sought inspiration here. Dinners out are lengthy affairs, with waiters serving endless plates of oily aubergines and wood-fired pizzas piled with mozzarella. Even a fish and chip supper has an Italian flourish. Ruined, but still ravishing: The remnants of the ancient city of Paestum are just as majestic as Pompeii . The most popular restaurant in Santa Maria Castellabate is the small takeaway which serves generous paper cups of fresh fried seafood through a glass hatch overlooking the beach, where the locals cheer on football-playing teenagers thrashing around on a pitch carved from the sand each evening. This modest place is a tonic to the glamour of the Amalfi coast. A word of warning though - U.S. vice-president Joe Biden stayed recently, so it might not be too long before his fellow countrymen follow suit. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Naples from Gatwick from £78 return. CV Villas (0207 563 7902, www.cvvillas.com) offers a seven-night stay in a double room at the Palazzo Belmonte from £550 per person, B&B.","Less known than the Amalfi Coast, the Cilento Coast is Italy at its best .

"Mexican hitmen allegedly killed more than a dozen students who went missing last month after a clash with corrupt local police, then buried them in a recently-discovered mass grave. State prosecutors in the country said a man they arrested told how 17 of the missing youths were rounded up and killed, then thrown in pits, where badly charred remains have now been unearthed. Authorities said that the man told them how the students, who went missing after a violent clash on September 26, were marched to the site on the outskirts of Iguala, Guerrero state before their deaths. Scroll down for video . Hunt: A forensic investigator works at the site of the mass graves, near Iguala in Mexico . The bodies found by authorities are so damaged that they could not be identified. All that is left are bones and small pieces of flesh. Investigators found 28 bodies there, though local officials say as many as 34 were buried across six separate pits. It could be days before the identities of the dead are known for sure. Security officials said earlier they believed the victims . had been driven to the end of the track, walked up the hillside, . executed and buried in six graves. As investigators worked at the site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the Guerrero state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice. 'You took them alive, we want them returned alive,' read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco. Victims: The above poster shows the 43 missing students and offers a reward for their recovery . Remote spot: Officers stand watch near the site of the mass grave on the outskirts of Iguala in Mexico . Mass grave: The roughly 30 bodies in the grave are believed to belong the group of 43  missing students . Jesus Lopez, an Acapulco street vendor whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, said he hoped the remains weren't those of the students. Other relatives 'told us that (the remains) were burned, and that they couldn't be the kids,' Lopez said. 'But we're really nervous.' Mexico's National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible 'serious human rights abuses,' such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police. Police infiltrated by local drug cartels are suspected of . abducting some of the students, a local security official said, . speaking on condition of anonymity. One security official said: 'You really can't call them police'. He added that suspected gang members had told . investigators that police had handed over the students to the . people who killed them, who belonged to the gang.

"The desperate hunt for missing UVA student Hannah Graham took an astonishing turn on Monday when it was revealed police are linking the case to that of the notorious abduction, rape and murder of student Morgan Harrington. Morgan, 20, vanished after she was last seen trying to hitch a lift after a Metallica concert in Charlottesville in 2009. She is one of five women - including Hannah - who have disappeared along the Route 29 corridor that runs through Virginia, in the last five years. Of the five women, only the remains of Morgan have been found. Scroll down for video . Big break: Police said on Monday that there is a forensic link between the rape and murder of Morgan Harrington, 20, in 2009 and the disappearance of Hannah Graham, 18 on September 13 . Missing on Route 29: Five women have gone missing in and around Charlottesville, Virginia, just a few minutes' drive from the same highway in the last five years. The body of just one has been found so far . Tragedy: Morgan Harrington, 20 (left), vanished from UVA's John Paul Jones Arena while attending a Metallica concert in October 2009. Alexis Murphy, 17 (right), was last seen at a gas station in Lovingston in August 2013 . Mystery: DaShad Laquinn Smith, 19 (left), has not been seen since November 2012. Samantha Ann Clarke, 19 (right) vanished after leaving her home in Orange in September 2010 . The disappearances, with that of Morgan being the most high profile, have for years fueled speculation of a serial killer on the loose in Virginia. Now, the arrest of Jesse Matthew, 32, over the abduction of Hannah has provided a 'forensic link' to the Harrington case. It will no doubt now raise the hopes - rightly or wrongly - of the families of the other women who vanished. Matthew has been charged with abduction and intent to defile Hannah. He has yet to enter a plea. Matthew has not been charged in any other case. Police did not specify the nature of the link between the cases. Before Matthew was arrested Morgan's mother, Gil, told MailOnline that the worry of not knowing is the hardest to bear. 'The missing time is the hardest. You have no answers and you fill in the blanks in a horrible way. 'It's much worse having a missing daughter than knowing she is dead. There are rituals for death. There are no cards for ""sorry about your missing child"". You go from hope to despair. It's hideous. 'My heart goes out to Hannah's family.' Mrs Harrington suffered months of despair after Morgan disappeared from UVA in October 2009 while attending a Metallica concert. She left alone and witnesses claim a woman fitting her description was seen hitchhiking at a bridge near the concert venue. A day after her disappearance, her purse and cellphone - with the batteries removed - were found at the arena. Her body was not recovered until three months later, hidden at a remote farm. She had been raped before she was murdered. Hope: Gil Harrington, the mother of murdered Morgan Harrington, told MailOnline: 'I hope and pray that Hannah is somewhere and will come walking through the door with a sheepish look on her face any moment now. But my logic tells me that is unlikely to happen' Link: Jesse Matthew is taken off a private plane after being found in Galveston, Texas, where he fled to . Police would later reveal that a Pantera t-shirt discovered in November 2009 at an apartment over a mile from the arena also belonged to Morgan. Her skeletal remains were found in January 2010 on a farm in Albemarle County - around four miles away from where she disappeared. Mrs Harrington, 57, from Roanake added: 'I hope and pray that Hannah is somewhere and is recoverable and will come walking through the door with a sheepish look on her face any moment now. 'That's my hope. But my logic tells me that is unlikely to happen. I'm really holding out hope that we can have a good outcome.' Mrs Harrington has launched a charity in her daughter's honor called Help Save The Next Girl to educate young women of the dangers of predatory men. She has previously said that a serial killer was responsible for Morgan's murder. Mrs Harrington said: 'My own daughter was abducted in the area that Hannah went missing. Morgan was abducted and murdered in Charlottesville in 2009. 'We know that the person involved with Morgan's case was a serial offender. We know that because he was involved with a previous abduction and rape in 2005.' Morgan's case gained widespread national coverage, largely down to her mother's tireless campaigning. The other women to go missing included Samantha Ann Clarke, 19. She disappeared after leaving her home in nearby Orange County in September 2010. Her body has not been found. Sketch: The police released the sketch of Morgan's attacker, left, in 2010. Right is Matthew without dreadlocks . Driver: Matthew used to work as a taxi driver and a source told MailOnline that he used to give girls free rides . DaShad Laquinn Smith, 19, disappeared in Charlottesville in November 2012. Her whereabouts remain a mystery. Alexis Murphy, 17, disappeared after leaving her home in Shipman, Virginia, in August 2013. This May, Randolph Taylor, 48, was convicted of her abduction and murder in January although her body has never been found. Another two young women, Alicia Showalter Reynolds, 25, and Anne Carolyn McDaniel, 20, were abducted and murdered in 1996 along the same corridor. On Monday, Virginia State Police said: 'For the past give year, the Virginia State Police has been aggressively pursuing the investigation into the disappearance and death of 20-year-old Morgan D Harrington of Roanoke, VA. ‘Last week the arrest of Jesse L Matthew, 32, of Charlottesville, Virginia, provided a significant break in this case with a new forensic link for state police investigators to pursue. ‘There is still a great deal of work to be done in regards to this investigation and we appreciate the public’s patience as we move forward.’ Morgan's case was also linked by DNA to the rape of a 26-year-old woman in Fairfax, Virginia in September 2005. The woman was lucky to escape with her life. She was walking along a residential street after dark when a man grabbed her from behind and forced her into a nearby wood. He sexually assaulted her but he fled after being startled by a passerby. The victim was rushed to hospital for treatment for several injuries. Hope: Hannah's parents, Susan and john, and brother James, are clinging on to hope they will find her alive. But they have said they do fear 'foul play' She described her attacker as black in his mid-20’s and with a heavy build, to police and it led to a police sketch being released of the attacker - by then, also thought to be Morgan's attacker. Meanwhile, MailOnline revealed last week that Matthew was named as a suspect of an alleged rape at Liberty University, the acclaimed Christian college, in Lynchburg, Virginia. He was not arrested or charged due to a lack of sufficient evidence. But he was expelled.","Police today claimed a forensic link between the case of Hannah Graham and Morgan Harrington, 20, who vanished at a concert in 2009 .
Jesse Matthew has been charged with the abduction of Hannah, 18, who disappeared in the early hours of September 13 in Charlottesville, Virginia .
Three other women have vanished just a few minutes' drive from the main highway through the city between 2009 and 2014 .
The remains of three have never been found and just one killer convicted .
Morgan's case has also been linked to the rape of a woman, 26, in Fairfax .
Morgan's mother, Gil, said she believes that Morgan was murdered by a serial killer but police insist that Hannah's disappearance is strictly a missing persons case at this stage .

"Tyson Fury is adamant he will not step foot in the same ring as British heavyweight rival Dereck Chisora in future after the Londoner pulled out of their scheduled fight this Saturday. The duo were set to settle their differences at the Phones 4 U Arena in Manchester this weekend, but Chisora pulled out of the rematch, which was billed as a final eliminator for the WBO title, on Monday. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tyson Fury's most volatile moments with Dereck Chisora . Stand in: Tyson Fury (left) will face Alexander Ustinov on Saturday after British rival Dereck Chisora pulled out . While promoter Frank Warren insists Fury is contractually locked in to a rearranged date in October, the 6ft 9in Manchester fighter insists he wants to face WBC champion Bermane Stiverne if he gets past Chisora's stand-in opponent Alexander Ustinov. 'As far as I'm concerned Dereck Chisora is history - finished,' Fury, who also saw David Haye twice pull out of a fight with him last year due to separate injuries, said. 'After I've done with this lummox in front of me (Ustinov) I want Bermane Stiverne for the WBC title. Confident: Tyson Fury (left) has already set his sights on who will face after Saturday's bout with Ustinov . 'I'm not interested in Dereck Chisora, he ain't got enough credibility to lace my boots up, never mind step in the same ring. He's a s***house who dropped his b******s in training. 'Chisora is another David Haye - a wannabe. A wannabe Tyson Fury opponent in hindsight who realises the daunting task ahead and decides I'll live to fight another day rather than get annihilated. 'I want to fight real fighters who want to fight. I started in a career in boxing to be involved in good fights, for people to say ""yes (he) fought good fighters and didn't pick and choose"".' Ustinov is a much different proposition to Chisora, standing seven inches taller, at 6ft 8in, and some four stones heavier. More importantly, he has lost only once in his 29 fights to date, and that came against Kubrat Pulev in September 2012 in an IBF eliminator bout. However, Fury (22-0, 16KOs) says he had no intention of disappointing the paying fans and is keen to fight on Saturday, even if it comes at a great risk to his unbeaten record. Dangerous: Ustinov has both the reach and power and has lost just one of his 29 fights . 'I'm not about to let people down especially in my home town, I don't care if he (Frank Warren) brought King Kong to me on Saturday night I was going to fight,' said Fury. 'Most people would have got a journeyman to fight, I don't do that. This guy is rated number 10 in the world by two organisations, he's not a pushover. 'I've had no sparring and no preparation. It's a real 50/50 fight, it's about who gets who out of there. Injury: Dereck Chisora (left) pulled out of the rematch after injuring his hand . 'People like Dereck Chisora and David Haye are conning people, they're out to con the public and the British Boxing Board of Control say I'm bad for boxing! 'When I say I'm going to fight, I fight. I would fight with no eyes. There was nothing going to keep me out of that ring on Saturday. 'For him (Chisora) to have another little injury and pull out is absolutely pathetic. It's a disgrace to the world of heavyweight boxing.'","Fury and Chisora were due to meet in Manchester on Saturday .

"Tick, tock the wait goes on for Fernando Torres. Much like his career since Chelsea spent all that money, the transfer window that promised something is passing by. The interest is there. Atletico Madrid and Monaco both want to invest in a shadow, but evidently not enough to meet Chelsea’s valuation and Torres’ expectations for wages. In the circumstances, both seem high. It has passed the point of becoming a dark comedy, this decline of one of the best strikers to play in the Premier League. Loss of form is one thing, Jose Mourinho’s suggestion last season that he wasn’t a ‘real striker’ quite another. Public humiliation by virtue of his performances, cutting words from his manager. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fernando Torres' dreadful two-yard miss in a Chelsea friendly . Place on the bench: Fernando Torres could find himself at the back of the pecking order for Chelsea . Contrast: Torres was one of the Premier League's most feared strikers in red but has struggled since his move . One step behind: Torres battles with Ljubljana's Andraz Sporar for the ball during Sunday's pre season friendly . Head in hands moment: Torres reacts to one of many missed chances in a Chelsea shirt . Honours (all with Chelsea): FA Cup (2012), Champions League (2012), Europa League (2013). Now this. Face buried in the turf, a replay of an astonishing miss on loop and soon to be viral. Dom Solanke, a prolific 16-year-old striker from the academy, has head in hands as he processes what he’s just seen. In their report of Chelsea’s 2-1 win over Olimpija Ljubljana on Sunday, the club’s official website described the preceding moment. It read: ‘Excellent work down the left from the overlapping Nathan Ake created an easy opening for Torres but, close to the goal-line, he could only chest his effort up and over the bar.’ It was an accurate review, but kind for the understandable compassion - he is a Chelsea player and the owner’s indulgence. But it was a dreadful, incomprehensible miss, worse than the open goal he failed to find after rounding David de Gea at Old Trafford in September 2011. That terrible miscue came after he had timed a run between two centre halves and fooled the goalkeeper with a stepover. That such a miss happened on the afternoon he scored his first of the season only serves to suggest this union between man and club was cursed from the start. Easy target: Torres missed another sitter for Chelsea, and was subject to criticism on social media . Cross: Nathan Ake put the ball on a plate for Torres inside the six yard box . Unorthodox: Torres then attempted to chest the ball into the goal from two yards . Not again: The ball went flying over the bar as Torres slumped to the floor in despair . Three years on, having contributed a bit (his goal away at Barcelona in 2012 was a wonderful moment) and blushed a lot, his miss in Slovenia was worse. It was two yards out. Opting to use his chest at that height was a bizarre; that he could get it over the bar with any body part from so close almost impressive. What has happened to him? There are always explanations with Torres. It’s the confidence thing, or the injuries and what they have done to his acceleration. Expectations. Truth in all, no doubt. But whatever storm is going on in his mind and body, the sights are uncomfortable, not least because in the passage of three-and-a-half years some, regrettably, might just have forgotten what a good player he was. Huge highlight: Torres rounds Victor Valdes in the Nou Camp to score the goal that sealed a famous win . Written in the stars: Torres' goal that sealed Chelsea's passage to the Champions League final was special . VIDEO Drogba returns to Chelsea . Raw emotion: Didier Drogba and Torres embrace on the pitch after Chelsea's Champions League triumph . Solanke was nine at the start of the 2007-08 season, when Torres scored 33 goals in 46 games and was voted the third best player in the world. It is a pleasant irony, a happy compensation for the player, that in his weakest years as a professional he has added the European Championship, Champions League, FA Cup and Europa League to the World Cup and European Championship he’d already won. Silverware winner: Torres played a key role in Chelsea's Europa League win including a goal in the final . Spanish selection: Juan Mata and Torres hold the FA Cup, one of three major club honours the 30-year-old striker has picked up during his mixed spell at Stamford Bridge . They go a hefty way to offsetting the statistics, most notably those for Premier League fixtures, that show he has scored 20 in 110 games for Chelsea. The numbers are what tend to kill a striker, the anecdotes depict how gruesome it was. For Torres, so lethal at his best, it has been fairly grisly. Now, surely, is the time for him to move on. Chelsea are committed to his £9million-a-year wages for two more seasons and they want a transfer fee in the region of £20m. It is an ambitious pricing. Rival: Diego Costa . Rival: Didier Drogba . Rival: Fernando Torres . Rival: Romelu Lukaku . You're the one that we want: Any potential buyer for Torres will hope for his Liverpool incarnation . Replacement? Costa scored in Chelsea's 2-1 friendly win after being picked ahead of Torres . Diego Costa has come in and so has Didier Drogba. Mourinho admires Costa and adores Drogba. What place can there be for a £50m signing, not regarded as a ‘real striker’ and whose security net - Roman Abramovich’s affection - has apparently disappeared? His position could be complicated further by Romelu Lukaku playing a fuller role at the club, should his price prove too expensive Everton. Then what for the 30-year-old? One can only hope that Atletico, Monaco or someone else stump up or Chelsea and Torres lower their respective bars. He might then be able to find – and sustain – some form. The man who has won almost everything needs it badly. Only the heartless would begrudge him that. Begging for a fresh chance: The once-prolific striker pleads with Nigel de Jong after missing a great chance at the World Cup in Spain's 5-1 group stage thrashing by Holland . High among the lows: Torres did score for Spain at the World Cup but his country crashed out in the group .","£50million forward still can't seem to get a break at Stamford Bridge .

"She's the farm girl with a Harvard education that left a high-flying law career to embark on a life in politics. But on Tuesday the focus was on Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's new relationship, rather than her policies. By her side at the Melbourne Cup Carnival was businessman David Panton, and the pair are said to have been dating for around six months, the Daily Telegraph reported. Scroll down for video . Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop (right) with her partner David Panton (left)  during Melbourne Cup at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne on Tuesday . Mr Panton also took daughters Laura (left) and Sally (right) to Flemington with him, seen here holding the Melbourne Cup . Mr Panton's two adult daughters Sally and Laura were also at the celebration at Flemington Racecourse earlier this week. A property investor from Melbourne, Mr Panton recently relocated to the beachside Sydney suburb of Manly from the Melbourne suburb of Shoreham. According to The Telegraph he and Ms Bishop both share a common passion for sport and fitness. Social media posts show Laura (left) and a friend brushing shoulders with Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr (centre) earlier this year . His daughters Laura and Sally were seen later in the day posing for a photo holding the prestigious Melbourne Cup, while social media posts show Laura brushing shoulders with Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr earlier this year. Mr Panton also has an adult son, Matt, who lives in New York. Aside from her blossoming relationship, Ms Bishop seems to have gained the approval from voters to be crowned the nation's next leader. Mr Panton also has a son Matt (left) and recently relocated to the Sydney beachside suburb of Manly . Fairfax poll found Ms Bishop (left) and Tony Abbott (right) both have 20 percent support from voters in preferred leadership stakes . As Australia's first female Foreign Minister and the Liberal Party's first female Deputy Leader, Ms Bishop's popularity has nearly doubled in the past five months. A Fairfax-Ipsos nationwide poll found Ms Bishop is now level with Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the preferred leadership stakes, who both have 20 per cent of support. This has been attributed to her strong showing on the international stage - particularly throughout the MH17 crisis in Ukraine - and her calm handling of government affairs in Australia. After the figures were released on Tuesday - Melbourne Cup day - she attended Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne with her new love, confirming to the Daily Telegraph the pair had been dating for six months. But it appears Ms Bishop has no plans of taking the country's top job as she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that she is: 'Living the dream and loving the job'.

When Ms Bishop met Bono during her time as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition . 'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said. 'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.' Ms Bishop's popularity has jumped from 11 percent in June to 20 percent. But both the Foreign Minister and Prime Minister fall into second place behind Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull who remains the overall choice with 35 percent support. The Fairfax poll of 1,401 voters, carried out between Thursday and Sunday, found female voters heavily favoured Mr Turnbull or Ms Bishop. The surge in support for Ms Bishop could be a result of her strong performance in relation to foreign diplomacy and national security in recent months, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. Ms Bishop fiercely confronted Russian President Vladimir Putin late last month at a summit in Italy to question him over the MH17 disaster over the Ukraine. The Foreign Minister was also regarded for pushing the resolution the United Nations Security Council passed back in July to allow Australia and other countries access to the Malaysian Airlines crash site to retrieve the bodies. Ms Bishop also created close ties with US Secretary of State John Kerry as they signed a Force Posture Agreement during the AUSMIN talks at Admiralty House in Sydney in August this year. She has also met with powerful figures including US President Barack Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Bono - the frontman of music group U2 - during her time in politics.

Ms Bishop is pictured in 1996, about the time when she was inspired to enter federal politics after attending Harvard Business School in Boston . Ms Bishop grew up on a cherry farm in Adelaide Hills, east of Adelaide, as she attended the prestigious St Peter's Collegiate Girls School where she later graduated as head prefect in 1973. She was also class captain and debating champion, according to the Daily Telegraph. Ms Bishop went on to study law at Adelaide University and graduated in 1978. Whilst completing an eight-week advanced management program at Harvard Business School in Boston in 1996, she was inspired to enter politics. Two years later, Ms Bishop won pre-selection for the Liberal Party for the seat of Curtin, Western Australia. Since then, she's gained a number of titles having served as a Cabinet Minister in the Howard Government as Minister for Education, Science and Training, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues and the Minister for Ageing.

"He's the heir to the Latymer baronetcy and the Coutts banking fortune that goes with it but Drummond Money-Coutts has more than money on his mind. Rather than follow his father Crispin into banking, the Eton educated 28-year-old chose to become a magician. Now better known as DMC, Money-Coutts is one of Britain's hottest young magic acts with a following that rivals those of Dynamo, Derren Brown and even David Blaine. Scroll down for video . No more banking: Drummond Money-Coutts swapped finance for a career in magic . How does he DO that? Money-Coutts pulls off an incredibly realistic levitation illusion . And his success looks set to continue with the launch of new show, Beyond Magic with DMC, which starts tonight on National Geographic and sees him travel the world in search of fresh tricks and inspiring magical talent. It was, he says, a dream come true. 'I get to explore the history of magic, I meet with some of my all-time heroes of magic, I recreate some of the most iconic illusions of all time and I share it around the world with a host of wonderful people,' he says, enthusiastic. 'This series is the culmination of a 20-year obsession with, devotion to and study of magic.' Born to Crispin Money-Coutts, 9th Baron Latymer and his wife Lucy Deedes in 1986, Money-Coutts first became interested in magic at the age of six. But it wasn't until a trip to Davenport's, the oldest magic shop in the UK, aged eight that his ambition to swap money for magic crystallised. 'From that moment, nothing else was ever an option,' he laughs. 'I briefly attempted the sensible option - banking - but that was a crashing disaster and I was miserable, so I ran away with the circus instead.' Clever: Money-Coutts says his obsession with magic began more than 20 years ago . Banking dynasty: Money-Coutts' family founded Coutts Bank which is used by the Queen . Travels: In his new show, Beyond Magic with DMC, the magician travels the world in search of new tricks . His repertoire of illusions combined with a love of card-sharping - his early tricks were practised on his Eton schoolmates - have made him into one of Britain's most popular magicians, although unlike Blaine and Brown, he's not a man for big bangs and well-publicised stunts. Indeed, when asked about his favourite magicians, he plumps for the subtle Argentinean Rene Lavand, whose magic he describes as being 'filled with poetry and theatre'. His own style owes much to Lavand's influence and he remains fascinated with subtle trickery and challenging illusions. 'Magic is like music,' he explains. 'Nobody is born able to play a guitar or piano and there's no shortcut to sitting down for hundreds and thousands of hours, for years on end, to learn every small minutiae required. 'To me, an insatiable hunger to look under every stone and discover everything you can about the subject is the number one thing you need to become a magician.' Magic in action: Money-Coutts performs the classic interlinking rings trick for a pair of baffled onlookers . Passion: Although Money-Coutts briefly tried the family business, he was always thinking about magic instead . Subtle: Unlike David Blaine and Derren Brown, Money-Coutts takes a more low-key approach to magic tricks . Money-Coutts' background - the Eton education, the banking fortune, the title - does make him an unusual addition to the world of magic and he admits that few of his friends have chosen similar careers. 'Whenever I attempted something else, I ended up sitting there thinking about magic, so when the time came to leave university there was only one choice. 'It's a great irony that five or so years on, a great many friends who initially went into ‘sensible’ careers are now fleeing en masse to set up their own businesses,' he smiles. 'It’s wonderful to see.' His family, who he hopes 'are very proud' of his success, have proved supportive, although they rarely get to see him in action. 'Growing up I was very private about magic,' he admits. 'Even today I try to keep my private life and my magic life separate. 'It’s very seldom my family or close friends actually ever see me perform.' Lucky for the rest of us then, that we can.","Magician Drummond Money-Coutts, 28, is heir to the Latymer baronetcy .

"If your job involves working in the ‘death industry’ - be it as a funeral director or a mortician - how do you find like-minded people to talk to about what you do on a daily basis? Working in such professions can make smalltalk a bit of a conversation stopper, but one website has come up with the answer. Named ‘Dead Meet’, the site helps people who work in the death industry meet others with similar 'interests' - letting the conversation flow onto darker topics without the fear of scaring the other person off. Dead weird? A dating website for people in the 'death industry' is now online (screenshot shown). Created by London's Carla Valentine, it boasts more than 5,000 members. It is intended to be used by people in the death industry like funeral directors, anatomists, taxidermists and so on . People looking for love sign up to the website and then chat with like-minded people to arrange going on a date - very similar to other dating sites already in existence. The website was created by Carla Valentine after she became frustrated at her attempts to date people not in the death industry, she told Vice. Apple’s HealthKit app is designed to help you get the most out of life by improving your well-being and fitness. But could it also be used to predict when you’ll die? That’s what a new app called Deadline is claiming, saying the tech can be used to predict exactly when you’ll kick the bucket. The morbid app uses a variety of data including your blood pressure, height and sleep pattern to come up with the prediction that is apparently accurate to the second. ‘You're going to die. Sorry, we all do eventually,’ company Gist LLC writes on their iTunes. However, according to Gizmodo, the app’s claims of being accurate are not entirely true, instead being just ‘a genetic algorithm that forecasts your death’. One of the key problems she found was that it was generally frowned upon to talk to ‘normal’ people about work if you’re a crematorium technician, anatomist, taxidermist and so on. Being a museum curator herself who deals with dead specimens all day, she said this made it difficult for her to hold conversations when out with friends a potential love interests. ‘I just wanted to be able to chat to someone who could really understand me,’ she said. ‘I wanted more friends in the same profession, not just my co-workers, and perhaps even a partner to talk to in the wee small hours of the night. ‘When asked, “How was your day?” I wanted to be able to say how it really was, safe in the knowledge that uttering sentences not usually uttered by ""normal"" people wouldn’t send someone packing.’ Ms Valentine said she already has more than 5,000 members, and there are also regular meet-ups around the world for local members to get to know one another. 'I have great comments on there from members saying they’re really pleased someone has started a site like this,' Ms Valentine added to MailOnline. 'It is meant to be for those within the profession but there is a section for ""researcher"" or ""student"" because there may be people who want to get into the industry and want to talk to others about how to do so. 'It’s also so that people who hold events can find death professionals to speak at them, if that’s what they’re looking for.' People can sign up and chat with others online to arrange a date. It was created to give people in the industry more chances to meet a potential partner without spooking them off such as crematorium technicians, anatomist, funeral directors and so on (stock image shown)","A dating website for people in the 'death industry' is now online .

He said memories were flooding back on Saturday after he warmed up by playing the first five and last four holes before the rain fell. After weeks of rehab, Woods insisted he is ready to win the famous Claret Jug at Hoylake for the second time. ‘I am only going to get stronger. As the weeks go on I am getting stronger and faster.

"Manchester United supporters were left frustrated on Saturday evening when the club's official channel cut out during the friendly match against Roma and failed to broadcast a Wayne Rooney goal. MUTV's transmission from Denver had been running according to plan when it suddenly lost signal moments before half-time with United two goals to the good after brilliant goals by Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata.

United fans watching in the UK, via their side's subscription service which viewers have to pay each month to watch, were then left guessing as to what would happen next when the picture was lost. As it transpired, it was dreadful timing for the club's in-house media channel as they missed the moment when Danny Welbeck was brought down to win a penalty. The Manchester United Twitter account attributed the fault to electrical problems at the stadium, saying: 'We apologise for any loss of picture on MUTV. This is due to a power failure at the stadium in Denver.' Rooney converted the spot-kick to extend United's advantage to 3-0 heading into the interval. The problem continued into the half-time break, leaving only a few minutes for analysis, although order was restored for the second-half.

"Manchester United began to sow the seeds of change as their 100-strong entourage flew to the USA on Friday. As Louis van Gaal took his new players, Wayne Rooney included, off to Los Angeles, the diggers moved in at the club’s Carrington training base to herald the start of a new era. The demanding Dutchman has signalled the go-ahead for first-team training pitches to be ripped up and replaced with a new surface: the Desso grassmaster surface that is in place at Old Trafford, and used at Wembley. It is a hybrid of grass and synthetic fibres. Scroll down for video... All smiles: New Manchester United manager shares a joke with frontman Wayne Rooney at the airport .

Infrequent flier: Ander Herrera signs autographs ahead of his first trip outside Europe . Further changes are expected with plans for trees and  double fences to act as wind-breaks around the complex. The idea, to also help with privacy, has been mooted for months but Van Gaal has been quick to assert work should be carried out. Signs of his no-nonsense approach were  evident yesterday, with misfits Anderson and Bebe among those left behind. Bebe hopes to join Benfica while Anderson, on loan at Fiorentina last season, picked up a calf injury in training but will leave if a buyer is found. Van Gaal has cut youngsters Tom Lawrence, Davide Petrucci, Tom Thorpe, Andreas Pereira and Nick Powell from the USA travelling party. They will all be used in friendlies at home. The 62-year-old had also ordered Friday’s flight from Manchester to be moved back to a later take-off, from 1pm to 3pm, to let the squad gather at Carrington. They met at 10.30am to allow some light testing for the remaining England World Cup contingent of Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling before lunch and the 1pm coach to the airport. As well as Van Gaal and his players, almost 80 extra staff were on the flight. The land of opportunity and commercial revenue means business for United and income is vital, particularly if the team miss out on competing in Europe again. The corporate demands that so shocked former  manager David Moyes last summer need due attention. Van Gaal acknowledged this in a message to supporters yesterday. ‘I am very proud to be here,’ he said. ‘I hope I fulfil your expectations. ‘I have heard the season tickets are already sold out, I am very pleased. ‘I hope you support your team always, not only when we are winning but when we are losing, because we are winning together and we are losing together.’ The Red .

"This kitten's life was saved by half a litre of vodka after yobs doused her with anti-freeze. Missey came home after the incident last week soaking wet and was seriously ill by the next morning. Her owners Paul Stephenson, 47, and daughter Sara, 27, took the four-month-old to the vets and were shocked when they were told that vodka would help break down the poison. The unusual treatment was administered via a drip and Missey was understandably pretty drunk after getting through half a litre of 39% vodka over the course of two days. Sara said: 'When we heard about the treatment I was just shocked. I had no idea you could even give an animal vodka. 'Missey was totally blind drunk after being fed the vodka on a drip. Missey's owner Sara, 27, said the kitten was 'blind drunk' after being given vodka to counteract the anti-freeze yobs had doused her in . 'She was trying to get up and she just toppled over. Her eyes were out of focus and when we took her home in a carry basket, her mouth has pressed up against the wire so it looked as though she had her teeth bared. 'At one point she was lying down trying to swipe at a pen and she just kept missing it, she was that out of it. It was all just totally mad.' Missey was treated first at White Cross Vets in Redcar, North Yorkshire, and then taken to Vets Now in Middlesbrough, where her condition was monitored round the clock by staff. Andrew Miller, a vet at White Cross, explained it is the ethanol in the spirit which neutralises the anti-freeze. He said: 'The vodka treatment is quite unusual but is commonly used on animals who have swallowed anti-freeze. The animals are fed the vodka through a drip and they do get quite drunk. 'It is the ethanol used in this particular spirit which helps. The four-month-old kitten came home  soaking wet and was given half a litre of 39% vodka over two days . 'Anti-freeze is extremely toxic to animal's kidneys, and we specifically use vodka because the ethanol in it neutralises the substance in the poison. 'Anti-freeze is life-threatening. Sadly, not all animals we have seen who have swallowed the substance make it, but if seen quickly and if they are given the vodka to react to the anti-freeze, they have a good chance of surviving.' The kitten is now back at her home in Redcar and being looked after by Sara. She added: 'The change in her is amazing. She seems to be doing OK, although it is absolutely heartbreaking that someone could do this to an innocent little animal. 'I do not understand why anyone would go out of their way to harm Missey. She's just a baby really, and has such a lovely temperament. You should be able to let your own cat out and not have to worry about this happening.' Missey left her house at 10pm last Tuesday but when she returned she appeared unwell and was soaking wet. At first, Paul and Sara thought the liquid was water but by the next morning, they realised there was something seriously wrong and took her to the vets. And this is not the first time that the family's cats have been attacked. Just five weeks ago, four-year-old Molly was covered in tar and was left with a snare wrapped tightly around her neck. Sara said: 'She was almost screaming at the window to be let in, and when she was she was covered in tar and had a snare around her neck. 'She had no claws from where she had obviously tried to stop herself from being dragged away by the person who attacked her. 'I want whoever is responsible to be caught and brought to justice. 'After this happened I tried to keep Missey indoors, but she somehow managed to get out.' Another of the family's cats, Timmey, died after eating food laced with caustic soda four years ago. Anyone who has any information about the attacks is asked to contact Cleveland Police on 101.","Missey came home soaking wet and became seriously unwell .

"If he navigates the next stretch of uncharted territory as adroitly as he did the treacherous links of Royal Aberdeen, Justin Rose will take some stopping. Until Sunday, the Englishman had never won back-to-back tournaments. After following up his win at Tiger Woods’ very own Quicken Loans National by winning the Scottish Open, his sights are now set on a remarkable treble. He heads to Hoylake for The Open in the best form of his life, his links skills honed to near-perfection during a closing 65. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Scottish Open highlights . Hot to Scot: Justin Rose celebrates winning the Scottish Open in Aberdeen . On a roll: Justin Rose won consecutive tournaments for the first time in his career . Nicely placed: The English golfer will be among the favourites for The Open at Hoylake . Rose, who . jumps to third in the world after pocketing £500,000 in Scotland’s north . east, said: ‘I couldn’t have scripted this better. I’ve never won two . in a row and I’ve certainly never won three in a row. So this is . uncharted territory. ‘But I . don’t feel like these two wins have taken too much out of me. I haven’t . taken my eye off the ball. I won’t be celebrating too much. In the past, . I feel like I’ve enjoyed my wins a little too much. So I will try to . stay level-headed. By tomorrow my mind will be back on the game.’ Rose . compared the pressure on him to his breakthrough season of 2010, when he . headed to  The Open on the back of two  US PGA Tour wins, but he said: . ‘I’ve been playing well for four or five years now and I’m a lot more . comfortable with the expectations. I trust my game more.’ He left . his playing partner, Scotland’s Marc Warren, open-mouthed in wonder at . his skills. ‘Obviously I didn’t want to be on the end of it,’ said the . 33-year-old. ‘But it was a joy to watch.’ In defence: Phil Mickelson shot a final round 65 on the links at Royal Aberdeen . Fizzled out: Rory McIlroy finished behind Mickelson after previously breaking the course record . Despite . putting the local hero to the sword, Rose was roared on by the local . galleries, many of whom hope to be cheering him on in Team Europe . colours at  Gleneagles later this year. ‘The next time I will be in . Scotland will be for the Ryder Cup,’ he told them in his victory speech. ‘So hopefully you will be loud and proud.’ Rose went . into Sunday tied with Warren at 10 under par. But he edged ahead with . birdies on the second and third — and never looked back at the mayhem . unfolding beneath him. There were things happening on every corner of the course under the grey drizzle. Kristoffer . Broberg made an unlikely charge, then Scott Jamieson followed by . getting within touching distance of  double digits under par. Both came up short but, along with young Tyrrell Hatton, claimed places in The Open as consolation. Just when . you thought it was safe, defending champion Phil Mickelson put in a . phenomenal push that just petered out towards the end. Above the . melee, though, Rose looked like he was in a world of his own, reaching . the turn in 31 strokes. No-one was able to match his pace and, at the . end of four days of extremes, he stood two shots clear of Broberg. Now . can he pull off a third straight win? Some of . those who competed here will fancy themselves to stop Rose, with . defending Open  champion Mickelson believing he’s played himself into . form. After shooting 65, the American insisted he’d be relaxed going to . Hoylake. True Brit: England's Tyrrell Hatton was one of three players to claim a qualifying place for The Open . ‘There is a . fraction of the pressure I felt before at Open Championships,’ he said. ‘Because, once you’ve already won it, once you’ve held the Claret Jug . and have one, it just feels different. You don’t feel like you have to . fight it and have to force it.’ Rory McIlroy finished with a 67, his third round under par this week — the odd one out being Friday’s horrific 78. ‘I see enough good signs in my game to give me confidence for next week,’ he insisted. ‘I am in . good form. I had three good rounds here. If I could just string a fourth . round in there it would be great and, going into next week, that is . what I am going to try and do — play four solid rounds of golf and see . where that leaves me.’ VIDEO Scottish Open - Day 3 highlights .","Justin Rose won the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open .

"Yossi Benayoun has branded Joey Barton 'stupid' and 'embarrassing' in response to a tweet he made about the Middle East crisis. Benayoun, who played alongside Barton during a spell on loan at Queens Park Rangers last season, captained Maccabi Haifa in their friendly against Lille in Austria earlier this week which had to be abandoned when pro-Palestinian protesters invaded the pitch and fought with players. Israel is currently engaged in hostilities with Hamas, an Islamist militant group that runs the Gaza Strip. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Israeli football players fight with Palestinian pitch invaders . Attack: Yossi Benayoun was involved in Maccabi Haifa's match which had to be abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters invaded the pitch earlier this week . 'If this was anybody else but Israel the West would intervene,' said Barton in one of a number of tweets posted on Friday morning. 'It cannot continue. Innocent children being slaughtered. This must stop. 'How can a God stand by and watch this? Or even condone this? Is this all part of his master plan? 'The UN attempting to evacuate the school when the bombing took place? Asked IDF (The Israel Defense Force) for window to evacuate. Not given. Children die as a result. 'This is not war. These are not combatants. They are just innocent children. This is ethnic cleansing.' Tussle: Benayoun (circled) was involved in the melee which saw Wednesday's game abandoned . Kick: Supporters of reportedly Turkish origin entered the pitch and headed for Maccabi Hafia players . Benayoun, who was born in Israel and has almost 100 caps for the national team, responded to Barton's rant against Israeli actions in Gaza, saying: 'Mate things can never changed you have been stupid and you will stay stupid all your life..embarrassing .' Barton replied: 'Firstly, you cannot call somebody stupid with such bad grammar. Secondly, you cannot and should not kill innocent children. Thirdly, you cannot remove people from their land because a fictional book from thousands of years ago tells you can. Last but not least, I hope you and your family are safe and well and remain so through this terrible time.' Continuing with his posts, Barton added: 'Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?' Twitter: Joey Barton, training for Queens Park Rangers on Friday, voiced his opinions on the Middle East crisis . On Wednesday, and with French side Lille winning 2-0, supporters of reportedly Turkish origin entered the pitch and headed for Maccabi Hafia players, including Benayoun, formerly of West Ham Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal. One of the players is seen to trip a fan before punches were thrown. The Maccabi stars - some of whom retaliated - managed to leave the field unhurt. Commenting on the incident, Benayoun, 34, said: 'As a football club we condemn all acts of verbal and physical violence. 'Yesterday (on Wednesday) in the closing minutes of the match we were attacked by thugs on the pitch simply because we are Israelis. We had no choice but to defend ourselves.' He continued: 'The older players saw it as our duty to defend the youth players and we asked them not to become involved in the brawl.

"For many people, the chance to meet the Pope is the opportunity of a lifetime. But for this shy toddler, the occasion got the better of him as he turned his back on the Pope while his elated mother posed for a selfie. The photo took place at the Vatican's Paul VI Hall where Pope Francis greeted a group of Italian adult scouts today. This toddler turns away from his mother's special selfie with Pope Francis in the Vatican's Paul VI hall today . The toddler turned his back on the Pope to the amusement of onlookers who had gathered to see him . In a talk, he emphasised the importance of marriage, family and children. This is not the first time Pope Francis has demonstrated he is in-touch with today's society. Last year, he posed for what was believed to be the first ever 'papal selfie' when he was snapped with a group of teenagers who had travelled from the Diocese of Piacenza and Bobbio for a pilgrimage. In April, Pope Francis made a remarkable break in protocol by delivering an off-the-cuff homily and posing for selfies during Palm Sunday celebrations. The Pontiff joined around 100,000 Romans, tourists and pilgrims in St Peter's Square in Vatican City to commemorate Jesus's entry into Jerusalem before his crucifixion. In a startling move, he abandoned his prepared homily and spoke entirely off-the-cuff to the crowds. And he continued to stray from the script - climbing off his Popemobile to pose for selfies, hugging young children and babies and even sipping cups of 'mate', a tea-like drink, passed to him from worshippers. The head of 1.2 billion Catholics worldwide has already amassed more than four million followers on the social networking site Twitter as part of his efforts to understand and integrate with youths since he succeeded Pope Benedict XVI. Pope Francis caresses a baby as he met members of the Italian adult scout movement today . In a talk today, Pope Francis called on Christian parents to live out their educational mission relying on the 'sacrament of marriage', enhancing dialogue, debate and openness to schools, parishes and associations . He said: 'All vocations take their first steps in the family…a movement such as yours, based on continuing education…for you, Christian parents, the educational mission finds its source in the sacrament of marriage, in which the raising of children constitutes a true ministry in the Church' The popular Pope touches a toddler's cheeks during his meeting with the scout movement today . The Pope is cheered by the faithful following the meeting today - he posed for selfies with the crowds . Pope Francis makes the sign of the cross at the end of an audience with Catholic scouts today . Elsewhere, it was announced today that American Cardinal Raymond Burke, 66, a fervent opponent of abortion and gay marriage, has been removed by Pope Francis from another top Vatican post. Burke's removal as head of the Holy See's supreme court was expected. Last year Francis took Burke off the Vatican's powerful Congregation for Bishops. While previously leading the St. Louis diocese, Burke was a vocal hardliner in a campaign which included calls for Catholic politicians supporting legalised abortion to be denied Communion. He also gave a series of recent interviews criticising the Pope and had emerged as the face of conservative opposition to Francis' reform agenda. Pope Francis today transferred Burke from the Vatican court job to the largely ceremonial post as patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a charity.","Pope Francis posed for selfies and greeted crowds at Vatican's Paul VI Hall .

"Alastair Cook ran with both arms in the air and a broad smile on his face as he enjoyed the acclaim of the Trent Bridge crowd and his team-mates. For one surreal moment all was well with the troubled England captain’s world. Sadly, though, he had not just scored a long overdue century nor was he celebrating a much needed win. Instead he had just got Ishant Sharma out. The fact that Cook was bowling, and taking his first Test wicket, the day after Jimmy Anderson had hit 81 in a world-record last wicket stand said everything about the conditions for this eagerly anticipated first Investec Test.

Pitching in: Stuart Broad has his (light-hearted) say on the state of the Trent Bridge wicket after the match . A horrible, frankly disgraceful, pitch . was long destined to be the only winner and Cook had given up all hope . of victory by the time he brought himself on for two filthy overs that . even featured, a la Graham Gooch, a Bob Willis impression. At . least he could enjoy the moment when Ishant somehow tickled his less . than medium pace down the legside to Matt Prior while the warm reaction . of the England team emphasised that the skipper continues to have their full . support. ‘I’ve got the match . ball now,’ said Cook after claiming a souvenir of his unlikely bowling . contribution. ‘That was my action in its full glory. I made a late . decision to do a Willis impression. I’ve never ever done it before but . Rooty was egging me on. I just tried to pitch my length up and keep the . batsman guessing!’ These . may be difficult times for the England captain but he is still smiling . and still standing after eventually having the better of this draw and . even glimpsing the possibility yesterday of what would have been a . famous victory. For . one glorious, cloudy hour on Sunday morning England could afford to . dream of that precious and highly improbable win but the dust quickly . settled on a stalemate that sees Cook with a wicket but without a . victory in nine long Tests. Only . the pitch and the Nottinghamshire coffers emerged victorious from a . draw that did little, other than during Anderson’s wonderful stand . with Joe Root on Saturday, to enhance the appeal of the ultimate form . of the game. When Anderson . and Stuart Broad, below their best this season, combined for their most . productive joint spell of the summer at the start of the fifth day, . three wickets fell for just 17 and India were suddenly under unexpected . pressure. The ball was . swinging, Broad was on one of those rolls that have won Tests and India . were only 145 ahead at the fall of their captain MS Dhoni to Liam . Plunkett’s first ball with just four wickets left. Yet that was as good . as it got. It was a Broad . charge that led to the brilliant win at Durham last year and a 3-0 lead . in the Ashes which provided no hint of the extent of the misery that was . just round the corner for an England side without a Test victory since.

That is not to . under-estimate the extent of England’s plight and Cook will need a win . soon, or at least some runs, if he is to remain in office beyond the . next four Tests which will come thick and fast. The odd wicket will not . help his cause. That win . would have come on Sunday had Stuart Binny, justifying his existence in . his first Test with 78, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar with his second half . century of the match not come to India’s rescue as England flagged. This . was a much worse Test for Dhoni than Cook, the Indian captain following . his appalling leadership during Anderson and Root’s stand on Saturday . by missing a trick yesterday in not having half an hour bowling at Cook. If . Dhoni had declared once the draw was secured and dismissed Cook again .

"More like a play from Ocean's 11 than the standard operating guidebook for FBI undercover operations, agents tricked their way inside three luxury villas at Ceasars Palace, Las Vegas, to gather evidence to bust an illegal sports betting ring. To get away with their incredible ruse, federal agents first turned off Internet access to the villas then impersonated repair technicians to gain entry to get around a warrant, according to defense lawyers challenging the practice.

The video shows investigators devising code words to use while they were inside, a back-and-forth about the cover story for an agent, who adopted the name 'Sam,' which he had used 'for other stuff' in the past, and a brief exchange about how another investigator should dress for the role of a technical repair nerd.

An FBI agent, Mike Kung, accompanied him also undercover. The AP obtained about 30 minutes of audio and video recordings of the covert reconnaissance. Inside the Las Vegas villa, Lopez appeared to try to fix an Internet outage for several minutes while glancing around the room and asking more than once to view a laptop screen to verify that Internet connectivity was still down. Defense lawyers said in their filing that Kung, the FBI agent, was sent inside because he spoke Chinese. Still undercover, Lopez appeared to call Wood from inside the villa and asked him to 'check the frame,' the code they had previously worked out. In a brief back and forth, Wood responded that he would 'trace the wire and make sure it's tied down good.' The FBI employed the ruse against the recommendation of an assistant U.S. attorney, Kimberly Frayn, according to lawyers for four of eight men charged in the case. Defense lawyer Thomas Goldstein, who is challenging evidence the government collected in what he described as an illegal search, said that was code to turn Internet access back on. Caught out: Wei Seng Phua, second from left, and his son Darren Wai Kit Phua, third from left, were two of the eight men arrested in July for their role in the multimillion-dollar World Cup betting scheme . Trickery: The FBI agents obtained their secret surveillance in a manner that Danny Ocean (played by George Clooney, in the Ocean's 11 trilogy) would have been proud of . After the agents left the villa, Lopez was recorded saying he saw the Internet address of the website that defendant Wei Seng Phua was operating, adding, 'Phua had the odds up on his page the whole time.' Federal authorities described Phua, 50, as a high-ranking member of the 14k Triad, a Chinese organized crime group. Goldstein said Phua denied that allegation, which he said had nothing to do with the criminal case in Nevada. Phua, his son Darren Wai Kit Phua, Seng Chen Yong, Wai Kin Yong and four others were arrested in July after federal agents raided three high-roller villas at the hotel. All eight face charges of transmission of wagering information, operating an illegal gambling business, and aiding and abetting. None of defendants has entered a plea, but Goldstein said they all deny wrongdoing. Phua also faces charges of running an illegal sports gambling business in Macau. He was arrested in the Chinese gambling enclave on June 18 and flew to Las Vegas a few days later. The FBI employed the ruse against the recommendation of an assistant U.S. attorney, Kimberly Frayn, according to defense lawyers. They filed a 54-page motion late Tuesday night in federal court in Las Vegas to dismiss evidence in the case. According to a conversation recorded by an investigator for the hotel, the prosecutor told FBI agents 'it was a consent issue,' the lawyers said. Over two days in early July, FBI agents worked with a hotel computer contractor and the state's gaming control board to shut off the Internet at different times and at one point delivered a laptop computer to try to see what was happening, according to the court filing. Investigators eventually gained access after they turned off the Internet connection to two suites, impersonated repair technicians and recorded video inside. Authorities later used the videos to obtain a warrant to arrest the men. In the criminal complaint, federal agents said the videos showed evidence of an illegal online sports gambling operation being run out of the villas. Prosecutors did not mention in the criminal complaint what caused the Internet outages. Defense lawyer Thomas Goldstein said lawyers learned about the ruse only when they reviewed the video recordings and heard an official make reference to turning off the Internet access. Ongoing case: All eight men face charges of transmission of wagering information, operating an illegal gambling business, and aiding and abetting - they all deny wrongdoing . 'They were trying everything they could to get inside without a warrant,' Goldstein told the AP. A former federal prosecutor, Mark Rasch, said the ploy probably will not stand up in court. 'Police are allowed to use a certain kind of subterfuge, but what they can't do is create a certain kind of circumstance,' Rasch said. In the gambling case, Wei Seng Phua, his son Darren Wai Kit Phua, Seng Chen Yong and Wai Kin Yong and four others were arrested in July after federal agents raided the three high-roller villas at the hotel. All eight face charges of transmission of wagering information, operating an illegal gambling business, and aiding and abetting. None of defendants has entered a plea, but Goldstein said Tuesday they all deny wrongdoing. Wei Seng Phua, 50, also faces charges of running an illegal sports gambling business in Macau. He was arrested in the Chinese gambling enclave on June 18 and flew to Las Vegas a few days later. In a criminal complaint, federal authorities described him as a high-ranking member of the 14k Triad, a Chinese organized crime group. Goldstein said Wei Seng Phua also denied that allegation, which he said had nothing to do with the criminal case in Nevada. Under U.S. law, a person whose property is inspected generally must waive his constitutional protections against unreasonable searches unless authorities obtain a warrant. Evidence collected improperly is not supposed to be used at trial. The FBI in Las Vegas referred questions about the practice to the U.S. Attorney's Office there. Natalie Collins, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Daniel Bogden, said prosecutors were aware of the allegations being made by defense lawyers but declined to comment, citing a pending trial. The gambling case was at least the third to surface in recent weeks raising questions about tactics by federal agents pursuing criminal investigations. The Drug Enforcement Administration set up a fake Facebook account using photographs and other personal information it took from the cellphone of a New York woman arrested in a cocaine case in hopes of tricking her friends and associates into revealing incriminating drug secrets. In another case, the FBI sent a fake news story it attributed to The Associated Press to trick a suspect in a bomb-threat case into clicking on the website link and revealing his location. The AP objected that the FBI's practice was 'unacceptable' and 'undermined AP's credibility.'","The FBI allegedly employed the ruse against the recommendation of an assistant U.S. attorney .

"Robert De Niro has found that he's fallen out of favor with residents in the small farming town of Gardiner . With past Hollywood roles including mobsters, criminals and villains, Robert De Niro is no stranger to playing the baddie. But the actor is probably not so happy to be cast in this most recent villainous role - in a real-life small-town tax dispute. De Niro has found that he's fallen out of favor with residents in the small farming town of Gardiner in upstate New York in a quarrel over a property tax bill. The conflict centers on De Niro's 78-acre homestead, which was bought by the actor's Riverside Trust in 1997 for $1.5 million. Since then a fresh valuation from assessors in Gardiner has put the worth of the property at $6 million, which - if it is allowed to stand - would mean the Riverside Trust owes the town $170,000. But the trust has challenged the valuation, leading to an extended legal battle that has left the tiny town with debts totaling more than $100,000. It is not clear whether De Niro sanctioned the legal challenge, but it has not made the actor popular among residents in the small farming community of around 5,800 people. According to the New York Times, when De Niro's trust acquired the property in 1997, it included an 18th-century wood-frame farmhouse and two outbuildings with a total of six bedrooms and seven baths. The Riverside Trust has since added 20 acres. A barn was turned into a 14,000-square-foot recreation center with a game room, gym, basketball court, swimming pool, steam room, sauna - and boxing ring and small film studio. Another barn was turned into a workshop and one was built as an office. There are also two guesthouses on the property, as well as a tennis court and a small ski slope. The trust's assessor valued the property - which sits about 75 miles north of Manhattan - at $4 million. Justice Mary Work of State Supreme Court in Ulster County sided with the town at the trial. 'The defining characteristics of the subject property are privacy and self-sufficiency, which would appeal to buyers seeking property in a wide range of areas outside New York City,' she wrote in her decision in June. The town offered a settlement for slightly less than its $6 million assessment but the Riverside Trust rejected it and filed an appeal. It could save $57,000 a year if the legal challenge succeeds. 'He took his stand, which is his right, we all agree with that,' Carl Zatz, a former film producer now in his fourth term as Gardiner town supervisor, told the New York Times. Gardiner in upstate New York has around 5,800 residents. It is home to De Niro's 78-acre property . 'Now it's like, 'I can afford this fight, so I'm going to dig my heels in'. ' The Town Board feels it is worth resisting the trust's challenge at present, but there are fears that the legal debts will continue to mount for the tiny town. 'What if he wins, or we give up? Then everybody else has to pick up the slack,' added Warren Wiegand, a member of the board. 'But can we afford to keep fighting, either?' Robert De Niro (pictured here in 1995 film Heat) is no stranger to playing the baddie. But the actor is probably not so happy to be cast in this most recent villainous role - in a real-life small-town tax dispute . Some Gardiner residents remain sympathetic to De Niro, acknowledging that he has employed dozens of local residents to build and maintain his considerable property, and saying that he is acting the part of any taxpayer. Roger Rascoe, the chairman of the Ulster County Republican Party, told the New York Times that he felt taxes were too high for everyone. But he added that De Niro may well have lost a lot of supporters when the trust challenged the original decision. 'People can work their whole lives and not make even close to what he spent on this place,' Mr. Rascoe said. 'It's difficult for us to feel for him.'","Conflict centers on De Niro's homestead, bought by Riverside Trust in 1997 .

"Since shooting to fame as Mark Wright's fiance on The Only Way Is Essex back in 2010, Lauren Goodger has seen her star - and her confidence - rise. As well as enjoying a stint on Celebrity Big Brother and Dancing On Ice, the 28-year-old has successfully launched her own cosmetics company, Lauren's Way. But the reality TV star-turned-entrepreneur wants to put her newfound confidence and sense of style to good use - by designing a clothing range. Big plans: Lauren Goodger found fame on TOWIE back in 2010 and now she wants to grow her empire by launching a clothing range . Speaking about what she's got coming up, Lauren told MailOnline: 'I would love my own clothing range that's different and caters for curvy sexy girls.' Lauren would be following in the footsteps of her former castmates Gemma Collins, Sam Faiers and Amy Childs, who all have their own fashion ranges. The blonde star also revealed the secret behind the toned body she's been flaunting in her recent social media snaps. So THAT's her secret! Lauren, who has been showcasing her toned physique on social media in recent weeks, says her newfound love of dancing helps her stay in shape . Speaking about her healthy new lifestyle, she explained: 'I try and work out as much as I can and eat healthily, which can be hard with my busy schedule. I love dancing, so that’s a great way to stay toned.' And Lauren has certainly been putting her newly acquired dancing skills to good use in her Instagram videos, where she can often be seen gyrating and twerking to the camera. Lauren is also something of a beauty buff and has her own range of tanning products, lashes and hair extensions under the name of Lauren's Way. The glamorous star has  been amping up her beauty regime recently - and she swears by chemical peels for beating her acne. Beauty buff: Lauren, who has her own range of lashes and tan, has been getting chemical peels to treat her acne and sun damage . She said: 'I’m always trying various treatments so when I heard about the The Perfect Peel I had to give it ago. 'It’s basically a chemical face peel that takes just 15 minutes, I visited a London clinic to have it done as it is a strong treatment but it was pain free (which surprised me) and the results you just can’t get with any products at home. 'I had mine done which can help with acne and sun damage. After my recent trip to Dubai my skin was in need of some TLC, so I had it to clear my skin and remove any dead skin or pigmentation that the sun caused. It's a deeper treatment which makes your skin clear and glowing, I see it as an investment.' Look good, feel good: The 28-year-old say she has no judgement on anyone who wants to better themselves by having cosmetic surgery . As well as peels, Lauren says she loves getting her eyebrows done. 'Eyebrows really shape your face so it’s important to have strong great brows. I also recently had a Lava Shell massages as it helps me relax and wind down after a long day, running a business can be quite stressful at times,' she added. And the beauty buff is all for cosmetic surgery if it makes you feel more confident.

"Tributes poured in for Bob Torrance after one of the greatest golf coaches in the history of the game . lost his short battle with cancer, aged 82. Torrance, father of Ryder . Cup-winning captain Sam and coach to many of the world’s best players . down the decades, passed away peacefully in his sleep at home in Largs on Friday. Former pupil Marc Warren, speaking after a 68 put him on . The Open leaderboard at Hoylake yesterday, said: ‘I wouldn’t be top 10 . in The Open if it hadn’t been for Bob. Well done, son: Bob Torrance (right) celebrates with Sam after Europe win the Ryder Cup at the Belfry in 2002 . ‘It’s a sad day for golf. A legend has passed away. He changed my career massively. Still to this day, and for the rest of my career, his words of wisdom will stay with me. ‘I can’t speak highly enough of him and his knowledge of the golf swing. He would give everything he had to make you the best player you could be. I’ll be forever in his debt for that. ‘I hit a great drive off 18 today and the wind was really kind to me. It might have been Bob helping me out.’ Fellow Open competitor Stephen Gallacher echoed the sentiments of the many who had received tutelage from Torrance, saying: ‘He was a massive influence on my career from a young age. He was like a father figure to me. Everything I know about the game is probably through Bob. ‘The first time I met him was down at Inverclyde and the snow was hitting the back of the bay. He was such a positive guy and I loved working with him. Legend: Bob Torrance helped many players including major champion Padraig Harrington . ‘I went . down to see him two or three weeks ago and it was sad to see him. I . really feel for June, Sam and the rest of the family. ‘I’ve . got millions of stories about him. He was larger than life. He was . always positive — and funny, too. He would teach you for as long as you . wanted to be there — even if it was in the dark. ‘Bob . was one of the hardest workers I have ever known. He had an eye for a . golf swing and knew how to fix it without becoming too technical. ‘He was never one for using a camera — he just used his eyes. He also had such a knowledge of the game. ‘Bob’s . seen it all and done it all. Working with Ian Woosnam, for instance, . and Sam, of course. He also went to see Ben Hogan, so he knew what he . was talking about. ‘I probably wouldn’t be standing here today if it wasn’t for working with Bob over the years.’ Many . friends and former pupils took to social media to pay instant tribute, . Ryder Cup legend Ian Poulter Tweeting: ‘Really sad news Bob Torrance . just passed away. An amazing man who coached so many great players, . he’ll be missed.’ Respect: European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley paid tribute to Torrance . Legend: Torrance will be dearly missed by all after losing his battle with cancer . Scotland’s Chris Doak added: ‘Farewell my old pal I’ll remember you always.’ Triple major winner Padraig Harrington and European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley also paid tributes to Torrance on Saturday morning. 'He was the greatest golf coach in the world and he was a father figure to me after my own dad passed away,' the 42-year-old said. 'My majors would never have happened without Bob. Not a chance. But I don't think anybody should have any regrets because Bob lived a full life.' Fellow Irishman McGinley, coached by Torrance for more than 20 years, echoed Harrington's views. 'We have lost one of life's, as well as one of golf's, true characters,' said the 47-year-old Dubliner. 'I feel blessed to have known Bob for many years and to have had him as my coach since 1992. Not only was he a world class golf coach, a fact recognised right across the game, but he was also one of my very favourite people in life.'","Golfing legend loses his battle with cancer aged 82 .

"A young mother so wanted to live the life of a 'normal teenager' that she left her baby with a known heroin addict, even changing her phone number so the woman could not contact her. Desiree Ann-Marie Cozzoni of St. Charles, Missouri, then decided to report to authorities that her 16-month-old son had been kidnapped, which led to her arrest on charges of making a false report and endangering the welfare of a child. She was also charged with unlawful use of drug paraphernalia when police found a pipe containing marijuana residue in her purse while booking her.

Cozzoni, 18, drew up nonlegal documents earlier this month signing over custody of her child to a woman she sometimes stayed with and who often used heroin in the presence of the young mother and her son. Police told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the woman, whose name has not been released, 'stayed at motels because she was homeless, unemployed and had lost custody of her own children.' Then, sometime during the week of October 6, Cozzoni changed her phone number so the woman could not get in touch with her. It is still uncertain why she decided to report her son had been kidnapped.

Even more disturbing is the fact that the young woman, whose Facebook is filled with photos of herself posing in front of mirrors, is smiling in her mugshot. She was released on $2,500 bail on Tuesday, and it is believed her grandparents may take custody of the child.

"Virgin Galactic was operating short of safety standards that allow for crew members to survive two separate and unrelated failures, a safety expert has claimed. Considered best-practice within the industry, the system known as 'two failure tolerance' is designed to allow for survival if there are two unrelated problems on an aircraft. But Tommaso Sgobba, the former head of fight safety for the European Space Agency, said Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo had too few  safeguards in place to prevent an accident he believes was 'waiting to happen'. Scroll down for video . A large piece of debris is pictured in the California desert after the spacecraft broke up in the sky above . These images show the space craft ascending then detaching from its mothership before it begins to break up . The experimental space craft disintegrated over the California desert a week ago when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces  tore it apart. Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed in the accident pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured. Feathering systems, which involve rotating the craft's tail structure, give it the ability to slow down and float like a feather, but are deadly if deployed at the wrong time. Mr Sgobba has now told the Financial Times SpaceShipTwo's feathering system appeared to be 'one failure tolerant', meaning it could withstand one, not two, problems. Investigators claim the feathering system activated when a lever was mistakenly pulled to unlock it - even though it should require a second lever to be pulled to deploy it, the paper reported. Virgin Galactic responded to the claims by saying the feathering locking mechanism used two safeguards - one procedural and one mechanical. In the wake of the disaster, Mr Sgobba has been highly critical of Branson's attempt to pioneer private space travel and claims the company worked in secrecy. He said: ‘They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand. Michael Alsbury (left) was killed in the crash on Friday, while co-pilot Peter Siebold (right) survived . 'They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design. I have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen.' The fatal accident has also prompted a review of insurance for  adventure trips into space such as those advertised by Richard Branson's company. A loophole means adventure travelers hoping to head into space - unlike pilots and skydivers - don't have to take out extra life insurance. The loophole exists because US life insurance policies don't ask about space tourism or exclude it from coverage, meaning insurers most likely would have to pay if the holder died on a space trip, insurance industry veterans said. Insurance companies say they are considering what to do about space tourists after the Virgin crash,and the loophole is likely to be slowly closed.","Expert claims SpaceShipTwo did not meet a 'two failure' safety standard .

"Will Radcliff, who built a multimillion-dollar global business from flavored, icy Slush Puppie drinks, has died at the age of 74. The businessan passed away in a hospice in Cincinnati, Ohio, yesterday after his health declined following a recent fall, according to his daughter DeeAnn Radcliff Harmon. His famous drinks, made from frozen syrup and small pellets of ice, have become widely available at convenience stores, shopping outlets and stalls following their creation in 1974. Today, Ms Radcliff Harmon described her father as a natural salesman with a 'bigger-than-life personality', saying: 'He could sell anything to anybody'. A natural salesman: Will Radcliff (left), who died aged 74 yesterday, built a multimillion-dollar global business from flavored, icy Slush Puppie drinks (right). The drinks are made from frozen syrup and small pellets of ice . Radcliff, who once peddled vacuum cleaners door-to-door and earned a six-figure income from selling peanuts, first spotted a slush machine at a 1970 Chicago trade show. He saw the potential of icy, sweet drinks that could be made for just a few pennies, believing the sound of crystals hitting the cup and the taste of the flavorings would be appealing to consumers. He came up with the name for his creation - Slush Puppie - with his sister Phyllis as they sat on the front porch of their Cincinnati home. The brand was later represented by a toboggan-wearing, floppy-eared dog, while initial flavors included cherry, grape, orange and lemon-lime. Home: The businessan, born in Dayton, Kentucky, passed away in a hospice in Cincinnati (pictured), Ohio, yesterday after his health declined following a recent fall, according to his daughter DeeAnn Radcliff Harmon . As sales boomed, Slush Puppie machines quickly became a staple in many U.S. convenience stores, before distributorships from Australia to Africa made the icy drinks global. In 2001, the London-based Cadbury Schweppes PLC bought the Slush Puppie Company. Radcliff, who was born Willard Lawson Radcliff in Dayton, Kentucky, also had a frozen cocktail business, among other business operations. Ms Harmon said her father's first regular job was shining shoes at a country club, and he later kept a vow to return to the club someday as a member. New owner: In 2001, the London-based Cadbury Schweppes PLC (pictured) bought the Slush Puppie Company . Radcliff owned a 4,000-acre ranch in Umatilla, Florida, and worked for land conservation amid central Florida's growth, his daughter said. He also had a Lear jet that he piloted himself 'many times'. Ms Harmon added that her father had many favorite sayings that guided his life, such as 'Where there's a will, there's a way', 'If it ain't fun, to hell with it', and 'Once you break through the clouds, it's always sunny'. Radcliff is survived by his daughter, son Chris Radcliff, a brother and sister, and four grandchildren.

"Sligo Rovers recorded an historic 2-1 win over Norwegian giants Rosenborg in Trondheim on Thursday. Alan Keane handed Rovers a well-deserved lead on 54 minutes before Danny North’s goal shocked the hosts as he tapped home for Sligo’s second. Per Joar Hansen’s side pulled back a fortuitous consolation 10 minutes from time courtesy of a David Cawley own goal. But the Bit O’Red held firm to record a magnificent victory, only their third ever in European competition. Famous win: Captain Alan Keane (centre) and Banny North celebrate a huge victory in Trondheim . Rosenborg: A Hansen; M Dorsin, T Reginiussen, J Skjelvik, T Mikkelsen; P .

Rovers: G Rogers; A Keane,  E McMillan, K Spillane, D Ledwith (Puire . 85), J Russell, D Cawley, S Conneely, R Gaynor;  D North (R Keating 81). Scorers: Keane 56, North 70. Referee: M Tykgaard (Denmark). Sligo enjoyed a lively start and were responsible for the game’s first chance with less than a minute played. North’s quick thinking resulted in his pass finding Cawley, but the midfielder was denied by a Tore Reginiussen block inside the area. Rosenborg’s Alexander Soderlund shot wide on 11 minutes after he was played through by Mikael Dorsin. Hearts were in Sligo mouths on the quarter of an hour mark. Ross Gaynor conceded possession 30 yards out, but Pal Andre Helland failed to hit the target. Sligo’s John Russell then sent his low drive wide of Alexander Hansen’s left hand post on 25 following a speedy counter attack down their right. Rosenborg fired a warning shot before half time as Mikkelsen blasted narrowly over shortly before the break. The industrious Helland could only bend his left footed shot wide of the Sligo goal five minutes into the second period. Illustrious opponents: Rosenborg's Pal Andre Helland is beaten to the ball by Sligo's Evan McMillan in the air . Sligo took the lead soon after when Keane’s initial shot was blocked by Hansen but he made no mistake with the rebound which flew in with the help of a deflection. Rogers pulled off another superb save on the hour mark as he diverted Helland’s downward header away for a corner. Evan McMillan cleared Morten Gamst Pedersen’s dipping header off the line on 64 as the Norwegians kept fighting. Incredibly, Sligo doubled their lead on 70 minutes. Cawley’s searching ball to the back post was tapped in by the lurking North at the back post. Soon after Rogers had to be alert to Helland’s deflected effort as he got his body behind the shot after it took a touch off Gaynor. North went close with a speculative effort from the angle, a few minutes later. The home side grabbed a reply on 80 minutes. Pedersen’s corner was punched away by Rogers, but the ball hit the back of the unfortunate Cawley before it  spilled behind Rogers and into the net. Sligo almost restored their two goal advantage on 87 minutes. Substitute Ruiari Keating robbed Mikkelsen before seeing his shot blocked away by Hansen. The rebound fell to Paul O’Conor whose effort was blocked off the line.

"A ‘shanty town ’ occupied by around 50 European migrants is to be cleared on the orders of the High Court. The area of shacks and tents in woodland on the Lee Valley Park in North London was highlighted by the Daily Mail earlier this week. High Court officials yesterday granted landowners Transport for London immediate possession of the site which has been occupied by Romanian, Polish and Bulgarian economic migrants for a year. Scroll down for video . A group of around 50 migrants from Eastern Europe have set up a 'shanty town' in some woodland on the banks of a canal in London . The area of woodland, next to a busy roundabout in Edmonton, has been turned into a semi-permanent residence consisting of around 15 huts . Squatter Mr Ion, pictured inside his hut, is one of around 50 people who are currently living illagelly on the site . Solicitor David Linklater, representing TfL, argued that the rights of the landowners to possession outweighed any breach of human rights to private life the migrants, who were illegal trespassers, might claim. The hearing was told the fire brigade was concerned that the camp in Edmonton next to the North Circular Road had become a fire hazard. There were also a number of gas canisters being used for heating and cooking which could cause an explosion. The site, where more than 15 shacks have been built from discarded timber, doors, pallets and plastic sheeting for multiple occupants, was ‘filthy’, added Mr Linklater. None of the occupants – many of whom work as ‘cash in hand’ painters and builders – attended the High Court hearing and the order was therefore not opposed. Earlier this week, the Daily Mail was invited to tour the site by 30-year-old Roma gipsy Marian Dumitrache, who revealed how up to six migrants sleep in a room on bare mattresses and sit outside among makeshift tables, armchairs and abandoned shopping trolleys.

Marian Dumitrache, 30, from Buzau, Romania, left his home country six months ago to work in London . Mr Dumitrache left his native Romania six months ago to work in London – sending money home to his wife and two young children in the city of Buzau. Wearing a Superman sweatshirt, he took a break from his house decorating job in nearby Chingford to claim he has ‘no choice’ but to live in the camp. ‘No one likes the Roma gipsy. Living here is cold and uncomfortable but at least I can earn money painting and send that home. The hearing was told the fire brigade was concerned that the camp in Edmonton next to the North Circular Road had become a fire hazard . There were a number of gas canisters being used for heating and cooking which could cause an explosion . The woodland sits alongside the canal in Upper Edmonton, pictured, which residents say is iconic among walkers, boaters and anglers . ‘But we are not living off other people or the state. The camp is deserted today because people are at work.’ He added: ‘We cook on camp fires and some people use the canal to wash. We are not really living here – we just about exist. It is very cold at night. We have no gas or electricity.’ TfL plans to ask the occupants to move voluntarily but if this does not happen it is likely the area will be cleared by the middle of next week.","Migrants live in woodland on the Lee Valley Park in North London .

"Manchester United have decided not to send Marcos Rojo for surgery on his dislocated shoulder, meaning the Argentina defender could be back in action within six weeks. It was feared that Rojo could be sidelined for up to three months after he was carried off in the second half of last weekend’s Manchester derby. Manager Louis van Gaal confirmed that United hope to cure the problem with rest, but admitted that there is a worry that Rojo could suffer a recurrence of the dislocation in future. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal: I feel lousy but I have belief in myself . Manchester United's Marcos Rojo could return within six weeks after dislocating his shoulder . The 24-year-old Rojo was carried off on a stretcher during the Manchester derby last weekend . ‘Marcos Rojo dislocated his shoulder but he did it in the right way, a positive way, so we don’t need to operate and that is a relief,’ said Van Gaal. ‘Because it’s a conservative way it can be less than six weeks and when we have to operate it’s 12 weeks. ‘Maybe with this injury it is very difficult that it won’t happen again, and that’s the problem. Yesterday another specialist said that the conservative way to heal it is the best. But we have always the risk it will happen again. ‘It’s always the same with this injury, I cannot change that.

With Chris Smalling suspended and Jonny Evans (ankle) and Phil Jones (shin splints) still injured, Van Gaal refused to confirm if Michael Carrick will play in central defence at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday. The England midfielder filled in as an emergency centre-back when Smalling was sent off in the defeat at Manchester City and finished the game playing alongside Paddy McNair following Rojo’s injury. ‘I don’t want to say what I’m thinking to do,’ added the United boss. ‘Smalling is not playing because he is suspended, and Jones and Evans are still injured. I have to solve that problem. Who is playing there I don’t want to say. Maybe I can train today and change my mind, because I have to solve that problem. Van Gaal refused to confirm whether Michael Carrick (left) would start at centre back on Saturday . The Dutch boss gives instructions to his players during a training session on Friday . Van Gaal also defended his team’s defensive record, claiming that it has been blemished by the 5-3 defeat at Leicester in September. ‘I don’t agree with the opinion about the defence,’ he said. ‘When you don’t count the five goals of Leicester City, we have (conceded) less than Chelsea I believe. The balance of the team is the problem. That is why I have remodelled the structure of my team for the third time.’ United’s injury problems also mean that Radamel Falcao will also miss his third game in a row with a calf strain. The Colombia striker started his last game, the 2-2 draw at West Brom last month, on the bench but Van Gaal denied that he is losing faith in a player who could end costing United in excess of £50million if they make his loan move from Monaco permanent. Radamel Falcao will miss the game against Crystal Palace with a calf strain . Chris Smalling is suspended for the Crystal Palace match following his sending off last weekend . ‘The problem for Falcao is that because of the balance in the (West Brom) game, I had to change and after that moment he has come in the game and assisted for a goal.

Mr Verona, who has recently released a book on the indigenous Aymara nation, Waska Tatay,, spent several months documenting its 'beautiful' culture' in South America. He told CNN Spanish colonialists were behind the nation's worship of both Catholic deities and traditional spirits,  who are seen as neither wholly good nor wholly bad, and can be powerful allies. He added that the Aymara 'live with both Catholicism and animism, both in modernity and their ancestral traditions', saying: 'They visit the Yatiri, the priest, to pay homage to deities or give prophesies when they are applying for visas, or for assistance in businesses matters.' Offerings: The Aymara's rituals often involve offerings of coca leaves, alcohol, cigarettes, threads of dyed wool, sugar and molded figures to the spirits (pictured) Religious: They also take part in traditional ceremonies, such as Tinku and Oruo, which feature striking outfits.

Above, members of the Aymara community . And interestingly, he said that residents appear to perceive traditional stories 'as true as the people talking to you at this moment'. 'If you ask someone if Supay, the god of the mines and the underworld, lives, they will say, ""of course"", because they heard stories about it. So myths come to life very strongly in this society,' he said. These myths include the story of the evil spirit Kari Kari, who reportedly targets his victims on public transport, before 'taking advantage of moments of sleep or provoking drowsiness to achieve his ends'. In his book, Mr Verona says of Kari Kari: 'He starts by blowing a powder of human bones over his victim's face that generates unusual dreams. Strong belief: Interestingly, Mr Verona added that residents appeared to perceive traditional, centuries-old stories 'as true as the people talking to you at this moment' Daily life: 'Myths come to life very strongly in this society,' said Mr Verona, from Switzerland.

'He then makes an incision in his abdomen with a flaked blade - nowadays, people even talk of a syringe - to extract a little bit of fat.

"Fifteen months ago, the planning for a mammoth summer Manchester United tour to Thailand, Australia, Japan and Hong Kong reached its final, most critical stage. A visit to Sir Alex Ferguson’s office. ‘We really were not sure he would agree to it,’ said one United source this week. ‘It was so big and contained so much travelling. ‘To our surprise, he smiled and signed it off in about four seconds. We couldn’t believe it. Within a couple of weeks, though, he had retired. He knew all along that he wasn’t going on it.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch some strange behaviour from Louis van Gaal on United's tour . Van's the man: Louis Van Gaal's arrival has given everyone at Manchester United a lift . New beginnings: Van Gaal has big shoes to fill in the Old Trafford hot seat . New era: Van Gaal alongside assistant Ryan Giggs during the club's pre-season tour of America . Fast forward one summer and two new managers and United have been confronted with the thorny issue of touring schedules once again. This time it is for real. Louis van Gaal’s repeated public utterances about the inconvenience of this month’s visit to America have caused more consternation in some departments of the club than key figureheads are prepared to admit. Less than two weeks in to the job and already United’s new manager is causing feet to shuffle. To managers like Van Gaal, the details are important. That is why on this tour, he has already tweaked the structure of a trip that was, interestingly, signed off by his new assistant Ryan Giggs during his spell as interim manager last May. On arrival in Los Angeles last week, for example, Van Gaal declared that he wished his players to train in the morning, eat and sleep at lunchtime and then train again in the afternoon. To make that work club staff had to book a Holiday Inn next to United’s training facility. Similar arrangements have now been hurriedly made for this week’s tour stops in Washington and Detroit. Not in favour: Van Gaal has admitted the club's current pre-season tour has been an inconvenience . Partnership: United chief executive Ed Woodward understands the concerns made by Van Gaal . Proud: Van Gaal, alongside club legend and ambassador Sir Bobby Charlton, is delighted to be United's manager . Van Gaal has also been very specific about his players dietary habits. Menus have been changed mid-tour. All this is a consequence of Van Gaal’s relatively late arrival at United after a summer spent with Holland in the World Cup. That can’t be helped and nobody at the club disputes the respected manager’s right to have things exactly as he wants them on tour. Certainly mistakes have been made. Van Gaal and his players spent hours travelling to and from training in LA while the game venue, Pasadena’s Rose Bowl, was 90 minutes away. Here in Denver meanwhile, United’s schedule saw them face Roma in afternoon heat of 33 degrees on Saturday. The underlying issue here, though is more fundamental. Van Gaal — along with other coaches of his generation — simply resents these increasingly arduous pre-season trips because he feels they interfere with the key business, preparing for a Barclays Premier League season. At Arsenal, Arsene Wenger resisted long-haul tours for years. Having relented, the Frenchman spent a visit to Malaysia two summers ago complaining non-stop about facilities. Respect: Van Gaal will be delighted to have a player of Robin van Persie's quality in his squad . All smiles: Van Gaal and Giggs will be eager to get United back on the trophy haul as soon as possible . This summer, meanwhile, Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho insisted on a short-haul trip to Austria having objected – quite understandably – to the three-week epic in the Far East and America he was landed with on returning to the club last summer. United, though, have long since viewed pre-season tours as crucial to their business. They would not be the behemoth they are without them.There is a balance to be struck between the football and the money. United’s chief executive Ed Woodward understands this and he and group managing director Richard Arnold would not try to force something on Van Gaal that he is rigidly opposed to. But as somebody said this week, only half in jest: ‘If Louis thinks we are going to start spending a week at a European training camp every summer, he will be disappointed.’ One only has to look at some of the numbers associated with United’s current tour to understand its importance to a club who continue to thrive financially despite the weight of debt imposed by owners the Glazer family. Each of United’s four games in the International Champions Cup here will net them more than £1m. Just as importantly, though, the club are committed to an astonishing 100 ‘engagements’ over the fortnight, whether they be player appearances or community initiatives. Pedigree: Van Gaal will do everything he can to ensure Manchester United have success on the field . Outside the Rose Bowl last week, American fans queued unprompted for over an hour just to have their photograph taken in front of a United billboard. England striker Danny Welbeck, meanwhile, arrived in the US and went straight to meet a disabled youngster who had been waiting for months to meet him. These commitments and dozens more like them do not, on the whole, make United any money directly but they deepen United’s footprint around the world. They keep stellar sponsors like Chevrolet and AON happy, furthering a global ‘reach’ that is already believed to number 600million fans – half of those are in Asia – and sees them six times more popular around the world than, for example, the New York Yankees baseball franchise. Aon, for example, the sponsors of United’s Carrington training ground, have 25 United engagements during this tour, involving 1,700 of their most-valued clients. When a United tour is taking place, traffic to the insurance company’s website increases by a third and by 500 per cent on a match day. Furthermore, their in-house experts believe that 34 per cent of their total business comes their way because of the United link. There are other startling indicators, too. In Nigeria - where United played in 2008 - traffic on the roads is 30 per cent lighter when they are on TV. In Mexico, the birth rate goes up when Javier Hernandez appears in red. Reunited: Van Gaal will pit his wits against close friend Jose Mourinho in the Premier League this season . Emulate: Can Van Gaal go on and become a club legend like former boss Sir Alex Ferguson? Numbers like this do not come about by United sitting at home every summer. The club’s marketing and commercial strategy is aggressive, cutting-edge and, as a result, astonishingly successful. Therefore, it needs to be indulged. On this tour Van Gaal’s players are wearing season 2014-15 shirts with ‘Chevrolet’ on the front. A deal worth £357m between now and 2021, the US car manufacturer want value and one of their privately-stated aims is for United to extend the company’s standing in Asia. The same goes for United’s watch partner Bulova, the US company having already said that extending their profile in Asia was their No1 reason for signing their own multi-million pound deal with the club last season. Sports company Adidas – who will begin to make United’s kit again from next summer – also wish United to return to Asia and it seems unfeasible that another visit to key markets in South Korea – where the club have 300,000 credit card holders – Japan and China will not be on the agenda soon. Planning for next summer’s tour will begin as early as October. It may well be America again in 2015, with Dallas, New York and Chicago the proposed venues. Van Gaal will be consulted and already claims he has reached an agreement that will cut down the air miles. United, though, can do many things but cannot bring continents like Asia, America and Africa closer to Manchester. Van Gaal said this week that all he wants is ‘balance’ and that is only right. To get it, however, the famously rigid ‘Iron Tulip’ is perhaps going to have to bend a little.","Van Gaal's arrival has already prompted changes at the club .

"Roma manager Rudi Garcia has ruled out the possibility of Kevin Strootman leaving Roma for Manchester United. United are understood to retain an interest in Strootman and reports in Italy claim the 20-time English champions have bid at least £30million for the Holland midfielder. But Garcia insists the 24-year-old is going nowhere. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some of Kevin Strootman's best goals for former club PSV . No deal: Strootman will not be joining Louis van Gaal's Manchester United this summer . Key component: Dutch midfielder Strootman will continue to play a major role at Roma . 'Strootman is a Roma player. He will be a Roma player this year. There is no doubt about that,' Garcia said in the build up to Roma's friendly against United in Denver. 'Only he can say whether he wants to stay but it was never an issue for him to go to another club. There is no question of it.' New United manager Louis van Gaal knows Strootman well from his time as Holland coach. However, Van Gaal had to do without the midfielder at the World Cup as he suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury in March. United would need to see the player, who moved to Roma from PSV Eindhoven last summer, had made a full recovery before launching any bid. Strootman is currently training in Boston, where Roma played Liverpool earlier this week, and will therefore not turn out against United on Saturday in Colorado. 'Strootman is following a normal recovery programme, he has stayed in Boston to work with our physios,' Garcia added. 'He will start running any time soon.'

"A new face stole the pre-match attention and sold the shirts, but by the end not many here had words about Alexis Sanchez. The thoughts, no matter how fleeting they might be, were all about the reserve striker who suddenly, unexpectedly struck gold and hit Benfica for four. Yaya Sanogo. Or Yaya Sanogoal, if you prefer. At the Emirates, in the competition of the same name, he had his moment. Four times. This is a 21-year-old who last season, his first in English football, played 14 games across the competitions and scored none. He was often off the pace. Cut to this fixture and he opened with two poor misses. By the end he had upstaged Sanchez, who appeared after 75 minutes, and had typified a strange result with a delightfully unexpected performance. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Arsene Wenger gushes over four goal hero Sanogo, and Campbell' One-man show: Yaya Sanogo scored four goals in Arsenal's emphatic Emirates Cup win over Benfica . Cheeky: Sanogo (right) put Arsenal ahead in the first-half with a clever backheel flick . Two-step guru: Sanogo celebrated all four of his goals with a unique dance move on Saturday . Arsenal: Martinez, Bellerin, Chambers, Monreal (Miquel 73), Gibbs, Flamini (Arteta 60), Campbell (Sanchez 73), Ramsey (Wilshere 60), Rosicky (Coquelin 60), Oxlade-Chamberlain (Cazorla 46), Sanogo (Akpom 73). Subs: Szczesny, Debuchy, Koscielny, Giroud. Booked: Monreal. Goals: Sanogo 26, 44, 45+1, 49, Campbell 40. Benfica: Artur, Amorim (Joao Teixeira 85), Gaitan (Cancelo 85), Lima (Derlei 85), Maxi Pereira, Ola John (Candeias 60), Salvio (Bebe 57), Eliseu (Benito 19), Sidnei, Talisca (Andre Almeida 60), Cesar. Subs: Paulo Lopes, Jara, Luis Felipe, Lindelof. Booked: Benito. Goal: Gaitan 62. For Arsenal, only so much can be drawn from a pre-season match, particularly when the opposition, not matter how gilded, roll over like Benfica did. But quite aside from the sight of their new £30million striker making his non-competitive debut, they had a number of positive performances to consider. Of the established guard, Aaron Ramsey was superb while the game was still up for grabs; next to him Tomas Rosicky also looked sharp and Joel Campbell, a first-half scorer and provider, likewise. Perhaps most promising was the early contribution of Hector Bellerin, the 19-year-old they signed from Barcelona in 2011. He bombed on from right-back, created chances and always looked confident. Not much can be said about his defending because Benfica did not present enough of a challenge in that regard, so for the same reason Calum Chambers will have to wait for greater tests. Of the tests Benfica did offer, Arsenal coped extremely well. And this against a side that ordinarily is not too shabby, a club that took a domestic treble last season and came within a penalty shootout of winning the Europa League. They can play and in Nico Gaitan they have a forward who has drawn significant interest from Liverpool. Gunner come on: Alexis Sanchez made his debut after replacing Joel Campbell in the second half . More to come: Sanchez leads an Arsenal attack on his debut . Getting shirty: Alexis Sanchez was greeted to huge cheers from the Arsenal crowd after coming on . It was Gaitan who rattled Arsenal within the first 10 minutes yesterday. Maxi Pereira had overlapped from right-back and pulled back a cross from the byline to Gaitan, who connected cleanly but saw his half-volley hit the bar. That was about as good as it got for the Portuguese in an abysmal first half. Arsenal had already been harshly denied a penalty for a shove on Campbell by the time Sanogo missed a couple of good chances. First, Ramsey scooped the most exquisite of passes into his path after 15 minutes, only for the 21-year-old, goalless in 14 games last season, to slide and make a hash of the finish. Moments later he stabbed wide a cross from Bellerin. His breakthrough was nice, though, coming from a backheel flick after Ramsey tricked and then outpaced two down the right before firing a low cross. Four-midable: Yay Sanogo celebrates after scoring his fourth goal . On target: Joel Campbell built on his impressive World Cup after scoring for Arsenal . New partnership? Sanogo and Campbell celebrate an Arsenal goal in front of fans . Defensive debut: Calum Chambers made his Arsenal debut in central defence after joining for £12million from Southampton . Campbell was given a huge welcome ahead of kick-off, returning after a loan spell at Olympiacos and a fine World Cup with Costa Rica. He is believed to have been mentioned in discussions among AC Milan’s scouting department, but his performance here will not have done much to convince Arsene Wenger that he should be offloaded. He initially struggled on the right to draw possession, but after switching to the left he showed his knack for finding space. It was from the left that he scored Arsenal’s second, arriving late to volley another excellent delivery from Bellerin. Campbell missed a chance for a quick second when he shot wide after a delightful passing move, sweeping the pitch from right to left, but he played a key role in Arsenal’s third. One for the future: Hector Bellerin impressed at right-back for the Gunners . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s shot was saved and Sanogo scuffed the rebound, before Ramsey chipped to Campbell on the left. The forward had space and a sight of goal but instead played a lovely, controlled volley across the six-yard box to Sanogo. It was a tap-in at the end of a nice move. Sanogo’s hat-trick goal, which like his second was scored in first-half stoppage time, was scrapped in after yet another Benfica defensive error. Sanogo got his fourth shortly after the restart, pouncing when Moraes Artur, poor old Moraes Artur, spilled Ramsey’s shot into his path. He tripped while celebrating. Benfica did pull one back when Gaitan bundled in after Arsenal failed to deal with a long throw. By that point Bebe, the former Manchester United flop, was on the pitch and drawing sarcastic applause; when Sanchez came on he drew a huge roar. He didn’t score, but he didn’t need to.","Yaya Sanogo scored four goals as Arsenal romped to victory .

"Kingman produced the equivalent of a Sir Chris Hoy burn-up as he flew through the final two furlongs to imperiously land a tactical Qipco Sussex Stakes. The British track cycling icon is a retired spectator at the Commonwealth Games but his name is still synonymous with high-speed two-wheel action. In what turned into a two-and-a-half-furlong sprint, Kingman turned a one-and-a-half-length deficit into a length lead within 100 yards as he made 2013 winner Toronado look pedestrian. On the march: James Doyle riding Kingman (right) to win The Qipco Sussex Stakes from Toronado (second left) at Goodwood . James Doyle, rider of the John Gosden-trained 2-5 favourite, reckoned he got a Hoy-like feeling as Kingman went sub-11 seconds for the final two furlongs with a breakneck 10.22 secs for  the penultimate one, . Doyle said: ‘I’ve never experienced going around a velodrome when they go real slow and then sprint for two laps but that will be as close as I will get.’ While Gosden, who was winning the group one mile race for the first time, added: ‘I used have an old MGB GT and I used to get into fifth gear and then flick a button. You can do that with him. He has a gear and then he has another. ‘I had him in the (six-furlong) July Cup and he would have won it. I ran Gregorian, who was unlucky not to be a good second, and I wouldn’t have put them in the same work.’ In the pink: Doyle and Kingman romp home . The Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in October is the one set target for the colt who has already won the Irish 2,000 Guineas and St James’s Place Stakes with the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville seemingly the only other race under consideration. It has been a memorable few days for Gosden, who won Saturday’s King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes with Taghrooda. Kingman’s win stretched his lead over Richard Hannon to over £500,000 in the trainers’ championship. For Hannon this meeting with its huge expectations has so far been one of frustration. He has not yet had a winner Toronado was one of five seconds he has saddled. But there was no argument about the Sussex Stakes result. Milking the applause: Kingman looks to the crowd as Goodwood cheers a popular winner . Richard Hughes, Toronado’s jockey, said: ‘I hit the two furlong pole at full belt and I knew it would take a good one to get by me. I got first run on him off a slow pace and he has still beaten me. I’ll have to bring a gun next time!’ A memorable day for Doyle and Khaled Abdullah, owner of Kingman, had started with Sir Michael Stoute-trained Snow Sky landing the Gordon Stakes. He goes for York’s Great Voltigeur Stakes and then probably the St Leger for which Ladbrokes make him a 12-1 shot. Paul Hanagan, Taghrooda’s jockey, is facing at least two weeks on the sidelines after X-rays showed he suffered a hairline fracture of his left arm in the fall of White Nile on day one of the meeting. Warwick will become a jumps only venue after owners Jockey Club racecourses said it will cease to hold Flat meetings from next year.","Kingman turned a one-and-a-half-length .

"Triple Olympic champion Jason Kenny admits he has had to bulk up to keep pace with the changing dynamics of the men's sprint. Kenny won gold in both the team and individual sprint at London 2012, having been selected ahead of Sir Chris Hoy for the latter, having taken his first Olympic gold in the team event four years earlier. But the 26-year-old Bolton boy was jolted back to reality in the World Championships at Cali in March when he was edged into fifth place. Improve: Jason Kenny (right) has had to bulk up to keep pace with the changing dynamics of men . All of the men who finished above him there were heavier, more powerful riders than Kenny. Having failed to beat them in Colombia, Kenny's next plan is to join them by tipping the scales when he rides for Team England at next week's Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. 'I was fifth at the Worlds and everyone in front of me was bigger, the average was probably 10 kilos more than me,' he said. 'A lot of big guys are winning races now so I have to kind of step up and match that. 'I've had to gain a bit of weight and strength because the landscape's changing a bit in sprint racing. 'Since the World Championships I've gained four kilos and that doesn't sound a lot but it is for me because I'm really consistent with my weight. 'Right now is the heaviest I've ever been but you have to gain useful weight. You do put a bit of chub on, it's impossible not too, but I try and overshoot then come back down again.' Kenny and girlfriend Laura Trott, who also hopes to be among the medals for Team England, made some waves in recent weeks for suggesting the Commonwealth Games did not feature too high on their agendas. Ready: Kenny takes part in a Team England training session ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games . He does not deny that remains the case, but is warming to the task ahead of him - as well as the chance to complete a hat-trick of Olympic, World and Commonwealth titles. 'I always try to be honest. Laura and I were honest when we said the programme wasn't funded for the Commonwealths, it's funded for the Olympics. 'Individually we're funded for the Olympics too and that's just the truth. 'When you look at the programme sat in an office or at a team meeting that's all that matters, but when you start training and put the fast wheels on these things get a bit more serious and come race day this will be really important. 'Ideally I'd like to compete the set with Commonwealth gold because that would be the three major championships - Olympics, Worlds and Commies for me.'

"Everyone coming to the United States from the three West African countries at the center of the Ebola outbreak will now be screened for the deadly disease at one of five airports, the Homeland Security Department said Tuesday. 'All passengers arriving in the United States whose travel originates in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will be required to fly into one of the five airports that have the enhanced screening and additional resources in place,' DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters that the new procedures will go into effect on Wednesday. The news comes as a new Gallup poll shows Ebola is now among the top 10 issues that Americans are concerned about. It is tied with  the ISIS terror army and rates higher than terrorism in general. Customs and Border Protection now conducts screenings, like this one in Chicago, on patients who arrive from or via Sierra Leone, Liberia or Guinea; now all such travelers will have to enter the US through one of five airports where the screenings take place . Passengers mingle in the arrivals area at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York  after health screening procedures were put in place at the airport . Earlier this month, Customs and Border Protection officers at New York's Kennedy, Newark Liberty, Washington's Dulles, Chicago's O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airports started screening people arriving from West Africa. The screening includes using no-touch thermometers to determine if travelers have a temperature, one symptom of a possible Ebola infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is also working with DHS on the screening. There are no direct flights to the United States from West Africa. About 94 percent of the roughly 150 people traveling daily from West Africa to the U.S. arrive at the one of the five airports. The new measures are designed to catch the remaining 4 per cent. Johnson said his agency has 'in place measures to identify and screen anyone at all land, sea and air ports of entry into the United States who we have reason to believe has been present in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea in the preceding 21 days.' Asked why the new policy wasn't immediately put into place when the new screening methods were launched at the five affected airports, Earnest said Tuesday's announcement represented 'relatively creative policymaking.' 'The Department of Homeland Security had to work with airlines' to reach an agreement to 'funnel' passengers to a limited number of entry points, he said. 'There is a lot of coordination that had to go into developing and implementing this policy.' DHS, he added, now has 'measures to identify and screen anyone at all land, sea and air ports of entry into the United States who we have reason to believe has been present in Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea in the preceding 21 days.' Concerns about travelers infected with Ebola have risen since a Liberian man traveled from the region to Dallas last month. Thomas Eric Duncan became the first person in the United States diagnosed with Ebola, a few days after arriving from West Africa. He died on Oct. 8. Using infrared temperature guns, staff are checking for elevated temperatures among passengers whose journeys began or included a stop in one of the three African countries . Since then, two nurses who helped care for him have also been diagnosed with Ebola. Some members of Congress have urged President Barack Obama to ban all travel from West Africa. Tuesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, praised the expansion of airport screening but again urged Obama to halt all travel from the region. 'President Obama has a real solution at his disposal under current law and can use it at any time to temporarily ban foreign nationals from entering the United States from Ebola-ravaged countries,' Goodlatte said.

"Secretary of State John Kerry admonished the anonymous White House official who reportedly called Benjamin Netanyahu a 'chicken***t' on Thursday, saying the description of Israeli Prime Minister reflects neither his nor the president's opinion of the world leader. 'We condemn anybody who uses language such as was used in this article,' Kerry said during an on-stage interview at the Washington Ideas Forum. 'It is disgraceful, unacceptable, damaging,' he added. Kerry did not apologize on behalf of the Obama administration for the slur. Rather, he claimed to have 'never heard that word around me in the White House or anywhere.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Secretary of State John Kerry said today that comments from the anonymous White House official who slurred Israeli PM Benjamin 'Bibi' Netanyahu neither reflect his views nor the president's . 'The assault on me comes only because I defend the State of Israel,' Netanyahu said after an unnamed Obama administration official called him a 'chicken***t' in a conversation with a reporter . 'I don't know who these anonymous people that we keep getting quoted in things,' he pondered aloud. 'But they make life much more difficult.' Kerry then touted the president's support for the Iron Dome, and said it wouldn't have been possible without him, and pointed to Obama's statements supporting Israel's right to defend itself as evidence that there's no hard feelings between Obama and his Israeli counterpart. The cabinet official's claims that he's never heard any one at the White House dis Netanyahu follows a New York Times report on Tuesday that alleged that Kerry is outside the president's inner circle, and as such, his views don't always reflect those of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 'White House officials joke that he is like the astronaut played by Sandra Bullock in the movie Gravity, somersaulting through space, untethered from the White House,' the Times wrote. The characterization of Kerry in the in-depth report allows for the possibility that an administration official did make unflattering statements about Netanyahu, but Kerry wasn't privy to them. The unnamed U.S. official's . reported description of Netanyahu as a . 'chicken***t', or worthless coward, drew a sharp response on . Wednesday from the Israeli leader – no stranger to acrimony with . the Obama administration – and a slam from America's Republican House Speaker. The American broadside, in an interview in The Atlantic, followed a month of heated exchanges between the . Netanyahu government and Washington over settlement-building in . Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, which Palestinians seek as the . capital of a future state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The White House soft-pedaled the insult as 'counterproductive' but offered no apology on Wednesday and didn't identify the official involved. 'The thing about Bibi is, he's a chicken***t,' the . unidentified official was quoted as saying, using Netanyahu's . nickname and a slang insult certain to redden the ears of the . U.S.-educated former commando. 'The good thing about Netanyahu is that he's scared to . launch wars,' the official said, alluding to past hints of . possible Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear . program. 'The bad thing about him is that he won't do anything . to reach an accommodation with the Palestinians or with the . Sunni Arab states.' Netanyahu, the official was reported to have said, is . interested only in 'protecting himself from political defeat ... He's got no guts.' Israeli leaders usually do not respond to comments by . unidentified officials. But Netanyahu addressed those remarks . directly in opening a memorial ceremony in parliament for an . Israeli cabinet minister assassinated by a Palestinian in 2001. 'I am not prepared to make concessions that will endanger our state,' Netanyahu said. 'Understand, our national interests, topped by security and the unity of Jerusalem, are not what top the interests of those anonymous forces attacking us, and me personally.' 'I am under attack simply because I am defending the State of Israel. If I didn't stand firm on our national interests, I would not be under attack.' Otherwise occupied: Obama ducked mention of the controversy by spending his day focused on Ebola – meeting with doctors and nurses in an orchestrated photo-op . 'Our supreme interests, chiefly the security and unity of . Jerusalem, are not the main concern of those anonymous officials . who attack us and me personally, as the assault on me comes only . because I defend the State of Israel,' the Israeli prime minister added. 'Despite all of the attacks I suffer, I will continue to . defend our country. I will continue to defend the citizens of . Israel,' he said. Such pledges by Netanyahu have resonated among Israeli . voters, even amid fears his strained relations with U.S. President Barack Obama could ultimately weaken support from . Israel's main diplomatic ally and arms provider. After Netanyahu's speech, Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for . the White House National Security Council, dismissed the . purported slur, denying that it reflected how the Obama . administration felt about the Israeli leader. 'Certainly that's not the administration's view, and we . think such comments are inappropriate and counterproductive.' The same word – 'counterproductive – was on White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's crib sheet during a Wednesday briefing with reporters. 'Those comments do not reflect the United States' position, and they do not reflect the personal views of the President of the United States,' Earnest said. 'I am not aware of who made those comments .... I am not aware if the president knows who made those comments. I'd be surprised if he did.' Confronted with harsh criticism from John Boehner, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Earnest called it 'a little rich to have a lecture about profanity from the Speaker of the House.' Referring to the epithet 'chicken***t,' he claimed that Boehner has 'reportedly said that about the majority leader of the United States Senate,' Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the president doesn't know who called the Israeli prime minister a vulgar name, but that it was 'counterproductive' The speaker had hours earlier called it a 'failure' of Obama's leadership that 'disrespectful rhetoric' has been 'used time and again by this administration with respect to the special relationship the United States has with the state of Israel.' 'When the president discusses Israel and Iran, it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is America’s friend and who he thinks is America’s enemy,' Boehner said in a statement. 'The House of Representatives has no trouble drawing that distinction.' 'Over the last several months, I have watched the administration insult ally after ally. I am tired of the administration’s apology tour. The president sets the tone for his administration. He either condones the profanity and disrespect used by the most senior members of his administration, or he does not.' Boehner's statement referred specifically to the use of vulgar language as a slam against a head of state, not the use of foul language in general. Some Israeli pundits predict an Israeli election in 2015, . two years early, speculation seemingly supported by increasingly . vocal challenges to Netanyahu's policies from senior ministers to the . left and right of him within the coalition government. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, whose ultranationalist . Jewish Home party belongs to the coalition but who has had testy . relations with Netanyahu, defended him on Wednesday. 'The prime minister of Israel is not a private person. He is . the leader of the Jewish state and the entire Jewish people. Cursing the prime minister and calling him names is an insult . not just to him but to the millions of Israeli citizens and Jews . across the globe,' he wrote on Faceboook. Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog sounded a more . critical note, telling Channel Two television: 'Netanyahu is . acting like a political pyromaniac, and he has brought our . relations with the United States to an unprecedented low.' In a series of recent speeches widely seen in Israel as . setting the stage for a possible poll, Netanyahu has highlighted . growing security concerns in the wake of the July-August war . with Hamas in Gaza and regional unrest that has brought Islamist . militants to Israel's northern border with Syria. Drawing Palestinian outrage and a State Department . accusation that Israel was distancing peace, Netanyahu pledged . on Monday to fast-track plans for 1,000 new settler homes in . Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem. Netanyahu described criticism as being 'detached from . reality', saying Jews had a right to live anywhere in Jerusalem, . regarded by Israel as its united capital - a claim not . internationally recognised. Baskey, the U.S. spokesman, acknowledged longstanding policy . differences between Israel and Washington over settlements. 'Obviously, despite the extremely close relationship between the . U.S. and Israel, we do not agree on every issue,' he said. 'For instance we have repeatedly made clear the United . States' longstanding view that settlement activity is . illegitimate and complicates efforts to achieve a two-state . solution.' Despite these differences 'the U.S.-Israel . relationship remains as strong as ever', Baskey added. Most countries and the World Court deem the settlements . Israel has built in areas captured in a 1967 war to be illegal. Israel disputes this, and has settled 500,000 Jews in East . Jerusalem and the West Bank, among 2.4 million Palestinians.","Unnamed Obama administration official used the slur against Israel's prime minister .

The Dutchman paid tribute to United's power on the world stage but also reminded fans of the sharp improvement needed on last season. ‘Last season you were seventh so you are not the biggest club.

Now I am at Manchester United which is No 1 in England. ‘I have never worked in the Premier League and that is a big challenge. ‘When I worked at Barcelona that was the best league. When I worked in Germany that was the best league. ‘Now I work here maybe this is the best league.' Van Gaal has previously been quoted as saying 'holidays are for wimps' as he gets straight to work at United. He continued: ‘When there is a challenge like this I cannot let it go. This is also a holiday for me because I like to work.' Despite lavishing praise on his new club, Van Gaal identified a problem with the club's Carrington training complex - designed to Sir Alex Ferguson's specifications - namely that it is too windy. ‘It’s unbelievable how many people are working for the same cause.

So we have to do something . about that. But the facilities are fantastic.’ Ferguson had described the enhanced training headquarters as his 'best signing' and well worth the investment from the club. He said: 'It's given us a training facility where all the players are saying, ""Wow, this is some training ground now"". It's one of the best. And I think if any player were to come here with any doubts about where they should be, they'll soon find out that this is a fantastic set-up.' Van Gaal refused to rule out new arrivals, but wants to . give his current squad the chance to impress in pre-season. He also revealed that Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera were signed with his approval. Class of 92: Van Gaal confirmed there will be roles on his staff for United legends Phil Neville and Paul Scholes . ‘My method is always the same – I want to look at the players I have now,' he said. ‘I . want to see in the first few weeks what they can do.

There is one important decision Van Gaal has not made and that is who will captain United. Robin van Persie was given the armband by Van Gaal for Holland and there are some who think he will fulfill the same role at United. The Dutch forward would have competition, however, not least from strike partner Wayne Rooney. Van Gaal said: ‘All the players are a possible candidate (for captain). ‘But I have to get to know them. The captain’s role is very important and therefore I need time.

The Dutch boss has a reputation of being a hard task-master and aggressive nut he insisted: ‘(My reputation) is unfair. The media wants to show that side (of my personality). ‘From 39 I was head coach of Ajax and until now my personality has not changed.

He was always confirming that by winning a lot of titles.‘I hope I can start with that philiosophy. ‘I am democratic. I am empathetic to human beings and I have a strong personality.’ Van Gaal also paid tribute to Old Trafford icon Sir Bobby Charlton, with whom he held up a United shirt with the No 1 on the back. ‘I want to thank Sir Bobby Charlton because it’s a great honour to come in this stadium and be guided by him,' Van Gaal said. ‘These were my first steps as coach of Manchester United and I was very proud to do that with Sir Bobby Charlton. ‘I saw him play and I know what he means to English football.

"The family of a young girl have claimed she had to be exorcised of an evil demon after visiting a haunted house owned by 'Ghost Adventures' host Zak Bagans. The unnamed youngster apparently became 'possessed' by a malevolent spirit inside the home in Gary, Indiana, once described as a 'portal to Hell'. The possession allegedly occurred during filming of Bagans' latest documentary for which he asked former residents of the property to retrace their footsteps through the haunted building. Spooky: The unnamed youngster apparently became possessed by a malevolent spirit inside the home in Gary, Indiana, that has been described as a 'portal to Hell'. A spooky figure was pictured in the window, and audio recordings were made of ghostly voices in 2012 . The mother claimed she felt a kick in the leg when nobody was in the room before her daughter, a few weeks later, began having 'violent outbursts', TMZ.com reported today, which happens also, by apparent coincidence, to be Halloween. Her family claim she soon began 'speaking in tongues' and threatening to hurt herself and others. Bagans said the possession was so severe that he decided to put filming of the show on hold while he took the girl to see a Catholic priest to rid her of the curse. One witness to the exorcism told TMZ: 'She had holes in her wrists and her eyes were red. Something's going on ... what's wrong with her?' Bagans, who presents Ghost Adventures on the Travel Chanel, said the possession was so severe that he decided to put filming of the show on hold while he took the girl to see a Catholic priest to rid her of the curse . Bagans filmed the exorcism on camera. He claims the priest indeed managed to banish the demon from the girl's body and that she has since recovered. He plans to return to filming in December, said the website. Bagans bought the house for $35,000 in January this year after demons tormented and possessed a mother and her three young children. During the ordeal back in 2012 the walls of the house allegedly bled clear oil which 'froze' the finger of a social worker who touched it, and ghostly voices were recorded when police went to investigate. Bagans, who presents Ghost Adventures on the Travel Chanel, told the Indy Star at the time: 'It's not entertainment. I really do have a passion for this stuff and the research aspect of this stuff.' The ordinary-looking property became world-famous in January after the case of Latoya Ammons, a previous owner, came to light. Ammos said that demons began to take over her house in 2012, throwing objects around and possessing her children to the point that the whole family nearly lost their lives. Social workers, psychiatrists, priests, police officers, doctors and nurses have all corroborated Ammons story, including one incident in which her son was taken to hospital where staff watched in horror as he climbed backwards up a wall before flipping over his mother's head. Audio recordings taken by police as they went to investigate the paranormal activity also seem to back up the story, as a ghostly voice can be heard whispering 'hey' as the officers talk. Neither of the officers recall hearing the voice that day. One man who did hear something, however, was Gary Indiana Police Captain Charles Austin, 62, who says after one trip to the property a growling voice came from his AM/FM radio saying 'you outta here' before it went back to static. Terrorized: Former resident Latoya Ammons claims she and her three children were possessed and tormented by demons in the basement of her house in 2012 . He was also there the day video footage was recorded of Ammos's mother giving a tour of the house. He entered a skeptic and left convinced that he had just witnessed a 'portal to hell.' Speaking to MailOnline he said: 'Everyone of us who was there that day in the basement and who saw what we saw, went through what we went through after…we all think the same, we all call it the same. That bit of dirt is a portal to hell.' The unusual happenings also attracted the attention of local priest Father Michael Maginot, who also set out to disprove the accounts, but ended up performing one minor and three major exorcisms on Ammons and her family, and now swears that he has been targeted by demons himself. Mystery liquid: During the haunting Ammons says the house seeped a clear, odorless liquid, which she claims can be seen here . Evidence? A social worker who touched the liquid apparently had her finger 'frozen' and then refused to go back . Ammons also says she saw her daughter levitating above her bed and a photograph has been circulated showing a shadowy figure standing by the window. Zak Bagans has been producing Ghost Adventures since 2008, in which he tours haunted places with his camera crew, interviews locals about paranormal activity, investigates areas allegedly plagued by spirits and often confronts the ghosts. According to his website, Mr Bagans became convinced of an afterlife in Trenton, Mississippi, in 2002 when he confronted the spirit of a suicidal woman in his apartment complex.","Ghost Adventures host Zak Bagans bought 'portal to hell' house in January .

"A recently retired Secret Service agent told MailOnline on Thursday that former director Julia Pierson's resignation will be welcomed by the agency's rank-and-file because 'people in the service thought she was a joke from Day One.' He attributed her swift fall from grace to a cadre of 'p***ed off agents who had had enough' of feeling disrespected by the service's first female director. 'Putting her in charge was part of the [Obama] administration's push to feminize the service after the ""hookergate"" nightmare,' the agent said, referring to agents who were fired after patronizing prostitutes during a security-check trip to Colombia before President Obama's 2012 visit. Pierson resigned Wednesday following an angry, tense congressional hearing the day before, which focused on a trio of headaches that erupted in a matter of days. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Julia Pierson stepped down from her role leading the Secret Service on Wednesday following a trip of scandals that a retired agent said were caused by angry agents who 'had had enough' of her . Pierson slashed the number of uniformed Secret Service police who patrol the outer perimeter of the White House complex; a fence-jumper got all the way into the presidential mansion on Sept. 19 . The Washington Post published stories last week describing how the Secret Service was unaware for four days that a gunman had fired shots at the White House, including one that broke an upstairs window. This week more dirt surfaced, including a story in the Washington Examiner about an armed security guard who got into an elevator with Obama during his September visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The president's protective detail, it has emerged, was unaware the man was carrying a gun and hadn't vetted him at all. Also damaging to the Secret Service was a report that an intruder got far into the White House itself after he scaled the mansion's perimeter fence and sprinted nearly the length of a football field across the lawn and through an unlocked door without being apprehended. Disgruntled agents and supervisors told the Post that Pierson discussed making the elite corps that guards the president and his family 'more like Disney World' and 'more friendly.' MailOnline's source said that this caused instant turmoil among long-serving agents, including those in the Presidential Protective Division. He spoke on condition of anonymity, and said he didn't know who inside the agency had 'sandbagged her' by leaking damaging information to the press. But he said it was likely a series of deep-seated resentments that ender Pierson's career. 'As soon as she took over' 18 months ago, he said, 'the word was that she wanted to make the service softer and less macho. And that didn't sit well with anybody.' 'Even the female agents are constantly drawing on their inner tough-guy. Anyone who is willing to take a bullet for the president has to be heavy on testosterone, so she really knocked the wind out of us.' A congressional panel excoriated Pierson on Tuesday, questioning her leadership of an organization whose lapses put President Obama's life in danger . Joseph Clancy (left), shown in 2010 as part of President Obama's personal protection detail, has come out of retirement to take over the Secret Service on an interim basis until Obama appoints Pierson's successor . The Post reported Thursday that Pierson had also rejected a plan to assign about 100 countersurveillance agents to patrol the White House's perimeter, instead cutting that number by one-third. She also presided over a reduction in the numbers of uniformed Secret Service Police who protect the White House compound from the outside. And she made the controversial decision to limit the street-level security surrounding this year's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, erring on the side of allowing more automobile traffic to flow through the nation's capital. These mistakes, the retired agent said, irked him and his colleagues, including many who were not assigned to the Presidential Protective Division. 'This is a job where our loyalty to the office of the president trumps everything else,' he told MailOnline. 'What we expected from our leadership was loyalty in return, and Pierson didn't seem to understand that. She hadn't been in the field for a long time. Maybe she just forgot.' 'But cutting down the size of the White House perimeter detail was a morale-killer and I think it came back to bite her.' A spokeswoman from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association did not respond to requests for comment about the mood of the union's members during and after Pierson's tenure.","A former Secret Service agent told MailOnline that rank-and-file thought Julia Pierson 'was a joke from Day One'

'I am not retiring from all cricket as I have a two-year contract with the Sydney Thunder and, if possible, to help the Kolkata Knight Riders defend the IPL (Indian Premier League) title we won earlier this year.' With South Africa the No 1-ranked Test side in the world and a decent chance of taking their maiden World Cup title next year, Kallis leaves with the team in good shape.

"More than 140 passengers on a Delhi-bound flight from Surat had a miraculous escape on Thursday after a stray buffalo ran onto the runway as the aircraft was about to take off. Indian low cost airline SpiceJet's flight SG66 hit the animal at the airport in Magdala, in the Western state of Gujarat at around 7.25pm. As a result the airline has suspended all its services at the Surat airport for an indefinite period. While none of the aircraft's 146 passengers were injured the Boeing 737-800 aircraft's left engine was 'severely damaged' and the buffalo died on the spot. Scroll down for video . Emergency: SpiceJet flight SG66 was left grounded and damaged after hitting a stray buffalo on the runway . Buffaloes graze in fields next to Surat airport but one had escaped through a gap in the perimeter fencing . The front wheel has just left land when the collision happened, seconds before take-off. The pilot initiated an emergency stop and the plane came to a halt around bushes situated outside the runway. The pilot and co-pilot explained what had happened to passengers and drove the plane into the parking area to check the damage. Low cost airline SpiceJet has cancelled all flights to and from airport while 'corrective measures' are taken . The buffalo died at the scene although none of the aircraft's 146 passengers were injured . An alternate aircraft was arranged to fly the passengers to Delhi, which left at 10.55pm hours that night. Buffaloes graze in fields just next to the airport and are a common sight in the area but one of the animals had escaped through a gap in the perimeter fencing and had walked onto the runway. SpiceJet spokesperson Siddharth Kumar said, 'A Surat-to-Delhi SpiceJet aircraft, SG-622, carrying around 140 passengers excluding crew members hit a buffalo on Thursday during take-off roll at Surat airport. The buffalo was essentially invisible against a dark background.' Darkness:A group of people gather around the area where the buffalo hit the airplane to inspect damage . 'The passengers had a miraculous escape,' airport director Dr SD Sharma told Times of India. 'There was no breakdown of the engine or other technical fault. The aircraft hit a stray animal during take-off. The aircraft will have to undergo a thorough investigation to check the damage. We've ordered a probe into the incident. A detailed report will be in within a couple of days.' The Civil Aviation Ministry is reportedly trying to get the airline to resume flights as soon as possible but SpiceJet says it wants ""corrective measures to ensure its passengers, crew and aircraft are not put at risk again."" The Civil Aviation Ministry has ordered two inquiries by the Director General of Civil Aviation and the Airports Authority of India. A security check of airport perimeters has been ordered across all airports in the country. There have been several incidents with animals at Indian airports including a stray pig on the runway of Nagpur airport in July 2009, which a Kingfisher Airlines' aircraft hit.

"Plenty of people grow up dreaming of having or designing their very own jetpack. Well, Glenn Martin actually built one. Sixteen years and 12 prototypes later, the New Zealander reckons his flying machine is all but ready for public use. His company, Martin Aircraft, is looking to raise $25 million in a November listing on the Australian stock exchange. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO . A pilot using a Martin Aircraft Company jetpack. Martin Jetpack was invented in New Zealand by Glenn Martin and the company has just lodged a prospectus to raise A$25 million to fund the next stages of development and to bring the Jetpack to market . It took sixteen years and 12 prototypes to get the jetpack off the ground . A pilot standing next to a grounded Martin Aircraft Company jetpack which has been created by Glenn Martin . The first orders are expected to be penned next year, with the first models zooming around the skies within two years. But at an estimated $215,000 pricetag, they won't be for the man in the street. Instead, they're designed for the 'first responder' market: paramedics, firefighters, border patrol. 'We've had paramedics who've come to us and said they work in large cities, and when there's an accident they have trouble getting there because traffic's so bad,' Martin said. 'The advantage of this is that it can land in very small spaces - much smaller than a helicopter can land in - right beside an accident.' 'The company has had a 'deluge' of inquiries from companies, governments, and even the odd millionaire playboy,' Martin said. He declined to name names, but said 80 per cent of inquiries had come from the United States. The latest prototype, viewed by AAP on Thursday, is less of a jetpack than a personal rotor copter. The Martin jetpack can carry 120 kilograms and fly at up to 74 km/h for 30 minutes at altitudes of 1000 metres. The pilot navigates via two joysticks positioned next to each hand . Jetpack inventor Glenn Martin (pictured) who has designed it for the 'first responder' market: paramedics, firefighters, border patrol . Martin Jetpack Inventor Glenn Martin, (left) holds one of the safety bars fixed to the Jetpack being flown by his son Harrison Martin, 16, as they demonstrate the personal jet pack for consumers at the Experimental Aircraft Associationís AirVenture air show in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in 2008 . It's a carbon-fibre frame housing a two-litre, 200 horsepower petrol engine, which powers two large rotors positioned either side of the standing pilot. It can carry 120 kilograms and fly at up to 74 km/h for 30 minutes at altitudes of 1000 metres. The pilot navigates via two joysticks positioned next to each hand. Mr Martin, who formerly worked in pharmaceuticals, says he dreamed of his own jetpack from an early age. 'I was brought up in the 1960s, saw the space program, always wanted a jetpack, saw jetpacks on The Jetsons, Lost in Space, Thunderbirds. 'But a few years later I found that I was 21, at university, and there were no jetpacks. 'After a night drinking at a pub with a few mates, complaining, I decided to go away and research it.' To his dismay, the rocket-based technology at the time would fly jetpacks for less than 30 seconds - and a pilot had to weigh less than 70kg. 'I'm 100kg and wanted to fly longer than 26 seconds.' The Martin jetpack (pictured) us priced at an estimated $215,000 . Martin Jetpack (pictured) was invented in New Zealand by Glenn Martin and its commercialisation is now being managed by Martin Aircraft Corporation, which has just lodged a prospectus to raise A$25 million to fund the next stages of development . Jetpack inventor Glenn Martin (pictured middle) with his wife Vanessa and 16 year old son Harrison, who are both test pilots . By 1998 he'd built a prototype in his garage and was confident it could lift a human off the ground. So he strapped his wife to it. It worked, and he gave up his day job. By 2004, after a couple more prototypes, a New Zealand venture capitalist firm agreed to pour several million dollars into the project. Today, the firm has 17 employees, and has attracted interest from the likes of Google co-founder Larry Page. Mr Martin plans to show the aircraft off to potential Australian clients next year. Before it flies, the craft needs to be cleared by national aviation regulators. It's built to fit within the 'microlight' category of craft, which includes the smallest planes and powered paragliders. Certification will first be sought from the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand, which will smooth its certification in other countries. A spokesman for the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority said the organisation had met with Mr Martin last year and were aware of the jetpack. 'We're watching with interest,' the spokesman said.","New Zealander, Glenn Martin, has built a flying jetpack .

"A gay British man who has flown home after being jailed in Morocco for 'homosexual acts' has described his ordeal as a 'nightmare'. Ray Cole, 69, from Deal, Kent, was imprisoned for four months in Marrakech with his Moroccan friend after police found homosexual images on his phone. Today, after being unexpectedly freed, he told how he was kept in 'a tank of 40 or 50 people' and said the conditions were 'indescribable', adding: 'Dickens couldn't paint it any worse'. The grandfather, who flew home to Britain last night after being released on appeal yesterday, said he knew that homosexuality was illegal and said he and his friend, 20-year-old Jamal Jam Wald Nass, were careful to be 'discreet'. Scroll down for video . Ray Cole, 69, from Deal, Kent, who was jailed in Marrakech for being gay, said conditions were 'indescribable' and spoke of his relief at being freed yesterday and reunited with his children Gemma and Adrian, above . Mr Cole, who is a father and grandfather, was a victim of a 'wholesale corruption', MP Nigel Evans said today . He told ITV's This Morning: 'We were doing nothing wrong.  We were totally discreet and even though we were together, we were never touching. 'I knew that homosexuality was against the law so I respected their culture. In my experience when you are discreet you don't have any trouble. 'When we were arrested I thought at any time they were going to say it was a mistake.' Mr Cole said he and his partner were thrown into separate cells after they were stopped by officials in the street, and said he suspected the Moroccan authorities had been tipped off by a concierge at their hotel who had previously asked them for money. He said: 'At no point was I told I had been arrested, charged, or even read my rights. I had no idea what was going on. 'My phone doesn't have a password and I've later found out that they went into everything on my phone: my Facebook and even my PayPal account. 'The first few days were the worst. I was kept in a tank of about 40 or 50 people and the conditions were indescribable. Dickens couldn't paint it any worse. 'The stench was disgusting and at night there was so much noise - people slamming doors. I was totally in shock the whole time.' MP Nigel Evans, who is openly gay and is a parliamentary friend of Morocco, supported him on television this morning and said a 'wholesale corruption has taken place' Ray Cole, 69, shares an emotional reunion with his family at Gatwick Airport after returning to the UK following his release from prison in Morocco where he was sentenced to four months in prison for 'homosexual acts' Mr Cole (left) was greeted by his son Adrian (centre) and daughter Gemma  at Gatwick Airport last night . He also shared an affectionate cuddle with his granddaughter Mia-Louise on his return to the United Kingdom . He said: 'I did not expect this at all - I thought I was going to be transferred to a different prison. They gave me a choice of staying in Morocco another night or getting the next flight back. 'You would not believe it, it's horrendous. It's not a prison, it's a concentration camp. People are in there from the age of ten to 80 and 90 for nothing. I can hardly move my arm from sleeping on the floor.' When asked about the support from his family, he said: 'I'm so proud of them - I could not have a better family.' Mr Cole was on holiday in Marrakech visiting Mr Nass, with whom he had struck up a friendship on Facebook, when they were approached by police at a bus stop on September 18. Mr Cole, who turns 70 on October 25, was four weeks into a five-week break in the north African country when he was arrested on suspicion of being homosexual - a crime that carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison in the country. The grandfather (pictured with his family) was released after less than a week following a successful appeal . Mr Cole, who turns 70 this month, was on holiday in Marrakech visiting Jamal Jam Wald Nass, who he had struck up a friendship with on Facebook, when they were approached by police at a bus stop on September 18 . As well as a petition, a 'Free Ray Cole' hashtag circulated on Twitter and a Facebook page was set up calling for his release. Mr Cole said he was 'relieved' to have been reunited with his family (pictured) following his release . He was sentenced, along with Mr Nass, to four months in prison on Thursday when police searched Mr Cole's mobile phone and found a photograph of the two men together. As well as a petition, a 'Free Ray Cole' hashtag circulated on Twitter and a Facebook page was set up calling for the release of Mr Cole, who has a minor heart condition. And yesterday the Moroccan Embassy said the retired magazine publisher had been released pending an appeal. A statement read: 'Access to consular assistance and a legal defence has been duly provided to Mr Cole, who has exercised his right of appeal and is due to appear in front of the Judge of the Court of Appeals tomorrow, 8 October 2014. Mr Cole was arrested after Moroccan authorities approached him and a local man at a bus stop . 'In the meantime, Mr Cole is to be granted conditional release.' Following his release, Mr Cole's son, Adrian, 41, said: 'Our legal team in Marrakesh lodged an appeal today. 'It has moved much faster than we expected and the court was able to take the step of releasing my father. 'We would like to express our gratitude as a family to the thousands of people who have offered us their support and kindness. 'I would also like to offer my thanks to the Moroccan authorities.' It is unclear whether Mr Nass was also released. Earlier, Adrian told how the Moroccan authorities failed to notify his family or the British Consulate of his father's arrest. He was in fact feared missing for nearly a week before he was eventually able to get in contact using a fellow prisoner's phone. Mr Cole had told his family that he was being forced to live on just one daily serving of boiled vegetables. They also said he was forced to live in a dorm, designed to sleep 44 men, with 60 other men - leaving him to sleep on a concrete floor. Charlie Elphicke, MP for Dover and Deal, is urging tourists to boycott the north African country and claimed it is 'unsafe' for British citizens. He said: 'It seems a very medieval process to prosecute someone and convict them for being gay. 'I'm particularly concerned because Mr Cole is 70 years old, has suffered from ill health including heart conditions and strokes, and we really need to get him back to the UK as soon as possible. 'Anyone thinking of going to Morocco needs to seriously consider the nature of their laws and be very cautious when travelling. 'I do not think Morocco is a safe travel destination for tourists.' Mr Cole's son Adrian, 41, (pictured right) said of his father's (left) release last night: 'We would like to express our gratitude as a family to the thousands of people who have offered us their support and kindness' Pictured is the Moroccan prison where Mr Cole, a retired magazine publisher, was held. He told his family he was forced to live on just one daily serving of boiled vegetables during his imprisonment for 'homosexual acts' Adrian, who works in recruitment, has been supporting his father alongside Mr Cole's daughter Gemma Cole, 37. The grandfather-of-one's ex wife Margaret, who is also the father of his two children is also showing her support. The pair were married for 45 years before he came out as gay a few years ago and the pair have remained good friends. Mr Cole (pictured while on his trip in Marrakech) had been in the country for four weeks when he was arrested and had been due to fly home in five weeks . All three helped back a campaign on social networks Twitter and Facebook this week appealing for his release went viral. Messages of support were sent from celebrities including Stephen Fry, Clare Balding, Simon Pegg and Lord Alan Sugar. The news of the release was revealed by MP Nigel Evans who read a statement outside the Moroccan Embassy in London. It said: 'We are sympathetic to the distress felt by the family of Mr Cole following his arrest and detention and every effort has been made to address their concerns. 'Moroccan and British authorities are working closely together to resolve the case as rapidly as possible in a manner that is respectful of the norms and customs both our countries. 'Mr Cole has exercised his right of appeal and is due to appear in front of the judge of the court of appeals tomorrow morning. 'In the meantime Mr Cole is to be granted conditional release from prison today.' Following the development, Mr Evans said: 'I'm really delighted that Mr Cole will not be spending another night on the floor of a prison cell in Marrakech. 'With a bit of luck common sense will kick in and we can get him home as quickly as possible.' A statement released by the family read: 'We are delighted to announce that our father, Ray Cole, has been released from prison and is now boarding a flight from Marrakech. 'We would like to thank everyone here and in Morocco who has helped our campaign to secure the release of our wonderful father And we would like to thank the Moroccan authorities for showing clemency and compassion.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports that Mr Cole has been released. 'We have offered full consular support throughout his case and continue to do so. We remain in close contact with his family.'","Grandfather jailed for 'homosexual acts' in Morocco has now returned to UK .

"The boot that helped David Beckham to bend it and inspired Zinedine Zidane throughout his illustrious career is celebrating its 20th anniversary with a retro, limited edition design. Adidas revealed the new Predator Instinct boot which is a throwback to the original black boot, with red tongue, created by former Liverpool star Craig Johnston in 1994. Johnston's iconic prototype, which had the front of a table tennis pad held onto the boot by a rubber band, was purchased by the German sports giants two decades ago after the Aussie convinced legends Franz Beckenbauer, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Paul Breitner to test them.

"Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has warned that Hamas and ISIS are 'branches of the same poisonous tree', both bent on world domination through terror, just as the Nazis were. In a blistering speech to the United Nations, Mr Netanyahu also hit back at Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, who accused Israel last week of carrying out war crimes and waging a 'war of genocide' during the fighting in Gaza. The Israeli leader said Hamas committed 'the real war crimes' in Gaza by using Palestinian civilians as human shields. Scroll down for video . Mr Netanyahu said ISIS and Hamas had the same 'ultimate goals' in a speech to the UN in New York . Addressing the UN General Assembly's annual ministerial meeting in New York, the Israeli leader argued that Israel's fight against Hamas and the US military campaign against the Islamic State are part of the same cause - the defeat of Islamic extremism. Mr Netanyahu railed against world leaders for simultaneously condemning the Jewish state for its war with Hamas and praising president Barack Obama for attacking Islamic State militants and other extremists in Syria and Iraq. The prime minister said that ISIS and Hamas are 'branches of the same poisonous tree'. The PM claims Hamas used Palestinians as human shields during Israeli air strikes on Gaza, above . He added that 'when it comes to its ultimate goals', Hamas is ISIS, and ISIS is Hamas. Mr Netanyahu said ISIS and Hamas, as well as other Muslim extremist movements, from al-Qaeda and Nigeria's Boko Haram to Somalia's al-Shabab and Lebanon's Hezbollah, share the goal of imposing militant Islam on the world. He likened them to Nazism - 'another fanatic ideology that swept into power eight decades ago'. To protect global peace and security, he said, 'we must remove this cancer before it's too late'. Turning to another regional enemy, Mr Netanyahu warned that the gravest threat to the world today is the danger of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. 'It's one thing to confront militant Islamists on pick-up trucks, armed with Kalashnikov rifles. It's another thing to confront militant Islamists armed with weapons of mass destruction,' he said. The Israeli leader added that Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's condemnation of the spread of terrorism last week amounted to 'one of history's greatest displays of doubletalk'. Mr Netanyahu said US strikes on ISIS targets, such as in Fallujah, Iraq, above, and Israel's fight against Hamas were essential in the fight against Islamic extremism . He accused Iran itself of mounting terrorist attacks all around the world, and lumped the country in with Islamic extremist movements. 'To say that Iran doesn't practice terrorism is like saying Derek Jeter never played shortstop for the New York Yankees,' he said. And Mr Netanyahu criticised the efforts of six world powers to reach a nuclear deal with Iran, saying: 'To defeat [ISIS] and leave Iran as a threshold nuclear power is to win the battle and lose the war.' He also launched a scathing attack on the UN Human Rights Council, accusing it of continually singling out Israel for criticism when other parts of the world are awash in atrocities. He called the Human Rights Council's name 'an oxymoron' and charged that the body has become 'a terrorist rights council'. The Israeli PM also attacked the UN Human Rights Council for its criticism of Israel's recent military action in Gaza, above . Mr Netanyahu said the council's treatment of Israel reflects 'the return of one of the world's oldest prejudices'. 'It's called anti-Semitism. It is now spreading in polite society, where it masquerades as legitimate criticism of Israel,' he said. Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's executive committee, said Mr Netanyahu's speech was 'a blatant manipulation of facts' aimed at misleading world leaders 'through a combination of hate language, slander and argument of obfuscation'. The Israeli leader dismissed Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's recent condemnation of the spread of terrorism, saying the country mounted attacks all around the world . In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki took issue with Netanyahu over the similarities between Hamas and Islamic State. She said that while the US considers both terrorist organisations, 'we obviously believe that [Islamic State] poses a different threat to the United States'. Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator, said Mr Netanyahu, in his remarks, 'buried' the possibility of a two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on the pre-war borders of 1967. Mr Erekat also complained that Mr Netanyahu branded those who dare to stand up to Israel as anti-Semites.","Netanyahu likens Muslim extremist movements around the world to Nazis .

"Plans that could see treated sewage water be introduced into London's drinking supply have been backed by two in three people. Last year Thames Water launched a consultation to look at how they could increase the amount of water they would need in the future as the population increases. One of the options to ensure the Thames Water area has enough water to go around was to look at schemes such as waste water recycling. Last year Thames Water launched a consultation to ask customers their thoughts on seeing waste water treated and put back into the mains supply (file picture) This would see waste from toilets recycled back into the River Thames, drawn out and treated again to make it safe to go into the mains supply, to flow out from kitchen taps, which is common practice around the world. And the survey showed that 69 per cent of the people who responded to the section 'Making sure there's enough water to go round' supported the idea of recycling waste water as 'the right plan to follow'. This is despite some customers voicing their concerns about the option of treated sewage being in drinking supplies. The company has already set up a test plant in Enfield, north London, which is experimenting with the toilet waste recycling method. The survey showed that 69 per cent of people agreed that Thames Water should look into waste water recycling (file picture) However, a Thames Water spokesman said there are no definite plans as yet to implement the scheme. The scheme could see waste water from toilets recycled back into the River Thames, drawn out and treated again to make it safe to go drink . He said: 'This waste water re-use we are asking for our customers views on is not something we are planning to implement any time soon. 'This is something we see as a longer-term measure and if implemented at all it would be in 2025.' The survey was prompted after estimates that the population of London and the Thames Valley could move towards ten million people. The firm say that unless action is taken, there could be a water deficit of around 125 million litres per day by next year. Other options people backed were installing water meters in homes and businesses as well as bringing in water from other parts of the country at times of drought. Today, a Thames Water spokesman added: 'In summer 2013, we published our draft proposals for how we will maintain and improve the services we provide to our customers for the five years from 2015 to 2020. 'Our draft five-year plan provides a summary of the work we believe is required between 2015 and 2020 to ensure we continue to provide high-quality water and sewerage services across London and the Thames Valley. 'We held an eight-week consultation and spoke to over 5,000 people at 22 road show events across our supply area, encouraging them give us their views and discussing our plans. 'Over 2,700 customers visited our 'Have your say' website, and nearly 400 of them used our interactive tool to see how the proposals could affect bills.'","Thames Water launched a consultation to look at increasing water supplies .

"Louis van Gaal may be irritated about Manchester United's exhausting pre-season programme, but the Dutchman can thank his lucky stars that he is no longer manager of Bayern Munich. Van Gaal complained last week that his side's commercial responsibilities in touring the USA were 'not very positive preparation' for a Premier League season. But he may wish to spare a thought for some of his former charges. Bayern Munich's tour of the USA looks set to be the most gruelling of the lot, with some of their players not even getting the chance to sleep on the tour. VIDEO Scroll down for Pitch invader takes a selfie with Bayern Munich star Javi Martinez . Checking in: Winger Franck Ribery checks in ahead of Bayern Munich's tour of America . All smiles: New signing Juan Bernat (left) shares a joke with Bayern Munich midfielder Javi Martinez . World Cup winners Lahm, Muller, Gotze, Boateng and Neuer, along with semi-finalists Robben and Dante, will join the squad next Wednesday. The club will play a friendly against Guadalajara, and finish with a fixture against the MLS All Stars. The latter being the headline attraction of the tour, Bayern are not prepared to do without their big names, and have demanded that their World Cup stars return from holiday to spend just one day in the States. That means that the likes of Lahm, Neuer and Robben face a nightmare 34 hour trip. Leaving Munich at 10am on Wednesday 6th August, they will be back in the city by 8pm the following day. The players will arrive in the US, play the match, and leave for Munich again without so much as an overnight stop. Of all the World Cup latecomers, only Jerome Boateng has been spared the gruesome round trip, but only by virtue of the fact that he is already on holiday in the US. Pre-season schedule: Pep Guardiola will manage Bayern Munich against Guadalajara and the MLS All Stars . With worries about Bayern's usually poor post-World Cup form, forcing an energy sapping trip such as this one on the players certainly seems rash. But just as van Gaal has found to his chagrin at United, the 'commercial activities' of a club come before the welfare of the players in pre-season. For Bayern, this summer is a huge opportunity to try and break the American market. They are set to open a new offices in New York during the tour, and will be looking to capitalise on the World Cup success of the US national team under former Bayern player Jurgen Klinsmann. There has already been one setback for Bayern's PR machine, though, with chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge unable to take part in the tour, having been denied a visa. The US consulate in Germany has admitted that there is a „global problem“ with the visa system at the moment. Six of Bayern's youth players have also been affected, and are now unable to join the squad as planned. VIDEO Guardiola ready for US trip . Selfie time!
