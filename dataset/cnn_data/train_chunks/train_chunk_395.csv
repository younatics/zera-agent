"Washington (CNN) -- The Census Bureau is expected to release results of the 2010 Census on Tuesday, the first look at how the country has changed over the last decade. ""The 2010 Census began last January in a remote corner of Alaska and in the months that followed, America stepped up and achieved a successful Census,"" the bureau said on its website. ""Beginning this month, the nation will see the first results from the 2010 Census as a new portrait of America begins to take shape."" The U.S. Constitution mandates that a Census be conducted every 10 years to track population shifts in the country. Its primary purpose is to determine how many people live in the United States and which states will gain congressional seats and electoral votes and which states will lose them. But Census population figures are also used to distribute federal funds to states and communities. The 2010 Census form had 10 questions -- the shortest one in U.S. history -- and surveyed some 134 million households either by mail or in person to collect the data. About 2 million Census workers were hired for the job. About 74 percent of households returned the form, matching the rate in 2000, according to the bureau. The new Census numbers will be the basis for congressional reapportionment, as the states divvy up the 435 seats in the House of Representatives. The report will likely kick off a fight next year between Democrats and Republicans over redistricting, as states gaining or losing seats will have to draw new districts. But even most states which are assigned the same number of House seats may redraw the boundaries of their congressional districts to make each one roughly equal when it comes to population. In states where one party dominates, the redistricting process could give that party an advantage, and the results could have a big impact on the 2012 battle for control of Congress. The Census numbers could also have a big impact on the next race for the White House, as some states will gain or lose electoral votes, and thus influence over the outcome of the next presidential race. Texas is expected to be a big winner in the process. An estimate by Election Data Services, a political consulting firm that specializes in redistricting, suggests that Texas will likely gain four congressional seats, with Florida adding as many as two, and Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah, and Washington state possibly each gaining a seat. According to the estimate, Ohio and New York could be the big losers, with each state likely losing two seats. Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania may each lose a seat. It is expected that California will remain steady at 53 seats, the largest congressional state delegation in the country. CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this story.","Census results are used for congressional reapportionment .

"(CNN) -- ""The moment I got into the modeling industry, I knew I had to be an entrepreneur,"" says former supermodel Iman. One of the most recognized models of the 1970s and '80s, Iman has used her entrepreneurial skills to great effect in the fashion industry, with her own cosmetics business and in her charitable fund-raising work. Married to rock star David Bowie and now residing in New York, Iman was born in Somalia in 1955. Her father was an ambassador, but her comfortable upbringing was disrupted in 1969 with the assassination of Somalia's president, forcing her and her family to flee to Kenya. ""We left Somalia with nothing but the clothes on our back. Not even photographs, nothing. So it's a total loss of everything and a total loss of your own self, your own country, your own place in terms of your people. If you're lucky you're in a country that will give you a second chance,"" she told CNN. She was lucky and her adopted home of Kenya provided her with a scholarship at Nairobi University, and it was also in the Kenyan capital that she was discovered as a model. Stopped on a Nairobi street by fashion photographer Peter Beard, she was soon signed by a top model agency and moved to New York in 1975. With her exotic looks she caused a stir in the fashion world, helped in part by a fanciful story about her background spread by Beard. ""They wanted to believe because it's kind of like 'My Fair Lady'. Everything about that article was fabricated... I was discovered herding goats and discovered in the jungle; I've never seen the jungle in my life. I was a city girl,"" she said. Iman admits she was complicit in the fabrication, suggesting an early realization that the fashion industry was built around control and manipulation. ""I had to be very clever about not over exposing myself, not under exposing myself. I had to make sure that I knew my worth that I would not settle if they gave me less. I knew how to walk away. It's very key."" After facing numerous challenges being a black model, she launched Iman Cosmetics in 1994, designed for models no matter the color of their skin. A hugely successful catwalk career as a model ended in 1989, but she faced up to the transitory nature of her career and gained a greater sense of self long before that when she was injured in a car accident in 1983. ""Where everything was about what you do and about how you look, it changed to more security about me. It was not about 'how will I look ten years from now?' It all became about what kind of person would I be ten years from now. ""Because of it I became very comfortable in my own skin. In a weird way I didn't think about outward looks anymore,"" she said.","Former supermodel Iman now has own multi-million dollar cosmetics business .

"One name stands out on the guest list of thousands of youth at a conference in Ecuador this week: Elian Gonzalez. Fourteen years after he made headlines as the subject of a bitter international custody battle, Gonzalez spoke to CNN on Tuesday. It's his first trip abroad since the U.S. government removed him at gunpoint from his relatives' home in Miami and, after a legal battle, sent him back to Cuba to live with his father. Gonzalez, who turned 20 last week, was just 6 years old when he was found clinging to an inner tube after the tiny boat he was traveling in from Cuba sank on the way to the United States. Gonzalez's mother and nine other people in the boat drowned. He had harsh words for the United States on Tuesday as he recalled his mother's deadly journey. ""Just like her, many others have died attempting to go to the United States. But it's the U.S. government's fault. Their unjust embargo provokes an internal and critical economic situation in Cuba,"" Gonzalez said. ""But, despite that, Cuba, even with all its problems has progressed over the years. The progress we've made is all thanks to Cuba's courage, our dignity, our continued fight for a more just model."" Gonzalez is in Quito, Ecuador, for the World Festival of Youth and Students, a left-wing conference attracting more than 10,000 people from all over the world to discuss global struggles against imperialism. He told CNN en Español that he has been asked to speak at the conference, but isn't quite sure what his topic will be. ""My topic could range anywhere from the lifting of the unjust blockade on Cuba to the freedom of the 'Cuban Five.' The main reason we're here is because we want a revolutionary progressive movement that leads to socialism,"" he said. The five Cubans imprisoned in the United States are convicted on charges of espionage, but are considered heroes in Cuba because many believe they prevented acts of terrorism on the island. After his rescue in 1999, Gonzalez was placed with relatives in Miami, who wanted to keep him in the United States. But Gonzalez's father, Juan Miguel, fought to bring him back to Cuba. Then-Cuban leader Fidel Castro led massive protests in Cuba demanding Gonzalez's return. The case of the telegenic boy became a flashpoint between supporters and opponents of Castro's revolution. As the two sides fought the high-profile case in court, U.S. immigration officials decided to put Gonzalez in the custody of his father, who had come to the United States to argue for Elian's return. His relatives in Miami refused to go along, and armed U.S. federal agents then raided the home of Gonzalez's uncle and seized the boy. Some experts at the time worried Gonzalez would suffer a lifetime of trauma as a result of the dispute, or become a political pawn for the Cuban government. After Gonzalez's return to Cuba, the government there celebrated a political victory but largely kept Gonzalez out of public view and surrounded by government bodyguards. But the case had an undeniable impact on Gonzalez's life. Fidel Castro attended his 7th birthday party. His father went from being a waiter to being a member of the country's national assembly. Now he studies engineering at a military school in Cuba and appears to be emerging as a new spokesman for the Cuban government. When asked by CNN en Español to describe what his life has been like since he left Miami, Gonzalez said ""magnificent."" In Cuba, he said, everywhere he goes he feels the love and support of his fellow Cubans. ""I haven't suffered any consequences because of what happened. It has not affected me psychologically, but it has been hard for my family,"" Gonzalez said. ""Those were tough times.""","Elian Gonzalez tells CNN he's happy in Cuba .

"If an airline loses or delays your bag, can you trust it to let you know how much money you're entitled to? One passenger says don't count on it. She's suing Delta Air Lines for breach of contract, alleging that the carrier leaves fliers in the dark about the compensation they're entitled to when their bags vanish. The U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to pay up to $3,300 per passenger if bags are ""lost, damaged, delayed or pilfered"" on a domestic flight. But lawyers for Susan Miller say Delta ""uniformly and systematically"" ignores this rule and often tells passengers they are only entitled to $25 to $50 a day in expenses. Delta has not responded to a request for comment, but it's not the first time the company has faced this complaint: Last year, the DOT fined the airline $100,000 for failing to comply with the government rule. Miller, a Florida resident, says she flew on Delta from Miami to Las Vegas in November of 2010. When she arrived at her destination, Miller discovered that the airline had lost her baggage, leaving her without any warm clothes or essentials, according to a class action complaint filed in the U.S. District Court in Southern Florida earlier this month. Miller then had to spend more than $315 to buy replacement toiletries, medication and other items, but when she raised the issue with Delta, she was told nothing could be done to help her, the court documents say. The bag turned up a couple of days later, her attorney David  Tucker said. DOT spokesman Bill Mosley declined to comment on this specific case, but said in general, carriers are not supposed to limit compensation when passengers are forced to buy essentials after their bags are delayed. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood has echoed this sentiment in the past. ""Travelers should not have to pay for toiletries or other necessities while they wait for baggage misplaced by airlines,"" LaHood said in a 2009 memo warning airlines not to improperly limit reimbursements. A few weeks after her flight, Miller made a claim with Delta for her expenses, which was ""rejected and/or ignored,"" her lawyers say. ""What happened to (Miller) happens every day to Delta passengers whose bags are delayed,"" the complaint alleges. ""Such tactics allow Delta to pocket millions and millions it would have had to pay out if it had abided by its contracts with passengers."" Miller is suing on behalf of herself and other Delta passengers who have found themselves in a similar situation. The class action is asking for a jury trial to award direct, compensatory and punitive damages.","Passenger says Delta lost her bag, then did nothing when she spent $315 for necessities .

"If you're a business traveler in Europe, you'll no doubt have complained at length about the regions' airlines, be it the cost of a plane ticket, the quality of the food or the delays. It's natural to feel hard done-by. If it's any consolation, however, you're not the only one grumbling at the unfairness of it all. According to the IATA (International Air Transport Association)  2013 is expected to be another profitless year for the European airline industry. Tony Tyler, IATA's director general and CEO, argues that the industry is ""balancing on a knife edge"" with even the sturdiest and more established airlines feeling the pressure. You only have to look at the profits forecast for the year to see how behind we really are. According to the Association of European Airlines, the sector is expected to lose $1.5 billion this year. U.S. carriers however, are expected to fare better and post profits totalling $3.4 billion. Tyler argues this disparity is in part down to sluggish economic growth in Europe; crucially, however, it can also be impacted by what he calls ""onerous"" EU regulation and legislation. As an example, he cites delays: ""There can be delays absolutely outside the control of the airline, but the airline still has to not only compensate the passenger but also to meet a whole lot of costs of those delays for passengers."" The additional costs don't end there either: air traffic control costs are roughly double in Europe than they are in the United States. The costs vary on land too. Europe's economic crisis has meant some governments have increased airport operating charges. In an opinion piece in Spain's El Pais, Tony Tyler argues that European airlines face ""significant hurdles to sustained profitability, starting with the cost of airport and airways infrastructure."" Spain's Madrid and Barcelona airports are a case in point: there, Tyler says, airlines have seen a 50% increase in charges. Despite cutting legacy costs through mergers, consolidation and restructuring, European carriers are still facing the heavy hand of regulation and government, adds Tyler. ""Just look at what's happening now in Spain with Iberia for example; very difficult to do the necessary restructuring in that environment"". Tyler is referring to battle between IAG (International Airlines Group) and the Spanish government. Whilst IAG's Chief Executive, Willie Walsh, wants to cut jobs and restructure the loss-making airline, the Spanish government is wary of a shrinking brand Iberia, which it argues is closely associated with 'brand España'. Speaking to me from Geneva, Tony Tyler called on governments to do more to help European carriers. He argues they can start by helping to control cost, by adding more runways, and repelling ""some of the excessively onerous consumer protection regulation."" In his words, to make Europe's airlines more competitive, government needs ""to back off."" But in a time of great economic crisis in Europe, where each country is facing their own internal struggle, backing off may just be too painful for government.","Tyler called on governments to do more to help European carriers, writes Soares .

"Washington (CNN) -- From Hollywood to Washington, the outrage is spreading over Sony Pictures' decision to cancel a movie release following a cyber attack and threats from a group of North Korea-backed hackers. Politicians urged Sony not to back down in the face of threats tied to the release of the controversial comedy ""The Interview,"" and then began lashing out when the studio made it clear it has no further plans to release the film, which depicts an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Republican Rep. Ed Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, slammed Sony's decision Thursday as a ""capitulation"" to the North Korean dictator and called for the U.S. to rally the international community and severely sanction North Korea for carrying out what he called a ""cyber war."" FBI investigators tracked the hackers who broke into Sony's servers, published private information and threatened moviegoers back to the North Korean regime, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN on Wednesday. The North Korean regime slammed the movie this summer as ""terrorism and a war action."" And despite the hackers' threat to attack movie theaters, the Department of Homeland Security has said ""there is no credible intelligence"" supporting an active plot against movie theaters. And President Barack Obama urged people to ""go to the movies."" ""Once you capitulate to one dictator, does that mean that the next dictator or the next terrorist that says you're not going to make a comedy about -- or a film at all about ISIS,"" Royce said. ""All of us in public life have a responsibility right now to speak out and to say, 'No, Sony, you did the wrong thing' and to say to Hollywood, come behind -- the other studios should come behind Sony and offer their support."" Royce said the U.S. should get international support to sanction North Korea and cut off its access to financial institutions. Watch out world: North Korea deep into cyber warfare, defector says . More broadly, Royce said Sony's decision to ""self-censor"" undercuts U.S. efforts to promote freedom throughout the world, including in the hermit kingdom. ""That's what's most worrisome about this decision,"" Royce said. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney also urged Sony, ""don't cave, fight"" in a tweet on Wednesday. Sen. John McCain, the incoming chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called Sony's decision ""profoundly troubling"" in a statement. ""That decision sets a troubling precedent that will only empower and embolden bad actors to use cyber as an offensive weapon even more aggressively in the future,"" McCain said in a statement Thursday. But McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential nominee, pinned the Sony debacle on the Obama administration for failing to ""satisfactorily address"" cyber warfare. McCain pointed to Iranian, Russian and Chinese attacks on government and private financial sectors and said the Obama administration has failed to ""deter our adversaries."" But Congress has also failed to tackle cybersecurity, failing to pass legislation before the end of the 113th Congress that would have beefed up public-private sector partnerships to fend off cyber attacks, which are on the rise. And Congress needs to tackle that type of comprehensive legislation, McCain said in the statement. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, a Republican and Air Force veteran, didn't pull any punches as he linked the Sony decision to recent events. And Rep. Steve Israel, a top-ranking Democrat, called on Sony Pictures to release ""The Interview"" on DVD and tweeted ""we should not let a pathological regime in N. Korea intimidate us."" He added that he would be the first online to see the movie. .","Rep. Ed Royce called the decision a ""capitulation"" and called for sanctions to punish North Korea for a ""cyber war""

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Sue Schwartz says she's been called a racist so many times she doesn't mind the label anymore. If wanting immigrants to enter the country legally, like her great-grandparents from Mexico, and obey the laws of the land makes her racist, then so be it, she says firmly. ""I'm getting to the point I wear it with pride,"" says Schwartz, a lifelong Arizonan who has warily watched the growth of the illegal immigrant population in the state over the course of her life. About 500,000 unauthorized immigrants were believed to live in Arizona in 2008, and 11.9 million nationwide, up from 3.5 million nationwide in 1990, according to a Pew Hispanic Center report published in 2009. This year, the tide is finally turning in her favor, she says, with the passage of SB 1070, aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration. The new law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there is reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. Read the full text of Senate Bill 1070 (PDF) ""I hope it makes a lot of them leave on their own, self-deportation. Hopefully that'll open up more jobs. There's a lot of people here who will do menial jobs -- maybe not pick lettuce, but these people aren't just picking lettuce any more,"" says Schwartz. The new law also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. What will Arizona immigration law do? Schwartz, a retired USPS worker, says undocumented workers are taking jobs from citizens like her teenage granddaughter, who hasn't been able to find a job since she began looking after she turned 15. ""She can't even work at the Hometown Buffet if she doesn't speak Spanish. How fair is that?"" she said. But Schwartz and some other Americans with Hispanic backgrounds who spoke with CNN say the problem with illegal immigrants isn't just the jobs they take. It's how they're overrunning  towns like Phoenix, turning them into ""mini-Mexicos"" with their trash-filled streets and loud music, according to Schwartz. Of equal concern to her friend, Martha Payan, is how she claims illegal immigrants ""fleece"" government coffers by collecting welfare on multiple children, or vanish without a trace after an arrest or a hospital visit. The two women, who became acquainted through various demonstrations in the metro Phoenix area, met Thursday to discuss their views outside the Maricopa County Municipal building, as more backlash against the controversial immigration law continued to flood the city. Latin pop star Shakira arrived in town Thursday to discuss SB 1070 with Mayor Phil Gordon, who has vowed to fight the law. This comes a day after Mexico urged its citizens not to travel to Arizona. Sporting a white baseball cap that that reads, ""100% American Citizen,"" Schwartz says she believes that SB 1070 came about because law enforcement in Phoenix was fed up over not being able to ask suspects about their immigration status. ""Any time an American does something wrong or breaks the law they're going to pay the consequences. Whenever an illegal does something wrong they get a new ID and become a new person,"" she says. ""I want the laws same for everybody here, not bent for them."" The 59-year-old mother of four adult children says her Mexican parents and grandparents taught her a respect for the law at an early age. Her grandmother, who lived in Juarez, Mexico, after being kicked out of the United States for smuggling drugs, encouraged her to get a good education and speak English, her second language, outside of the home. ""If I entered another country illegally I'd go to jail, yet they're demanding better treatment than their government would give us,"" she says. iReport: Share your thoughts on immigration policy . Anna Gaines, a Mexican-born U.S. citizen, says she took up the fight against illegal immigration after becoming disillusioned by the attitudes of immigrant families that she witnessed as a teacher in the Paradise Valley School District in Paradise, Arizona. ""Many of these families were having one child after another just to earn a paycheck from the U.S. government and they didn't care about their children's education,"" says Gaines, the controversial founder of American Citizens United, a grass-roots organization known for its extreme views on immigration enforcement. ""They didn't want to contribute, just take."" Gaines, who came to the United States as a nurse on a work visa during the Vietnam War and met her current husband, says she thinks immigrants have changed over the years. ""There used to be a level of dignity and self-respect. They were hard-working people who wanted to contribute to American society because it was better than where they came from,"" says Gaines, a petite woman in her 70s. ""But our government has been giving them handouts for so long that now they expect them."" Gaines says SB 1070 mirrors federal law on fortifying the borders, allowing local officials to enforce immigration law in a manner that the federal government should have been doing all along. ""We as Americans have the right to defend this country's laws. There's nothing racist about protecting the country,"" she says. Payan, originally from Puerto Rico, hopes the law will deter future illegal immigration. ""I hope it stops trespassers and lets people know the law is the law and you cross that border illegally, it's a crime,"" she says. Payan has also been called ""traidora,"" or traitor, by neighbors in her primarily Hispanic neighborhood who know how she feels about illegal immigrants. ""They know how I feel. I don't hide my feeling,"" she says. ""I've already had by apartment broken into and had my car hit by an illegal. What more do I have to lose?""","Woman who supports the new immigration law says she  has been called racist .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge will hear arguments Monday on a temporary restraining order against an Oklahoma referendum that would ban the use of Islamic religious law in state courts. Oklahoma voters approved the amendment during the November elections by a 7-3 ratio. But the Council on American-Islamic Relations challenged the measure as a violation of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and U.S. District Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange issued a temporary restraining order November 8 that will keep state election officials from certifying that vote. ""What this amendment is going to do is officially disfavor and condemn the Muslim community as being a threat to Oklahoma,"" Muneer Awad, executive director of CAIR's Oklahoma chapter and the lead plaintiff in the suit, said earlier this month. In addition, he said, the amendment would invalidate private documents, such as wills, that are written in compliance with Muslim law. The amendment would require Oklahoma courts to ""rely on federal and state law when deciding cases"" and ""forbids courts from considering or using"" either international law or Islamic religious law, known as Sharia, which the amendment defined as being based on the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed. In bringing suit, CAIR argued that the amendment violates both the establishment and free-exercise clauses of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom. Awad has said the amendment passed ""under a campaign of fearmongering"" about Islam. The entire U.S. Muslim population is about 2.4 million -- less than 1 percent of the country, according to a 2009 survey by the nonprofit Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. But supporters said a New Jersey case, in which a judge refused to grant a restraining order against a Muslim man whose wife accused him of raping her repeatedly, made it necessary for Oklahoma to take action to keep Islamic law from being imposed there. The New Jersey decision, in which the family court judge found the husband was abiding by his Muslim beliefs regarding spousal duties, was overruled by an appellate court. But in automated phone messages in support of the amendment, former CIA Director and Oklahoma native James Woolsey warned that there was a ""major campaign in Europe to impose Sharia law"" and that Islamic law ""is beginning to be cited in a few U.S courts.""","Oklahoma voters approve an amendment barring the use of Islamic law in state courts .

"(CNN) -- The Serbian capital of Belgrade and the lavish Claridge's Hotel in the heart of London might be more than 1,000 miles apart, but for one day some seven decades ago the two places came much closer. On 17 July 1945, Queen Alexandria of Yugoslavia gave birth to her son, Crown Prince Alexander, in the hotel's 212 suite. Then British Prime Minister Winston Churchill designated the room Yugoslavian territory for the day so that the baby prince could retain his right to the throne. ""It was an extraordinary act that he did,"" recalls Crown Prince Alexander. In 1941, Germany invaded and occupied Yugoslavia forcing the country's King -- Peter II -- to move into exile in London. Later on, he was banned from returning home by the Communist government that followed World War II . Alexander, who was baptized by Queen Elizabeth and her father King George, grew up abroad and only visited his country for the first time in 1991. Ten years later, he returned to live in Belgrade after the country's government decided to give him and his family the right to use the city's royal palaces, which were taken from the royals when they were stripped of their possessions and citizenship by the communists. ""I never thought we'd come back here -- I really didn't,"" he says. The power of religion . After decades abroad, the return home signaled many first experiences for the Crown Prince -- and one of those included celebrating the Patron Saint Day of the Royal Family, St. Andrew the First, in Serbia. ""It's even more meaningful doing it at home, very much so,"" says Alexander, who has today a strictly ceremonial role. The Serbian Orthodox religion is closely bound to the country's identity -- around 85% of the 7.2 million population declare themselves as Orthodox. Since his return in 2001, Crown Prince Alexander has enjoyed the feast of St. Andrew as an open, inter faith celebration -- a turning point for Serbian history. ""It's wonderful and very moving for me to see that he has accomplished that because they're all together sitting and talking to each other,"" says the Crown Prince's wife, Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Katherine.

"With a congressional hearing set for week's end, President Obama vowed Monday to hold the Internal Revenue Service accountable if reports of political targeting turn out to be true. ""If in fact IRS personnel engaged in the kind of practices that have been reported on and were intentionally targeting conservative groups, then that's outrageous.  And there's no place for it,"" Obama told reporters. ""And they have to be held fully accountable. Because the IRS as an independent agency requires absolute integrity, and people have to have confidence that they're ... applying the laws in a nonpartisan way."" Documents set to be released this week by the IRS watchdog show that the agency targeted tea party organizations and other groups focused on government spending and the federal debt that were seeking tax-exempt status. The IRS also applied extra scrutiny to applicants with statements that ""criticize how the country is run"" or that sought to educate the public on how to ""make America a better place to live,"" designations that would have included conservative political groups looking to apply for 501(c)(4) status. Those disclosures are included in the appendix of an inspector general's report, obtained by CNN, that has caused widespread anger among lawmakers on both sides of the aisle as well as conservative groups. CNNMoney: What's behind the IRS flap . An IRS official admitted Friday that the agency made ""mistakes"" in the past few years with tax-exempt status applications submitted by groups with the words ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their names. Multiple conservative groups have said their applications were delayed and returned with lengthy requests for supporting materials, sometimes including website printouts and lists of guest speakers. Obama said he learned of the allegations through news reports on Friday and didn't want to comment on any findings by the Treasury Department inspector-general that oversees the IRS -- but if true, he said, ""It is contrary to our traditions, and people have to be held accountable, and it's got to be fixed.

""The Committee on Ways and Means will get to the bottom of this practice and ensure it never takes place again,"" Camp said in a statement announcing the hearings. Rep. Sander Levin, the panel's ranking Democrat, added that ""a thorough and bipartisan investigation and effective remedial action"" was essential. And in the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus called for a full investigation as well. ""We need to know who knew what, and exactly what mistakes were made,"" said Baucus, D-Montana. ""The American people have questions for the IRS and I intend to get answers."" IRS officials knew of agents' tea party targeting in 2011 . In 2010, Baucus called on the IRS to look into whether some groups were abusing their tax-exempt status by making politics their primary activity. Sen. Orrin Hatch, the committee's top Republican, wrote a letter to Baucus calling for an immediate hearing. ""Bipartisanship on this issue is critical since both Democrats and Republicans have expressed considerable interest in these matters over the past couple of years,"" Hatch wrote.  ""As the sole committee of jurisdiction over the IRS, it is critical that Finance Committee play a leadership role in examining this issue."" Flood of tax-exempt claims followed court ruling . The applications in question were processed by an office in Cincinnati that handles most applications for 501(c)(4) status and had seen the number of applications rise sharply beginning in 2010, the year of the Supreme Court's Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling, which blessed unlimited campaign spending by corporations. Tax-exempt groups became a popular channel for the new wave of political spending. Marcus Owens, the former director of the IRS division under fire, said the IRS receives about 60,000 applications for tax-exempt status every year. Most of them are from civic groups like parent-teacher associations, scout troops or sports leagues, and they're quickly approved. But Owens said organizations seeking tax exemptions that appear to be involved in politics should get a closer look from the IRS based on their actions -- ""but not by name, like they were here, which was a mistake."" The inspector-general's report indicated the agency's practice of singling out conservative groups began as early as March 2010, and in July of that year, unidentified managers within the agency ""requested its specialists to be on the lookout for tea party applications."" In August, specialists were warned to be on the lookout for ""various local organizations in the tea party movement"" applying for tax-exempt status. Timeline: IRS wrestled with which groups to scrutinize . In June 2011, a briefing paper noted that groups focused on government spending and debt, as well as organizations criticizing how the government was being run, were also singled out for extra inspection. Officials at the Internal Revenue Service knew in June 2011 that their agents were targeting conservative groups for additional scrutiny on tax documents, the report indicates. Owens said the IRS used to have a set of ""tripwire"" actions that drew the agency's attention, but he said those standards were largely abandoned during a reorganization in the early 2000s. The reorganization was aimed at finding more money, and tax-exempt groups ""don't produce any tax revenue for the government regardless."" ""What was wrong was using criteria that look like they were focused only on one end of the political spectrum,"" Owens said. Craig Holman, who monitors campaign spending for the liberal watchdog group Public Citizen, said the ""vast majority"" of 501(c)4) groups are legitimate. But the others are ""primarily involved in elections"" and helped funnel more than $1.2 billion in secretive campaign money into the 2012 elections, and the IRS needs to crack down on them, he said. ""They should not be partisan, or single out the tea party,"" Holman said. ""But they should look for political groups, and they're not. They never prevented any of them from registering as nonprofit social welfare organizations."" And now that the issue has become a political hot potato, they're not likely to, he said. ""This controversy means they will never enforce the tax code,"" he said. ""We are going to see the IRS hide."" Who knew what, and when? Lois Lerner, the head of the Cincinnati-based IRS office that oversees tax-exempt groups, did not respond to requests for comment from CNN on Monday. Lerner is the IRS official who publicly admitted Friday that agents used the keywords ""tea party"" and ""patriot"" to flag applications for further review -- but she stressed that was done as a ""shortcut"" for picking the applications to review, not out of ""political bias."" Lerner said in a Friday conference call that she ""did not feel comfortable answering"" as to when senior IRS officials became aware of the situation. She said the IRS has implemented changes to prevent similar mistakes in the future but could not say that any IRS employees had been disciplined. But a congressional source familiar with the inquiry understood that Lerner knew of the targeting in 2011 and sent letters to Congress this year without disclosing the extent of her knowledge. And Republicans are questioning why Miller -- who the IRS said was informed of the problem in May 2012 -- didn't raise it when lawmakers asked questions about the issue the following June and July. ""An apology is not sufficient,"" Camp said.  ""There have been enough excuses and delays, and now it is time for the IRS to answer to the American people."" Opinion: IRS abuses power in targeting tea party . The IRS did not respond to questions about why Miller didn't inform Congress nor to questions about when its previous commissioner, Doug Shulman, found out. Shulman told a March 2012 Ways and Means hearing that his agency did not target conservative groups for political reasons. ""I can give you assurances. We pride ourselves in being a nonpolitical, nonpartisan organization,"" said Shulman, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. ""There is absolutely no targeting. This is the kind of back and forth that happens when people apply for 501(c)(4) status."" The IRS has told Congress that Shulman did not know about the targeting of conservative groups when he made that appearance, said Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Hatch.","The IRS must ""answer to the American people,"" Ways and Means chairman says .

"I remember watching TV shows such as ""The Jetsons"" when I was a child and fantasizing about the possibilities of living with a robot, riding in a flying car, or having food instantly show up warm and ready whenever I wanted it. Fast forward a couple decades later, and it turns out that we are now on the brink of a Jetsons-like reality. Robotics companies are popping up all around the world, enabling humans to program objects with artificial intelligence to do mundane tasks for them, ranging from mopping the floors to answering doors. Startups like Terrafugia are creating flying cars that can convert from driving mode to flying mode in under a minute. (You can even sign up to reserve one of the first publicly available cars.) And food creation is evolving to the point where our refrigerators know exactly what is inside of them and can even conjure up recipes using the ingredients you have on hand. The technological revolution has impacted so many parts of our lives, and the ""smart home"" is the next big trend on the horizon. Computer scientists and industrial designers are working together to prototype new technologies that will make life at home easier and more efficient. Read on to unveil home technologies that are either available now or may become available over the next 5-10 years. Bedroom . The futuristic Hi-Can bed comes complete with blinds that drop on all sides, making it pitch black even in full daylight, a built-in PC, and a multimedia system with connected speakers surrounding the bed and a large high-definition projector screen that drops down at the foot of the bed. It is also able to connect via Wi-Fi to all other compatible devices in your home, making it easy to adjust the lights and sounds throughout your house -- right from your bed. Though still in a conceptual development phase, this mini washing machine may change the way we all do laundry. Perfect for those without a lot of space for a full-size washer, this machine is compact and portable, enabling you to wash pieces of laundry on-the-go. It's also designed to be eco-friendly. Instead of using water and soap, the machine cleans clothes via ultrasonic waves and can be charged with the sun via a built-in solar panel. These innovations could prove quite useful for those in developing countries without much access to water. Kitchen . Another product still in its conceptual design phase, this digital cutting board is designed to be a touchscreen device, a food scale, and a cutting board in one. It can display recipes and step-by-step instructions while also telling you if you've added too much of an ingredient based on the weight of your food. Up until recently, molecular gastronomy was used to describe the science of cooking; however, it is now more commonly referred to as a new type of cuisine that chefs all over the world have been adopting which uses common chemistry techniques to create a physical and chemical reaction during cooking. The result can yield all kinds of frozen foods in addition to tasty liquids like foams and jellies. The Mo'Sphere is a molecular cooking device that lets you, the home cook, create the same types of foods from within the walls of your own kitchen. No white coat required. Bathroom . The Numi Toilet may just be one of the most advanced toilets ever. Complete with a touchscreen interface and built-in speakers, the toilet can connect via bluetooth to devices like your smartphone in order to play your favorite music or podcasts while you're on the pot. It also comes equipped with a motion sensor that raises the lid as you enter the bathroom, bidet functionality, a heated seat, and ambient lighting with multiple color options. There are even heat vents for your feet! Already a hit in Asia and Europe, the Magic Mirror is a new product that is fast making its way to America. It's a fully functioning mirror that has a built-in display connected to the Internet so that you can browse the web, watch videos, check the weather, and more -- like Google glass for your bathroom -- all while you're getting ready for your day. It also comes with a sensor pad so that you can keep up with your health vitals (weight, etc) from a single location. Living Room . Ever wish you could not only turn your TV off, but make it invisible as well? The transparent TV may just be the answer to your wishes. It's a new product design that does just what it sounds like -- makes your TV screen transparent so that when it's turned off, you can see straight through it. While this one is more about form than it is function, I could be swayed by it for aesthetic purposes alone. Acoustable is a speaker and a table in one, and aims to be as useful to place things on as it is to pump out sound. It is Wi-Fi compatible and thus can connect to your computer, iPod, or phone to play music or videos. It's a space saver and conversation piece all at once. Yard . Click & Grow is a new product that makes growing herbs and plants indoors simpler. The magic lies in its ""smart soil"" which, according to its website, is a nano-technological growth medium that guarantees plant roots an optimal amount of water, oxygen and nutrients at all times. The soil draws from a built-in water reservoir that contains enough water to keep the plant healthy for 3-6 weeks before needing more H2O. Don't worry, an indicator will come on to let you know when to add more. Finally, a way to become a gardener without needing to have a green thumb first. Garage/door . New tools make locking and unlocking your doors as easy as pushing a button on your smartphone. Devices like Lockitron, Kevo, and August are useful not only for those who have a tendency to misplace their keys, but also for those who may want to grant access to someone to enter their home remotely. Using a connected app, you can give a friend permission to unlock your door for a specified period of time, a good solution for those who may have guests stopping by when they're not around. Would you use any of these futuristic home technologies? If you can't get enough, check out even more gadgets from your future home. You might be using some of them inside your own house sooner than you think.","Your house is on the brink of a Jetsons-like reality .

"As Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy and the rest of their fuzzy friends prepared to return to the big screen for the first time in six years in their new film, ""The Muppets"" (also starring Jason Segal, Amy Adams and the newest addition to the Muppet brood, Walter), they took time out from their busy schedule of ""SNL"" visits,  Password games with Jimmy Fallon and their star-studded movie premiere to talk to CNN, and answer some questions submitted via iReport, about their beloved, late creator Jim Henson, their Hollywood crushes, and Piggy's glamorous new magazine job. CNN: Miss Piggy, what is a typical day for you like as Plus-Size Editor at Vogue Paris? Miss Piggy: I spend the whole morning meeting with designers, offering them moi's insights, inspiration and measurements. Then, I lunch and then, since it is Paris, we go to a lovely patisserie -- that's French for doughnut shop -- and pick up a few things to snack on during the afternoon. This is followed by meetings with people who apparently work for me, and then I go try on the clothes made by those designers I met with in the morning. Being a fashion editor is wonderful; play your cards right and you can get a whole wardrobe in a couple weeks. CNN: Kermit, what are your happiest memories of Jim Henson? Kermit the Frog: The work. We worked together right from the start, back when he did a local TV show called ""Sam & Friends."" We'd fool around, sing, and just make ourselves laugh -- and, what do you know, other folks started laughing and having a good time, too. Those are great memories. CNN: What was it like moving on after Jim Henson died? KTF: You don't move on. A part of him is inside of me, and that will be forever. I think of Jim every day, and try to make sure what the Muppets do would make him proud -- and make him laugh. CNN: What is your favorite movie and why? And it can't be one that the Muppets have been in. KTF: ""Singin' in the Rain"" -- and not just because frogs like rain. It's a perfect movie. Debbie Reynolds reminds me of Piggy when I first met her. (That's meant as a compliment, Ms. Reynolds.) Donald O'Connor is like Fozzie Bear, especially when he sings and dances to ""Make 'Em Laugh."" And Gene Kelly is just the best. I even got to dance with him to ""Singing in the Rain"" on ""The Muppet Show."" Gee, now that I talked about it, I want to go watch it again. Got popcorn? CNN: Team Edward or Jacob? MP: Team Kermit. Frogs, yes. Vampires and wolves, not so much. CNN: Do you eat bacon for breakfast? MP: No, I don't. Do you like having all your teeth? CNN: Besides Kermit, which actors do you have a crush on and why? MP: For moi, there is only Kermie. However, I do have teensy-weensy crushes on a few other cute guys. Brad Pitt, Brad Paisley, Bradley Cooper, Enrique Iglesias, George Clooney, Javier Bardem, David Beckham, Patrick Dempsey, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Johnny Depp, Rodrigo Santoro -- I'll send you the complete list later; this is gonna take too long. As for why, I can only say: Duh! CNN: Tell us about your first date. KTF: I don't really remember our first date. MP: As far as I'm concerned, we're still on it. CNN: What is your most prized Muppet memorabilia and why? KTF: I have the red curtain we used on the very first Muppet Show. MP: I kept the frog. CNN: Did you haze the new Muppet Walter at all? KTF: Muppets don't haze -- . MP: Yeah, we treat everyone the same. KTF:  -- and we're sorry about that, Walter. CNN: You are such seasoned professionals -- did you give any acting tips to Jason Segal, Amy Adams or the rest of the cast of ""The Muppets""? KTF: Well, Jason and Amy are real pros, too, so they don't need our advice. I watched and learned from them. Same goes for Chris Cooper. As for the other Muppets, you can't really give them acting tips, since I don't think any of them are acting; that's just them being themselves. MP: I give everyone I work with the same advice: Don't get between moi and the camera, and there won't be any trouble. Très easy, n'est-ce pas?! CNN: What are the Moopets doing now that you're all back together? Will we ever see them again? KTF: Sorry, I can't help you. I'm not sure what the Moopets are up to now. MP: Don't worry about it. It's taken care of. KTF: What does that mean? MP: It's best not to ask. KTF: Sheesh. CNN: What music are you listening to? Who are your favorite artists, what are your favorite albums of the year? KTF: I like -- . MP: AHEM!!!! KTF: Uh -- Miss Piggy, who do I like? MP: None of the female artists except moi. KTF: What she said. MP: And your favorite albums are the soundtrack to ""The Muppets"" (featuring moi) and ""The Green Album"" featuring songs made famous by moi -- and the other Muppets. KTF: I couldn't have said it better myself. MP: Not without injury.","Kermit the Frog says: ""A part of (Jim Henson) is inside of me and that will be forever""

"Contractors who helped develop the embattled HealthCare.gov website blame each other and the government, but not themselves, in testimony prepared for Thursday's first congressional hearing on the problems engulfing the online enrollment system. House Energy and Commerce Committee members will grill officials from CGI Federal, Optum/QSSI, Equifax Workforce Solutions and Serco at the hearing to examine technological problems faced by people trying to buy health insurance under President Barack Obama's signature reforms. Complaints of inability to log in, lengthy delays, incorrect information relayed to insurance companies and other problems have plagued the website since it opened to much fanfare on October 1. White House video makes HealthCare.gov issues seem simple . In the first detailed account of what happened, the prepared testimony describes a convoluted system of multiple companies designing parts of the website under oversight of the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services. According to the advance statements, the system had been tested as required but still buckled under an unanticipated flood of visitors when it opened. Cheryl Campbell, senior vice president at CGI Federal, will tell the panel that testing of the site met industry standards and ""passed eight required technical reviews prior to going live on October 1,"" according to her prepared testimony. Sebelius on the spot in Obamacare website fiasco . ""Unfortunately, in systems this complex with so many concurrent users, it is not unusual to discover problems that need to be addressed once the software goes into a live production environment,"" Campbell's advance testimony says. ""This is true regardless of the level of formal end-to-end performance testing -- no amount of testing within reasonable time limits can adequately replicate a live environment of this nature,"" she added. Campbell blames initial problems on the ""enterprise identity management"" function known as EIDM that serves as the entry portal to the website. The EIDM tool designed by another contractor, which Campbell's advance testimony doesn't name, ""created a bottleneck that prevented the vast majority of users from accessing"" Healthcare.gov when it opened, according to Campbell. Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview . However, Andrew Slavitt of Optum, which designed the EIDM tool, says in his prepared testimony that an unexpected high volume of people registered at the start and overwhelmed the entry portal and other aspects of the website. He puts the blame on the government, saying: ""It appears that one of the reasons for the high concurrent volume at the registration system was a late decision requiring consumers to register for an account before they could browse for insurance products."" ""This may have driven higher simultaneous usage of the registration system that wouldn't have occurred if consumers could 'window shop' anonymously,"" Slavitt's testimony says, adding that the EIDM tool was able to process the high volumes with low to zero error rates by October 8. A third contractor, Equifax Workplace Solutions, says its role providing ""real time verification of income and employment"" information submitted by applicants has worked properly, according to the advance testimony by its corporate counsel, Lynn Spellecy. Equifax conducted ""multiple load and stress tests"" that showed it could process up to 120,000 verification requests per hour or more, which it estimated as more than any peak period would demand, Spellecy's testimony says. Insurers pledge to help solve website problems . Campbell also says in her prepared testimony that improvements to the EIDM tool have allowed more users to proceed to the website's main function of providing a range of choices and information on available subsidies for them to choose health insurance required by law. ""More individuals have enrolled in qualified insurance plans; however, the increased number of transactions ... have caused system performance issues (such as slow response times or data assurance issues) that now need to be addressed through tuning, optimization and application improvements,"" her testimony says. The White House and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius make the same argument, saying the initial problems in accessing the website have eased. Sebelius: Website problems blindsided President . Sebelius has brought in tech experts from Silicon Valley and elsewhere to work with the contractors on eliminating problems, with acting Office of Management and Budget Director Jeff Zients overseeing the effort. ""The work of constantly improving the website will continue day by day,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. ""A week from now, it's going to be better than it is today."" The Energy and Commerce Committee isn't the only one probing Obamacare in light of its issues. So, too, is the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The latter sent an eight-page letter Wednesday night to 11 contracting firms involved in putting together HealthCare.gov giving them two days to provide documents, meeting lists and all communications with the Obama administration on the project, committee spokeswoman Caitlin Carroll said. The fact all three committees are in the same chamber -- which is led by Republicans -- is likely no coincidence. The GOP has and continues to be staunchly opposed to Obamacare, even trying unsuccessfully to make defunding or delaying it requirement before it would fund the government. The White House has been pushing back against not just Republicans, but some Democrats who have urged an extension of the open enrollment period beyond March 31 and/or a delay in penalties for those who don't sign up for insurance on time because of the website issues. The Obama administration is moving to clarify confusion on when people need to sign up for health care, and it has plans to issue new guidelines to this point soon. Still, Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters insisted ""the individual mandate timing"" -- i.e. the requirement for a person to have insurance by March -- ""has not changed. ... It was true this morning. It is true tonight."" Pelosi pushes back on extending Obamacare deadline .","A third House committee is investigating the HealthCare.gov website issues .

"Editor's note: This story is part of the iReport Weekend Assignment project, in which the CNN iReport community takes on a special skills challenge once a week. Last weekend's challenge was to create a time-lapse video that told a local story. This weekend, we're making mini cooking demonstrations. Head to CNN iReport to join the fun and learn a little something while you're at it. Time was, if you wanted to make a time-lapse film, first you had to build a machine. In the late 1920s, John Ott was an American high school student with a passion for photography and a lot of time on his hands. He wanted to capture apple blossoms unfolding over time on film, and he knew he needed to take frequent pictures around the clock, even while he was sleeping or away at school. So he wired together a kitchen timer, a camera, a paper clip and a pull cord, and voilà: Photos taken at regular intervals over time and sped back up revealed the beauty of the blooming flowers to the naked eye. Ott went on to become a pioneer of time-lapse photography, filming incremental changes in flowers and insects, and helping to pave the way for scientific research that still today gains insights from slowed-down views of biology and the physical environment. Time-lapse is a photographic technique that captures images much more slowly than normal video but plays them back at standard speed, which condenses long periods of time into a relatively short video. It's like ""slow motion, seen from the perspective of eternity,"" says Richard Misek, a film professor at Bristol University in England who is writing a history of time-lapse. (See Misek's iReport time-lapse of a busy Melbourne lunch.) When John Ott wanted to experiment with time-lapse, he had to build a contraption, but today's inexpensive digital tools make it easy for almost anyone to give it a try and share their results with the rest of the world. All you need is a camera on a tripod, an idea and a healthy dose of patience. And a folding chair, recommends Raphael Rodolfi, an iReporter who took part in a time-lapse challenge on CNN iReport last weekend. Someone has to sit with the camera while it's filming an extraordinary sunset or clouds moving slowly across a sky. See iReporters' tips for trying time-lapse . Dozens of people shared their first time-lapse attempts on CNN iReport last weekend. Jim Dourney, who shot a day in the life of a busy Florida inlet, said he found time-lapse ""surprisingly easy to do."" Simple instructions for using the movie-making software that comes standard on may computers are just a Google search away. Maarten Toner runs a group dedicated to time-lapses on Vimeo, a video sharing site popular among filmmakers and creative photographers. It's a wildly active group, where inventive new time-lapse videos from across the world pop up every few hours. When people first pick up a digital camera and want to try video, ""slow motion is the first thing you do,"" Toner says. ""Time-lapse is the second."" What's the draw? It's simple to make magic. ""I think people are really surprised by the effect, and then it becomes an addiction."" Another attraction, says artist Keith Loutit, is that in some ways, time-lapse brings back some of the wonder of analog photography. ""When people turn a camera on and it's firing away, there's a real wonder about what's going to happen. People are so used to looking at the back of the camera now."" But with time-lapse, you don't see the result until you get back home. Loutit is a photographer whose work uses time-lapse and tilt-shift techniques to turn the real world into what looks like meticulous animation. His ""Bathtub IV,"" a piece shot over three months in Sydney, Australia, tells the story of a helicopter rescue at a busy beach. He was looking to cast a place he knows well in a different light. When iReport asked its community to try time-lapse as part of a weekend assignment series, several participants remarked that it had made them think about the places they live and see every day in a new way. See all the iReport time-lapse videos . ""Waiting in the cold with my camera made me sensitive to subtle changes in the scene I might normally have missed,"" iReporter Hannah Slagle Palmer said. (Watch Palmer's video of gnat-sized airplanes hopping over the Atlanta, Georgia, skyline.) That's what it comes down to: ""The power of time-lapse,"" Misek said, is that it ""shows you time frames that you can't normally perceive. When it's at its best, it shows you the world from another perspective.""","Digital cameras and video sharing sites give new life to an old technique .

"Connie Ley made an unusual request in her will before she died last month in Aurora, Indiana: She asked that her German shepherd, Bela, be euthanized and buried with her. Three weeks later, however, Bela, who is 9 years old and male, is healthy and very much alive. And there's a growing movement on social media to defy his late owner's wishes and spare the animal. Ley's attorney, Doug Denmure, told CNN affiliate WCPO-TV that his late client preferred to send Bela to Best Friends Animal Society's no-kill sanctuary in southern Utah to live out the remainder of his days. But if transporting the dog across the country proved too expensive, Ley wanted a close friend to take charge of Bela and carry out her request that ""the dog be put to sleep, cremated and that the dog's ashes be placed with her own ashes."" As it turned out, sending Bela to the Utah animal sanctuary was not financially feasible, Denmure told WXIX-TV, another CNN affiliate. But following a public outcry, a decision about the dog's fate has been put on hold for now, he said. Bela was with Ley when she died at home November 25. The dog is now being housed in a special kennel at PAWS of Dearborn County Humane Center in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Director Becky Foster said the center has no legal control over the dog's future and is waiting to hear from Ley's attorney. ""He's been cared for very well,"" Foster told CNN on Thursday. ""We're happy to have him here as long as need be. He has toys and blankies and he's just chilling."" Meanwhile, animal lovers on Facebook and Twitter are urging that Bela be spared, calling Ley's decision selfish. Supporters have mounted an online petition to save the dog and are rallying around a #SaveBela hashtag. ""Add me to the list of people who would gladly adopt Bela and give her a happy home. Please #SaveBela from her dead owner's stupidity,"" one woman wrote. Best Friends Animal Society also has weighed in, posting a statement on its Facebook page urging fans to share #SaveBela messages. ""We want to save Bela's life and bring him to our sanctuary, but the decision to send him to us or have him put down and cremated is out of our hands,"" said the post. ""The decision needs to be made by the person designated in Ms. Ley's will and we are hopeful that she will agree."" Denmure maintains that everything about Ley's request is legal. ""The dog was owned by my client and now it's part of her estate,"" he told WCPO. ""And those are her wishes, as far as the future of the dog is concerned. Outsiders don't have the grounds to rewrite the provisions of my client's will and impose what they want."" Denmure said Ley didn't trust Bela to be around others and the 105-pound dog has a history of aggressive behavior. He told WCPO that a veterinarian recommended Bela be put down. ""He could cause damage and inflict bodily harm on strangers, in particular, children."" The case has raised ethical questions about how much control deceased people should have over the life of their pets. ""On the whole, we don't allow people to euthanize healthy pets,"" said Edward Queen, a professor of ethics at Emory University. On the other hand, he said, it's not uncommon for unwanted pets to be euthanized. ""As a matter of policy, do we really want people to control the life of a healthy pet on a whim?"" he pondered. ""Assuming the dog is healthy and will be cared for, I'm not sure we want to encourage this.""","A deceased Indiana woman asked in her will that her pet dog be euthanized .

"Sen. Rand Paul broke with the field of Republicans considering a 2016 presidential run on Thursday, calling President Barack Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba a ""good idea"" since the American embargo against Cuba ""just hasn't worked."" Paul, a likely presidential candidate, made the remarks in an interview with News Talk 800 WVHU's Tom Roten, just a day after his potential competitors for the Republican nomination -- former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz -- slammed the decision to normalize relations as a dangerous move. Rubio and Cruz are sons of Cuban immigrants. Paul joined the mostly Democratic supporters of the decision, asserting that the embargo hasn't produced results and hurts the Cuban people rather than their autocratic rulers. He even likened his support to U.S. trade with China, which he called ""ultimately the best way to defeat communism."" ""The 50-year embargo with Cuba just hasn't worked,"" Paul said. ""If the goal is regime change, it sure doesn't seem to be working and probably it punishes the people more than the regime because the regime can blame the embargo for hardship."" Paul is not the only Republican to support Obama's decision to increase economic ties with Cuba. Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona traveled with a congressional delegation to Cuba that brought back Alan Gross, the formerly imprisoned American aid worker. ""In the end, I think probably opening up Cuba is probably a good idea,"" he said. He also added that he ""grew up in a family as anti-communist as you can come by."" Rubio, on the other hand, has led the charge against the Obama administration's landmark deal with the Cuban government, railing against Obama for appeasing an autocratic regime. ""It is a lifeline for the Castro regime that will allow them to become more profitable ... and allow them to become a more permanent fixture,"" he said Wednesday. ""The embargo is leverage, these sanctions are leverage.""","Sen. Rand Paul says he agrees with President Barack Obama that the Cuban embargo hasn't worked .
Paul's position is the opposite of other potential GOP 2016 candidates, like Sen. Marco Rubio and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush ."
"(CNN) -- Last year, we learned that the Great Recession had come to an end. It ended in June 2009, the experts said. But, for many Americans, the declaration had little meaning and was of little solace. Unemployment is still high and economic hardship is commonplace. During 2010, six CNN iReporters followed someone they knew in their community to get a measure of how the economy was affecting people's lives. They related stories of perseverance, reinvention, doubt and success. 'Feed your spirit' In February, Bruce Pollard, after more than 25 years on the job, was forced into an early retirement. The 58-year-old from Houston, Texas, was given a severance by his company, which helped provide some stability. See all the stories on CNN's Economy Tracker . By March, he was still looking for a job. As he searched, his wife, a psychologist who used to work one day a week, began working more. Meanwhile, Pollard took on more of the work around the house. ""You think when that when you go away for five days a week and come back, that things just happen around the house,"" he said. ""They don't."" His severance pay came to an end in September. Pollard picked up work as a consultant once a week in addition to occasional substitute teaching gigs. However, he had two kids in college and another on the way to college. And he had to plan for retirement. He needed another job, but the experience of unemployment had changed his perspective. ""The main thing I think I've discovered, kind of later in my career, is that there are two things you want to do when you look for a job,"" he said. ""You want to feed your family, for sure. But you also want to feed your spirit."" As 2010 came to a close, the consulting contract was renewed and expanded, and other consulting engagements were becoming possible, Pollard said. But he appears to be a changed man when it comes to his work. ""I'm definitely not going to be working full-time for another company,"" he said. ""I'm always going to be working by myself as a contractor under a company name, which is my own."" 'That extra leap' As 2010 began, Michael Andrews -- who lives in Bowie, Maryland, with his wife, Danielle, and a 4-year-old son -- faced a dilemma. The 33-year-old college administrator and his family wanted to move from their townhouse to a single-family home. They first had to sell the current one. But the price of their house fell with the collapse of the housing market. ""The cost of our home is such that we can't really leave until it flips back around to some kind of profit,"" he said in December 2009. Andrews, who describes himself as an optimist, was also frustrated with limited job opportunities. ""I think that when times are as rough as they are right now in the economy, you really have to rely on yourself to take that extra leap,"" he said. And so he did. He created Five Mikes, an entrepreneurial project based around his motivational speaking engagements. He entered the search for an advice guru for ABC's ""Good Morning America"" and reached the semifinal stage. And, by the fall, Andrews got a new job at his university and transitioned to a new office. Ultimately, Andrews and his wife decided to stay put and not sell their Baltimore townhouse. Yet the year was ""awesome,"" he said. He is, however, humble about the good fortune that has come his way. ""Some people are really, really suffering, and I'm happy that our family isn't necessarily on that level,"" he said. ""But if either my wife or I lose our job, we could be one of those people. ""We're just one mishap away."" 'Life halted' Ask Jamie Smith about 2010, and she'll tell you about mishaps. Well, frankly, she may use other words. Toward the end of October 2009, Smith, who lives in Bentonville, Arkansas, was laid off when her newspaper merged with a competitor. She began collecting unemployment benefits, looked for other jobs, searched for freelance writing opportunities and decided to create a public relations company. Then, in April, she ruptured her appendix, complications developed, and she had to spend two weeks in the hospital. ""Life halted,"" she said. Her unemployment benefits ran out midsummer but were renewed because of a federal extension. ""I have mixed feelings about that, but I don't talk politics, so I won't,"" she said. The search for another job stretched into the fall. ""It's very interesting when you're changing careers and you're trying to make jobs skills translate in an obvious way,"" she said. ""You know you can do it, but you have to express that you can do it."" As October rolled around, she was still without a job, marking the longest stretch of time she was unemployed in her working life. She finally received some good news in November. She got a part-time job that could become a full-time job, she said. It also gives her time to develop her freelance opportunities. 'Roll with the punches' Guy Daniels has been a tattoo artist for 16 years. He owns Expressions Ink, a tattoo parlor in Wausau, Wisconsin. Heavily reliant on the disposable income of his customers, he was a bit nervous when the year started. ""I've seen a lot of customers lose their jobs,"" he said. Walk-in traffic was down, and gift certificate sales were smaller than in previous year. But as the weather warmed, business picked up, especially around the time people started receiving their tax refunds. ""People are more spontaneous with their money at tax time,"" he said. ""It's like Christmas for us."" But sales were again down when winter returned. ""As a business owner, you do get tired of (the ups and downs), but you gotta feed your family, so you roll with the punches,"" he said. Growing small is the key to success in today's economy, and the at times turbulent year made him a smarter businessman, Daniels said. He cut back on expenses whenever possible and put money into the business when he could. ""I think it made me plan a lot more for the future,"" he said. An ambitious plan . Growth was very much in the plans for 2010 for David and Susan Nethero, owners of Intimacy, a specialty bra company. With 11 stores already in existence, the Atlanta, Georgia-based couple looked forward to their biggest expansion -- the opening of five stores -- in a single year since they launched the company 18 years ago. ""We're feeling very strong and very bullish,"" Susan Nethero said. By June, the Netheros had opened two new locations -- in New York and Los Angeles -- and were preparing to open a second store in Los Angeles. Susan credited increased marketing and a popular customer referral program as two main contributors to the company's success. By the end of the year, Intimacy opened all five new locations across the country. ""Despite the recession, we were able to grow our company by just under 30 percent this year, which is really phenomenal,"" David Nethero said. 'You never know' Kathy Kirkpatrick, a small-business owner in New York, would probably not describe herself as ""bullish."" She owns Life Café, which has two locations: one in the East Village and another in Brooklyn. The troubled economy of the past few years has made her pragmatic and cautious. In the more than 20 years that she has run her business, 2008 was the worst economy she'd ever seen, she said. ""The recession has made me cautious of the eggs I do have in my basket,"" she said. ""I don't have the time in front of me to take any more risks like I used to. I have to be realistic."" Spring, when tourists frequent the café, saw a boost in business, but it was down in relation to years past. The summer was a mixed bag. It was a record month in May and an ""all right"" June, but July ""tanked big time,"" she said. And, the quiet streets of winter didn't help. Sales floundered in October and November, she said. But two decades in business teach you lessons in survival. Kirkpatrick brought in a new chef. She also began a digital and social media strategy to get the word out about the café. It seems to be having an effect. During a conversation late last year, Kirkpatrick said that it had managed to stop the plunge in sales and that business had picked up. ""The only thing I hope is that while we're moving forward in a positive way, something else doesn't show up around that corner that makes it all tumble down,"" she said. ""You never know.""

"(CNN)Before you dismiss President Obama's proposal of two years of free community college as frivolous government spending, let me toss a number out at you: 500%. That's roughly how much college costs have increased between 1985 and today. Compare that with wages, which have increased by about 140% over the same time period and you begin to understand why Americans owe $1.4 trillion in student loan debt. Had the rise in college costs stayed in line with the inflation, the $10,000 to send your kid to school in 1985 would have been $21,947.12 today. Instead it's over $50,000. If college was still a luxury, like say a Mercedes-Benz, then sure, dismiss the high price as a personal problem. But it's important to point out that while much of the 2012 presidential debate focused on the economy and job creation, employers were sitting on 3 million unfilled jobs because Americans didn't have the skills needed to fill them. By 2020, one third of all new job openings will require some postsecondary education, according to a study conducted by Georgetown University. If you still think a proposal to make community college free is just a liberal handout, then you're living in the past. The reality is bachelor degrees are the high school diplomas of the 21st century. And whether you like President Obama or not is irrelevant, because the skills gap that has been a drag on our economy is not go away after 2016. Neither will the postsecondary sticker shock that discourages people from trying to get the skills necessary to be employable in any field beyond those found in the low-paying service industry. Any White House hopeful who talks about creating jobs at a campaign stop but fails to mention the cost of a college education is just a windbag looking for applause. President Obama's domestic policy hasn't been perfect, but he's quietly pushed through a number of measures that have made college more affordable. For example, his administration doubled the money for Pell Grants, capped new loan payments at 10% of income and expanded education tax credits, providing up to $10,000 for four years of college tuition. His latest proposal does not address the problem of runaway college costs. And it will take a degree of fiscal gymnastics to pay $3,800 in tuition for each of the 9 million students the administration is estimating would take advantage of the program. But it is a mistake to immediately shoot holes into the K-14 conversation and allow all the good it could do sink into the abyss of partisan gamesmanship. The administration compares the long-reaching impact of free community college with that of the compulsory laws, which made school attendance mandatory, and the progressive era, which made high school more accessible. These were seminal moments in this country's workforce history. Shifting the thinking around postsecondary education from a luxury to an integral part of citizenship would not only provide financial relief -- especially for families who are too rich to receive traditional aid and too poor to pay out of pocket -- but would keep our workforce competitive. It would also help our economy. Despite the addition of 252,000 new jobs in December and an unemployment rate of 5.6%, we know there are hundreds of thousands of people who have stopped looking for work because they do not believe there are jobs for them. We know there are millions who are working part time involuntarily. And we know there are 500,000 unfilled jobs in manufacturing alone -- good paying, full-time work waiting for workers with the right skills. It is unlikely the newly christened Republican Congress will debate, let alone pass what Obama is proposing if for no other reason than he's the one proposing it. They will say if the President wants to create jobs he should green light the Keystone pipeline, as if the 35 permanent jobs projected to come from it will impact the unemployment rate. Such is life in Partisan America, I guess. If we're lucky, this proposal would open the door to a substantive debate that will unfold as Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney and other presidential hopefuls look for ways to differentiate themselves from the pack. Or maybe common sense would win out. By 2025, 55% of new jobs in Tennessee will require at least a two-year degree. Currently, only 32% of state residents have one. In response, Gov. Bill Haslam introduced the ""Tennessee Promise"" scholarships last year, becoming the first state to make community college free. All students need to do is prove they are state residents, maintain a 2.0 GPA and do eight hours of community service per semester. Haslam, a Republican, understood that for his state to be competitive with the rest of the country, he had to address the looming skills gap. This is the model the President hopes to replicate to keep the country competitive with the rest of the world. Paying for it will no doubt be a major sticking point for his critics. However, skirting this topic altogether will undoubtedly cost us all a lot more.","LZ Granderson: President Obama's proposal of two years of free community college is smart .

"A midterm election sometimes arrives like a tidal wave, sweeping one party's incumbents out of office and bringing in a new majority.  For Democrats, their wave came in 2006.  For Republicans, theirs came in 2010. As the next midterm election approaches, however, there are few signs of a tsunami.  2014 seems likely to reproduce divided government and, with it, even more of the partisan polarization that has become endemic in American politics.  Thus, the next election seems unlikely to change the dynamics that have produced the partial government shutdown. Loyalty to a political party is not just a feature of Congress.  It is, and has always been, a pre-eminent force in American elections.  Nine in 10 Americans identify with or lean toward a party, and most vote loyally for that party.  In our book, ""The Gamble,"" we document the powerful role partisanship played in the 2012 election. In partnership with YouGov, we interviewed  45,000 Americans online in December 2011 and then interviewed most of them again after the election.  Of those voters who described themselves as Republicans or Democrats that December, more than 90% voted for their party's candidate. Voters who were undecided in December also tended to vote in line with their underlying partisan loyalties. The same party loyalty has increasingly carried over into congressional elections as well.  This is one reason why split-ticket voting has dropped so precipitously in the last 40 years. Some maintain that the 2012 election inaugurated an ""Obama realignment"" or ""Liberal America."" As we argue in ""The Gamble,"" it was always unlikely that the election signaled Democratic or liberal ascendance.  In reality, Obama won despite a sharp conservative turn in public opinion and despite being perceived as ideologically further from the average voter than Romney was.  The election mainly signaled just how narrowly divided the country is. Heading into 2014, a set of cross-currents seems likely to maintain this partisan balance.  Republicans have more seats to defend in the House, and history shows that the larger a party's majority, the more seats the party is likely to lose.  On top of that, the dismal marks that Americans give to Congress tend to hurt the majority party in the House most. But the Democrats face their own challenges.  Two key fundamentals in both presidential and midterm elections are the economy and presidential approval.  At the moment, the economy is growing only slowly, and approval of Obama has dropped 8 points since January. Both factors could end up hurting congressional Democrats.  Moreover, in the Senate the Democrats must try to hold seats in Republican-leaning states like Alaska, Arkansas, Montana, New Hampshire and Louisiana. When you put these factors together, Republicans are currently forecast  to gain a small number of seats in both chambers, although this could be enough to give them a narrow majority in the Senate. Is the shutdown likely to change this dynamic and strengthen Obama's hand against Republicans?  Probably not.  Although the last big shutdown battle in 1995-96 did no favors for Newt Gingrich and House Republicans, it did not necessarily help Clinton in the eyes of voters—contrary to the conventional wisdom today.  Clinton's approval was no higher  immediately after the two shutdowns than before, and it is unclear whether the increase in his approval later in 1996 stemmed from the shutdown itself. Moreover, this time Americans seem willing to spread the blame for the shutdown.  They are only slightly less likely to say they will blame Obama and the Democrats than blame Republicans.  Indeed, during the last big debt ceiling fight with the GOP—in summer 2011—Obama's approval rating dropped 5 points. None of this is to say that the shutdown can't damage Republicans, too.  If the conservative faction of the party continues to drive policy, the dwindling, but vital, number of Republican moderates may find themselves electorally vulnerable.  Political science research shows that being more ideologically extreme  or partisan than their district can hurt members of Congress at the ballot box.  John Boehner has to find a way to protect moderates—some of whom are clearly chafing--and placate conservatives at the same time. Ultimately, the 2014 election seems likely to give us more of the slow grind of divided government.  This will continue to hamstring both parties and frustrate Americans ready for an end to gridlock.","Authors: Some midterm elections are like tidal waves that remix the Washington scene .

"(CNN) -- Like many entrepreneurs, I am often asked about the secrets to building a successful career. The advice I give is that whether you're in Silicon Valley creating apps, or in Unadilla Valley in upstate New York making yogurt, there are many common ingredients for success. But everything starts with opportunity, whether it be the opportunity to study, to work, to build something, or the opportunities afforded by a safe home, a stable society and a secure environment. These were all opportunities that I enjoyed as a young boy in a Kurdish community in eastern Turkey, and as a young man who came to America, inspired by the American dream. Sadly, far too many in the region where I grew up will never receive the opportunities that I had. In the decade since I began the Chobani business, dramatic changes have occurred in the Middle East. Conflict has engulfed Iraq and Syria, forcing millions of people to flee from their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries. When I watch the reports from towns like Kobani, I see a haunting despair in the eyes of refugees. Their faces look familiar -- they are just like my aunts, uncles and childhood friends. And yet the fear in their eyes seems very different. The truth is that although I grew up in their part of the world, I can't imagine what it must be like to be forced to flee your home with your family, not knowing if your grandmother will survive the journey or your daughter will ever see home again. In the past, the world has risen to the moment and responded to similar crises. Refugees from wartime Europe were taken in by dozens of countries across the world in the 1940s and 1950s. Similarly, victims of conflict in Vietnam, Cambodia and East Africa in the 1970s, and those from the Balkans in the 1990s, found welcoming new homes in faraway countries. With all that in mind, I cannot understand why the welcoming arms of the international community have become so feeble and spiritless in the face of the latest crisis. Last week, at a pledging conference in Geneva, Switzerland, other countries could only muster a commitment to take in 38,000 more refugees from Syria in 2015, despite the fact that we are currently facing the largest refugee crisis since World War II. More than 50 million people around the world are now refugees or displaced people, robbed of life's opportunities by war, persecution and natural disasters. So where is the big-hearted response of previous generations? Have our hearts turned to stone? Turkey alone took in more people in three days than the international community has offered to welcome in an entire year. Lebanon and Jordan have likewise absorbed enormous numbers. These countries, and agencies like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Rescue Committee, which do extraordinary work, desperately need financial support to be able to provide the basic essentials for those who have fled across borders in search of safety. How can it be that such suffering exists just a few hours' plane ride from some of the world's richest capitals? And how can so many enjoy a life of abundance, and yet, despite our more interconnected world, appear so oblivious to quite how bad things have gotten? Generosity starts with us as individuals. But the needs in this desperate situation are far too immense for private donors to ever meet on their own. Governments across the globe must therefore answer the call to action -- just as they've done in the past. It is with this pressing need for action in mind that I have been a strong supporter of the U.N.'s immediate efforts to get winter supplies to refugee camps. I am also supporting new campaign initiatives to help advance long-term solutions to the crisis. Such efforts, it is hoped, will help decision-makers around the world hear the voices of those that need help the most. This week, I am writing to the foreign ministers of ten key countries, calling on them to show leadership and deliver on their past commitments. It is a campaign I will continue with for as long as this crisis persists. And I would urge entrepreneurs from across the globe -- men and women who have already demonstrated their ability to shake things up -- to join in and press for change to address this injustice. So, as many of us prepare to spend the holiday season with families, and in conditions that millions of refugees could only dream of, it is time to raise our voices as we seek to jolt our leaders into action. This is what it means to have a human heart. Not to avert our gaze from others' suffering, but to step forward. To open our arms. To lift our voices, and call for our leaders to wake up. And to do our duty to these sons and daughters, brothers and sisters who are all part of the one human family. As those blessed with opportunity in our own lives, we must restore opportunity and hope to theirs.","Hamdi Ulukaya: World must do more to assist Syrian refugees .

"The strategist in charge of electing a Republican Senate majority thanked Democrats on Thursday for keeping President Barack Obama on the sidelines and building their campaigns around women's issues instead of making an economic argument. Rob Collins, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told reporters in a postmortem session that Democrats ""sidelined their best messenger"" by running from Obama. ""They were so focused on independents that they forgot they had a base,"" Collins said of Democratic campaigns. ""They left their base behind. They became Republican-lite."" The ""war on women"" message that permeated so many Democratic campaigns up and down the ballot ""was a mistake,"" Collins said — it used ""a tactic as a strategy."" He praised Republican candidates for being ""proactive and having something to say."" ""I can't remember a Democrat who spent any kind of money in a significant way talking about the economy,"" he said. ""If I had a choice between talking about the number one issue we saw in every single poll, and talking about a single issue, I would be talking about the number one issue."" Not all Democratic campaigns ran single-issue campaigns. A number of Democrats, especially those in the party's progressive and labor wings of the party, have highlighted Tuesday winners like Al Franken in Minnesota, Gary Peters in Michigan and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire as candidates who talked about women's issues but also weaved the debate into a larger economic theme. But even those campaigns were careful to avoid being seen as too close to the president. Collins and NRSC communications director Brad Dayspring agreed that Obama was a political lightning rod for Democrats — especially late in the campaign. But they said they were baffled that their opponents didn't use him to rally the base throughout the year and make an argument about the economic successes of the Obama administration -- particularly in the purple states of Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina. ""If you are running to Mark Udall's campaign, there is an argument to be made that unemployment was higher when he took office,"" Dayspring said. ""There is an argument that gas prices were higher when he took office. But they never made it. They stuck to a flawed strategy that talked about birth control and abortion through the election. That was something we never understood.""","The National Republican Senatorial Committee held a postmortem call Thursday .

"A military standoff with terrorists at a Kenyan mall was apparently drawing to a close Tuesday after four days of carnage left at least 61 civilians and six security officers dead. Five terrorists were killed, and 11 other suspects are in custody, Kenya's president said. About 175 people were injured, he said. As authorities indicated the siege was all but over, many questions will have to be answered, such as did the terrorists include Americans, a British subject and a Canadian national, as claimed by Al-Shabaab, the Islamic extremists who took responsibility for the gun attack. Attackers defeated, Kenya's president says . For now, Kenya reels from a horrific terror attack at Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall -- frequented by well-to-do Kenyans and the expatriate community -- which began just after high noon Saturday. Day One: Saturday . It was a nice day at the 80-store mall. A cooking competition was held for youths, perhaps some aspiring to become chefs. Visitors stocked up on staples at a supermarket or sipped coffee at a cafe. Without warning, gunmen stormed the mall, shooting people outside the five-story structure and then inside it. Shoppers said they also heard grenades exploding. Other witnesses described it ""like a Hollywood-action scene,"" said hospital volunteer Abiti Shah. Mall customers crawled beneath cars in the parking lot and found cover in stairwells and a women's bathroom, presumably because the gunmen would be reluctant to look in that gender's restrooms. 'Westgate bad, blood ... I ran, ran, ran' Attackers went from store to store, taking hostages or randomly firing upon people. Gunmen asked customers whether they were Muslim. The terrorists apparently allowed people of that faith to escape from the mall. The chaos included an unclear report on deaths. Finally, by day's end, 39 people were counted as killed -- a number that would grow. Several hours into the terror assault, an al-Qaeda offshoot in neighboring Somalia called Al-Shabaab used its Twitter account to claim responsibility. Authorities now learned who they were dealing with, and the international community condemned the terror, including the Kenyan president whose nephew and his fiancée were among those killed. Day Two: Sunday . The terrorists continued their siege of the mall, and confusion prevailed over the number of deaths and hostages. Security forces decided to launch a ""major assault"" on the mall, police said. As another violent day unfolded, ""most of the hostages"" were rescued, and security forces took control of ""most parts"" of the mall, the Kenyan military said. Gunfire punctuated the day. Between the bullets are moments of silence. Soldiers surrounded the mall. Authorities numbered the gunmen involved in the attack: 10 to 15 attackers. Further, unconfirmed reports emerged on who they could be: As many as three are from the United States, two are from Somalia and one each from Canada, Finland, Kenya and the United Kingdom. That information came from sources within Al-Shabaab who spoke to CNN about nine names published on Twitter who were purported to be the alleged hostage-takers. Bergen: Al-Shabaab's American allies . CNN couldn't independently confirm that claim by Al-Shabaab. ""All efforts are underway to bring this matter to a speedy conclusion,"" the Kenyan military said. Day Three: Monday . The first announcement about deaths on the other side of the siege is made: Three terrorists have been killed, authorities said. So far, more than 200 civilians have been rescued, they added. But 11 Kenyan soldiers have been wounded, the military said. Kenyan officials reassured the world that they were in control of the mall. The terrorists have little chance of escape, authorities said. But sporadic gunfire sent aid workers and journalists running for cover. Inside the mall, the terrorists ignited a fire, spewing heavy smoke throughout the afternoon. ""We're not here to feed the attackers with pastries but to finish and punish them,"" Kenyan police Inspector General David Kimaiyo warned on Twitter. Even away from the mall, the country faced intensified security. At various locations, more than 10 people were taken into custody for questioning about the attack, including at least four people from an airport. Opinion: What does attack mean for Kenyan security? Authorities released a few details about the death toll: Most of the dead were apparently Kenyans, but the slain included six British citizens, two French nationals, two Indians and two Canadians, including a diplomat, their governments said. Among the 175 people wounded were five Americans, the State Department said. In response to the unconfirmed claim that the terrorists included Americans, U.S. authorities reviewed intelligence reports for evidence of a U.S. connection to the attack, law enforcement sources said. But a senior U.S. official said the claim wasn't looking too solid. Final Day? Tuesday . As the world anxiously awaited a conclusion to the terrorists' siege of the mall, President Uhuru Kenyatta announced forces killed five terrorists at the mall and arrested 11 others for possible ties to the attack. ""We have ashamed and defeated our attackers,"" the president said. That announcement, however, didn't answer important questions: were there foreign nationals among the terrorists, what happened to the hostages and what's the status of the 65 people that the Red Cross says are unaccounted for? Identification of some victims provided glimpses into the terrorists' alleged barbarity: A pregnant Dutch woman expecting her first child in October was killed, along with her husband architect who was building hospitals and clinics for free. Another woman, who was seven months pregnant, was slain. A boy, age 8, was dead, along with his father. The material condition of the besieged mall evoked a war scene: three floors of the mall collapsed during the government's counter-offensive against the terrorists, trapping bodies inside, the president said. Those trapped bodied include terrorists, Kenyatta said. ""Our attackers wish to destroy the essential character of our society. They failed,"" Kenyatta said. ""Kenya endures.""","Kenya's president indicates terrorists' siege of Nairobi mall has ended .

"(CNN) -- ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" husband Apollo Nida has reported to prison to start an eight-year federal sentence for a fraud conviction, despite a side trip to have a final word with his wife. Nida was still in Atlanta at the home he shared with his wife, ""Real Housewives"" co-star Phaedra Parks, on Wednesday after the noon deadline that U.S. marshals gave him to turn himself in to the minimum-security federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky. Park's publicist, Steve Honig, who was at the home when Nida arrived Wednesday afternoon, told CNN ""there was an incident"" around 4 p.m., although he declined to give details on the record. A source who witnessed the incident told CNN that Nida came to the house because he was upset that Parks would not deposit money into his prison account. The source asked not to be identified. Nida, 35, eventually checked into prison as inmate 65725-019, prison spokesman Kenny Coleman said Thursday. Inmate privacy rules prevented the spokesman for disclosing details about what time Nida arrived. ""I can tell you that he is here,"" Coleman said. However, Nida posted a message on his Twitter account early Thursday saying ""I would like to say thanks 4 everyone's support & thanks 4 holding me in prayer I've arrived 2 my destination and I'm going asunder"" He also posted a video on his Instagram account with a similar message that apparently was recorded just before turning himself in at the prison. Nida's lawyer did not respond to CNN calls about Nida's status. Parks, a lawyer and reality TV star, would not comment on the record about tabloid reports that she was upset that Nida ignored his children and spent much of his time drinking in clubs during his last weeks of freedom. ""Phaedra is now putting all of her energy into ensuring the well-being of her two children and making decisions that are in their best interests,"" her publicist said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday. ""This situation has put a tremendous strain on Phaedra and her family, and she is working hard to bring back a sense of normalcy to everyone's lives."" Nida, who appears on the reality TV series with Parks, was arrested in January and pleaded guilty in May to charges in a fraud scheme that federal prosecutors say stole millions of dollars from at least 50 people over four years. He must serve five years under parole supervision after he completes his eight years in a federal prison, U.S. District Court Judge Charles A. Pannell, Jr. ordered at his sentencing in July. This is the second prison stint for Nida, who served five years in a federal prison for auto title fraud before marrying Parks in 2009. In the most recent case, Nida created two fake collection companies to gather personal information used to steal victims' identities, U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said after his sentencing in Atlanta. He used the information to get fraudulent auto loans in the names of his victims, according to the criminal complaint. He was busted after a yearlong investigation by the U.S. Secret Service. The break in the case came in September, when federal investigators arrested Gayla St. Julien, a woman who ""described herself as Nida's 'right hand b----' in executing the legwork of his fraud schemes,"" the criminal complaint said. St. Julien, who previously served prison time for identity theft, told agents that Nida ""only paid her 'scraps' "" for her work, ""compared to the amount of money he made from the fraud schemes,"" the filing said. She turned on him and agreed to let agents record their phone calls, it said. Nida ""knowingly and willfully (did) execute and attempt to execute a scheme to defraud federally insured financial institutions by depositing stolen and fraudulently obtained checks and fraudulently obtained auto loan proceeds into bank accounts opened in the stolen identities of real persons, and conspire with others to do so, and knowingly convert to his use and the use of others stolen and fraudulently obtained United States Treasury Checks,"" Special Agent Alexandre Herrera said in a sworn affidavit. Nida's fake companies fraudulently signed up with ""LexisNexis, Equifax, and Mircrobilt databases"" to steal personal information on people. Along with the fraudulent auto loan checks, Nida stole U.S. Treasury checks, ""retirement checks issued to Delta Airlines employees, and checks in the names of real people that were owed unclaimed property from various state and federal government agencies,"" the complaint said. Agents recorded phone calls St. Julien made to Nida, during which he discussed details of pending fraudulent auto loans and ""details of future auto loan checks that he was expecting to receive any day now from in the mail,"" the affidavit said.

"Newt Gingrich won Saturday's South Carolina GOP presidential primary, marking a stunning turnaround for a candidate who finished fourth in Iowa and New Hampshire and whose campaign had been left for dead -- again -- by observers just weeks ago. With about 95% of polling places reporting, Gingrich had 40% of the vote, with former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney getting 27% and former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum getting 17%. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas had 13%. Based on early returns and exit polls, CNN projected Gingrich the winner. In his victory speech to supporters, Gingrich thanked ""everyone in South Carolina who decided to be with us in changing Washington."" ""It is very humbling and very sobering to have so many people who so deeply want their country to get back on the right track -- so many people who are so concerned about jobs, about medical costs, about the everyday parts of life, and who feel that the elites in Washington and New York have no understanding, no care, no concern, no reliability, and in fact do not represent them at all,"" Gingrich said. Gingrich, whose surge has been helped in part by two strong debate performances in South Carolina, said that if he's resonating with voters, it's not just because he's a good debater. Up-to-minute updates on CNN.com's live blog . ""It's that I articulate the deepest-held values of the American people,"" he said. Since the beginning of the modern GOP primary system in 1980, this is the first time that three different GOP candidates won nominating contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. The winner of the South Carolina primary, which this year is the third contest on the primary and caucus calendar, has gone on to win the Republican nomination in every election since 1980. Less than a week ago, Romney, the New Hampshire winner, was looking at a double-digit lead in most polls of likely voters in South Carolina, a big lead in Florida and the possibility of a clear path to the GOP nomination. But Gingrich turned in two strong debate performances in the state this week while Romney was put on his heels by his rivals. Romney congratulated Gingrich in remarks to his supporters after polls closed Saturday night. ""This race is getting to be even more interesting,"" Romney said. ""... We're now three contests into a long primary season. This is a hard fight because there is so much worth fighting for."" How they voted in South Carolina . ""Our campaign has fought very hard here in South Carolina, and in the coming weeks and months, I'll keep fighting for every single vote. I will compete in every single state,"" he said. ""We're going to win this nomination, and we're going to defeat President Obama in November."" Santorum, the Iowa winner, also congratulated Gingrich on Saturday night. Nearly an hour earlier, he told CNN that the battle between the first three contests' winners is just beginning. ""The great narrative is that three days ago, there was an inevitability in this race,"" Santorum said. ""Mitt Romney was 2-0 (before Iowa officials switched the narrow Iowa result this week) and soon to be 3-0, and I took Iowa, Newt took South Carolina, and it's game on again."" Santorum said he was preparing not only to campaign in Florida, where the next primary awaits on January 31, but in other states, indicating he believed he had what it took to sustain his campaign for a long fight. ""This is a long race. As a result of what happened here tonight, this race isn't going to be over next week or the week after,"" Santorum said. ""This is going to be a long one, and it's going to be the best thing that could happen for whoever the eventual Republican nominee is, because that nominee is going to be sharpened by steel."" Paul told supporters he expected to get four to five times as many votes in South Carolina as he did four years ago. ""So there's every reason to be encouraged,"" he said. Gingrich's Palmetto State turnaround is just his latest. He came out of nowhere to top national polls in late fall on the strength of debate performances, but dropped again ahead of the Iowa caucuses as opponents hammered him in Iowa ads. ""Gingrich has been harder to kill than Rasputin,"" Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos said Saturday. ""He has been dead three times in this campaign, and ... the guy keeps coming back."" Are you voting in the S.C. primary? Share your story . According to exit polls Saturday, 38% of voters said they decided whom to vote for in the ""last few days,"" and 17% did so on Saturday. Of the ""last few days"" crowd, 44% voted for Gingrich, and 26% took Romney. Of those who decided Saturday, 44% voted for Gingrich, and 21% took Romney. Gingrich won a plurality of votes among all income categories except the one for people making $200,000 a year or more, a category that Romney won with 47%, according to the exit polls. The candidates will now focus on Florida, where they will debate in Tampa on Monday and at the CNN/Republican Party of Florida debate in Jacksonville on Thursday. The former House speaker has been presenting himself as the conservative alternative to the ""Massachusetts moderate"" Romney, while Romney continued to attack Gingrich as he has over the past week as polls tightened. Romney supporters and donors were grumbling Saturday that Romney's campaign badly mishandled how he responded to rivals' demands that he release his tax records. Romney said in a CNN debate Thursday night that he was not sure how many years of tax returns he plans to release but will make them public sometime in April. But as the polls were closing, a Romney source tried to downplay the results, noting that Romney got only 15% of the vote in South Carolina in 2008, a race that eventual nominee Sen. John McCain won. The campaign will immediately pivot to Florida, the source said, where ""we have a strong organization and big plans for next week."" Romney has held a large lead in polls of likely primary voters there, but recent polls show the race tightening a bit there, too. Three Republican sources told CNN that Romney has secured the endorsement of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is on many Republicans' wish list. But a Bush source denied the report, and sources in Romney's campaign said if that is true, he hadn't told them. The campaign plans a ""major"" economic speech on Tuesday morning as a prebuttal to Obama's State of the Union address that evening and differentiate Romney from Obama and Gingrich. He also plans a reaction speech to Obama's address on Wednesday morning. Romney launched a new line of attack on Gingrich on Saturday before polls closed, calling for him to release details on his work for government-backed mortgage giant Freddie Mac, an institution unpopular with conservatives. ""Didn't he say he was going to release information about his relationship there?"" Romney asked. ""Let's see what report he wrote for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, what his conclusions were and what the contract looked like. I thought he said he was going to do that."" Romney's campaign also has been pressing the former House speaker to release the full report from a 1990s ethics investigation that led to his downfall in Congress. Gingrich was reprimanded by the House and ordered to pay a $300,000 penalty in 1997 for violating an ethics rule. This week, Romney's campaign sent Gingrich a cake marking the 15th anniversary of that reprimand, according to a Romney campaign source. A picture provided by that source shows the wording ""Happy 15th anniversary, Mr. Speaker! ... Now release the records,"" written in icing on the cake. Things reversed quickly for Romney in South Carolina this week. As late as Tuesday, Romney had a double-digit lead in most polls of likely voters in the state's primary. Then what had been declared an eight-vote Romney victory in Iowa's January 3 caucuses was reversed into a 34-vote win for Santorum when the state party certified its results on Thursday. Later that day, Texas Gov. Rick Perry suspended his campaign and threw his support to Gingrich. ""It has been a hard week,"" state treasurer Curtis Loftis, a leading Romney surrogate, said Friday. ""Nobody is going to deny that."" Santorum spent the week trying to bring down Gingrich in what most see as a race between the moderate Romney against conservatives Gingrich or Santorum. Although most GOP strategists see Paul's strict interpretation of the Constitution and his views on defense and spending as out of step with the mainstream, he appeals to libertarian-leaning Republicans and has a large following among younger voters.","""I articulate the deepest-held values of the American people,"" Newt Gingrich says .

"""It's been seven years, and a lot has changed,"" Hillary Clinton said Sunday in her first visit to Iowa since the state dealt her presidential campaign a devastating body blow. But there was a moment in the afternoon when it seemed like not much had. Roughly 200 credentialed media were gathered in a far corner of the Indianola Balloon Field, the grassy expanse where Sen. Tom Harkin was convening his 37th and final Steak Fry, an annual fundraiser that doubles as a point of entry for ambitious Democrats curious about the Iowa caucuses. After a 90-minute wait, the press scrum -- scribblers and photographers alike -- were herded like cattle through a series of gates and escorted up to a hot smoking grill, waiting to capture the same image: a staged shot of Bill and Hillary Clinton, fresh out of their motorcade, ritualistically flipping steaks with Harkin. Hillary Clinton stumps for Iowa Democrats, and herself . The Clintons ignored the half-hearted shouted questions from reporters -- ""Mr. President, do you eat meat?"" -- with practiced ease. They were two football fields away from the nearest voter. Mechanical, distant, heavy-handed: The afternoon spectacle felt a lot like Hillary's 2008 caucus campaign, a succession of errors that crumbled under the weight of a feuding top-heavy staff and the candidate's inability to connect with her party's grassroots. And then the head fake -- and something different. After a few minutes, the Clintons walked into a nearby barn, out of view. Most of the media swarm gave up and hustled back to the main event, where nearly 7,000 Democrats were eating red meat and waiting patiently in the sunshine to hear from two of the most famous people in the world. A few dozen press were still milling about when the duo re-emerged. ""There she is!"" a television reporter screamed, clamoring for her cameraman. An early moment of engagement . There she was. Bill, too, walking along a fence and gabbing with a small army of political reporters, a chore that has never come easy for Hillary Clinton, and one she has assiduously avoided since leaving the State Department. It's hardly a shock that the voluble ex-President handled a rope line full of reporters with gusto. But the willingness of the more reticent Hillary Clinton to thrust herself into the gaping maw of the hungry press dragon signaled, perhaps, that she and her aides are eager for a fresh start in Iowa, and with the national media, if she runs for president once again. She kept both the state and the press at arm's length during her last campaign, with troublesome consequences. On Sunday, though, she gave it a go -- an early moment of engagement with the media and voters that revealed an understanding of past mistakes, but also the difficult road ahead if she takes the 2016 plunge. ""Good to see you!"" she told the assembled press, surely a half-truth. ""My goodness! You guys having a good time? Good. We're having a good time today."" Strutting back and forth, Clinton declared that it was ""fabulous to be back"" in the state. ""I love Iowa,"" she said, smiling as if she were in on a joke. She entertained and swatted away a bombardment of questions, mostly of the unremarkable ""will you run?"" variety. ""Does this whet your appetite for another campaign?"" asked one reporter. ""We're here to help Democrats,"" Clinton responded, offering requisite praise for Iowa's Democratic candidates, Senate hopeful Bruce Braley, gubernatorial challenger Jack Hatch and congressional candidate Staci Appel. This long-awaited interaction, so craved by the access-starved political press, was short-lived. Never quite at ease in these situations, Clinton milled about for five minutes or so, keeping a few feet between herself and the press, before walking back into the secure barn. The other Clinton -- now he likes to talk . Bill Clinton, meanwhile, was having at it, holding court with reporters for a good 20 minutes -- much of it with MSNBC host Ed Schultz -- while his wife, the presumed candidate-in-waiting, was nowhere in sight. Bill sidled up with Harkin and held forth with the press on all manner of topics: the '92 campaign, the prospect of being a grandparent, the scourge of outside money in political campaigns, the Arkansas and Georgia governor's races, a recent visit to Atlanta. After their futile yelps of ""Last question!"" and ""We gotta go"" were ignored over and over again, aides finally dragged the former President away. Then it was time to meet the voters. Hillary Clinton's speech to the sun-drenched crowd, more workmanlike than impassioned, was littered with Iowa pleasantries and nods to the last campaign, including her opening line: ""Hello Iowa! I'm back!"" She lavished praise on Harkin and, after a warm-up that included nods to her time as Secretary of State and her ""constant grandchild watch,"" urged the audience to get behind Iowa's slate of Democratic candidates. Her biggest applause lines were about women's issues -- equal pay and abortion rights -- a departure from the 2008 race in which she avoided focusing on her gender and the history-making nature of candidacy. The crowd was firmly in her corner, thanks in large part to the super PAC ""Ready For Hillary,"" which plastered every nook and cranny of the rural setting with ""READY"" signs and bused in an army of volunteers to collect email addresses and phone numbers from arriving Democrats. Bill Clinton laughingly called the young organizers ""Energizer bunnies."" Leading in the polls, but ... She leads the early polls here by a wide margin, but there is still fault to be found with Clinton among Iowa Democrats. Conversations reveal that some of them skew more liberal than Clinton on economic and foreign policy issues. Others want a fresh face and see the 66-year-old Clinton as an avatar of the past. And there are those who just say they'd like to see a competitive race, for the sake of ""the process,"" even if Clinton ultimately wins the nomination. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley has been welcomed warmly during his three visits to the state this year. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont socialist threatening to seek the nomination, also drew respectable crowds during a trip here timed to coincide with the Clinton show. Vice President Joe Biden will be in Des Moines later this week. Supporters of progressive Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who promises not to run, ran a booth near the entrance and distributed several hundred T-shirts and bumper stickers. Brenda Brink drove down from Ames and decked herself out in ""Ready 4 Warren"" gear, availing herself to any reporter willing to listen. ""Hillary is fine, she has done her duty, but she doesn't inspire me anymore,"" she said. ""She is aligned with the banking industry. But, you know, the Democratic Party is behind her."" Despite her lament, Brink said she'd received many-a-thumbs up during the day. 'This time, she will make history' The fields of Indianola, however, were firmly Clinton turf on Sunday. ""She was wonderful,"" Sue LaPlante, a certified nursing assistant from Des Moines, said after the speech. ""If she runs, she will be the next president."" ""Hillary was a good candidate last time, but sometimes it's what fate throws at you, and Barack Obama was making history,"" said Irene Hardisty, a 61-year old mortgage finance specialist from Des Moines. ""This time she will make history."" Everyone here -- operative, activist, politician, reporter -- has a theory about why Clinton finished third in Iowa in 2008. And there are no shortages of bright ideas about how she can perform better in 2016. But there is universal agreement from rank-and-file Democrats that Clinton has to ""touch and feel"" Iowans, listen to them, talk one-on-one and get outside the security and media bubble that surrounds her everywhere she goes. She gave that a go, too, working the rope line after her speech for half an hour in the baking sun, signing copies of ""Hard Choices,"" awkwardly posing for selfies and saying thank you to the many people demanding she run for president. It wasn't a perfect show. At times, as her Secret Service detail and her aide Huma Abedin escorted her along the crowd, she looked like she'd rather be elsewhere. She ignored questions from not-so-friendly crowd members who wanted her to comment on the President's immigration policy, recovery funds for Superstorm Sandy or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Then it was back to the motorcade. But she put in the effort -- and got her first real taste of what's to come if she decides to do this campaign thing all over again.","With Bill at her side, Hillary Clinton attends the 37th and final Harkin Steak Fry .

"ZURICH, Switzerland (Reuters)  -- An amateur paleontologist in Switzerland may have unearthed Europe's largest dinosaur mass grave after he dug up the remains of two Plateosaurus. The dinosaurs' bones came to light during house-building in the village of Frick, near the German border. ""A hobby paleontologist looked at a construction site for a house and happened to discover the bones,"" said Monica Ruembeli from the Frick dinosaur museum. The finds show that an area known for Plateosaurus finds for decades may be much larger than originally thought. ""It could be that the area extends for 1.5 kilometers (0.9 miles) and in that case, you could certainly say it's the biggest site in Europe,"" said Martin Sander, a dinosaur paleontologist at the university of Bonn in Germany. The Frick area contained the bones of one animal per 100 square meters, Sander said, so the entire area might contain bones of 100 more Plateosaurus. The peaceful herbivore -- measuring up to 10 meters from head to tail -- roamed river deltas in large herds some 210 million years ago, according to some scientists, when most of Switzerland was covered with desert and its landscape may have looked much like the estuary of the Nile now. There are two other large Plateosaurus sites in Germany, Sander said. It is not known how big they are because one is covered by the town of Halberstadt and the other, near Trossingen, by a forest.

"A new CNN poll finds that about half of Republicans sympathize with the tea party movement. The other half either remain aloof or (5%) even express hostility. That second group of Republicans has received remarkably little media attention this cycle. Yet their man -- Mitt Romney -- has held steady in first or second place for the past three years. Meanwhile tea party Republicans have bounced from Sarah Palin to Donald Trump to Michele Bachmann to Rick Perry to (now) Herman Cain, transfixing the media every time they lose faith in one messiah and search for another. Yet sooner or later, the tea party Republicans must converge on a single choice. When they do, they will present the non-tea party Republicans with a troubling menu of possibilities. Possibility 1: Romney is nominated, Romney is elected. From the point of view of non-tea party Republicans, this is the ideal outcome of the 2012 election. Yet it is also an outcome that looks worryingly out of reach. As we enter the final 12 months of the election countdown, Romney still cannot rise above 30% support in his own party. Worse, while it's easy to imagine (say) Herman Cain's voters shifting to Rick Perry or vice versa, it is very hard to imagine where Mitt Romney will find the additional Republican votes he needs. Possibility 2:  Romney is nominated, Romney loses. For non-tea party Republicans, this second outcome opens all kinds of ugly, ominous possibilities. If candidate Romney loses, tea party Republicans will claim that the GOP lost because it failed to nominate a ""true conservative."" That claim may fly in the face of political math (how would a more extreme candidate win more votes?), but it will pack a lot of emotional punch. Intense partisans are always ready to believe that the way to win is to be more intense and more partisan. Back-to-back losses under John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 will open the way to an ultra-conservative nominee in 2016 -- and a true party debacle. Possibility 3: A tea party Republican is nominated and loses. From the point of view of a non-tea party Republican, the third possibility is the most tragic waste. A winnable election will be thrown away on an ideological adventure. Yet within the disaster might lurk a silver lining. At least the GOP will get the ideological adventure out of its system. For three years, Republican activists have lived in a fantasy world in which fringe characters like Sarah Palin and Herman Cain somehow ""speak for the common sense of the common people."" It seems incredible that anybody could believe such a thing. It seems crazy that anyone would actually need a presidential election to disabuse them of such notions. But as Benjamin Franklin said: ""Experience is a hard teacher, but fools will have no other."" Possibility 4: A tea party Republican is nominated and wins. This possibility has to be reckoned the most unlikely. But it cannot be excluded as utterly impossible, on two conditions: . If the U.S. economy continues as weak and sick as it is today, and; . If tea party Republicans revert from the utterly unelectable Herman Cain to Rick Perry, who as governor of Texas possesses at least the paper qualifications for the presidency. Then - who knows? - anything might happen. Perry would be a much weaker candidate than Romney, but if the voters are determined to fire the incumbent, then even a weak challenger can prevail. (See Barack Hussein Obama, 2008 candidacy of.) In which case, not only tea party Republicans but all Republicans and all Americans will confront the problem: what next? The tea party stands for a series of propositions that don't meet the reality test: that deficits matter more than jobs, that cutting deficits and tightening credit will accelerate economic growth, that high taxes and over-regulation are the most important reasons that growth has not revived, and that America still offers the world's best opportunity for the poor to rise. Tea party plans call for a radical shift in the burden of taxation from the rich to the poor -- and promise big reductions in government spending without touching any of the benefits of current retirees. If put into practice, the tea party platform is a formula for political and economic crisis. Fortunately, it remains a long-shot outcome. If you're betting the odds, you want to put your money on possibility three. As for possibility one -- that's just good government. And nobody seems to get much excited about that these days.","David Frum: Non-tea party Republicans hope Romney will be the nominee and win election .

"Americans' pessimism about the nation's economic conditions, and skepticism that government can help solve that problem, delivered Democrats their midterm beating this cycle, a team of bipartisan pollsters found in a midterm postmortem survey. Democratic pollster Celinda Lake and Republican pollster Ed Goeas said those were the main takeaways from their final George Washington University Battleground Poll of the cycle, conducted Dec. 7-11 among 1,000 registered voters nationwide. And they said the survey has grave implications for the Democratic Party if they can't craft a cohesive, convincing message on the economy. ""Tell me who is ahead on the economy in 2016 and I'll tell you who is going to be president,"" Lake said at a Christian Science Monitor event on Thursday. She noted that ""voters' economic anxiety is deep-seated, and shows no signs of abating."" The poll found that a vast majority of Americans, 77 percent, said they're at least somewhat worried about the nation's current economic conditions. And voters in the middle class are the most pessimistic about the economy, the pollsters found. That points to why, Lake and Goeas said, Democrats had so much trouble this cycle and ultimately lost control of the Senate to Republicans and gave the GOP their biggest majority in the House since the 1920s. Democrats aimed their midterm message at middle class voters, highlighting policies like a minimum wage hike and fair pay legislation that they said polled well with the middle class. But that strategy was too ""piecemeal,"" Lake wrote in her analysis of the poll, and ""struck voters as falling well short of the level of change necessary to set our country and our economy back on track."" And Democrats had trouble selling the public government solutions for their problems because, the poll found, American voters are still split on whether government can solve them to begin with. ""Voters want government to intervene, but they fear what the government will do if it wades into the important task of ensuring the economic stability of voters,"" Goeas said. A slight majority, 52 percent, said the government should do more to solve problems and help meet the needs of people, while 48 percent said it should get out of the way and let the free market help people get ahead. Many in the party have diagnosed that very issue as one of the main reasons the party fared so poorly in the midterms.","A George Washington University Battleground Poll found Americans split on the role of government .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court, perhaps for the final time, has rejected a multistate appeal over efforts to keep the invasive Asian carp from reaching the Great Lakes ecosystem. The justices turned aside another request for intervention Monday, the latest chapter in a nearly century-old dispute between six Midwest states and the Canadian province of Ontario. At issue is a direct challenge to Illinois' complex water diversion and sewage disposal network, which some predict will inadvertently allow the non-native fish to enter Lake Michigan. Some environmentalists and lawmakers fear an economic and ecological disaster if the creatures breach man-made barriers. And there are concerns that the fish may have already slipped past locks and entered the massive freshwater bodies of water. The fish can grow up to 4 feet in length and 100 pounds in weight, reproduce rapidly and can gobble up to 40 percent of their body weight daily, quickly out-competing less aggressive native fish populations. The high court has refused to intervene in the case twice in recent months. Some activists say Michigan could file another appeal in federal court, but it could take months to resolve. The justices were asked to grant a preliminary injunction, which would have forced Illinois to immediately close down much of its Chicago-area shipping locks and dams, and would have prompted rapid construction of a fish-proof barrier. The voracious Asian carp have migrated up the Mississippi River to the Chicago suburbs. State officials, businesses, and environmentalists fear that it is only a step away from triggering a swift economic disaster across the Great Lakes, saying that once in Lake Michigan they would spread quickly to Lake Erie, Lake Huron, Lake Ontario and Lake Superior. ""What could be at stake is the multibillion-dollar fishing industry -- commercial, sports fishing, and recreational fishing industries -- in the Great Lakes,"" said Chris McCloud of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, noting that the lakes constitute ""the largest freshwater body on Earth, and we have to protect it at all costs."" DNA from the carp was found in December closer to Lake Michigan than ever before -- at a Wilmette, Illinois, pumping station along the lake shore -- raising fresh concerns that the fish has breached an electric barrier placed along a maze of canals and locks in Illinois. In a signal of the urgency, Michigan, Wisconsin and New York have repeatedly but unsuccessfully asked the high court to order those locks closed immediately. Among those being sued are Chicago's local water reclamation agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which helped build and maintain the canal system. Illinois officials say other states and the federal courts do not have the legal authority to order the closing of any federally approved water management projects. There are fears that shutting down the locks would lead to massive flooding and cripple the area's commercial shipping industry. The term ""Asian carp"" is actually an umbrella name for at least four large varieties of fish considered nuisance invasive species: the grass, black, silver and bighead carp. Related to common goldfish, the bigger types are prolific jumpers, easily spooked out of the water by passing watercraft, and numerous boaters have been injured by inadvertent flying fish collisions. Biologists have been tracking their northern migration ever since they were imported in the 1960s, traced to an Arkansas fish farmer. Several of the fish escaped during a flood in the 1990s and quickly expanded their range. Their possible presence just miles from the lakes prompted the latest lawsuit over the so-called Chicago Diversion, a project started in the late 1800s to prevent the city's sewage from contaminating Lake Michigan. The project involved reversing the flow of the Chicago River, connecting it and two other nearby rivers with the Mississippi River basin. That created a connection between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi, helping fuel an economic boom in the nation's third largest metropolitan area. In 1922, Wisconsin sued Illinois to stop the growing water diversion, since other states relied on the drinking water. All other lake states except Indiana joined suit, and the Supreme Court eventually agreed with them, ordering mitigating effects over Illinois' diversion. Now several of those states are asking the justices to reopen the old cases. Such interstate disputes over boundaries and shared natural resources are one of the few instances where appeals can go directly to the Supreme Court, instead of first being heard in lower courts. The Obama administration is supporting Illinois. In a filing with the high court last fall, Solicitor General Elena Kagan argued that although allowing the carp to enter the Great Lakes would produce ""grave and irreparable harm,"" it was only ""speculative"" that the harm would occur ""imminently."" She suggested that Michigan and other states were more interested in relitigating disputes over removal of water from the lakes than seeking to stop fish from entering the lakes. The other states and Canada want the Illinois water diversion projects be declared a ""public nuisance"" because of the carp emergency. Of more immediate concern, they want Illinois and federal officials to modify their fish-control facilities -- including electric fences -- to ensure that the fish stay away from the lakes. Electric barriers were set up in 2002 in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, about 33 miles from Lake Michigan. They became fully operational last year, but Army engineers acknowledge that the barrier is not 100 percent effective. It is designed not to kill carp but to discourage them from going further. ""We can control what the fish feels, basically,"" said Col. Vincent Quarles, commander of the Chicago District of the Army Corps of Engineers. ""What they feel is a jolt or a tingle. It's an electric current in the canal being created by our barriers."" Another underwater barrier is set for completion this year. The cases are Wisconsin, Michigan, New York v. Illinois and Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago (1, Orig.; 2, Orig.; 3 Orig.).","Justices won't get involved in dispute between six states, Ontario .

"A man who allegedly shot a 15-year-old boy and his 12-year-old cousin last summer following a neighborhood dispute over a dog has been arrested in Stockton, California, after a 7-month manhunt, police said. A task force of U.S. Marshals and Stockton police closed in on Alfonso Martinez, 20, Wednesday afternoon as he got into his car outside a Stockton apartment complex. He allegedly tried to back the car into the officers, but hit a pole after police rammed the vehicle with an unmarked car.  After hitting a pole, Martinez fought with police, who ""legally subdued"" him with a stun gun, Stockton police spokesman Joe Silva said. Police later found a loaded 9 mm handgun gun inside the car, Silva added. Martinez was being sought in connection with several shootings, including the July 12 shooting that partially blinded and deafened the 15-year-old. The 12-year-old was shot in the leg. ""Praise Jesus!"" said Demetria Carruthers, the grandmother of the older boy who was shot. ""Now my family can sleep."" The boy, now 16, told his story to CNN Digital as part of a project that looked at every shooting that took place across the United States on July 12. Because he is under 18 and his shooter was still at large when the original story was published, CNN agreed to identify him only by his childhood nickname, Dookie. The CNN Guns Project: One Day of Violence . Dookie, who lost an eye, underwent brain surgery and has been recovering at home. He hopes to return to school in January. He wants to see the man who shot him convicted and sent to prison. ""I want him gone,"" he told CNN in September. That process begins Friday afternoon, when Martinez is due in court to face charges of attempted murder, assaulting a police officer with a deadly weapon and drug  offenses. He is being held without bail in the San Joaquin County jail. Dookie told CNN he never saw the bullets coming. He said he received a call asking him to back up his friends in a fight. They'd been having trouble with Martinez, who lived with a girlfriend near his cousins, Dookie said. Dookie had gone back to retrieve a gold chain broken in the scuffle when a light-colored sedan began to follow him and a cousin down the street. About a dozen shots were fired at the boys from a handgun inside the car. Dookie was airlifted to the UC Davis Medical Center, where he underwent surgery to remove a section of his skull and relieve the pressure on his brain. He spent a week in a medically induced coma. Within a day or two of the shooting, police found surveillance camera video of one of the neighborhood fights and used social media to post an image of the man involved. That led investigators to a clearer photo and a name. Police initially believed Martinez had fled to Mexico or was hiding out in Reno, Nevada. Martinez also was being sought on a warrant for a drug charge.","Alfonso Martinez, 20, arrested after 7-month manhunt .

"The United States is cutting funding to the U.N. education and science agency UNESCO after the agency voted to accept a Palestinian bid for full membership, the U.S. State Department said Monday. ""Today's vote by the member states of UNESCO to admit Palestine as member is regrettable, premature and undermines our shared goal of a comprehensive just and lasting peace in the Middle East,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. ""The United States will refrain from making contributions to UNESCO,"" she said. The United States was going to make a $60 million payment in November, and will now not do so, she said. Some U.S. lawmakers had called on the Obama administration to withhold funding to UNESCO if the measure was approved. How the U.S. decision could be counterproductive . The lawmakers cited U.S. law, which states that funds must be denied to any organization granting the Palestine Liberation Organization ""the same standing as member states."" A spokeswoman for the U.S. Mission to UNESCO -- the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization -- said the United States contributes $80 million a year. The U.S. contribution comprises 22% of the agency's funding in its regular budget, a spokeswoman for UNESCO said. The vote, which required two-thirds approval by UNESCO members, passed with 107 in favor, 14 against, and 52 abstentions. It was the first such vote by a part of the world body. The vote is separate from the Palestinian bid for full membership in the United Nations. Representatives of several countries pointed out that currently that bid is being discussed by members of the U.N. Security Council. Huge applause broke out at the meeting in Paris when the results of the vote were announced. UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova, speaking after the vote, said she is concerned for the financial stability of the organization. ""I believe it is the responsibility of all of us to make sure that UNESCO does not suffer unduly,"" she said, specifically citing concerns about losing funding from ""our largest contributor, the United States."" Bokova said the ""admission of a new member state is a mark of respect and confidence."" U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon addressed the concern as well, saying ""we will need to work on practical solutions to preserve UNESCO's financial resources."" Ban said he had no further comment, although he noted ""the urgency of a negotiated solution of the Middle East peace process."" Susan Rice, the U.N. ambassador to the United Nations, posted on her Twitter account: ""Today's vote to grant Palestinian membership in UNESCO is no substitute for direct negotiations, but it is deeply damaging to UNESCO."" UNESCO, which is headquartered in Paris, works to promote peace and sustainable development through education, the sciences and culture. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the vote ""is premature and undermines the international community's shared goal of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East.  Today's vote distracts us from our shared goal of direct negotiations that results in a secure Israel and an independent Palestine living side by side in peace and security."" Palestinian leaders celebrated the vote. ""This is a significant victory and sends a clear message to those who are trying to hold history and deny the rights of Palestinians that there are a majority of nations with conscience who refuse to be intimidated and blackmailed,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's Executive Committee, speaking by phone from Ramallah, in the West Bank. ""The ones who voted negatively are isolating themselves along with Israel on the wrong side of justice and the law. And if the U.S. continues to threaten to boycott or withdrawal from organizations that recognizes Palestine it might find itself outside most global institutions with diminishing influence and standing,"" she said. Sabri Saidam, adviser to Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas, said, ""This is a historic moment, a moment of jubilation on route to full recognition of Palestinian independence and self-determination, that's equally a call for reconsideration of positions to those wavering on the Security Council vote. ""It is also a foundation stone for what's to come at the (Security Council) and other international organizations. Today's experience is a manifestation of ability of the international community to defy occupation and practically work towards ending it."" The Israeli representative, Nimrod Barkan, addressing the meeting after the vote, called the decision ""a tragedy for UNESCO"" and ""a great disservice to international law."" UNESCO has now ""adopted the science fiction version of reality by admitting a nonexistent state to the science organization,"" he said. In a statement, Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, ""This is a unilateral Palestinian maneuver which will bring no change on the ground but further removes the possibility for a peace agreement. This decision will not turn the Palestinian Authority into an actual state yet places unnecessary burdens on the route to renewing negotiations. Israel believes that the correct and only way to make progress in the diplomatic process with the Palestinians is through direct negotiations without preconditions."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the vote during remarks at the start of the Knesset winter session. ""Instead of sitting around the negotiating table,"" Netanyahu said, Palestinian leaders ""have decided to make an alliance with Hamas and are carrying out one-sided endeavors in the U.N., including today.  We will not sit with folded arms against these measures which are hurting Israel and are violating bluntly the most basic obligations the parties took in the peace process, to solve the conflict between us through negotiations. Sadly, during the time we are trying to form a Palestinian state with a peace agreement they are trying to form a state without an agreement."" David Killion, the U.S. permanent representative to UNESCO, said the United States ""cannot accept the premature Palestinian admission for membership in a United Nations specialized agency such as UNESCO."" ""Despite the challenges ahead, we pledge to continue our efforts to find ways to support and strengthen the important work of this vital organization,"" he said, addressing the UNESCO meeting after the vote. Killion did not say what could happen to U.S. funding for UNESCO. The Pakistani representative called the decision ""momentous."" ""For over six decades, Palestinians have proven to be superb human beings but have regrettably remained without their rights,"" she said, adding that ""today this wrong has been righted."" She referred to the longtime Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as an ""inimitable hero."" The representative from Sri Lanka said that with its vote, UNESCO ""acted precisely as the conscience of the world community."" ""I think that by showing Palestine's independence is an idea whose time has come and that this has brought recognition in the world community, we have in fact bolstered all the efforts which with respect towards a negotiated peace and towards the recognition that is sought in the Security Council,"" he said. Earlier, as the vote was under way, applause broke out after some countries voted in favor of the bid. There was laughter in the room after Israel voted no. In September, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas launched the bid for the United Nations to recognize a Palestinian state. UNESCO is the first agency the Palestinians have sought to join. The Palestinian Authority-run Wafa news agency reported late on Monday that Palestine is preparing to apply for full membership in the World Health Organization. Since Palestinian leaders made the request for membership in UNESCO earlier this month, U.S. lawmakers have urged the agency to reject it. ""Any recognition of Palestine as a Member State would not only jeopardize the hope for a resumption of direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, but (it) would endanger the United States' contribution to UNESCO,"" said an October 13 letter signed by members of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, which appropriates UNESCO's U.S. funding. Rep. Kay Granger, R-Texas, who chairs the subcommittee, said she will ""advocate for all funding to be cut off."" ""This is consistent with current law, and I will consider additional actions as needed,"" she said this month. ""There are consequences for short-cutting the process, not only for the Palestinians, but for our longstanding relationship with the United Nations."" She was referring to a provision of U.S. code which states: ""No funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or any other Act shall be available for the United Nations or any specialized agency thereof which accords the Palestine Liberation Organization the same standing as member states."" Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, slammed Monday's vote. In a statement before the State Department announced it was cutting funding, Ros-Lehtinen said, ""Today's reckless action by UNESCO is anti-Israel and anti-peace.  It rewards the Palestinian leadership's dangerous scheme to bypass negotiations with Israel and seek recognition of a self-declared 'Palestinian state,' and takes us further from peace in the Middle East."" ""Existing U.S. law mandates that we cut off funding to any U.N. body that approves such a request.  The administration must stop trying to find ways not to fully implement this law, and instead cut off funding to UNESCO immediately,"" she said.  ""And Congress must pass pending U.N. reform legislation to cut off funding to any U.N. entity that grants any upgraded status to 'Palestine.' Such strong action is the only way to deter other U.N. bodies from following in UNESCO's footsteps, and to prevent U.S. taxpayer dollars from paying for biased entities at the U.N.""","Report: Palestine will seek full membership in the World Health Organization .

"Marco Rubio needed to get back on the radar after his fellow Floridian, Jeb Bush, jolted the political world this week with an announcement that he was considering a presidential run. The Republican senator got help from an unlikely source: President Barack Obama . Rubio seized on Obama's decision to thaw relations with Cuba to become the first -- and most forceful -- of the potential 2016 presidential contenders to oppose the move. He appeared on every major news network except for MSNBC on Wednesday, hammering  Obama as ""willfully ignorant"" on U.S.-Cuba relations and promising to do everything within his power as an incoming chairman of a subcommittee that handles Cuba policy to ""unravel"" the administration's plans. He spoke in both English and Spanish, and couched his opposition in his own family story, as the son of two immigrants who fled Cuba. But more than an opportunity, seizing on the development is a necessity for the senator as he stares down the man — who has been a mentor of sorts to the young conservative star — that many Republicans are calling the ""elephant in the room"" crowding others out of the presidential race. Bush's announcement on Tuesday that he's ""actively exploring"" a run for president immediately shifted the dynamic of the GOP presidential primary fight. Many political observers believe that Rubio won't run if Bush does — and, more than that, Rubio can't run if Bush does. Indeed, GOP donors say his announcement has already begun to lock up much of the establishment money. And with the political establishment already speaking out in favor of Bush, Rubio's path to the nomination has narrowed. Bush associates insist the two aren't at odds on the Cuba issue, noting the former Governor also came out staunchly opposed in a statement later Wednesday. ""I don't see how this is a 'fight' between them,"" a spokeswoman said. ""The President made a very ill-advised decision and two Florida leaders who have engaged on the issue for decades engaged."" But the U.S. policy shift on Cuba offers Rubio a unique opportunity to regain control of the national spotlight, and draw a stark comparison with Bush in style, if not in substance. Rick Wilson, a Florida-based GOP operative with ties to Rubio, noted that he came out early and aggressively on the issue, where Bush hesitated. ""All the way across the board he was the guy you could count on yesterday to correctly assess the situation. He became the counterweight against the the president,"" he said. ""Bush handled it, but it was later in the news cycle."" The issue of U.S.-Cuba relations also gives him an opportunity to show his ability to get things done on Capitol Hill. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he's on board with whatever Rubio says on the issue. And if the senator keeps his promise to block the administration's moves at every opportunity, he'll keep his name and message in the media even as other Republican contenders ramp up their own campaigns and draw much of the party's attention. But more than that, the administration's announcement was an opening for Rubio to highlight what his supporters say is his best rationale for running — and why his choice, aides insist, will have nothing to do with what Bush decides: His compelling personal story. The party acknowledged after the 2012 elections that it can't compete nationally if it doesn't mitigate its deep deficit with Latinos. Both Rubio and Bush are seen as credible messengers to that demographic group — they both speak fluent Spanish, and Bush's wife was born in Mexico. But Rubio is the son of immigrants, and his supporters say that gives his message a particular resonance. And they note that he's one of the youngest potential contenders in the field. ""The Cuba situation ties into everything that makes Marco Marco, which is he understands, from the position of a son of two immigrants, what it means to come from a country like that to this one,"" said Matt Keelen, a GOP fundraiser and Rubio supporter. ""It fits into what I believe, if he runs, his theme is going to be — which is the lack of belief in the American Dream,"" he added.","Rubio seized on Obama Cuba moves .

"It's been a year since a plane crash ended the lives of Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera and six others, and new details have emerged about what might have caused the plane to plunge 28,000 feet into a mountainous area of northern Mexico. Last week, Mexico's aviation investigation agency released its findings on the December 9, 2012, crash, saying that the 78-year-old pilot was too old for the license he was given by Mexican authorities, and the 43-year-old Learjet was flying unevenly and shaking when it reached cruising speed. In addition, the report from Mexico's General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics noted that the owner of the plane neglected to report problems with the plane's operation before last year's ill-fated flight from Monterrey to Mexico City. The agency said the report reflects the conclusion of its investigation into the crash that killed Rivera, two pilots, and the singer's lawyer, publicist, hairdresser and makeup artist. The families of the four passengers have filed a wrongful death suit against Starwood Management, the company that owned the plane, and Jenni Rivera's entertainment company. Plane owner linked to troubled businessman . Known to fans as ""La Diva de la Banda"" or The Diva of Banda Music, Rivera was well-established as a musical powerhouse with her Spanish-language performances of regional Mexican corridos, or ballads. For fans, the nickname captured her powerful voice and the personal strength many admired. Her legacy will be honored on the one year anniversary of her death. The U.S. Spanish-language network Telemundo is dedicating several days of special programming, including tributes in the Mexican state of Nuevo León by family and fans and near the plane crash site about 70 miles south of Monterrey, Mexico. Rivera's newest album will be released on Tuesday, according to Universal Music Group. It will include music from her last concert at the Monterrey Arena the day before she boarded the doomed charter jet. Rivera, who was 43 when she died, became the most successful female banda singer in grupero, a male-dominated genre in the regional Mexican music industry.  She sold more than 15 million records, according to Billboard magazine. Banda and norteña music lyrics have always focused on women, drinking and drug trafficking. But Rivera was the genre's first female voice to express the issues that man women face: domestic violence, being a poor and single mother and how difficult it was to be a Hispanic woman in the United States. Fans remember her as a powerful woman who was able to bring people together. ""She wasn't the typical face that you see on Spanish language television,"" said Leila Cobo, executive director of Latin content and programming for Billboard, and the author of a biography on Rivera. Where the lawsuits stand . A month after the plane crash, the families of publicist Arturo Rivera, makeup artist Jacob Yebale, attorney Mario Macias Pacheco, and hairdresser Jorge Armando Sanchez Vasquez filed a wrongful death lawsuit against U.S.-based Starwood Management and Jenni Rivera Enterprises Inc. seeking punitive damages for negligence. The lawsuit is scheduled to be tried in California, a Los Angeles County judge ruled last month, despite an attempt by the plane operators to move the case to Mexico. Starwood is still deciding whether or not to appeal that ruling, according to Starwood's attorney Mark Velasquez. Attorney Paul R. Kiesel, who represents the four families involved in the lawsuit, said he expects it will be ""a couple of years"" before a trial date will be set for the lawsuit. ""As for the case, we're continuing with the underlying investigation as to why the plane fell out of the sky. Was it pilot error? Mechanical failure? We're now taking depositions from individuals who chartered the plane to find out more,"" Kiesel said. Rivera crash puts spotlight on charter jet safety . The 1969 Learjet that Rivera and the six others boarded last year was involved in another crash in 2005 in Amarillo, Texas, when the pilot lost ability to steer during landing. The plane sustained substantial damage in that crash, according to the National Transportation Safety Board records. In addition, court records revealed that Starwood Management had two planes authorities seized in 2012 in Arizona and Texas, triggering an investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration days after the 2012 plane crash. At the time, the DEA declined to elaborate on its investigation. CNN reached out to the DEA this week for further comment but did not hear back from them in time before the story was published. When asked how the victims' families were coping as the anniversary of the plane crash approaches, Kiesel said his clients are staying out of the spotlight citing a significant amount of media intrusion over the past year. Death at the peak of her career . Rivera's death came at the height of her musical and acting career. With a weekly radio show, a makeup and clothing line, and a starring role in reality TV show ""I Love Jenni,"" Rivera had a starring role alongside Edward James Olmos and Lou Diamond Phillips in ""Filly Brown,"" a film that released this spring. Olmos told CNN that working with Rivera was ""the most inspirational part of the filming process."" Rivera's popularity among her fans is partly because her life story is a testament that even those who come from humble beginnings can achieve success. She was born in Long Beach, California, shortly after her mother illegally crossed the Mexican border.  Growing up, she once sold cans for scrap metal and hawked music records at her family's stand at a Los Angeles flea market, she told CNN en Español in 2010. When she was just 15 and a high school student, she became a mother herself, giving birth to her first child, daughter Janney ""Chiquis"" Marin Rivera in 1985. She detailed her personal struggles -- including her mother's miscarriage, a suicide attempt at 19, rape and domestic abuse by her first husband --  in her memoir ""Unbreakable: My Story, My Way,""  published in July. ""People don't realize how difficult her rise to fame was. Her struggle as an artist gets lost a lot. She worked very hard to get where she was,"" said Billboard's Leila Cobo. ""The first time she got into the charts was around 1995 but she had six albums before she ever charted."" Responding to the intense public interest in the entertainer after her death, Cobo  -- one of the country's leading experts in Latin music who regularly interviewed Rivera -- wrote a biography on Rivera, ""Jenni Rivera: The Incredible Journey of a Warrior Butterfly,"" which was released in Spanish and English earlier this year. In her book, Cobo focused on Rivera's musical career through the eyes of a journalist, saying that Rivera's family never responded to her interview requests. CNN also reached out to the family, but they declined to comment. Many suspect the reluctance to speak to the media lies with the tension in the Rivera family since the matriarch of the family died.  Rivera's five children are no strangers to the media spotlight -- daughters Janney ""Chiquis"" Marin, Jacquie Marin, and Jenicka Lopez, and sons Johnny Lopez and Michael Marin starred in the reality show ""I Love Jenni,"" which aired on the cable network Mun2 for three seasons, wrapping up earlier this year. On Monday, the one year anniversary of Rivera's death, Mun2 -- NBC's companion cable channel geared toward young Latinos --  will reair episodes of ""I Love Jenni,"" which was shot before Rivera's death and focuses on the hectic life of her family. With a reputation as a no-nonsense business woman who personified the American dream, Rivera is still making an impact on the Latino community. ""A lot of people were able to relate to her,"" Cobo said, ""For the most part, her personal life was very public, an open book.""

"London (CNN)Occupied France, July 1941. Michel Chapuis, a charismatic, French art student on assignment for Vogue magazine, was traveling on a busy train alongside peasants and German soldiers. Suddenly, an old women leaned over. ""Before the War, my brother had beautiful English shoes like yours,"" she said. The young man froze. ""C'est extraordinaire,"" he replied, affecting nonchalance. Luckily, none of the German soldiers overheard this conversation, and he lived to fight another day. And, after surviving three Vichy prisons and five Nazi concentration camps, he became one of the most prominent fashion illustrators of his age. Michel Chapuis, of course, was not his real name. Rather, it was a cover used by Brian Stonehouse, a British spy and talented artist who had parachuted into France the month before as part of the legendary Special Operations Executive (SOE), a clandestine espionage and sabotage unit. On landing in France, his radio transmitter had become tangled in a tree, and his first few days had been wasted trying to retrieve it without attracting attention. Thereafter, he had gone to ground for two weeks, living on nothing but stolen peaches -- a diet which had left him with acute dysentery -- before risking the train journey to Limoges to make contact with a spy network known as ""Ventriloquist"". Stonehouse had been trained as a clandestine radio operator, and given the codename Celestin. On the train that day he was carrying a paintbox that had been specially adapted to contain a secret transmitter -- the one he had managed to rescue from the tree. A most dangerous mission . At that time, the life expectancy of an SOE radio operator in occupied France was just six weeks. Knowing that something as insignificant as a British button on his jacket could give the game away, SOE's Camouflage Section had painstakingly made Stonehouse's clothes using French fabric, styles and techniques. But for some reason, he was still wearing British-made shoes. ""He told the story to his sister, but she isn't sure how the mistake occurred,"" says Philip Athill, managing director of the Abbot and Holder Ltd art dealer in London, who has collected Stonehouse's work. ""Maybe he was wearing French shoes to start with but they got ruined, so he changed them at a safe house. Either way, he was lucky to escape."" That Stonehouse was nearly given away by his clothing is ironic: after the War he enjoyed a stellar career as a fashion illustrator, becoming one of the leading artists for Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. He even painted a portrait of Britain's Queen Mother, which hangs in the Special Forces Club in London to this day. But this was not before he had spent almost three years in captivity. In October 1942, the Gestapo were able to triangulate his position during a secret transmission, and Stonehouse was arrested. He spent the rest of the war in various prisons and camps, including in the notorious Dachau concentration camp. He survived only because he was able to draw the guards' wives and mistresses in exchange for extra food and shelter. From rags to riches . Immediately after the War, Stonehouse returned to Dachau to make sketches of the crematoria, in order to ""bear witness"" (these drawings are currently held at the Imperial War Museum in London). He was also able to use his exceptional visual memory to serve his country one last time. Officials from SOE were trying to find out what had happened to four of their female officers; Stonehouse was able to draw from memory four well-dressed women that he had seen being taken to their deaths by the Nazis the year before. His sketches matched their photographs. As a result, their files were closed and their families were informed of their deaths. It was while Stonehouse was acting as a witness at the War Crimes Tribunal that he met the American socialite Harry Haller, then a major in the United States Army. Haller persuaded Stonehouse to move to New York to join the large number of Second World War émigré illustrators who were shaping America's fashion trends. With Haller's help, Stonehouse quickly became part of the high society scene, rubbing shoulders with Henry Fonda and his fourth glamorous wife, the Italian baroness Afdera Franchetti, as well as members of Hemingway's circle. In 1952, Jessica Davies, an editor at Vogue, made Stonehouse the first new illustrator to be taken on by the magazine since 1939. ""In those days, there was a belief that illustration showed how the clothes should be worn better than photography,"" says Athill. ""The magazines were split evenly between photographs and illustration. It was the golden age of fashion illustration."" Tinker, tailor, artist, spy . Stonehouse died of a heart attack in 1998, and his pictures have been brought together for the first time at Abbot and Holder Ltd, where they can be purchased. They have also been collected in a new book, ""Brian Stonehouse, MBE, 1918-1998"", by Frederic A Sharf and Michelle Tolini Finamore (Sharf, $24.95). ""Normally, fashion illustrations of the period were thrown away after they had been published,"" says Athill. ""But something inside Stonehouse made him keep everything. ""Six years ago, members of his family discovered a box of his pictures and brought them to a British Legion road show in Bury St Edmunds to be evaluated. Eventually they were auctioned, and I recognized their rarity and purchased them."" Since then, Athill has become increasingly fascinated with Stonehouse, becoming acquainted with his surviving family and several of his friends (including 83-year-old Afdera Franchetti). Athill believes that the same qualities lay behind Stonehouse's aptitude as an artist and as a spy. ""He was a perennial outsider and an observer,"" he says. ""He was illegitimate and was brought up largely by his mother in France, and never became part of mainstream society. ""But despite these challenges, he had shown the inner strength to remain balanced in the face of adversity. He was incredibly handsome, charismatic and well-liked, and throughout his life, people noticed him -- from his commanding officer to the editor of Vogue. ""That is what must have caught the attention of British spy masters."" Behind the scenes at the legendary Studio 54 . Unseen photos of Astaire, Garbo, Churchill and others .

"In what many sports fans view as a historic move, the reigning NBA champion San Antonio Spurs announced the hiring of Becky Hammon as assistant coach. Terms of Hammon's contract were not disclosed. ""I very much look forward to the addition of Becky Hammon to our staff,"" Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich said. ""Having observed her working with our team this past season, I'm confident her basketball IQ, work ethic and interpersonal skills will be a great benefit to the Spurs."" At her introductory press conference Tuesday afternoon, Hammon called the opportunity humbling. ""I'm just incredibly grateful, obviously, to the Spurs organization and Coach Pop and (Spurs General Manager R.C. Buford),"" Hammon said. ""The whole staff really just from day one has been so great to me. I'm a little overwhelmed right now, to be perfectly honest."" Hammon, a six-time WNBA All-Star, announced July 23 she will retire as a player at the end of this season. She has played the last eight seasons with the San Antonio Stars. Hammon is not the first woman in NBA history on an NBA coaching staff. Lisa Boyer, while working for the WNBA's Cleveland Rockers as an assistant coach, also was on the Cleveland Cavaliers coaching staff under John Lucas in 2001-2002. Boyer is now the associate head coach for the South Carolina women's basketball team. Hammon alluded to the historical impact of her hiring, but she also tied in career fields other than basketball. ""There's women that have trail-blazed much bigger paths and really trail-blazed the path for things like this to happen,"" Hammon said. ""There's a lot more important things going on, in the bigger things, CEOs of companies. Women are really in every area. They're in the surgery rooms. They're doctors. They're lawyers. They're COOs. ""So even me sitting here today to be able to have the playing experience that I had as a professional basketball player, women went before me to pave that trail. So I'm really just reaping benefits of all their hard work and labor."" Popovich found out through San Antonio Stars head coach Dan Hughes that Hammon was interested in coaching. That led to Hammon spending time with Popovich and the rest of the Spurs team at practices, and a feature on ""NBA Inside Stuff."" ""She's right in the middle and she knows how to do it and her players really respond to her,"" Popovich said in the ""Inside Stuff"" feature. ""She's just a natural."" Spurs guard/forward Danny Green was complimentary as well. ""Everybody here respects her,"" Green said. ""She's a really good player and also a good person to have around. She understands the game."" In the feature, Popovich also said Hammon ""knows when to talk"" and ""when to shut up,"" saying that a lot of people don't figure that out. ""She talks the game, she understands the game,"" Popovich said. ""So for all those reasons you really know she's got that same sort of Avery Johnson, Steve Kerr, (Mike) Budenholzer type thing."" Hammon acknowledged she will be in high-pressure situations. ""I'm ready to be treated as just any other assistant coach,"" she said. Despite going undrafted in 1999, Hammon was named one of the WNBA's Top 15 Players of All Time in July 2011. She's seventh in league history in points with 5,809, fourth in assists (1,687) and sixth in games (445). Hammon has averaged 13.1 points per game in her career. Hammon, who grew up in Rapid City, South Dakota, spent her first eight WNBA seasons with the New York Liberty after signing as an undrafted free agent. On a draft-night deal in 2007, she was traded to San Antonio. Hammon also was a three-time All-American at Colorado State. Hammon, one of many women's players to also play professionally overseas during WNBA offseasons, became a naturalized Russian citizen in 2008. That same year, when she was the runner-up in the WNBA MVP voting, Hammon created a stir when she decided to suit up for the Russian National Team in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. She said  she was feeling overlooked by USA Basketball for a spot on the U.S. national team but still wanted to fulfill her dream of playing in the Olympics.

"The Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques to be released Tuesday concludes that the CIA tortured detainees and that torture did not yield actionable intelligence, Sen. Angus King said Tuesday. ""Did we torture people? Yes. Did it work? No,"" King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, said on CNN's ""New Day"". King, who is a member of the committee, called the extensive report ""chilling"" and said it will show the world that the U.S. is repudiating those practices used in the post-9/11 era under President George W. Bush's tenure. ""This is not America. This is not who we are,"" King said. ""What was done diminished our stature and enflamed [Islamist extremists], terrorists around the world."" The report is being released over cries from other lawmakers and intelligence officials who say the report could endanger American personnel abroad. RELATED: Hagel on torture report release: 'We want to be prepared' King acknowledged those risks and said the decision to release the report was ""not an easy"" one. But King said releasing the report is key to ensuring the U.S. government is never again involved in torture. ""It's important to take this step to say who we are and that we're not going to be doing this again,"" King said. President Barack Obama signed an executive order when he came into office in 2009 officially barring U.S. officials from using torture practices, such as waterboarding, that were called ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques under the Bush administration. King noted that that executive order could be reversed by a next President. ""History is important,"" King said.

"Yelena Isinbayeva, the golden girl of Russian sport, has sought to clarify her controversial comments about gay rights and her apparent criticism of fellow athletes for highlighting the issue at the world championships in Moscow. Isinbayeva reclaimed the women's pole vault title in front of her adoring public on Tuesday, then two days later defended her country's anti-gay propaganda law after receiving her medal. ""If we allow to promote and do all this stuff on the street, we are very afraid about our nation because we consider ourselves like normal, standard people,"" Isinbayeva said in English at a press conference. ""We just live boys with woman, women with boys. ""Everything must be fine. It comes from history. We never had any problems, these problems in Russia, and we don't want to have any in the future."" She criticized two Swedish athletes who defied the anti-gay law by sporting what could be seen as ""propaganda"" under the new regulations. High jumper Emma Green Tregaro and sprinter Mao Hjelmer wore rainbow-colored fingernails in their events in support of the gay rights movement. Green Tregaro posted a picture on her Instagram account captioned: ""Nails painted in rainbow sign #pride #moscow2013."" ""It's unrespectful to our country,"" Isinbayeva told reporters.  ""It's unrespectful to our citizens because we are Russians. ""Maybe we are different from European people and other people from different lands. We have our home and everyone has to respect (it). When we arrive to different countries, we try to follow their rules."" However, on Friday Isinbayeva released a statement via athletics' ruling body claiming that she had been ""misunderstood."" ""English is not my first language and I think I may have been misunderstood when I spoke yesterday,"" said the 31-year-old, who is an ambassador for the International Olympic Committee and will be mayor of the athletes' village at the Winter Games in the Russian city of Sochi next year. CNN iReport: What it's like to be gay in Russia . ""What I wanted to say was that people should respect the laws of other countries particularly when they are guests. ""But let me make it clear I respect the views of my fellow athletes and let me state in the strongest terms that I am opposed to any discrimination against gay people on the grounds of their sexuality (which is against the Olympic charter)."" Russia's recently implemented law, which bars ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors,"" has led to calls to boycott the Winter Olympics in Sochi. Russia hosts another massive sporting event in 2018, soccer's World Cup. U.S. President Barack Obama spoke about the issue last week, saying that ""nobody's more offended than me"" by the anti-gay legislation ""you've been seeing in Russia,"" and some bars around the world have also stopped serving Russian vodka in protest of Russia's stance. U.S. runner Nick Symmonds was quoted in the New York Times criticizing Isinbayeva's comments. ""It blows my mind that such a young, well-traveled, well-educated woman would be so behind the times,"" said Symmonds, who spoke out against the law after winning a silver medal in Tuesday's 800 meters event. He told the BBC Thursday that he had wanted to compete wearing a rainbow sticker, but was afraid of being arrested. In his blog for Runner's World prior to the world championships, Symmonds said he disagreed ""with the laws that Russia has put in place."" Thrilling finish . On the track, Trinidad and Tobago's Jehue Gordon edged American Michael Tinsley in Thursday's 400-meter hurdle final in a finish reminiscent of the women's 400m three days earlier. In the latter race, Britain's Christine Ohuruogu chased down Botswana's Amantle Montsho and won by four-thousandth of a second. Gordon's margin of victory was a little greater but not by much -- 47.69 seconds compared to 49.70. Felix Sanchez, the 36-year-old from the Dominican Republic who was seeking his third title, came fifth. Kenya's Ezekiel Kemboi claimed his third consecutive world title in the 3,000-meter steeplechase -- adding to his two Olympic gold medals -- with a time of eight minutes, 6.01 seconds. Had there been 10 more meters, he might have been caught by younger countryman Conseslus Kipruto but Kipruto had to settle for the silver.","NEW: Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva issues statement trying to clarify controversial comments .

"Santa wasn't the only one racing against the clock to get packages to homes Tuesday night. UPS was too. But the company's backlog left some Americans with gifts missing from under the Christmas tree Wednesday morning. ""We're terribly sorry,"" spokeswoman Natalie Black told CNN. In a statement, the company explained that ""the volume of air packages in our system exceeded the capacity of our network immediately preceding Christmas so some shipments were delayed."" ""We know how hard it is for everyone to receive their holiday packages, and we're working around the clock to resolve this issue,"" Black said. Behind the scenes, perhaps -- but UPS stuck to its plan to make no deliveries on Christmas, angering some customers. ""Thanks for totally screwing us AND lying about it all day,"" Mo Husseini posted on Twitter. He was responding to a UPS tweet in which the company vowed ""every effort to get packages to their destination."" On the company's Facebook page, Melissa Gilbreath wrote that she ordered her sons' gifts on December 9, but the packages have sat in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 18.  ""I realize it is not about the gifts but that is part of Christmas,"" she wrote. But the Facebook page is also filled with messages from people who say they are UPS employees and proud of their work and the company. ""We all work really hard and I think people have too high of expectations,"" Misty Fulton wrote. ""There will be an afternoon sort today,"" Black told CNN on Wednesday.  ""Workers will be processing packages so that tomorrow, bright and early, our drivers can clear out the remaining excess air volume. We expect that air volume to be delivered between tomorrow and Friday."" The company considered Christmas Day deliveries as an emergency measure, but ""after much thought and consideration"" decided not to ask drivers to work on the holiday. ""They've pulled in extra hours. We did a lot of Sunday deliveries, which we normally don't do. It wasn't a decision that we came to lightly."" Asked why the company underestimated the volume of air packages it would receive, Black noted that previous severe weather in the Dallas area had already created a backlog. Then came ""excess holiday volume"" during a compressed time frame, since the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas was shorter than usual this year. Add to that the consumer trend of doing more shopping online, she said. ""All of this culminated to become the perfect storm, so to speak."" Amazon responds . Online retailers are damaged by UPS' mistake. These sites told customers their purchases would arrive in time for Christmas. Some customers received messages from Amazon.com alerting them of the ""failure in the UPS transportation network."" In the message, the company offered to refund shipping charges and provide gift cards. Amazon representatives could not be reached for comment immediately. ""We have a relationship with Amazon. We will definitely work with all of our retailers,"" Black said.  ""We're going to make good on our service commitments. What that exactly entails I don't know, but we'll work with them to maintain that relationship."" After January 2, the day the industry processes returns, the company will examine what happened and gauge its contingency planning and losses, she said. Weather has caused delays in previous years. Technical glitches have as well, but Black said it's been ""quite some time"" since that happened. Medicine didn't arrive . The backlog isn't just affecting Christmas presents, of course. The Warren family of Heath, Texas, had to go a few days without special medicine their 14-year-old son needs in order to eat. ""It was just sitting"" at a UPS outlet in Mesquite, where the family finally picked it up, Patrick Warren told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""People are really upset in there.

"It's called Godwin's law.  The longer a debate rages, the greater the likelihood that someone will compare someone else to Hitler. And Hillary Clinton has done just that: On Tuesday the former secretary of state reportedly told a private fund-raising party that Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions are similar to Hitler's in the run up to World War II. Her quote (according to the Long Beach Press-Telegram): ""All the Germans that were ... the ethnic Germans, the Germans by ancestry who were in places like Czechoslovakia and Romania and other places, Hitler kept saying they're not being treated right. I must go and protect my people, and that's what's gotten everybody so nervous."" Of course, what also gets everybody ""so nervous"" is leading statesmen comparing Putin to Hitler and, thereby, raising the specter of another world war. It's unlikely that Clinton intended to gain politically from these remarks -- and they were carefully qualified. She added that ""there is no indication that Putin is as irrational"" as the German dictator was. But they could indicate that if she wins the 2016 election, America might gain a slightly more forceful president in foreign affairs, someone more willing to engage directly in Europe than Obama has. You may recall that in the 2008 primaries she was the Democrats' hawk candidate -- so much so that Ann Coulter preferred her to John McCain (Coulter called her ""our girl""). But was Clinton right? Mostly no. It is true that Putin's justification for intervention in Ukraine is similar to Hitler's, that is, threatening to invade a sovereign territory to defend his ethnic brethren. But the situation is complex, and the historical comparison is tenuous at best. Opinion: Has Putin broken international law? After all, in the eyes of many ethnic Russians, it is the Ukrainian nationalists -- not Putin -- who are the Nazis. The Russians have asserted, quite accurately, that the revolution that overthrew a pro-Russian, democratically elected leader has resulted in the elevation of Russophobe fascists into key government positions. For example, the new secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council is Andriy Parubiy -- co-founder of the Neo-Nazi Social-National Party of Ukraine (SNPU). Another creator of the SNPU is Oleh Tyahnybok, a high-profile leader of the Kiev protests who has blamed Ukraine's problems on a Jewish conspiracy run out of Moscow. Ukraine's new deputy secretary of national security is Dmytro Yarosh, leader of the Right Sector group, which regards Tyahnybok as a soft liberal and which flies the old flag of the Ukrainian Nazi collaborators at its rallies. In other words, in this situation, who exactly are the Nazis? Putin's ethnic Russian nationalists? Or the fringe of the ethnic Ukrainian nationalists? Neither is particularly pleasant. Of course, the Ukrainian Nazi movement is small, and Ukraine is dwarfed by Russia, which puts Putin in the role of the dominant regional power picking on a small country and exploiting its extremist politics for the purpose of propaganda. But Putin is still no Hitler, because he lacks the German Fuhrer's global vision. Opinion: Putin 2014 vs. Putin 2004 . Hitler worked by an all-encompassing racist ideology that dreamed of turning Europe into a giant living space for his people. Putin -- the leader of a democracy, albeit a highly corrupt and politically stagnant one -- simply meddles in the affairs of countries that could reasonably be said to fall within his country's historical sphere of influence. Ukraine was a part of the Soviet Union until two decades ago (whereas Crimea was part of Russia until 1954), the country contains millions of ethnic Russians and, crucially, it has Russian military installations that are key to Russia's strategic interests. In other words, a Russian invasion of Ukraine is not going to be a stepping stone to the invasion of France. Unfortunately, it may well be a stepping stone to involvement in the affairs of the Baltic states -- which are firmly in NATO and the EU.  This is why Putin's latest ambitions have to be checked. Nevertheless, calling Putin Hitler is careless. Even reckless. As Marc Tracy points out in the New Republic, it's historically insensitive and ignores the tapestry of cultural clashes and political calculations going on. It smacks, too, of the Manichean division of the world between good and evil that permeated the war on terror and led to so many terrible mistakes and so many American deaths overseas. Worse, still, is that such provocative language should be applied to a confrontation with a state like Russia. We are dealing with a major power with nuclear weapons that has the capacity to reduce the world to so much irradiated ash. The West needs to be careful with its words.","Timothy Stanley: Hillary Clinton compared Putin's Ukraine moves to Hitler's in 1930s .

"(CNN) -- No one should underestimate the historic importance of the North Korean cyberwar against America and the collapse of American defenses in the Sony Pictures attack. This was not some amusing pop culture event in which a few ""hackers"" played games with celebrities. This was not an entertaining series of embarrassing leaks that allowed us to learn how viciously and nastily some senior Hollywood bosses write about famous movie stars in internal emails. This was a deliberate assault on sovereign American soil against an American company, costing it millions of dollars in direct damages and hundreds of millions in reputational damages while blocking most of its employees from using their internal systems to get routine work done. This was a threatened physical assault against moviegoers and movie theaters nationwide if they ignored the cyberattack and dared to laugh at the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Some commentators criticized the movie theaters for their ""cowardice"" in not standing up to the threats. Others criticized the rest of the movie industry for not coming to the defense of Sony. Both critiques miss the core reality. Private companies can't fight sovereign nations. Private companies cannot be asked to risk the lives of their employees and their customers because of an unanswered foreign threat of violence. Defending America against foreign enemies is the duty of the United States government. To ""provide for the common defense"" is one of the reasons given in the preamble to the Constitution for forming a government. This attack on American interests began on November 24 when there was a massive hacking assault on Sony. After 24 days of government passivity and ineffectiveness, the theaters caved to the threat of terrorist attacks. Thus with more than three weeks to find and defeat the attackers, the American government proved to be impotent. This attack is pure cyberwarfare. There is a big difference between hacking for intellectual property theft and hacking to coerce a change in behavior. The former is a crime. The second is an act of war. The real danger is that this incident will become a precedent. Other countries and other terrorist groups will conclude that it is open season on American interests and even American lives. American companies will begin (in fact have already begun) self-censoring to avoid offending dictators and terrorists. The enemies of our freedoms will have won. We need three decisive steps to react to this defeat in a cyberwar. First, we have to go on the offense in this campaign and refuse to accept that the fight is over. North Korea must be made to pay an extraordinary price for this attack. One step might be to simply confiscate North Korean ships until the dictatorship pays triple damages to Sony and the theaters for the cost of its attack. What must not happen is for the American people to be told it is too hard or too dangerous to defend America against an out-of-control dictatorship. That could lead to anarchy and chaos, with every predator on the planet feeling they have the right to wage cyberwar against Americans. Second, we should develop an immediate response capability to defend American interests and crush cyberopponents immediately. The time to hit back hardest was November 24, the day the attack began. We need protocols to enable companies and the federal government to spot an assault, report it and respond to it in virtually real time. This will require the creation of a command center -- comparable to the air traffic control system in its speed of response -- for the government and private companies to cooperate on cyberattacks . Third, we must develop vastly better defensive and offensive capabilities. This will require considerable congressional involvement in thinking through the realities of the emerging permanent cyberdangers and the patterns of cyberwar. No one should kid themselves. We have now entered the age of cyberwar and we lost a major round in that war. The longer it takes us to confront this fact and take the necessary corrective actions, the greater our vulnerability to another defeat will be.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some private security guards hired to protect the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan say their contractor has allowed widespread mistreatment, sexual activity and intimidation within their ranks, according to the watchdog group Project On Government Oversight (POGO). A spokeswoman for watchdog group POGO said hazing at a camp for security guards went ""well beyond partying."" The group sent a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, and briefed reporters on its findings, which it said are based on e-mails and interviews with more than a dozen guards who have worked at the U.S. compound in Kabul. The company -- ArmorGroup, North America -- has a security contract with the State Department to provide services through July 2010, and has been cited several times for shortcomings in the security required by the contract. A U.S. Senate panel two months ago was critical of the State Department for not closely supervising ArmorGroup, after a series of warning letters from the State Department in the year leading up to the panel's inquiry. When CNN contacted Wackenhut, the corporate parent of ArmorGroup, a spokesperson there said the company would have a response Wednesday. The U.S. Embassy said Wednesday it was taking the allegations very seriously. ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of all Embassy personnel -- Americans and Afghan -- and respect for the cultural and religious values of all Afghans,"" it said in a statement. ""We have taken immediate steps to review all local guard force policies and procedures and have taken all possible measures to ensure our security is sound."" Should initiation rituals such as hazing be allowed? Sound off below . POGO says two weeks ago it began receiving whistleblower-style e-mails, some with graphic images and videos, that are said to document problems taking place at a non-military camp for the guards near the U.S. diplomatic compound in Kabul. ""This is well beyond partying,"" said Danielle Brian, POGO's executive director, after showing a video of a man with a bare backside, and another man apparently drinking a liquid that had been poured down the man's lower back. She told CNN that ranking supervisors were ""facilitating this kind of deviant hazing and humiliation, and requiring people to do things that made them feel really disgusted."" Watch claims that alleged hazing at the U.S. Embassy pose a threat to security » . ""This is not Abu Ghraib,"" she said, referring to images and videos of abuse by U.S. military troops against prisoners held at a facility in Iraq. ""We're not talking about torture,"" she continued, ""we are talking about humiliation,"" by supervisors causing a breakdown of morale, and a ""total breakdown in the chain-of-command."" In the letter POGO sent to Clinton, Brian wrote that the problems are ""posing a significant threat to the security of the Embassy and its personnel."" Among the recommendations from the group: immediate military supervision of the private security guards, a review of whether the contract should be revoked, and consideration as to whether government forces should replace private security in a combat zone.","Watchdog: Contractor providing security guards allowed ""deviant hazing, humiliation""

"(CNN) -- ""I do not believe we can keep doing the same thing for over five decades and expect a different result,"" President Barack Obama pronounced Wednesday. ""Moreover, it does not serve America's interests, or the Cuban people, to try to push Cuba toward collapse."" And with these words, Obama introduced a long-absent element of lucidity into U.S. policy approaches to Cuba. On the Cuban side, President RaÃºl Castro also welcomed the renewal of dialogue and committed his government to work with the United States to resolve ""profound differences"" on a host of issues. The implications of the action go far beyond Obama abandoning an utterly anomalous policy, one without internal logic, one that was both counterproductive and contradictory -- a policy in fact that contributed to the very conditions it professed to abhor. To speak to Cuba is to speak to Latin America. It is a powerful affirmation of a U.S. willingness to respect the propositions of national sovereignty and self-determination in a region of the world where centuries of colonialism have made the pursuit of national sovereignty and self-determination something of national obsession. It is an acknowledgment that history does matter, and that a shared awareness of that history cannot but result in salutary outcomes. The commitment to normalize diplomatic relations also signals the end of a policy that had as its overriding objective the overthrow of the Cuban government. The idea was to use economic sanctions to induce calamity, make daily life as difficult and as grim as possible, and increase Cuban suffering as a means to foment popular disaffection in the hope that Cuban people, driven by want and motivated by despair, would rise up against their government. This has served as the cornerstone of a half-century policy. ""The only foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship,"" a State Department official insisted in a memo in 1960, and thereupon proceeded to call for actions designed ""to bring about hunger, desperation and (the) overthrow of government."" The President's assertion that it is not in U.S. interests to push Cuba toward collapse is a remarkable policy reversal. But it is also true that to signal the end of a policy of ""regime change"" has far-reaching implications in Cuba. For much of the last 50 years, and especially since the collapse of the Soviet Union, U.S. policy has served as a means for the Cuban leadership to sustain moral authority. The United States has represented a looming threat to Cuban national sovereignty -- that is, Cuban national security. As Americans have learned in the last dozen years, the invocation of ""national security"" does not readily accommodate to the demands of civil liberties. A commitment to ease economic sanctions serves to counter the perception of the United States as a threat to Cuban sovereignty, thereby denying those in Cuba the pretext of U.S. hostility to limit public debate and restrict civil liberties. The change of policy represents a momentous occasion -- rare indeed in U.S.-Latin American relations -- where the Americans are signaling a desire to engage the Cubans on the basis of mutual respect, to engage Cubans in normal political and economic interactions, and thereby contribute to the creation of space in which Cubans themselves could proceed to address their most pressing issues, on their terms, within the logic of their own history, and act accordingly. It is a measure, in the end, of enlightened American self-interest. It shows respect for the Cuban people by acting on the premise that Cubans themselves know what is in their best interest.","Louis Perez: Obama normalizing relations with Cuba an overdue moment of U.S. lucidity .

"As many of the devastating stories and photos of typhoon-wrecked Philippines show, one of the most pressing problems of the Philippines crisis is the lack of toilets and the collapse of water systems. Tacloban is currently facing a desperate lack of sustainable sanitation. UNICEF, among other organizations, has delivered portable toilets and hygiene supplies to Tacloban and is appealing for $34 million to help the four million children affected by Typhoon Haiyan, the estimated amount for six months of assistance. The lack of sustainable sanitation that the Tacloban region is suddenly facing is part of daily life for an astonishingly high percentage of the world's population. To throw a spotlight on the issue, the United Nations General Assembly declared this year would kick off the inaugural World Toilet Day on November 19. ""We must break the taboos and make sanitation for all a global development priority,"" said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in an official statement in Singapore last July. Some sobering facts about the world's lack of toilets, according to the United Nations: .

""We aim to make these hugely important issues relevant and sexy,"" says Garvey Chui, the Asia representative for Toilet Hackers, a nonprofit organization trying to give access to ""dignified sanitation"" to those without. ""For many Westernized travelers -- particularly for many women travelers, no matter how well-seasoned -- sanitation and access to clean toilets becomes a serious consideration when traveling,"" says Chui. ""But for those without access to safe, clean and private toilets and sanitation, it is more than an inconvenience, it can be life or death,"" says the Toilet Hackers rep. ""One very dangerous time for a woman in a developing country, and one of the main times she may get sexually assaulted, is when she is going to the washroom. When there is no toilet to go to, she is vulnerable and exposed when she is going outdoors or in a public space, often late at night and away from people.""

"A federal law requiring that screening machines commonly found at schools, courthouses and other public facilities be able to detect all types of firearms will expire in less than a month. And that deadline is suddenly very relevant because of the availability of lethal 3-D printable guns that contain virtually no metal, law enforcement authorities say. Two proposed bills to extend the metal-detection requirement have almost no chance of passing, according to lawmakers. And authorities say that creates a public safety hazard from guns that are homemade from hard plastic materials on printers that cost between $1,000 and $500,000. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this week for the first time made public the tests it has done on a model of handgun called the Liberator, made using 3-D printer technology. Some performed well while others did not, the ATF tests showed. Texas company makes metal gun with 3-D printer . One gun made using a plastic called ABS-M30, commonly used in toys and luggage, fired a .380-caliber round without failing all eight times it was tested at an ATF lab in Martinsburg, West Virginia, ATF officials said. The firearm was made of molded opaque plastic, larger than a common handgun, and it contained one small metal firing pin similar to a roofing nail. The fired round traveled 8 to 11 inches into a piece of gelatin molded to simulate human soft tissue; by comparison a commercially available .380 pistol fired a round 18 inches in the same simulation. ""The Liberator is a lethal weapon,"" said Earl Griffith, chief of the ATF Firearms Technology Branch. The tested model included one with a removable metal block that complies with the expiring metal-detection law when the block is removed. A similar gun could be made with a ceramic firing pin to go undetected. UK police raise specter of 3-D printer-made guns . Another pistol made from a plastic called Visijet didn't perform as well in ATF tests. Video of the tests in June showed the gun exploding into a dozen plastic shards when fired. The Liberator guns were made from blueprints uploaded last year by a group led by a Texas law student, Cody Wilson. The group Defense Distributed says it exists ""to defend the civil liberty of popular access to arms as guaranteed by the United States Constitution and affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, through facilitating global access to, and the collaborative production of, information and knowledge related to the 3D printing of arms."" Wilson told CNN in an interview earlier this year:  ""The assumption is one day the technology will become more ubiquitous and widespread."" The files that can be used to make a 3-D printable gun have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times, ATF officials said. For decades, manufacturers have increased the use of plastic in lightweight guns, as in other products. Many popular models made with plastic parts still must use a certain amount of metal to abide by the detectability law. It's not clear if any commercial gun makers will abandon metal components once the law expires. The expiration comes amid a spate of mass shootings in the United States, though none of the recent shootings have involved firearms passed through metal detectors. Attorney General Eric Holder called on Congress to renew the law requiring guns be detectable by metal screening machines . ""This is an extremely serious problem. This is an extremely serious threat to law enforcement, to people who fly every day,"" Holder said in remarks in St. Louis on Thursday.  ""Think about this: there is the possibility that (if) this legislation is (not) renewed and it expires in early December ... plastic guns could not be detected by metal detectors (and) could be smuggled into a variety of places. And, it would seem to me that whatever people's feelings are about gun safety legislation, that this is something we could all agree needs to be reauthorized."" Holder added: ""I think that there are at least a few things that are so common sense and so logical that even those factions that are warring on other things can come together and decide that we can't have guns that are not detectable by metal detectors."" A handful of lawmakers are backing bills in the House and Senate to try to extend the detectable firearms law but there's no indication they'll get a vote in a Congress that is bitterly divided on many issues, including gun safety laws. Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said that when the law was first passed in 1988, ""a 3-D plastic gun was science fiction."" He said it's unfathomable that there's not enough support to extend the law. ""This is the absolute worst and most dangerous time to let this law expire,"" Israel said. 3-D gun raid in UK may have nabbed printer parts .","Expiring law could create public safety hazard, law enforcement officials said .

"Misty and Larry Shaffer have been together since high school. She went to his senior prom; he went to her junior and senior proms. They got married in October 2008. He never said anything about her being overweight. When Larry, an Army specialist, was deployed to Afghanistan for a year in 2012, Misty decided she wanted to get in shape. She weighed about 260 pounds when he left, and less than 155 pounds when he returned. ""I just sat in bed one night and was like, 'I can do this,'"" she said. ""'I need to do this.'"" Shaffer, now 25 and living in Leland, North Carolina, has struggled with her weight her whole life, even as a child. Each time she had tried dieting in the past, she would relapse. Before she became pregnant with her daughter, Nevaeh, she took diet pills and lost 60 pounds. But all that -- and more -- came back after she stopped taking the pills. At her heaviest, she weighed around 300 pounds. She's 5 feet 6 inches tall. ""I would eat when I was bored. I'd eat three huge meals a day, and then snack in between. Sad or happy, I'd turn to food for everything."" Shaffer felt tired all the time. People picked on her. She wanted to surprise her husband, and work toward a better life for herself and her family. Her primary mission: Cut out all the junk. She stopped drinking soda, and tried to limit her liquids to water and coffee. upwave: Try it now! No fast food for a week . The first three to four months were the hardest, she said. Once she got past that, she started craving more healthy foods and water. It got to the point where, if she drank a diet soda, it made her so thirsty that she didn't even want it. Shaffer's job presented its own challenges; she's a personal shopper at a supermarket. At lunch time, the hot fried chicken ""just smells so good,"" she said. But the supermarket also offers a large, well-kept salad bar, as well as warm vegetables on the hot bar and oven-baked chicken. A typical breakfast for Shaffer is oatmeal with fruit or a cereal bar. On her days off, she'll cook up sausage, eggs or pancakes, but she'll watch her portion size. Around 10 a.m. she has a snack, such as fruit or carrots. Lunch is a salad or half a sandwich with some kind of vegetable or fruit. An afternoon snack might be yogurt. For dinner, she eats a lean meat (like ground turkey or a boneless, skinless chicken breast), a vegetable and a very small portion of starch. The big day, Larry Shaffer's return, was May 15, 2013. The soldier had never seen his wife weigh less than 220 pounds, even in high school. When she saw him at the airport, Misty Shaffer didn't know what to say or do. She just ran and jumped into his arms. Her husband was speechless, uttering only one word: ""Wow."" It was the first time he had ever picked her up. Before, he hadn't been able to lift her off the ground even a little, she said. That moment was worth everything. ""A lot of people look at it like, 'Why is that such a big deal?'"" she said. ""But (when) you never thought you'd see that moment, that somebody can pick you up ... it is a big deal."" The other big part of the surprise: She had bought a new house while he was away. Since then, Shaffer has been able to keep the weight off. When her husband left she was a size 22 to 24; now she can wear a women's size 6. She's especially loving how much money she saves on smaller clothes. Khakis, for example, used to cost $80, but she found a pair for her new physique for only $7. She said her husband's eating habits haven't changed much; he likes her cooking, but he'll help himself to ice cream or cake afterward. Sometimes she will join him. But she's not too tempted to go back to her old ways of eating. ""I've seen how hard I worked, and what I had to go through to get to this point,"" she said. She's still in disbelief when her husband picks her up.","Misty Shaffer's husband was deployed to Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Ketsana, downgraded from a typhoon to a tropical depression, set its sights on a fourth nation Wednesday -- barreling toward Laos after leaving a trail of destruction and death across southeast Asia. A man tries to get into his flooded house in Hoi An in the central Vietnamese province of Quang Nam. By Wednesday morning, the death toll from the storm's rage had topped 325: at least 246 in the Philippines, 74 in Vietnam and nine in Cambodia. With heavy rains still lashing Vietnam, some major roads were closed and rivers and flood waters were rising. But the airport in the coastal city of Danang, which had been closed for three days, reopened Wednesday. Workers used chainsaws to clear toppled trees from roads so rescue crews could rush relief supplies to the worst-hit areas. Families waded through knee-deep water to salvage precious belongings from flooded houses. In Danang, an ill elderly woman was brought to safety on a make-shift raft made of banana tree trunks and leaves. She said eight other family members remained on the rooftop where they had found refuge. In addition to the 74 deaths, the Vietnamese government said 179 people were injured. The numbers, the government said, are expected to rise because officials have not been able to reach some isolated areas. Vietnam has not asked for aid but some international relief agencies were providing help, which the government accepted. In neighboring Cambodia, the storm knocked down 92 houses in Kampong Thom province, about 80 miles (130 km) north of the capital Phnom Penh. Along with the usual rice and blankets, the Cambodian Red Cross planned to donate $120 to each of the affected families so they can afford a traditional funeral for their loved ones. The nine deaths reported in Cambodia were all in Kampong Thom, with 40 others injured there, the Red Cross said. The worst-hit country, the Philippines, began the slow process of clearing up mud and debris Wednesday. Even as they did so, Filipinos kept their eyes peeled on another storm looming in the Pacific Ocean. In the city of Pasig -- part of metropolitan Manila -- enterprising residents used inflatable mattresses as makeshift boats to ferry people through flooded streets. The government, which some people said did not act quickly enough, opened up part of the presidential palace for aid distribution. Ketsana left at least 246 people dead as it passed over the Philippines. Another 38 people were still missing, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said. The storm affected nearly 2 million people and forced the evacuation of 567,000. At one point, 80 percent of the capital Manila was under water after experiencing the heaviest rainfall in 40 years. As the death toll rose, so did the collective grief. ""I did not know what happened,"" said Gingerly Comprendio. ""We were on top of a roof. We got separated. The next day when I came back to our house, I saw my eldest already dead and my aunt saw my other child buried in the mud."" Ray Lee, a prominent judge, single-handedly saved 32 people using his jet ski. ""There were cries for help, so I returned to other houses or roofs and retrieved all the people there,"" he said. To help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe, several nations have rallied to the Philippines' side. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the United Nations was considering an emergency appeal for aid as several U.N. agencies pledged support. The World Food Program said it will provide rations to 180,000 people. CNN's Arwa Damon in Danang, Vietnam, and Dan Rivers in Manila, the Philippines, and journalist Asha Phillips in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, contributed to this report.","Death toll now over 325 following destructive path of  Ketsana .

"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito has granted a stay of execution for a Missouri death row inmate whose rare birth defect, his lawyers argued, would have made his death an ""excruciating"" process. The stay is in place pending further action by the 8th Circuit Court, which will hold a hearing on the matter. Russell Bucklew had been scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. CT Wednesday at Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri. It would have been the first execution since Oklahoma botched a procedure last month. Bucklew, who turned 46 last week, is already in pain, as his condition includes unstable tumors in his head and neck, causing him to bleed regularly from his mouth, nose, eyes and ears, said defense attorney Cheryl Pilate. Dr. Joel Zivot of Emory University filed an affidavit in the case saying that Bucklew's airway is so ""severely compromised and obstructed,"" especially when he's lying flat, that it could easily be ruptured, raising the risk that Bucklew could choke or suffocate. ""If you touch it, it bleeds,"" Zivot wrote of Bucklew's airway. In 1997, a jury convicted Bucklew of first-degree murder, kidnapping and first-degree burglary and recommended the death sentence, court documents show. He was accused of fatally shooting his ex-girlfriend's presumed new boyfriend, Michael Sanders, and firing at Sanders' son, 6, before kidnapping Stephanie Ray Pruitt. After raping his ex-girlfriend, he became involved in a gunfight with authorities, during which Bucklew and a Missouri state trooper were injured, according to court documents. Controversy over lethal injections has been brewing in recent years after European manufacturers, including the Denmark-based manufacturer of pentobarbital, banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions. In 2009, the U.S.-based manufacturer of sodium thiopental, a drug also commonly used in executions, stopped making the painkiller. Many states have scrambled to find substitutes from overseas or have used American-based compounding pharmacies to create substitutes. Attorneys for death row inmates in several states have flooded the court system, arguing that correctional facilities' secrecy over where and how they obtain drugs is unconstitutional and violates the Eighth Amendment's ""cruel and unusual"" punishment clause. Last month, Oklahoma used a new three-drug injection protocol to execute convicted murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett, but his vein collapsed, and he died of an apparent heart attack. A full investigation and autopsy results are still pending, but witnesses said they saw Lockett struggling to speak as he convulsed and writhed on the gurney. Previously, Oklahoma inmate Michael Lee Wilson said during his January execution, ""I feel my whole body burning."" Wilson was executed using a cocktail that included pentobarbital, as was Texas' Jose Luis Villegas, who also complained of a burning sensation during his April execution. Also in Texas, Robert James Campbell's attorneys challenged the state's plan to administer pentobarbital to their client. A federal court stayed his execution last week, not because of the drugs Texas planned to use but because his defense team deserved more time to make the case that Campbell was intellectually disabled. On Monday, the Georgia Supreme Court weighed in on the issue, reversing a stay of execution for inmate Warren Lee Hill after his attorneys argued last year that a statute keeping the compounders of lethal injection drugs ""a confidential state secret"" was unconstitutional. ""We hold that it is not,"" Justice P. Harris Hines wrote in the 33-page majority opinion. He said the reason for keeping such information private is ""obvious, including avoiding the risk of harassment or some other form of retaliation from persons related to the prisoners or from others in the community who might disapprove of the execution as well as simply offering those willing to participate whatever comfort or peace of mind that anonymity might offer.""

"European lawmakers took their push for answers on U.S. surveillance programs to the White House on Wednesday, meeting with Deputy National Security Adviser Lisa Monaco and other National Security Council staffers. This is ""an extremely important issue of trust between the European Union and the United States,"" said Claude Moraes, head of the nine-member European Union delegation tasked with investigating disclosures of American spying on European leaders and citizens. ""We want to get to the truth of these allegations"" and rebuild a relationship of trust, he added. Members of the European Parliament's civil liberties committee have been in Washington since Monday, and have also held discussions with officials from the State Department, Congress and intelligence agencies. Germany sent a separate delegation to the White House after revelations the U.S. government monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. The news sparked an indignant response from the European powerhouse, a key U.S. ally. Merkel pronounced German confidence in the United States ""shaken."" Moraes dismissed a defense offered by a number of U.S. officials -- namely, that all countries spy on each other. ""This old chestnut of 'spying has always happened' just can't stand,"" he said. ""Spying has always existed, but friend-on-friend spying is not something that is easily tolerable."" But another member of the delegation, Britain's Timothy Kirkhope, acknowledged that the United States and EU member states need to strike ""a difficult balance"" between security and privacy concerns. ""I have trust in the United States and its democracy,"" Kirkhope told reporters.  ""It's not for me to tell you or anyone in the United States what to do."" Opinion: Germany's Stasi past looms over NSA spying furor . Revelations of U.S. spying involving allied leaders and citizens have sparked calls for the United States to roll back its surveillance programs and triggered threats of repercussions. On Wednesday, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said authorities there have demanded an explanation from the United States about surveillance activities. In Spain, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the nation's intelligence chief will brief lawmakers about what Spain knows about U.S. activities in a closed-door session in Madrid. Last week, the European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the end to a treaty with the United States allowing for the exchange of some banking data meant to help track terrorist financing. Without providing details, the European Union delegation described its talks as an opportunity to explore ""possible legal remedies for EU citizens"" affected by U.S. surveillance. The meeting between the Germans and the White House follows an agreement between Merkel and President Barack Obama to ""intensify further the cooperation between U.S. and German intelligence services,"" NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. Top senator: Obama didn't know of U.S. spying on Germany's leader . Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence leaders began to publicly push back Tuesday against the European complaints. National Security Agency chief Gen. Keith Alexander denied Tuesday that the United States had collected telephone and e-mail records directly from European citizens, calling reports based on leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden ""completely false."" Testifying Tuesday alongside Alexander before the House Intelligence Committee, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told lawmakers that covert spying among nations was a ""fundamental given."" Despite such defenses, the White House is reviewing U.S. intelligence gathering operations. ""We need to look at and make sure that we are not just gathering intelligence because we can, but we're gathering it because we need it,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday, echoing similar comments earlier by Obama in an interview with Fusion TV. The review should be completed by the end of the year, Carney said.

"Fifty-seven. That's the number of goals Landon Donovan has scored for the U.S. national soccer team. It's 19 more than the total goals racked up by the No. 2 all-time scorer, World Cup captain Clint Dempsey. It's also one fewer than Donovan's career assist tally, 58, which is 36 more setups than Hall of Fame midfielder Cobi Jones had  in his lengthy career. The only major benchmarks where Donovan isn't tops are shutouts, a statistic designated for goalkeepers and defenders, and caps, or game appearances, a stat in which Jones leads Donovan 164-156. It's simple math, which is why, to fans casual and ardent, coach Jurgen Klinsmann's decision to leave the orchestrator of 115 goals off the 23-player World Cup roster doesn't add up. The sports world expressed outrage at Thursday's announcement -- and not your typical ho-hum soccer outrage (they flop! it's too low-scoring!), but real, palpable baseball- or football-esque outrage. Americans, many of them thoughtfully, questioned a personnel decision, like they might question the Philadelphia Eagles not re-signing Mike Vick. But this is soccer, and American soccer at that. So if Klinsmann is honest in saying that his goal is to raise soccer's profile in the United States, snubbing Donovan seems to have done the trick. Now come the questions, the doubts, the Monday-morning goalkeepers. While some speculated whether Donovan's age (32) or perceived lack of heart -- he said in 2012 he wasn't sure if he wanted to go to Brazil and last year went on sabbatical during an arduous World Cup qualifying campaign -- others simply denounced the decision. Bruce Arena, who coaches Donovan for Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy and also skippered the 2002 and 2006 World Cup squads, told the San Jose Mercury-News, ""If there are 23 better players than Landon, then we have a chance to win the World Cup."" Meanwhile, soccer guru and Sports Illustrated writer Grant Wahl flatly stated, ""Cutting Landon Donovan will prove to be a mistake."" Not everyone was so diplomatic, as some folks resorted to calling the move shortsighted or the machination of a madman. Of course, there were a few anti-German epithets hurled at Klinsmann on Twitter as well (never mind that he's a 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year who coached an unheralded German squad to a third-place 2006 World Cup finish). More angry barbs were pointed squarely at the youngsters named to the squad -- in particular, Julian Green, 18, DeAndre Yedlin, 20, and John Brooks, 21, whose combined caps total a whopping six. Fans also decried the selection of Brad Davis, a 32-year-old MLS player who, while wicked with set pieces, at just 14 caps doesn't own a resume nearly as shimmering as Donovan's. Klinsmann defended his squad -- and Green, Yedlin and Brooks -- in a Friday press conference, saying, ""They might surprise some people."" As for Donovan, Klinsmann said other players were ""a tiny little bit ahead of him,"" and though he didn't want to go into details, he alluded to Donovan not having the speed and ankle-breaking one-on-one skills he once possessed. Donovan recently acknowledged himself that he struggles to find the motivation to train at 100%. Still, Klinsmann said at the press conference, Donovan's a ""great passer"" with lots of experience. Donovan accepted the decision maturely, saying he was disappointed. ""Regardless, I will be cheering on my friends and teammates this summer, and I remain committed to helping grow soccer in the U.S. in the years to come,"" he wrote on Facebook. He has promised to field questions about his omission from the team Saturday at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, where his Galaxy play. If he never took the field again for the United States, Donovan will have left an indelible mark on the team and its history. Forget all the goals, assists or the hat tricks against Scotland, Ecuador and Cuba (he actually hung four on Cuba). There are reasons Donovan has earned a sort of cult fame among U.S. soccer's fan base, and notoriety among America's casual fans. He's one of the primary reasons fans of archrival Mexico shudder when they hear the chant ""dos a cero"" (two to zero). The most glorious dos a cero for American fans came when Donovan buried the second goal in the 2002 World Cup round of 16. He scored four goals to lead the men's national team to a 2007 Gold Cup trophy and netted the winner against Honduras to earn the United States a ticket to the 2010 World Cup. He donned sunglasses that someone threw at him during a quarterfinal match in the 2013 Gold Cup quarterfinal, of which he was the inarguable star, and he's the reason Mexican fans chanted ""Osama! Osama!"" after he urinated, yup, on the consecrated pitch of Guadalajara's Jalisco Stadium in 2003. And then there was the 2010 World Cup game against Algeria. With only injury time left, the score 0-0 and the United States' hopes of advancing looking dim if not dead, the U.S. team launched a lightning counterstrike. Goalkeeper Tim Howard hit Donovan in stride. Donovan pushed the ball out to striker Jozy Altidore on the wing, who drove into Algeria's penalty area and attempted to set up Clint Dempsey. Dempsey's shot caromed off Algeria's goalkeeper into the path of Donovan, who buried it for a 1-0 win. From Boston to Barstow, America's soccer faithful went nuts. How nuts? This nuts. That's history, however. Donovan would be the first to say he's not the No. 10 of old. He has yet to score in seven games for his club this year, and his performances for the national team have been such that Klinsmann pulled him out of a World Cup qualifier against Jamaica last year and benched him during an April friendly against Mexico. But for all the talk about Donovan's future and questions over whether the curtains have closed on a distinguished international career, Klinsmann told the Donovan-minded reporters at Friday's press conference that much could happen between now and June 16, when the USA takes on Ghana. Should, heaven forbid, any of Team America's eight midfielders or four forwards suffer an injury in the run-up to the Cup, the coach said, Donovan could be right back in the fold. And all this ranting and raving could be for nothing.","Landon Donovan has 57 goals and 58 assists in international career, both U.S. records .

"DMX may realize by now that South Carolina police know who he is and that he does not have a driver's license. The rapper -- real name Earl Simmons -- spent three hours in jail Monday night before posting bond on charges of driving with a suspended license, having no car tag or insurance, according to the Spartanburg County Detention Center website. A police officer who was familiar with Simmons and his several recent arrests stopped him for questioning as he drove up to the front of the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport Monday evening, airport spokeswoman Rosylin Weston told CNN affiliate WSPA. The officer arrested him when he could not produce a valid license, she said. It was his third run-in with the law in his home state in recent months, which included a citation for marijuana possession in Greer, South Carolina, in August.  He was arrested then when an officer recognized Simmons and knew there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest for failure to appear in court for a previous charge, according to the arrest report. Simmons allegedly ""became very aggressive with his words and was making multiple idle threats"" when the officer questioned him about ""a bag of green plant material I knew to be marijuana"" near where he was sitting in a pickup truck, the report said. He was also arrested in Greenville, South Carolina, on July 26 on charges of driving under the influence, driving without a license and driving without a seat belt, police said.

Simmons also ran into trouble while in prison, being placed on ""lockdown status"" and forced to eat only bread and water for ""jailhouse infractions."" In February 2009, he threw a food tray in anger at a corrections officer, according to the sheriff's office. In 2010 he was sent to prison after violating his probation. Four days later DMX was admitted to the Flamenco Mental Health unit for an undisclosed disorder. But before the litany of arrests, DMX had a promising music and movie career. He had a huge hit with ""Party Up (Up in Here)"" more than a decade ago, and he also appeared in such movies as ""Romeo Must Die."" A DMX publicist said the recent arrest will not derail his efforts to revive his career.

"The Arctic winter may be long and dark but one light still shines bright in the land of the midnight sun -- Iceland's booming tourist trade. Foreign visitors increased by 15.9% last year whilst travel now accounts for 5.9% of GDP, according to the Icelandic tourist board. Given the financial catastrophe confronting the country as recently as 2008 -- when the IMF stepped in with a $2.1 billion loan after several major Icelandic banks collapsed -- this turbo-charged development is all the more remarkable. ""We've had this extraordinary growth in tourism in the last few years,"" Iceland's president, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, told CNN's Richard Quest. ""Because [in] the tourism structure of Iceland we have many small and medium-sized companies in the north, the east and the west, the economic benefits spread through the economy and all over the country in a way that no other sector actually does."" Watch video: Richard Quest's presidential tour of Iceland . Iceland's economy is predicted to grow by 2.7% this year and unemployment will fall to 5.7%, according to Statistics Iceland -- thanks in part to the expansion of tourism. For President Grimsson, this is just the start of a back-to-basics economic approach that will focus less on risky financial services and more on industries such as clean energy tech, fishing and, of course, travel. Official figures show that Iceland currently attracts 600,000 visitors a year, but by 2020 Grimsson says he hopes this figure will be nearer two million, almost seven times the country's population. Key to meeting these ambitious targets is the successful promotion of Iceland's pristine natural beauty -- its rural hinterland is famed for its spectacular volcanoes and natural hot springs -- as well as its potential as a business and aviation hub. According to Oli Bjorn Hauksson, CEO of Keflavik, the country's only international airport, Iceland's geographic location makes it the perfect pit stop for long-distance flights. ""We are in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean between Europe and the North America, which is the best place for a hub ... airport to be,"" he says. That gives tourists traveling between the outer reaches of the two continents the option of breaking up their journey. See also: Discover Iceland's fire and ice . So far, the tactics aimed at enticing travelers to Iceland appear to be working. Iceland's tourist trade was even able to safely negotiate the ash-cloud chaos caused by the erupting Eyjafjallajokull volcano in mid-2010. Close to 100,000 flights were cancelled and millions of passengers were left stranded in what was the biggest disruption to air travel since World War II. ""We were worried, if the handsome growth we had been experiencing year-on-year would be halted,"" says, Steingrimur J. Sigfusson, Iceland's tourism minister. ""But fortunately that did not happen."" He added: ""For the good or worse, the eruption proved to both Europe and America that Iceland is not so far away. At least we were close enough to cause all this trouble for the aviation industry."" Despite an initial dip in visitor numbers, Iceland returned to double digit travel growth by late 2010. Such resilience so soon after the financial crisis provides Sigfusson with a bullish outlook for the future. ""If things go on for a number of years, in addition with growth of 10 to 15%, tourism will be Iceland's industry number one, in terms of foreign currency earnings,"" he says. See also: Eat like a viking in Iceland . President Grimsson however cautions that such rapid development will require precise planning to ensure Iceland can cope. Some in Iceland already fear that the country is becoming overrun with tourists, but Grimsson is confident Iceland can cope. ""This is a country the size of England -- a big part of it is volcanic desert, glaciers, rivers, lakes -- so  if we decide to do it we can control the traffic in such a way that we allow people to enjoy the beauty of the country without being overcrowded,"" he says. He adds: ""When this decade comes to an end we might have two million tourists coming to Iceland every year, and we have to plan for that. ""That is a debate I have encouraged the nation to engage in over the next few years.""","Iceland has experienced rapid growth in its tourism sector since its economy collapsed in 2008 .

"Kurdish Peshmerga forces say they've recaptured territory near Sinjar Mountain in northern Iraq, where dramatic airdrops were made last summer to the Yazidis, one of Iraq's smallest minorities. The Kurdish military says it has ""cleansed"" the area of ISIS fighters with the help of coalition airstrikes. The operation represents the single biggest and most successful military offensive against ISIS, said the Kurdistan Region Security Council in a news release. Last summer, the siege of Sinjar forced the Yazidis, one of Iraq's smallest minorities, to flee the ISIS advance. They found refuge in the surrounding mountains but were trapped without food, water or medical care in the heat before coalition forces airdropped supplies and rescued some of them. Thousands of Yazidis fled on foot to Syria. Only a few hundred are left on Sinjar Mountain. The plight of the Yazidis, coupled with the ISIS assault against Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region, prompted the United States to begin targeted airstrikes in Iraq last August. More airstrikes against ISIS . Coalition aircraft conducted 48 airstrikes near Sinjar on Tuesday night, the heaviest concentrations of airstrikes to date, according to two US defense officials. The U.S. military says it has conducted 1,300 airstrikes to slow down ISIS. In November,  airstrikes killed two top-level and one mid-level ISIS leader, including Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's deputy and the emir of Mosul, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. The most recent airstrikes were aimed at supporting Peshmerga fighters efforts to open a land corridor from Sinjar north to Dahuk in northern Iraq, officials said. ""We have opened a corridor from south of Zummar to the Mountain Sinjar,"" said Masrour Barzani, chancellor of the Kurdistan Region Security Council, on Thursday. The corridor enabled the Peshmerga to gain direct access to displaced people trapped on Mount Sinjar and to provide humanitarian support, he said. ISIS fighters fled toward the Syrian border and ISIS strongholds such as Mosul and Tal 'Afar, the Kurdistan Region Security Council news release said. ""ISIS is always making damage, killed the people, steal the stuff, kidnapping people, taking money from people. That's what ISIS is doing, and that's not Islam,"" said Peshmerga fighter Khalid Suleymen Kolaoh, who was on the front line. ""We're not seeing the broad offensive movement we saw in May and June,""  Gen. James Terry, commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday. He said the military is seeing signs that ISIS is having a hard time communicating with its fighters and resupplying them.  There's also social media traffic out of Mosul that shows an ""inability of their self-declared caliphate to govern population centers,"" Terry said. An array of names for the group . During the Pentagon briefing, Terry referred to ISIS as ""Daesh"" for the first time. It's the Arabic term for the terror group. ""Our partners -- at least the ones that I work with, ask us to use that because they feel that if you use 'ISIL,' you will legitimize a self-declared caliphate, and they feel pretty strongly that we should not be doing that,"" Terry said. ISIS, ISIL or the Islamic State? Several names have been associated with the same group this year. CNN and some other news organizations have primarily maintained the use of ISIS (for Islamic State in Iraq and Syria). The U.S. government has been using ISIL (for Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant). Earlier this year, the group declared it was calling itself simply the ""Islamic State."" Mass grave found . A mass grave with 230 bodies was discovered in Syria's al-Keshkeyyi Desert near Deir Ezzor  across the border from Iraq, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. They were members of the al-Shaitaat people and were killed by ISIS militants, the observatory said. ISIS had fought for control of Deir Ezzor five months ago and many fled to the surrounding countryside, said Omar Abu Leila, a spokesman for the Free Syrian Army's Eastern Front who is from Deir Ezzor. He said ISIS told people they could return to their homes if they put down their weapons and followed the group's orders. Those who came back without weapons, and no ability to fight, thought that maybe their family members were arrested, but they found a mass grave instead. ""It is obviously a warning to the returning residents,"" Omar said. The bodies were decomposing, and one father told Omar, ""I can't even tell which is my son.""

"Challenges continue to mount for Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. Public criticism persists as she prepares to testify on Wednesday before a Congressional committee heatedly demanding answers about ongoing problems with the Obama administration's health care enrollment website. Public ridicule reached prime-time -- or late-night -- when Saturday Night Live parodied Sebelius and the HealthCare.gov debacle that has rocked the online rollout of President Barack Obama's signature domestic policy achievement. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, called her a ""laughingstock"" on ABC's ""This Week"" and said ""she's lost considerable credibility."" And then another Obamacare federal website outage occurred over the weekend. It resulted from efforts to fix a technical problem. But Sebelius appears secure for now, despite political uproar, a public relations debacle and a ""punch list"" of tangible problems that have hampered the Obamacare website. That's because Obama has her back. The President has resisted calls from Republican opponents to show Sebalius the door. He has ""full confidence"" in Sebelius, White House spokesman Jay Carney said this month. That's all Sebelius needs at the moment, and she knows it, especially with her appearance before the House Energy and Commerce Committee looming. Sebelius told CNN last week that ""the majority of people calling for me to resign, I would say, are people who I don't work for and who do not want this program to work in the first place."" For the time being, Obama has few choices other than to stick with the woman responsible for implementing the initiative to get millions of uninsured Americans health insurance. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: 5 surprises from Sebelius interview . Scapegoat Sebelius . While Sebelius is constantly being hammered for the faulty rollout, the President escapes a good deal of the blame. Sebelius even protected the President by saying in the interview with CNN that he didn't know about potential problems with the website until a couple of days after its launch on October 1. Eric Dezenhall, crisis management expert and CEO of Dezenhall Resources, said the president is getting a free ride. ""She is going to absorb a tremendous amount of lightning,"" he said, adding that is part of the plan. ""The general rules is the President announces good news and the departments announce bad news and get the blame,"" said Dezenhall, who worked in President Ronald Reagan's administration. Rep. Darrell Issa of California has aggressively investigated the Obama administration as chairman of the Republican-led House Oversight Committee. And he is putting the blame over snafus with the Affordable Care Act online rollout squarely at the feet of Sebelius. ""The President has been poorly served in the implementation of his own signature legislation,"" Issa said on CBS' ""Meet the Press."" Confirmation concessions . One reason Sebelius is likely to keep her job for now is that a permanent replacement requires Senate confirmation, finding someone else ostensibly to serve out his term would subject Obama to a damaging political fight with conservative Republicans determined to get rid of the health care law. The hidden truth behind early Obamacare numbers: It's not what it seems . Moreover, CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein said an Obama ally would not ultimately be confirmed, regardless of who was appointed. There would be ""virtual certainty"" of a Republican filibuster as ""an opportunity to use this as kind of a way to leverage more concessions from the administration,"" Brownstein, editorial director of National Journal, said Monday on CNN's ""New Day."" Additionally, a confirmation hearing and debate in the Senate over a nominee would create another opportunity for Republicans to re-litigate Obamacare. It's a commonly used tactic in Washington. Republicans held up two nominees to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau because they opposed the new agency designed to protect consumers and didn't want to see it running because they felt it put unfair burdens on business. The president could avoid a confirmation fight by appointing an interim replacement, but there are political and practical risks with that as well. Firing her won't fix it . In fact, it could make the situation worse. Bringing in someone on a temporary basis to oversee the largest implementation of a government program since Medicare in 1965 could confuse the process. Dr. Mark McClellan, former administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, oversaw the bumpy roll out of the Medicare's expansive Part D program. He said firing her ""by itself wouldn't do anything."" Sebelius is the public face of Obamacare. McClellan said she needs to ""make sure there's an effective strategy to address the problem"" as well answer questions for the public and Congress. Obama has brought in additional help, including Jeffrey Zients, who is a noted management consultant, former White House budget official and the forthcoming director of the National Economic Council. The appointment has been praised by some of the most critical Republicans. ""He's got a lot of managerial experience. He's been a consultant for the health care industry. I think he's got the right qualifications,"" Rep. Jeff Fleming, R-Louisiana, said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Sebelius' Obamacare damage control fuels critics' fire . Obamacare hasn't failed yet . While the online rollout has been a disaster, the actual program hasn't failed. People have until March 31 to sign up to obtain health coverage for 2014. ""If people become more comfortable with the program, the outrage will recede,"" Dezenhall said. ""It's going to take a while to get people acclimated to managing their health care this way. I think there's going to be a lot of bed side manner, hand holding, and direction giving and that's going to take a while,"" he added. Dezenhall cautioned, however, the scenario could change quickly and the administration should be assessing the situation constantly. For instance, the program needs to enroll millions of the young and the healthy to keep costs down and enable the program to work. ""This is day by day,"" he said. ""If the problems continue and they may, he may have to change his tone.""","Despite the tangible problems and the public relations nightmare, Sebelius appears secure in her job .
Sebelius is President Barack Obama's scapegoat for Obamacare website disaster .
Confirmation hearings to replace her would be damaging politically for the President .
Replacing Sebelius won't necessarily fix the problems either ."
"Oscar Pistorius, the onetime Olympic athlete turned murder suspect, must undergo a month of psychiatric testing before his trial can continue, the judge in the case ruled Wednesday. The move puts his trial on ice indefinitely. It was triggered by the testimony of a psychiatrist who testified that the sprinter has suffered from generalized anxiety disorder since he was an infant, stemming partly from the amputation of both of his lower legs because of a genetic defect. Pistorius is accused of murdering his girlfriend, the model Reeva Steenkamp, in his home last year. Pistorius, 27, does not claim he was insane or mentally incapacitated when he shot her, but when the defense put the psychiatrist on the stand, it raised the question of the athlete's mental health, the judge said Wednesday. ""A doubt has been created"" that Pistorius may have a psychiatric issue that would affect the court's verdict, so she must order the testing, Judge Thokozile Masipa said Wednesday. ""The accused may not have raised the issue that he was not criminally responsible at the time of the incident in so many words, but evidence raised on his behalf cannot be ignored,"" she said of testimony by Dr. Merryll Vorster. She acknowledged that her order would mean a long delay in the trial, but said that was not the most important consideration. ""This is not about anyone's convenience, but about whether justice has been served,"" she said. ""The aim of the referral is not to punish the accused twice,"" Masipa said, saying that Pistorius should be examined as an outpatient rather than committed to an institution if possible. Expert report . Court will reconvene on Tuesday for her to issue her order formally, she said. At that point, Pistorius will learn when and where he will be tested. The prosecutor had argued in favor of psychological evaluation, while the defense argued against it. The testing will be done by a panel of experts who will then submit a mental health report to the court, CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps said. At one extreme, they could find that Pistorius was mentally incapacitated at the time he killed Steenkamp, which would end the trial immediately in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness, she said. But it would also mean Pistorius needs to be committed to a mental health institution against his will until he is found not to be a danger, she said. Another option is that they could find he had ""diminished responsibility"" at the time he killed Steenkamp. In that case, the trial would continue and his mental health would be taken into consideration during sentencing if he is found guilty, said Phelps, a criminologist and law lecturer at the University of Cape Town. The third possibility is that the experts could disagree with the defense psychiatrist and say that Pistorius' mental health is not an issue at all. If that happens, Vorster's testimony will be disregarded, Phelps said. The experts might not all agree with each other, and lawyers on either side could disagree with the experts' report, leading to any number of possible outcomes. If there is any dispute, the final decision about what to do with the experts' report lies with Judge Masipa. Mistake or murder? Pistorius  admits shooting Steenkamp but says he thought there was an intruder in his house. He has pleaded not guilty. The athlete's defense team is trying to show that Pistorius made a genuine mistake and responded reasonably on the night he shot Steenkamp, 29, a model and law school graduate. If the trial continues after the psychiatric evaluation, Judge Masipa must decide whether Pistorius genuinely made a mistake or whether he murdered Steenkamp intentionally. If she does not believe the athlete thought there was an intruder, she will find him guilty of murder and sentence him to at least 15 years in prison, and possibly life. South Africa does not have the death penalty. If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. A verdict of culpable homicide would leave the sentence at Masipa's discretion. The prosecution rejects the sprinter's defense that he mistakenly thought he was defending himself and his girlfriend from an intruder. The state contends that Pistorius argued with Steenkamp before killing her. The defense team is seeking to cast doubt on the state's case and needs to show only that there is a reasonable doubt that Pistorius meant to kill Steenkamp. There is no dispute that Pistorius fired four bullets through a door at Steenkamp in his home early on the morning of Valentine's Day 2013. Three hit her, causing devastating wounds. The final shot struck her head and probably killed her almost instantly, a pathologist testified in March. The trial has seen Pistorius break down repeatedly, crying, wailing and sometimes throwing up as the court sees and hears evidence about Steenkamp's death. Vorster said the athlete's physical distress was real. Live blog: Pistorius on trial . Oscar Pistorius trial enters new phase after blistering cross-examination .

Crop Over events range from historic remembrances such as the Ceremonial Delivery of the Last Canes, where plantation-era traditions are on display, to Foreday Morning, in which participants slather each other in mud, paint and powder, to Grand Kadooment, in which revelers wine the day away in scanty costumes of feathers and beads, grooving to soca music.

"(CNN) -- Rescue workers in Kansas searched for people Thursday among the wreckage left by tornadoes that ripped through the Midwest on Wednesday night. Two people were killed as tornadoes swept across Kansas, destroying 60 homes and damaging another 60, officials reportedly said. A man was killed outside Soldier, about 50 miles north of Topeka, said Sharon Watson, a spokeswoman for the state emergency management agency. His body was found outside his mobile home, she said. A woman was killed in Chapman, Kansas. Her body was found in a yard, Watson said. In the wake of the late-night destruction, authorities sifted through rubble on the ground and used infrared technology in the air to locate survivors or bodies. ""It's so difficult to account for everyone in these types of situations,"" Watson said. ""It can take some time, unfortunately, for the search-and-rescue process, especially when you're talking about a significant area that has been hit."" Gov. Kathleen Sebelius visited Chapman on Thursday morning to survey the damage. She said two schools, three churches and several homes were destroyed and many buildings sustained heavy damage. Sebelius said that at least three other people were hospitalized for serious injuries.  Watch rescue workers sift through the damage » . ""There's a good deal of the town still intact, with trees upright and houses in pretty good shape, so it's slightly different than our experience last year with Greensburg, where the entire community was really wiped out,"" she said. ""That's the upside."" In May 2007, a massive tornado nearly two miles wide destroyed 95 percent of the buildings in Greensburg, Kansas, killing 11 people and injuring dozens more. She said residents in the areas hardest hit by Wednesday's storms had about 20 minutes of advance notice, which was ample time for people in a state that takes tornado warnings seriously. ""There's a sense of devastation on one hand,"" Sebelius said. ""On the other hand, the notion that they can replace basically everything they've lost as long as everybody they love is OK."" The storm also destroyed several buildings at Kansas State University, including a wind erosion lab, and tore the roof off a fraternity house at the school in Manhattan, Kansas, said Cheryl May, the university's director of media relations.

"Beijing (CNN) -- A historic drought in southern China has caused billions of dollars in losses to agriculture and left millions of people and animals short of drinking water, government officials said Tuesday. And with no significant rain forecast for the next 10 days, there's no relief in sight, according to the National Meteorological Center. The impact of the drought, which began in June, is being felt across four provinces, affecting more than 44 million people, Ministry of Civil Affairs said.  The direct economic loss is estimated at RMB 28.6 billion, or US $4.5 billion. In Guizhou province, it's the worst drought in 60 years, affecting 21.5 million people, the ministry said.  More than 7 million people and 3 million cattle are short of drinking water. The drought has damaged 1.8 million hectares (4.4 million acres) of farmland, according to the ministry. The Chinese government is ramping up aid for farmers impacted by the drought, the Ministry of Agriculture said.  The Ministry of Finance will distribute relief funds.

"The end of the 50-year freeze in diplomatic relations with Cuba will mean many more U.S. travelers could be on their way to the neighbor island, only 90 miles from Key West, Florida. But the days of Havana as a glamorous destination for U.S. tourists — as it was before the Cuban revolution ended legal U.S. travel there — aren't returning quite yet. And while American visitors who do make it to Cuba will be able to return with rum and cigars, exporting them for sale in the United States still isn't in the works. Historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba standoff . Americans already travel to Cuba in large numbers — nearly 100,000 per year, according to Cuban government statistics. The numbers rose after Obama's 2009 easing on some of the restrictions on travel to Cuba, including making it easier for Americans to visit family members there, and a subsequent 2011 announcement allowing for certain types of other trips. Now Obama is easing up restrictions for other kinds of visitors. Administration officials listed a host traveler types the federal government will now allow to visit: government officials, journalists, professional researchers, educators, religious officials, performers planning public presentations, humanitarians, emissaries of private foundations, and importers or exporters. Officials say all legitimate applications received by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control — the body that dispenses licenses to for Cuban travel — will be approved. When they visit, Americans will be able to use their credit or debit cards on the island, a convenience previously banned. Agencies inside the United States will be permitted to organize trips. And American telecom equipment will now be allowed into Cuba, making communication with Americans easier. But the day when Americans can log online to book a vacation in Cuba hasn't yet arrived. U.S. officials say the ban on tourism in Cuba is still in place; the overall ban on travel to Cuba can't disappear without congressional changes to the law. ""The ban has to be lifted by Congress,"" a senior administration official said. ""But the President is doing everything that he can with his authority to facilitate travel within the limitations of the law, and we believe that that will lead to a significant increase in travel."" Americans have long found ways around the travel ban to Cuba. U.S. citizens have been known to get around travel restrictions by stopping first in a country with flights to the island. Cuban customs officials are familiar enough with the practice to not stamp American passports when they cross their desks. 9 questions you were embarrassed to ask about Cuban embargo . U.S. visitors will now be able to return to the U.S. with Cuban cigars, coveted for their quality.

But with the latest crack in the long-standing travel ban, American travel companies were optimistic a new vacation market could soon be open to tourists. ""We look forward to the day — hopefully soon — when all Americans have the opportunity to travel to Cuba,"" said Barney Harford, the CEO of travel booking website Orbitz.

"Editor's Note: Peter J. Wallison is the Arthur F. Burns Fellow in Financial Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. He was General Counsel of the Treasury and White House Counsel in the Reagan administration, and is the co-author of two books on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A Republican and supporter of John McCain, he occasionally serves as a volunteer surrogate for the campaign. Peter Wallison says Congress blocked reform that could have headed off the costly bailout. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In announcing the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson noted that the ""flawed business model"" of these companies was in part responsible for their failure. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are called government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) because they have government charters and perform a government mission: providing liquidity to the mortgage market and assisting in the financing of affordable housing. The flaw in their business model is that they are owned by private shareholders but backed by the government. As a result, lenders do not care about the risks the companies are taking because they know that the government will eventually step in to protect them against losses on their loans. That meant Fannie and Freddie were able to borrow funds in the capital markets at very low rates and in essentially unlimited amounts. This allowed them to grow in both size and profitability over the last 20 years, doubling every five years. Now we see the consequences -- the Treasury has been compelled to step in with a rescue plan that has been estimated at the outset to require what Paulson estimated could be about $200 billion of taxpayer money. Concerns about the flawed business models of Fannie and Freddie are nothing new. Many people, including such experts as Alan Greenspan, have been arguing for years that Fannie and Freddie should be reined in, that they were creating huge risks for the taxpayers, and that eventually these turkeys would come home to lay their eggs. iReport.com: Are foreclosures driving down your neighborhood's value? These warnings began in earnest near the end of the Clinton administration, especially by Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers, and were carried forward by the Bush administration, which supported legislation that would provide stronger regulation for Fannie and Freddie. But these warnings were ignored in Congress. Although there were efforts by a number of Republicans in the House and Senate to adopt tougher regulatory legislation -- beginning in 1999 -- these efforts were resisted by Democrats, primarily Sen. Charles Schumer of New York and Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, who is currently the chairman of the Senate committee with jurisdiction over the GSEs. To their credit, when the problems of Fannie and Freddie finally became too obvious to ignore, the Democrats in the House and Senate voted for stronger regulation of the two companies and to give the Secretary of the Treasury broad authority to bail them out. But by then it was far too late to save the taxpayers. In the current election season, the American people should want to know why it is that they as taxpayers will now be compelled to bail out these companies. John McCain was one of the Republicans who supported GSE reform, but he and the others faced an insurmountable defensive phalanx in Congress -- the result of a strong lobbying and political support program engineered and operated over many years by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The fact that the Republicans controlled Congress during much of this period shows the validity of McCain's comment in his convention acceptance speech that ""We were elected to change Washington, and we let Washington change us."" Among other things, Fannie and Freddie orchestrated substantial contributions to the campaign funds of their congressional supporters. They hired some former congressional staff members as lobbyists and engaged lobbying firms that had strong relationships with members of Congress, including lobbyists who are active in both of this year's presidential campaigns . They got people who were homebuilders, Realtors and members of the securities industry -- all groups that profited from Fannie and Freddie's activities -- to hold fundraising events for key members of Congress of both parties; they staged ribbon-cuttings and other events in the congressional districts of their supporters in order to provide them with favorable publicity; they established charitable arms that contributed to community groups who in turn supported them when some in Congress sought tougher regulation. This is a prominent example of Washington's culture of corruption. The government put its credit behind the two companies; this enabled them to grow and dominate the housing finance market; they used their resulting financial and political power to gain and retain the support of key members of Congress; and the process continued until they collapsed -- at which time the taxpayers have to clean things up. This could all have been prevented if Congress had acted years ago to eliminate the GSE business model. There are three possible models -- privatization, nationalization or liquidation. Congress and the president can decide which it will be, but the worst idea is to reconstitute them as GSEs. Unfortunately, that seems to be the choice Treasury Secretary Paulson made in the plan he announced Sunday. In that plan, a conservator will be appointed for Fannie and Freddie, and they will be nursed back to financial health with injections of taxpayer funds by the Treasury. A conservator has only the power to stabilize the companies. A better idea would have been to appoint a receiver, who could have wound down the companies over time and prepared them for one of the three possible future models. Instead, the failed business model is likely to be kept in place because of its support in Congress. It is thus no surprise that Sen. Schumer was quoted as follows right after the Paulson plan was announced: ""This plan will be met with broad acceptance in Congress because it doesn't prejudge the ultimate fate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.'' We know what that means. The American people sense that something is seriously wrong in Washington. The Fannie and Freddie debacle shows how right they are. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.","Peter Wallison: Mortgage giants are government-backed, private companies .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of firefighters fought to control several dangerous blazes in Arizona, fighting to make progress even as expanded evacuations and power outages signalled that the battle was far from over. The Monument fire -- which U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell has deemed the nation's ""number one priority,"" putting it first in line for any air, ground or other resources -- jumped Highway 92 late Sunday afternoon at Carr Canyon heading east, according to the Cochise County website. ""We've had a hard day today, with things that we didn't want to happen,"" fire spokesman Bill Paxton told CNN on Sunday night. ""The bull came out of the pen."" Thanks to dry, windy conditions, the fire broke through four different contingency lines, including going over to the other side of the highway, said Paxton, part of the national Interagency Incident Management Team. ""Everything  aligned for a massive push,"" he said. ""It's really hard on the community here."" The county sheriff's office broadened the evacuation zone soon thereafter east to the San Pedro River, reports InciWeb, an online interagency database that tracks fires, floods and other disasters. On Sunday evening, that website noted that the fire had burned at least 20,956 acres and was 27% contained. More than 1,000 personnel -- as well as 100 engines and nine helicopters -- were battling that blaze, which had burned 44 homes and 18 other structures from its start June 12 through Sunday. The weather has hardly been cooperating in the fight, with humidity at 7% and temperatures topping 96 degrees. The National Weather Service forecast winds should weaken somewhat in the early part of this week, to between 7 and 13 mph in Sierra Vista, Arizona, though temperatures were still expected to remain in the 90s all week. ""The conditions that we're dealing with here are as bad as we can get,"" Tidwell said Saturday. ""It just can't get any worse."" People living in Sierra Vista were ordered to leave Sunday while firefighters conducted burn-out operations in an attempt to stop the fire moving that way, CNN's Thelma Gutierrez reported from the area. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has issued emergency declarations for the Monument fire and another blaze, Horseshoe II, making Cochise County eligible for $100,000 toward response and recovery expenses. This is just one of dozens of wildfires affecting the southwestern United States, where red flag warnings were in effect for most of Arizona, all of New Mexico, much of north Texas and portions of Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas and Utah for Sunday.  A red flag warning means weather conditions -- mainly high heat, low humidity and strong winds -- pose an extreme fire risk. ""The winds certainly will be very gusty and strong,"" said Ken Daniel, weather service meteorologist in Flagstaff, Arizona. ""Any new fire starts would have the potential to have explosive growth."" Nationwide, wildfires have burned almost as many acres in the first half of 2011 as were recorded by the National Interagency Fire Center for all of 2010. The agency reports on its website that 3.1 million acres in the United States had been ignited by wildfires as of May 31, compared to 3.2 million burned acres cited in the organization's year-end report in November 2010. One Arizona blaze that started May 29 has mushroomed into a historically large wildfire. Known as the Wallow fire, it has burned 511,118 acres and was 44% contained as of Sunday. This fire has caused power outages Sunday in Arizona cities Blue and parts of Alpine, Nutrioso and Greer, the Navopache Electric Cooperative reported on its website. Generators are powering some of the company's New Mexico customers, as well as those in Alpine, Arizona. Residents of Luna, New Mexico, were ordered to evacuate Saturday afternoon after the blaze jumped containment lines along U.S. 180, according to InciWeb. But fire public information officer Rich Szlauko had some good news, telling CNN that in terms of bringing the Wallow fire under control, ""everything is starting to look pretty good."" Some 3,600 people continue to battle the blaze, in the face of winds Sunday measuring 20-30 mph, he said. Tidwell said Saturday that he was ""very optimistic"" that damage from future wildfires could be minimized by thinning forests and clearing out biomass -- which did occur, to some extent, in parts of eastern Arizona. He noted that 3.2 million acres were ""treated"" nationwide last year. Sen. John Kyl, R-Arizona, noted Saturday that the estimated $64.1 million price for the Wallow fire would more than double after the costs of mitigation efforts to prevent mudslides from the summer monsoons. ""Just think that what we could have done using those funds to treat those forests in advance,"" Kyl said. But government budget strains have limited the amount of money going to such efforts. ""The only way we are going to get these (forests) thinned is through greater participation of private enterprise,"" Sen. John McCain said, adding that the government should try to facilitate such initiatives, including by allowing limited logging in national parks. ""There is simply not enough tax dollars to get the job done without them,"" the Arizona Republican said of private companies.

"The Chinese government has pledged to protect an eight-year-old boy with HIV, who was shunned by his entire village in the southwestern province of Sichuan, state media reported. A photo from a People Daily's online report last week showed the boy called ""Kunkun,"" watching villagers unanimously vote for his removal in a meeting held in early December. Even his own grandfather, added his name to the petition signed by more than 200 villagers. ""Kunkun is diagnosed with AIDS, causing great fear among the villagers and village children. In order to ensure the safety of villagers and children, we demand that authorities quarantine Kunkun for treatment,"" the petition read. In response, China's health authority promised to assure Kunkun with the right to medical treatment, education and a living allowance, reported China Daily. ""Everyday life with an infected person doesn't affect others' health, and the infected person's rights are protected by laws and regulations,"" said Wu Zunyou, director of the National Center for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention in a press release issued Saturday. The United Nations had also released a statement expressing concern over the reports on Kunkun. Villager: ""He's a ticking time bomb"" Kunkun -- a pseudonym used to protect his identity -- was expelled from school and ostracized by members of the community after he was diagnosed in 2011, said the People Daily's newspaper. ""He's a ticking time bomb. My daughter is around his age, and goes to a boarding school now. What happens if she gets bitten while playing with him here at home? That boy is too dangerous,"" says He Jialing, one of the villagers. The report said the boy contracted the disease from his mother before he was born. Kunkun, whose parents are migrant workers in Guangzhou, lives with his 69-year-old grandfather. With no school willing to take him in, he is often found roaming the streets alone. ""No one wants to play with me,"" the newspaper quoted Kunkun as saying. His grandfather told local media the boy's parents have stopped sending money back home since he was diagnosed. In response to the petition, local authorities have stressed that Kunkun's rights should be respected. They plan to launch an educational campaign hoping to reduce the stigma of people living with HIV/AIDS. China's AIDS fight . Some 780,000 people are living with HIV/AIDS in China, according to the latest count by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in 2011. People living with HIV or AIDS in China face widespread discrimination and stigma, especially in rural areas where there is a lack of education about the disease. China has sought to tackle the stigma by establishing laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination against people with HIV. China's First Lady Peng Liyuan who was appointed World Health Organization's goodwill ambassador for AIDS in 2011, has appeared in public advertisements holding hands and playing with HIV-positive children. Despite China's fight against AIDS, cases such as Kunkun's suggest inconsistency with official policy.

"Interstates and highways were shut down Monday night as a large winter weather system brought heavy snow, fierce winds and ice to at least five states in the West and Midwest. There were blizzard conditions in parts of western Kansas and southeast Colorado, with visibility of less than a quarter-mile, said Ariel Cohen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. A blizzard warning was in effect for those areas along with northeastern New Mexico, the northwest Texas panhandle and the Oklahoma panhandle, he said. The severe weather was starting to affect Missouri late Monday, with a winter weather advisory in effect for the northwest corner of the state. The New Mexico State Police shut down Interstate 40, a major east-west artery, from Albuquerque to the Texas state line, saying there was zero visibility due to blowing snow. Interstate 25 was shut down from just north of Albuquerque to the Colorado state line because of the blizzard conditions, which included snow-packed and icy roads. Are you there? Tell us about it. The state police also shut down U.S. and state highways in the northeast corner of the state. Texas authorities closed I-40 westbound in the Texas panhandle at New Mexico's request. The Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Department of Transportation said motel rooms had already filled in Tucumcari, New Mexico, the first major town on I-40 across the state line, because drivers weren't allowed to travel any farther on the highway. Cohen called it a strong storm system that is producing ""very hazardous"" conditions. While such storms typically occur during the winter months, he said, the large area of strong winds combined with the snow is unusual. Texas Gov. Rick Perry activated the Texas Military Forces as a precautionary measure to provide any needed assistance on the roads, his office said. Snow accumulations of up to 6 inches were likely, with higher accumulations expected across the northwest Texas Panhandle, Perry's office said. Vehicle crashes were being reported around Amarillo, which lies along I-40 on the Panhandle, said Trooper Gabe Medrano of the Texas Department of Public Safety. He said it was already snowing heavily Monday evening and was getting worse. ""We have whiteout conditions for the north of Amarillo at this point,"" he said, adding the roads will probably freeze over once the snow stops. ""It's going to make for pretty bad conditions."" Flights were canceled by mid-afternoon at the Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport, which meant morning departures were scrubbed, spokesman Patrick Rhodes said. But ""nothing much"" has happened at the airport, he said, and he expected operations to be back to normal by mid-morning Tuesday. To the north, in the Oklahoma Panhandle, U.S. highways were closed and transportation workers were salting the roads, according to Michaelann Ootean of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. Roads and highways were ""completely snow-packed"" or covered with ice in much of western Kansas, according to the state's Department of Transportation. They included I-70, which crosses the state from west to east, and I-135 through Salina. Two U.S. highways, 50 and 54, were shut in southwest Kansas. The DOT said U.S. 50 was closed because of blizzard conditions and ""multiple accidents"" in Colorado. The Colorado Department of Transportation shut down highways across the southeastern part of the state because of snow and icy conditions. I-25 was shut southbound from Pueblo to the New Mexico state line, and the DOT said lodging was unavailable south of Colorado City. Northbound I-25 remained open.","Roads are closed in Oklahoma and Kansas .

"(CNN) -- Seventy-five Australian soldiers killed in the World War I battle of Fromelles have been identified, the first of about 250 whose remains were discovered at the site in France more than a year ago. The 75 soldiers were identified by name, Australian defense officials said Wednesday. A further 128 bodies were identified as being Australian. ""The number of soldiers that we have been able to identify exceeds even our most optimistic forecasts,"" said Greg Combet, Australia's minister for defense personnel, materiel and science. About 2,300 British and Australian troops were killed in the battle and thousands more were wounded, captured or left missing in action when they were ordered to charge into German machine guns July 19, 1916, in northern France. So many died that night that British and Australians could not recover all their dead. German soldiers buried hundreds of them in mass graves, which were rediscovered in 2008. The battle of Fromelles remains the most fatal 24-hour period in Australian military history, Australian defense officials have said. Combet said officials are unlikely to identify every soldier at Fromelles, though they will try. DNA was key to identifying the soldiers, but historical, anthropological, and artifact evidence was also used, he said. ""I am also pleased to say that we have strong reason to believe that more identification could occur in the future,"" he said. Excavations of the mass grave began in May 2009 and lasted until September. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission, which builds and maintains cemeteries for Commonwealth troops who died in the two world wars, built a cemetery near the site of the battle where the excavated troops are being reburied. The Pheasant Wood cemetery was the first full cemetery it had constructed in more than 50 years, the commission said. ""All but one of the soldiers have been reburied in individual graves in the purpose-built Fromelles (Pheasant Wood) Military Cemetery,"" said Alan Griffin, Australia's minister for veterans affairs. Those whose identities cannot be determined will be marked by a headstone reading ""Known unto God,"" the commission said. The final soldier will be buried at a special ceremony in July to mark the 94th anniversary of the battle, he said. ""The new cemetery is a fitting resting place for these brave men, who made the ultimate sacrifice,"" he added. The Australian Department of Defence released photographs of some of the 75 men whose remains were identified. They include Cpl. Herbert Thomas Bolt of Sydney, Australia, of the 55th Battalion, who peers out from the picture wearing a slouch hat, a wide-brimmed hat pinned up on one side that is a trademark of the Australian Army. Private Henry Alfred Cressy, from New South Wales, of the 54th Battalion, sits for a portrait while wearing his military uniform. Private Clifford Dawson Holliday, also from New South Wales and the 54th Battalion, smiles in his picture while wearing a peaked cap. The men's ages were not immediately known. About 800 people from Britain and Australia who think they may have a relative buried at Fromelles have donated DNA to try to identify the bodies, said Peter Jones, the DNA consultant on the project. But that's only half as many as the experts need, he said, since about 1,600 Commonwealth dead from the battle remain unaccounted for. The Ministry of Defence urged people who believe they have a relative at Fromelles to get in touch. The 250 bodies being buried at Pheasant Wood are among the 1,600. Personal items found with the bodies have also helped experts identify them. In addition to military decorations, uniforms, and buttons, the items include personal effects such as a locket with a lock of hair, and a return ticket to Perth, Australia -- left on the body of a soldier who never lived to use it. A full list of the soldiers identified and also their photos is available on the Australian Department of Defence Web site. CNN's Richard Greene contributed to this report.","Seventy-five Australian soldiers killed in World War I battle of Fromelles identified .

"Brisbane, Australia (CNN) -- Recovering from flooding in northeastern Australia will be a ""reconstruction task of post-war proportions,"" a top official in Queensland state said Sunday. ""We have massive infrastructure damage that will take months and in some cases years to fully repair,"" Queensland Premier Anna Bligh told reporters. ""We have homes and lives torn apart, in some cases ... by an event of the most traumatic proportions. So we cannot underestimate what is happening."" Police in the flood-ravaged state said Sunday that the death toll from flooding had climbed to 18, and they urged residents to knock on their neighbors' doors as waters recede. ""Many people don't have friends and family to check on them, so it's up to the whole community to do their part and look out for their neighbors,"" acting Inspector Gareth Bosley said, according to a statement on the Queensland Police website. Meanwhile, flood warnings were in place Sunday in Victoria state in southeastern Australia as authorities said heavy rains threatened homes there. Police said 14 people are missing in Queensland, many of them in the Toowoomba and Lockyer Valley areas. The missing include people who were swept from cars or were in houses that collapsed. ""Credible and reliable information provided to police indicates that these people were caught up in the storm surge that swept the valley, and police hold grave fears for their well-being,"" Queensland Police Service said in a statement. Among those who died were Llync-Chiann Clarke, 31, and her two children, ages 5 and 12, who were swept to their deaths as a rescue fire truck became inundated by floodwaters on a local road. Two other people escaped. Robert John Kelly, 30, was found dead in an upside-down vehicle in a creek, authorities said. The body of Jean Gurr, 88, who was trapped by rising water, was found in her residence. A teenager who was afraid of water drowned in the Queensland floods after begging rescuers to save his younger brother first. Jordan Rice, 13, and his mother Donna, 43, were swept away as a wall of water hit the town of Toowoomba last week. His family has hailed the youngster's selfless actions. ""Jordan can't swim and is terrified of water,"" his father, John Tyson, told local newspaper The Toowoomba Chronicle. ""But when the man went to rescue him, he said, 'save my brother first.'"" Officials warned the cleanup would take months. More than 20,000 homes were inundated after the normally subdued Brisbane River turned into a raging torrent as weeks of rain pushed it to more than 4 meters (13 feet) at high tide last week. Residents in Brisbane were urged not to enter floodwaters because of the risk of illness after sewage plants along the river were inundated.","NEW: The official death toll in Queensland stands at 18, police say .

"White House Economic Council Director Jeff Zients pointed fingers at Congress on Thursday for not acting fast enough on cybersecurity legislation, in the wake of news that North Korea was behind the Sony Entertainment cyberattack. ""We're doing what we can within the executive authorities of the President to do what we can across the federal government -- both protect the federal government assets and to work with the private sector -- but in order to take this to the next level we need legislation,"" he said at a Politico breakfast. The Sony hack attack has breathed new life into controversial legislation often called the ""zombie bill"" by opponents because of its failure to launch. The proposed cybersecurity bill is intended to help companies and the government work together to thwart hackers through increased data sharing. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said the November attack has increased urgency for the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, which failed to make it to the Senate floor in July, despite winning bipartisan committee support. Feinstein, who remains the committee's top Democrat when the new Republican majority takes control in January, plans to reintroduce the measure. ""We must pass an information sharing bill as quickly as possible next year,"" she said in a statement this week. Privacy advocates have opposed the legislation -- and it's House companion -- at every turn, since it was first introduced in 2012. They argue the bill's broad language could breach the public's privacy and civil liberties. ""Privacy advocates will be there to steadfastly oppose any privacy and invasive information sharing bills,"" said Mark Jaycox, a legislative analyst at Electronic Frontier Foundation. Every time there is a massive public security breach, the legislation gets a new lease on life, he said, but added there are already measures in place that foster information sharing between the private sector and the government. A recent executive order issued by President Barack Obama created a program that allows companies to voluntarily share information with the Department of Homeland Security. Once a threat is deemed critical, the information would be disseminated with member companies. But Jaycox admits the government hasn't done a good enough job at luring companies to join the network. Although the proposed cybersecurity bills are also voluntary for companies to participate, language has been written into the bill that shields businesses from ""frivolous lawsuits"" and ""unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles,"" according to Sen. Saxby Chambliss, of Georgia, the top-ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and co-author of the Senate measure. But privacy and civil liberties groups fear the expansive immunity for corporations will discourage companies from protecting their user's data.","The White House hopes to build support for cybersecurity legislation in the wake of the Sony hack .

"(CNN) -- A tsunami advisory has been issued in Japan after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Japan's main island of Honshu, the Japan Meteorological Agency said Wednesday. The quake was centered 169 kilometers (105 miles) off the east coast of Honshu, directly east of the city of Sendai, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The quake occurred about 8.8 miles below the earth's surface, the USGS said. The expected height of the tsunami was only expected to be 0.5 meters (19.6 inches). CNN correspondent Kyung Lah said she could feel the earthquake in Tokyo, 267 miles southwest of the quake's epicenter, and said the shaking lasted as long as three minutes, but that there was no significant damage. TV Asahi showed video of boats rocking back and forth, as well as images taken from shaken city cams as the earthquake hit. CNN's Kyung Lah in Tokyo contributed to this report.","Tsunami is only expected to reach 0.5 meters .

"In 2011, Sen. Rand Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he would favor a halt of U.S. foreign aid, including assistance to Israel. In August, at the height of the recent Gaza conflict, the Kentucky Republican made headlines for declaring he never proposed ending aid to the country. Democrats and other critics seized on his sharp change in tune and blasted the likely presidential contender for flip-flopping. The criticism kicked off a wave of close scrutiny of Paul's past statements. On Friday, Rand spoke with Blitzer again, saying he stands by what he told him in 2011. ""Interestingly, they keep playing our interview, Wolf. So we had a great interview. But the interesting thing of it is I actually still do agree with what I told you. Ultimately, I think a country that's $18 trillion in debt should not be borrowing money from China to send it to anyone,"" he said. What Rand Paul thinks is the 'biggest mistake' for GOP . He'd like to see an end to all foreign aid eventually, Paul said, reiterating a line he has used often. ""However, I think in the meantime ... I've tried to put restrictions on foreign aid and I've been unsuccessful. And so I've come to the conclusion that maybe we should start by eliminating foreign aid from countries that burn our flag and hate us. And I think that would be a good place to start,"" he said. Pressed on whether he would continue to aid Israel in the short term, Paul said, ""yes."" ""It's an eventual goal, is to eliminate all aid,"" he continued. ""But we have so many -- we have such a resistance in Congress to even attaching any restrictions that my goal since I've been in Congress and the bills I've introduced have been to place restrictions on countries that either hate us, burn our flag or persecute Christians or other religious minorities."" Rand Paul to CNN: 'I don't want to create panic' over Ebola . Paul has said repeatedly that he's considering a run for president in 2016 and plans to make his decision in the spring. Asked whether he thinks he's qualified for the job, Paul said the next president needs to be somebody with ""wisdom, somebody who thinks about issues, who isn't entirely beholden to partisanship...And we need somebody who ultimately, if they were in charge of our nuclear arsenal, would not be rash, reckless or eager for war."" ""And I think I do meet that criteria,"" he said.","Rand Paul tell CNN he would ultimately favor ending all foreign aid, including to Israel.
The Kentucky senator has faced criticism for saying he never made such a proposal."
"Five years ago Monday, the Supreme Court dealt a devastating blow to a hardworking woman from Queens, New York. Evelyn Coke, a single mother of five and immigrant from Jamaica, worked nearly every day for more than two decades in the homes of the elderly and the infirm, feeding, bathing, carrying them, administering their medications and tending to their needs. Coke loved her work but grew unhappy that she was paid less than minimum wage and never for overtime. She often worked three consecutive 24-hour shifts, or more than 70 hours a week.  After many years of quietly taking it, she stood up and brought her case to court. Her case went all the way to the nation's highest court.  On June 11, 2007, the Supreme Court unanimously decided that Coke -- and millions of home care workers like her -- are not protected by federal minimum wage and overtime laws, even if they're employed by for-profit home care agencies. Why? Because through a legislative loophole, federal regulations exempt so-called ""companions"" from the basic labor protections that most everyone else takes for granted. It's up to the Labor Department to change the rules, the court said. Coke passed away three years ago at age 74. Today, home care workers remain woefully underpaid. They're excluded from federal protections and covered by minimum wage or overtime laws in only 21 states. The average national wage of $9.40 per hour for this occupation means that one in five workers lives below the poverty line. In 34 states, the average hourly wages are low enough to qualify workers for public assistance. The efforts of Coke and those who have carried forward her cause haven't been all for naught, however. The Labor Department is finally revising the rules so that all home care workers will be covered by federal wage and hour laws. But it's not a done deal, and lobbying from industry groups concerned about their profits could cause the new rules to be shelved.  That would be a shame and an injustice to everything for which Coke fought. Today, low wages and long hours undermine home care work. Long hours can lead to worse care for patients as caregivers working 60- to 70-hour weeks face fatigue and stress in performing what is a hard job under any circumstances.  Studies have shown turnover rates among home care workers of between 44% and 65% per year, threatening continuity of care. The agency Coke sued claimed it would suffer ""tremendous and unsustainable losses"" if made to pay overtime.  But such claims are belied by the fact that home care employers have managed to stay in business and are profitable in the 21 states that already mandate minimum wage or overtime pay, with no reported decline in the amount or the quality of care provided. One of our nation's fastest-growing industries, home care work now employs roughly 2.5 million Americans and is expected to add another 1.3 million jobs by 2020 as demand for in-home care continues to rise.  By 2050, an estimated 27 million Americans will need direct home care. But unless working conditions improve, the industry will have a tough time recruiting new workers to replace its aging and often injured work force. More Americans are living longer than ever before. Home care workers enable our elders -- parents and grandparents -- to stay in their homes and live independent lives. If we don't change the industry, we'll soon face a crisis that touches us all. Coke didn't live long enough to see any reforms come to fruition. And the sad irony is that, after a lifetime of caring for others, when she needed care most as a result of kidney failure, she couldn't afford it. Today, the best way we can honor Evelyn Coke's legacy --- and help our nation's well-being -- is by following through on the promise of new rules that will finally extend minimum wage and overtime protections to home care workers.","Home care workers are not protected by federal minimum wage and overtime laws .

"Pope Francis has told a Spanish newspaper that he prefers not to use a bulletproof Popemobile despite the dangers of an assassination attempt because it is a glass ""sardine can"" that walls him off from people. ""It's true that anything could happen, but let's face it, at my age I don't have much to lose,"" he told Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia in an interview published Friday and reported on in English by Vatican Radio. ""I know that something could happen to me, but it's in the hands of God."" Since an assassination attempt on then-Pope John Paul II in 1981, the head of the Roman Catholic Church has customarily used the custom-made glass-sided Popemobile when in public. But Francis has taken his own approach to transport since assuming the papacy last year -- creating a headache for those tasked with ensuring his security. On a trip to Brazil, he climbed into a silver hatchback Fiat for the drive from the airport to downtown Rio de Janeiro. Along the route, the vehicle became pinned between a bus and a crush of well-wishers who were reaching into the car to touch the Pope. Security was stepped up after that incident. He's also used an open-topped vehicle, rather than the enclosed, bulletproof version preferred by Benedict, for tours through crowds of the faithful in St. Peter's Square. The Pope's recent trip to the Holy Land, during which he made stops in Jordan, the West Bank and Jerusalem, is likely to have posed additional significant security challenges. But he sees being able to speak with and meet people directly as a key part of his pastoral role as pontiff. Another Pope Emeritus? In the interview with La Vanguardia, Francis also did not rule out following in the footsteps of his predecessor in the role, Benedict XVI, who stood down from the papacy citing age and frailty. Francis described Benedict's retirement as a ""great gesture"" which opened the door to the creation of an institution of Pope Emeritus, as Benedict is now known, according to Vatican Radio. ""As we live longer, we get to an age at which we cannot carry on with things,"" Francis said. ""I will do the same as he did: ask the Lord enlighten me when the moment comes and tell me what I have to do, and he will tell me for sure."" He speaks too of his commitment to interfaith relations and his hopes for Middle East peace. Asked finally how he would like to be remembered in history, Francis said he hadn't thought about it, according to Vatican Radio. ""But,"" he said, ""I like it when you recall someone and say, 'he was a good guy, he did what he could, and he was not that bad.' With that, I would be content."" Historic attack . Would-be assassin Mehmet Ali Agca shot John Paul II in the abdomen, arm and hand, as he was driven through St Peter's Square, Rome on May 13, 1981. The then-Pope suffered life-threatening injuries in the attack, but recovered after undergoing major surgery; he later forgave Agca after meeting him in prison. Agca, who has never fully explained the reasons behind his attempt to kill John Paul II, was jailed for life; he was pardoned in 2000 after almost 20 years behind bars, and deported back to Turkey. The gun is currently on loan to the John Paul II Museum in his hometown, Wadowice. John Paul II was canonized, or made a saint, in April, along with Pope John XXIII.

"(CNN) -- In case you haven't noticed, President Obama has been flexing his executive muscles lately. On paper, it's a head-scratcher. After all, he lost control of the Senate in the last election. His popularity is hovering near an all-time low. And, of course, he's a lame duck. Only no one seems to have told him. It's as if he has shed his Clark Kent-ish demeanor for the more flamboyant cape. He's no Superman, to be sure, but he's spending an awful lot of time lately trying to get off the ground. So, after suffering a political shellacking, he's showing he still has some muscle, using executive authority everywhere he believes he can. President Bill Clinton famously declared his relevance, months after losing control of the House in 1994. Obama, on the other hand, is literally leaping into unilateral action: On immigration! On climate change! On regulating the Internet! On Cuba! ""I'm energized,"" said a buoyant President in his year-end press conference, Friday. ""I'm excited about the prospects for the next couple of years. And I'm certainly not going to be stopping for a minute..."" Translation: This is the new, all-drama Obama. And all of that pent-up energy, ambition and action, barely two months after losing control of the Senate. ""Anyone would become annoyed and frustrated if you were accused of being a wuss,"" says a senior Democratic policy adviser. ""And it's always better to be on offense than defense."" It wasn't exactly a state secret that Obama had a lot on his to-do list after the election. The thinking, according to a knowledgeable source: He felt constrained and frustrated by his tactical responsibilities to Democrats in trouble. Don't rock the boat. Don't make Democrats take hard votes. Don't even campaign in red states. So he didn't. And, as it turns out, the restraint helped not one whit. So now, with the clock ticking, he's moved from party cheerleader to the head of the executive branch. It's Katie-bar-the-door, with or without the Congress. At the press conference today, the President strongly hinted at a veto of the Keystone XL Pipeline--so take that Republicans and red-state Democrats. And he wants tax reform, too. 'Tis the season for a presidential list, and he's checking it twice -- as his legacy looms. Everything he is doing redefines the very notion of a lame duck. But here's what this flurry of activity also defines: the 2016 presidential race. In forcing the Cuba issue front and center, for instance, Republican presidential wannabes have to respond. So, too, on Obama's moves on immigration. All sorts of new tests of conservative loyalty are being created by these moves. And some candidates could find themselves pushed in a direction they might not otherwise go. For instance, parse the differences between Republican pre-presidential candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Rand Paul on Obama's Cuba deal. Rubio called the President the ""single worst negotiator we have had in the White House in my lifetime."" Bush did not like the deal, but stopped short of name-calling. ""I don't think we should be negotiating with a repressive regime,"" Bush said -- a long way from Rubio's accusation that the President was ""willfully ignorant"" and ""naÃ¯ve."" And Rand Paul went even further in Obama's direction, saying, ""Opening up Cuba is probably a good idea."" In appealing to the younger Cuban-American demographic, Obama is making the Republicans choose sides. And he's gambling that the numbers are with him. Eventually, Democrats will have to do the same. If Obama's audacity turns out to be misdirected, Hillary Clinton will have to explain -- and likely defend -- it. If he's not pro-active enough, the Elizabeth Warren wing of the party will react. It's a clichÃ© that presidential campaigns are generally defined by the president who served before. Barack Obama is actively making sure that's the case. But there's one caveat in this new, muscular, pro-active Obama-world: It just might lead to higher expectations. Which is exactly where Obama began -- and then faded.","Gloria Borger: Obama uses executive powers aggressively despite electoral losses .

"The economy has been front and center during this presidential race, followed by issues such as national security, abortion and taxes. But are the candidates talking enough about the Internet? Some big-time Web players don't think so and plan to launch a nationwide bus tour to see if they can change that. Start-up guru Alexis Ohanian, co-founder of social sharing site Reddit, is raising funds for the Internet 2012 Bus Tour. ""From taxes, to health care, to immigration -- Democrats and Republicans can't seem to agree on anything,"" reads the text on the project's IndieGoGo fund-raising campaign.

Ohanian, who also founded travel site Hipmunk and philanthropic geek-merchandise vendor Breadpig, was active in this year's fight to derail the Stop Online Piracy Act.  That bill and related legislation were designed to crack down on illegal sharing of copyrighted material, but critics attacked it as an overreaching assault on Web freedoms. Ohanian said that the success of Reddit, which was launched in 2005 with just $12,000 in funding, speaks to the importance of a free and open Internet to the economic growth both parties promise to deliver. The site was bought by Conde Nast in 2006 and, last month, had nearly 40 million unique visitors. ""We got to live the American dream by having this great startup success at a company that continues to grow,"" he said in an interview with CNN. ""There is really no other industry right now where you can say that. ""There are companies right now, starting up all over the country, who could be the next Google."" Tour leaders have drafted what they're calling the Internet Declaration of Freedom. It calls for promises to never censor the Web, promote international access to fast, affordable Web services and defend online privacy, among other things. And they're encouraging both major U.S. political parties to add Internet freedom to their official platforms. Ohanian said he's heard ""on pretty damn good authority"" that some sort of Web-freedom language will be proposed for the Republican platform. He hopes that will help spur Democrats, many of whom also opposed SOPA and similar bills, to do the same. ""I would love to hear it brought up during the debates,"" he said. ""I would love it to be the thing that Obama and Romney try to one-up each other on."" The bus (painted half-red and half-blue to give it a bipartisan vibe) will travel from Denver -- site of the first presidential debate October 3 -- to Danville, Kentucky, where the vice-presidential debate will be held eight days later. It will start with a kickoff event on October 1 in Denver. Along the roughly 1,000-mile journey, they plan to host meet-ups with supporters, promote local Web start-ups, support candidates friendly to their cause and register people to vote. Reddit is funding most of the cost of getting the tour from town to town, but the fund-raising campaign will cover expenses such as hosting local events, promotional material and documenting the journey. The campaign is shooting to raise $40,000. Unlike fellow fund-raising site Kickstarter though, IndieGoGo doesn't require that goal to be reached for the tour to receive all the contributions. It won't be the first time that folks from Reddit (current general manager Erik Martin is joining Ohanian) have sparred with presidential campaign players over Web freedom. The site targeted Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan last year for his perceived support of the Stop Online Piracy Act. Critics considered Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, to have been too vague in his stance on the legislation and objected to the $288,600 in campaign funds he had received from groups considered to be for it. Reddit users launched ""Operation Pull Ryan,"" publicizing the congressman's muted stance on the issue and throwing support behind his political opponent. Ryan eventually announced he would oppose the bill, calling the Internet ""one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history"" and saying ""it should stay that way."" ""A bunch of random people on the Internet made it an issue,"" Ohanian said. ""A bunch of citizens got him and his team to come out with a statement in opposition. That's impressive."" Reddit also joined Wikipedia and other sites that went black for a day in January to protest that legislation, which was eventually shelved without a vote.","Internet 2012 Bus Tour seeks to highlight Web-related issues this fall .

"The Obama administration was given stark warnings just one month before launch that the federal healthcare site was not ready to go live, according to a confidential report obtained by CNN. Read documents . The caution, from the main contractor CGI, warned of a number of open risks and issues for the HealthCare.gov web site even as company executives were testifying publicly that the project had achieved key milestones. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Medicaid Chief Marilyn Tavenner, whose job it was to oversee the October 1 rollout of the website, said she did not foresee its problems. ""No, we had tested the website and we were comfortable with its performance,"" she said. ""Now, like I said, we knew all along there would be as with any new website, some individual glitches we would have to work out. But, the volume issue and the creation of account issues was not anticipated and obviously took us by surprise. And did not show up in testing."" Tavenner: Sorry for problems, but system working . 5 things we learned from Tuesday's hearing . But the CGI document, which describes ""top risks currently open"" and ""outstanding issues currently being mitigated"" says the testing timeframes are ""not adequate to complete full functional, system, and integration testing activities"" and lists the impact of the problems as ""significant."" Another element is listed as "" not enough time in schedule to conduct adequate performance testing"" and given the highest priority. Healthcare.gov: What works and what doesn't? CGI had no comment other than to confirm authenticity of the report that also gave ""the highest priority"" and warns ""we don't have access to monitoring tools"" and ""hub services are intermittently unavailable"" -- short for the ""site's not working sometimes."" One concern, listed as ""severe,"" warned, ""CGI does not have access to necessary tools to manage envs in test, imp, and prod. Specifically (1) we don't have access to central log collection / view (2) we don't have access to monitoring tools. We have repeatedly asked CMS and URS but have not been granted this access."" The report, which documents issues from August 2013 and was sent to at least one employee at CMS by an executive at CGI on September 6, was submitted in response to a request by the House Oversight Committee, which is now investigating the rollout of the health law. Earlier: Contractors blame government for Obamacare website woes . E-mail addresses and some names on the document were redacted before it was obtained by CNN. CGI also said in the document they were putting a team in place to alert whenever the hub goes down. CNNMoney: Obamacare site partially restored after another outage . CMS pointed to part of the report that said all ""upcoming major milestones"" were seen as ""on track."" Brian Cook, an agency spokesman, said the report was ""not a dire warning"" but more of a ""list of things to do"" if read in full. ""What's been done, what needs to be done, what needs to be resolved.  It is misleading to cherry pick a few lines,"" he said, adding that the report identified issues and ""we worked to address those issues and all issues identified."" It is not clear if a later report detailed that the issues were resolved. But the warnings run counter to Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' stated optimism to CNN's Sanjay Gupta that when she woke up October 1, things would go smoothly. Cheryl Campbell, a Senior Vice President for CGI Federal told lawmakers on Capitol Hill October 25, ""no one ever gets enough time for testing."" Campbell, whose company has a contract worth a possible total of more than $200 million for its work on the system, noted than an end-to-end test conducted within two weeks of the launch caused the system to crash. She said it was up to CMS to decide on proceeding with the rollout. Campbell did not raise any alarm bells on Capitol Hill back in September, when she told a House Committee CGI was confident it could get the job done. ""To date, the marketplace implementation has achieved all of its key milestones from the initial architecture review in October 2011 to project baseline review in March 2012 and, most recently, the operational readiness review in September 2013,"" before the website went live. Up on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Tavenner, kicked off testimony by saying she's sorry for the Obamacare rollout. ""We know that consumers are eager to purchase this coverage and to the millions of Americans who have attempted to use healthcare.gov to shop and enroll in healthcare coverage,"" she said. ""I want to apologize to you that the website has not worked as well as it should."" It was a big switch from August, before CGI's report, when Tavenner told lawmakers the rollout was ""on track."" ""CMS is ready for October 1 and we're motivated and ready for the hard work ahead,"" she said at that time. Related: Government memo warned of high security risk at website .

"More than 20 years after a major study said there is no evidence that people who live near nuclear power plants face an increased risk of dying from cancer, the federal government will look anew at the subject, starting with seven nuclear facilities from Connecticut to California. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said Tuesday it is pushing forward with the study because an oft-cited 1990 study is dated and because more modern methods of analysis and information sources are available. In a briefing paper, the NRC staff says that given the known amounts of radiation released from nuclear reactors, researchers would not expect to observe any increased cancer risks for nearby residents. Nevertheless, the staff says, the studies would be ""helpful to address public health concerns"" and could be a tool for allaying public health concerns. While some civic groups have supported the study, the top industry trade group had argued against it, saying the study is ""unlikely to produce scientifically defensible results."" In a pilot project to begin in the coming months, the NRC is commissioning the National Academy of Sciences to conduct cancer risk studies at six nuclear power plants and one nuclear fuel facility. If successful, the study would likely be expanded to the rest of the nation's 104 commercial nuclear reactors. The six nuclear power plants in the initial study are: . -- San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, San Clemente, California. -- Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Morris, Illinois. -- Millstone Power Station, Waterford, Connecticut. -- Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, Forked River, New Jersey. -- Haddam Neck, a decommissioned plant in Haddam Neck, Connecticut. -- Big Rock Point Nuclear Power Plant, a decommissioned plant in Charlevoix, Michigan. In addition, the pilot study will look at Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin, Tennessee. The pilot study will take two to three years to complete and will cost about $2 million. For the past two decades, the NRC has relied on a National Cancer Institute's report, ""Cancer Risks in Populations near Nuclear Facilities,"" published in a 1991 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association. That study showed no general increased risk of death from cancer for people living in 107 counties containing or near 62 nuclear facilities. When compared with control counties, some of the study counties had higher rates of certain cancers and some had lower rates. None of the differences could be linked to the presence of nuclear facilities, according to a synopsis of the study on the cancer institute's website. ""From the data at hand, there was no convincing evidence of any increased risk of death from any of the cancers we surveyed due to living near nuclear facilities,"" John Boice, chief of NCI's Radiation Epidemiology Branch at the time of the survey, is quoted as saying. But he cautioned that the study had limitations, saying, ""If any excess cancer risk due to radiation pollution is present in counties with nuclear facilities, the risk is too small to be detected by the methods used."" Several years ago, the NRC staff started efforts to update the study because of the ongoing public interest in the issue, said NRC spokesman Scott Burrell. When the National Cancer Institute indicated it could not perform the work, Congress directed the NRC to work with the National Academy of Sciences. The academy developed methods for assessing radiation near nuclear plants and for assessing cancer rates in nearby communities. The academy recommended performing two types of epidemiology studies -- a geography-based study of people with various cancers leaving near nuclear facilities, and a study of cancers in children born near nuclear facilities. The academy selected the six nuclear power plants because they were a ""good sampling"" with different operating histories and population sizes. Of the 74 individuals or organizations to comment on the proposed study, 44 encouraged the NRC to proceed. But the Nuclear Energy Institute did not support the study, saying an epidemiological study ""will likely involve an outlay of significant resources without much expectation"" it would advance scientific understanding of potential risks. Other cancer risk factors, such as smoking or exposure to medical radiation, may surpass the effect from power plant releases and ""overwhelm the actual effect attributed to the releases,"" the group said.","NRC is pushing forward with the study because an oft-cited 1990 study is dated .

"Today Cordy Tindell ""C.T."" Vivian and Bayard Rustin were among 16 people honored with the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Household names former President Bill Clinton and media icon Oprah Winfrey received the honor, but odds are you probably aren't as familiar with their fellow honorees. Vivian is a civil rights leader who participated in the freedom rides, and Rustin was considered to be one of the masterminds behind the March on Washington. Here are seven things you don't know about these two unsung civil rights pioneers, but should. Civil Rights movement: No ammo necessary . When the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was just getting the Montgomery bus boycotts off the ground he ""had not personally embraced nonviolence"" according to the The Bayard Rustin Documentary Film Project.  ""In fact, there were guns inside King's house and armed guards posted at his doors. Rustin persuaded boycott leaders to adopt complete nonviolence, teaching them Gandhian nonviolent direct protest."" Violent encounters of the Southern kind . In 1965, when he was the national director of affiliates for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, or SCLC,  C.T. Vivian led a group of people to register to vote in Selma, Alabama. As the county Sheriff Jim Clark blocked the group, Vivian said in his fiery tone, ""We will register to vote because as citizens of the United States we have the right to do it."" This did not sit well with Clark, who instead of keeping the peace, disrupted it by beating Vivian until blood dripped off his chin in plain view of rolling cameras. Images such as these galvanized support for change. Bayard Rustin and Muhammad Ali have two things in common . Rustin and Ali both were conscientious objectors to war who resisted the draft and were sentenced to federal prison as a result. Rustin ended up serving almost three years for refusing to fight in World War II because of his Quaker beliefs. Ali is also a recipient of the Presidential Medal Of Freedom. C.T. Vivian got you into college . When Vivian created a college readiness program during the civil rights era, he said it was a way to ""take care of the kids that were kicked out of school simply because they protested racism."" Years later the U.S. Department of Education used his Vision program as a guide to create Upward Bound, which was designed to improve high school and college graduation rates for students in under-served communities. Throw Jim Crow from the train . During the Montgomery bus boycotts, Rustin was the logistical gasoline to King's inspirational spark that helped bring national attention to the cause. However, what many don't know is that Rustin had practice protesting segregated transit routes. In 1948 he filed a federal civil suit against the Southern Railway Company for violating his constitutional rights the year before when its employees refused him access to the dining car because of his race. 'It was bigger than the Klan' In the late 1970s Vivian founded the National Anti-Klan Network, an anti-racism organization that focused on monitoring the Ku Klux Klan. Soon after it was founded, the name and direction changed because ""it was bigger than the Klan,"" said Vivian in a phone interview. ""We called it the Center for Democratic Renewal because the whole culture had to be renewed if it truly was going to be a democratic one."" Vivian said they viewed the Center For Democratic Renewal as ""the political side"" of  what they were doing with the SCLC, which was focused on the country's morality struggles during the civil rights movement. A minority within a minority . Rustin faced oppression on two fronts:  as a black man in the Jim Crow era and as an openly gay man during a time when being ""out"" was effectively illegal. He was even arrested on a public indecency charge. His early activism as a communist was enough to raise the ire of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI, but it wasn't just before the March on Washington that the intelligence chief attempted to slow the movement's progress by attacking Rustin, the march's deputy director. Hoover reportedly supplied Rustin's arrest record to segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond, who used the information to publicly attack Rustin on the Senate floor.","Cordy Tindell ""C.T.""

"(CNN) -- The recent climate summit in Lima, Peru, has laid the foundations for a new climate treaty to be adopted in Paris in 2015. We have made significant progress toward an agreement that for the first time will involve all countries in serious efforts to combat climate change. The compromise reached in Lima ensures that all opportunities are open for negotiations to be successful over the coming year. This progress is welcome because ultimately, taking action on the climate is both a moral issue and the key to our well-being. Indeed, in recognition of the importance of tackling climate change, Germany earlier this month adopted a package of measures that will considerably bolster our efforts. The package we passed provides the instruments we need to achieve our goal of cutting emissions by 40% by 2020 compared with 1990 levels. It includes additional measures for all relevant sectors -- from energy generation, transportation and agriculture to insulating buildings. Once, such changes might have sparked widespread concern that we would somehow be hampering our competitiveness. Yet the European Union has been able to banish the myth that ambitious climate action is detrimental to the economy. Between 1990 and 2012, for example, greenhouse gas emissions in the EU fell by 18%, while the overall economy grew by around 45%. The reality is that greater prosperity doesn't have to mean more greenhouse gas emissions, poorer environmental protection or higher resource consumption. In fact, in the future, the opposite will surely prove to be true: Only those economies that take the Earth's planetary boundaries seriously will be able to achieve sustained success. Of course, doubts remain. Yet 15 years after we launched our ""Energiewende"" -- the move away from an energy supply based on fossil and nuclear fuels -- the economic impact has been broadly extremely positive: Renewable energy sources now account for nearly 30% of our electricity demands, and by 2050, our energy supply will be based almost completely on renewable sources. Indeed, the boom in environmental technologies is one of the reasons Germany made it through the economic crisis relatively unscathed. There are now over 1.5 million people working in this sector. Technologies such as photovoltaics are now commercially viable despite the doubts about their economic benefits only 10 years ago. Meanwhile, money that would otherwise have been needed to import expensive fossil resources now instead goes to individuals, cooperatives, farmers, and small and medium-sized enterprises, that can all themselves become energy suppliers. The second pillar of our climate policy is energy efficiency. In a world where political tensions are mounting even as the hunger for natural resources grows, efficient production is becoming the deciding factor for a country's competitiveness. With this in mind, Germany supports companies that optimize their refrigeration facilities, for example, or that use heat-power co-generation. But even as we improve the standards for new construction, we also have to face the challenge of the considerable existing stock of public and private buildings. Our goal is to ensure that these buildings are climate-neutral by 2050, and we have allocated significant state funding to stimulate private investment in improving the energy efficiency of our buildings. Scientists have long agreed that climate action strengthens economic development and creates an opportunity for comprehensive modernization of our economies. The age of fossil fuel is coming to an end, just as the age of the horse and cart, the steam locomotive and the oil lamp eventually came to an end. But to hasten this end, we must invest in our future. Scientists estimate that more than $90 trillion will need to be invested globally in public infrastructure and energy systems over the next 15 years. Agreements like the one in Lima will encourage greater certainty in green investment, but that deal is not the end, merely the latest part of an ongoing, global change that we need to promote. We are pleased that the United States, with recent announcements by President Barack Obama, is also willing to contribute to this change, thus testifying to the country's continuing ability to modernize itself while retaining its traditional values. Back in September, while world leaders were preparing to attend the annual U.N. General Assembly meetings, demonstrators came together in New York to demand that we take climate change seriously. It was an inspiring scene, one that I hope all leaders took to heart. These demonstrators in New York called for us to act now, not tomorrow. Let us do just that.","Barbara Hendricks: Lima climate talks marked significant progress .

"There may be a number of good reasons to vote against Mitt Romney, but based upon what we know so far, his honesty about his tenure at Bain Capital does not seem to be one of them. Let me acknowledge upfront what I have said several times on CNN: I have a past relationship with the top partners at Bain that is both personal and financial. I have worked with them in support of nonprofit organizations such as City Year. I have given a couple of paid speeches for Bain dinners, as I have for many other groups. I was on the board of a for-profit child care company, Bright Horizons, that was purchased by Bain Capital. It was a transaction with financial benefits for all board members and shareholders, including me. So, yes, I have a bias.  But let me also add how that bias plays out: I have come to admire and like the leaders of Bain Capital because I have learned firsthand that in a private equity industry, where there are obviously some predatory companies, Bain stands out for the respect in which it is generally held and for the generous philanthropy of some of its partners.  Nothing I have seen so far has shaken that view. With that on the table, let's turn to the controversy and offer answers to some basic questions: . Are President Barack Obama and his team right to demand close scrutiny of Romney's leadership at Bain?  Absolutely.  Central to Romney's candidacy is his claim that he will be better at creating jobs and growth than Obama because of his experience at Bain.  Just as Republicans have relentlessly questioned Obama's record (often to the point of sheer demagoguery), it is absolutely fair to question Romney's. And given that critics have argued that Bain helped outsource jobs through its investments in the years immediately after Romney's departure to head the Olympics, it would be a significant revelation if it turned out that in fact he had still played a meaningful role in the company. Has Romney handled the scrutiny well?  No, he hasn't.  He and his team should have prepared a thorough, written record of his time at Bain and made it publicly available long before this stage of the campaign -- a record that would have explained in advance his accomplishments and failures while at Bain, the manner of his departure and the conflicts that have arisen over what he has said and filings Bain has made with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Had he been proactive in laying it all out, it is unlikely he would be facing the barrage of today. (In another life, I made a similar argument to Bill and Hillary Clinton -- people I enormously respect -- over Whitewater and that went nowhere; naturally enough, politicians are not inclined to put out documents that may be discomforting, even if they also help clear the air.) Donna Brazile: Why Obama's Bain charges are working . Should Romney disclose his tax returns and other information relating to off-shore accounts?  Yes, he should.  Like many others who have been financially successful and as a result have complicated financial histories, Romney has shown a deep reluctance to disclose anything more than the bare minimum and has only released his tax return for one year.  But he is asking voters to entrust him with the most powerful and important office in the world.  In return, voters have a right to know who he is and how he got here.  Put it out, take whatever hits are coming, and move on.  If he has been as honest as all his friends believe, he will ultimately be a stronger candidate and can refocus on what matters: the country. Has Romney basically lied about when he actually departed Bain?  Has he tried to mislead the public or investors? Here we come to the heart of the recent controversy.  I may be wrong but based on what we know so far, I would conclude that we do not have persuasive evidence to show that he has. Romney has argued for years that after he was called in to rescue the Salt Lake City Olympics in February 1999, he turned his full attentions there and no longer exercised active management at Bain.  The story is a complicated one because Bain was a complex partnership and because the company filed various SEC papers after February 1999 still listing Romney in various key roles, including CEO and chairman.  But if one takes time to look behind the SEC filings, what emerges is much more supportive of Romney's statements. David Frum: Mitt Romney's painfully bad week . When the story first broke Thursday in The Boston Globe suggesting that Romney and Bain had fudged, CNN asked if I would do some reporting. I reached two of the top people whom I know in the company and, on background, they told me the same story that Bain sources told CNN's John King: When the call came from the Olympics that February, Romney met with his partners and said he and wife, Ann, had concluded that they had to do this and as difficult as it would be for the partnership, he had to leave in a matter of several days. That set off consternation within Bain because the company had exploded in size and Romney was not only CEO (or managing partner) but was also deeply tied into a variety of investments and partnerships.  The partners had to turn quickly to reorganizing their teams and the way they ran their business.  That was their priority. Had they known that one day Romney would be running for president, they might have acted with equal haste on cleaning up the many filings and paperwork that bore Romney's name but at the time, they didn't think that was an urgent task.  So, as the company slowly unwound its records, some papers from Bain continued to list Romney even though he had left the partnership. A sloppy mistake?  Yes.  An attempt to mislead?  The evidence so far doesn't show that.  Also of note: At the time, it seemed that he might return from the Olympics to active management, but in any event, he did not. Secondly, I do not know of (nor is there any controversy suggesting) his involvement in other companies during that time. As the New York Times reports Monday, there was an expectation at first that Romney might return to active management of Bain so he did not sever his ownership ties right away -- an additional reason why his name was not struck from documents for a while. The Times account goes on to say there is no evidence that during this interim he was actively engaged in managing the firm. Both partners with whom I spoke firmly and unequivocally said that after he physically left in February 1999, Romney no longer made decisions for Bain regarding investments, hiring, firing or any other management issues.  Subsequent to that February, the firm in 2000 offered another round of financing and, according to Bain, the investors well understood that Romney was no longer actively managing the company. Could these Bain partners now be lying?  Possibly.  On a rare occasion in the past, when I was wearing a reporter's hat, a friend has lied to me for self-protection.  But based on relationships over several years, I trust his or her account.  Even so, knowing my bias, you may well ask: Is there any corroborating evidence?  As it turns out, there is. FactCheck.org, a respected website that nails candidates for inaccuracies, earlier investigated the whole issue of Romney's departure and reached a conclusion that he was telling the truth.  Last week, little noticed by Romney's critics, FactCheck went back, reviewed the evidence again, and based on what we know so far, reaffirmed its earlier conclusion. FactCheck's recent article was co-written by a man who was once a top investigative journalist for CNN.  (The piece last week also recalled an Associated Press report on the Olympics that said in his early tenure at the Olympics, Romney was working 112-hour weeks to save the Salt Lake City games.  Does this sound like a man who was also managing a private equity firm on the East Coast?) Last week, in another article that critics tend to ignore, Fortune reported that it had obtained confidential documents that Bain gave to prospective investors in advance of that seventh round offering in 2000.  The prospectus is the way a company such as Bain informs possible investors who will manage their money.  The prospectus listed 18 managers at Bain who would have responsibility.  Romney's name was not among them. It remains possible, of course, that new evidence will emerge that could sharply contradict both Romney and Bain.  If so, that will be a whole new ball game.  Both he and the company would be grievously damaged. But judgments today can only be fairly made on the evidence at hand and the reputations of the people who are coming forward.  From my perspective -- yes, with a bias -- the weight comes down on the side that as he has said all along, Romney ended his active management at Bain when he left for the Olympics.  Again, there are many other reasons why one might oppose his candidacy, but this does not strike me as a fair one. As long as fairness is the standard, it would be reassuring if some of the harshest critics of Romney and Bain would acknowledge their own biases.  And for goodness sake, will the Obama campaign please withdraw its heavy suggestion that Mitt Romney could well have committed a felony?  That was an injustice to both Romney and the president.

"Greenland, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Rick Perry aimed Saturday to shift attention from Iowa's straw poll to New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he told conservative activists he is seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. The Texas governor addressed a group of voters in Greenland, New Hampshire, a state where he is expected to launch an aggressive campaign. ""It's time to get America working, folks, and that's the reason I am announcing my candidacy today to be president of the United States,"" he said, as supporters cheered. Perry came in sixth as an unofficial write-in on the nonbinding Ames Straw Poll. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, Texas Rep. Ron Paul and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, as expected, took the top three positions in the vote. Perry spoke at the home of Deputy House Speaker Pam Tucker, one of several state officials who had previously traveled to Austin, Texas, to woo the governor. Perry told his supporters that he intends to ""compete for every vote in every state"" and vowed to cover the country during the course of his campaign. He addressed Barack Obama directly during his speech, telling the president: ""You can't win the future by selling it off to foreign creditors."" He called the recent Standard and Poor's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating one of a ""number of recent downgrades."" Earlier in the day, Perry announced that he would run for the Republican nomination at the RedState Gathering in Charleston, South Carolina, one day after meeting with Alabama Republicans. ""I came to South Carolina because I cannot accept the path the country is on,"" Perry said. ""A renewed nation needs a new president."" Perry recited a litany of issues facing America, including debt, high unemployment and hefty energy costs. Leadership under Obama, he said, is ""rudderless."" ""It's time to believe the promise of our future is better than the best days behind us,"" Perry said to applause. He launched his presidential campaign website, rickperry.org, shortly before the announcement. The timing of the announcement buttressed Perry's bid to get attention on a busy day in American politics: His South Carolina speech started the same hour as those given by candidates making a pitch for straw poll votes in Iowa. Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said Perry's appeal to both social and fiscal conservatives could be crucial in the South Carolina Republican primary, which every GOP presidential nominee has won since 1980. ""He would appeal to tea party Republicans, he would appeal to the individuals who are interested in job creation in the state,"" Black told CNN. ""He can also, I think, appeal to evangelical Christians, and the overlap between evangelical tea party Republicans, economic development Republicans -- those are a lot of voters in a South Carolina Republican primary."" South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley helped kick off the RedState conference, saying Republicans will unite to defeat Obama. Perry told the South Carolina crowd that he has helped cut taxes and government spending in Texas. Meanwhile, Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt struck back, saying Perry ""pledged to support the 'cut, cap and balance' plan that would preserve subsidies for oil and gas companies and tax cuts for the wealthiest while ending Medicare as we know it, eroding Social Security, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs and erasing investments in education and research and development."" In a statement, LaBolt claimed the governor ""allowed special interests to write their own rules, hired corporate lobbyists to oversee corporations, and cut funding for programs that would create opportunity for middle-class families."" Perry succeeded George W. Bush in the Texas governor's office and has held that job longer than anyone in state history. His entry into the race will shake up the Republican field, putting Perry into direct competition with Bachmann for core right-wing support. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, if she runs, also would vie for that backing. A CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday showed 15% of Republican and independent voters who lean toward the GOP picked Perry as their choice for the Republican nomination. That put Perry, still a noncandidate at the time, just 2 percentage points behind former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, considered the front-runner in the nominating process. Romney's advantage over Perry is within the survey's sampling error. Working the crowd in Iowa, Romney said Friday that he expects a ""more interesting contest"" with Perry in the field.

"Police locked down New Delhi's key government district ahead of Monday's visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin, after two days of pitched street battles following the gang rape of a woman on a bus. Putin is scheduled  to meet with Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh Monday afternoon and later with  the Indian president. Authorities erected security barriers throughout the city's Raisina Hills area -- home to the presidential mansion, the parliament building and federal ministerial blocks.  Only those authorized to work in the district were allowed to pass. Surviving rape, iReporters speak out . Furious weekend demonstrations rocked Raisina Hills as public outrage surged after a 23-year-old woman was sexually assaulted and beaten to near death on a bus on December 16 by a group of six suspects, now under arrest, police say. Singh again expressed solidarity with the rape victim in a televised address on Monday.  He also reiterated an earlier appeal for calm and a pledge of safety for women and children. On Sunday, incensed protesters defied a police ban on demonstrations, clashing repeatedly with police. As officers sprayed water cannons, some dispersed, while others huddled tightly in a circle to brave high-pressure streams in the cold December weather. ""We want justice!"" the protesters shouted in chorus. Read more: New Delhi police fire water cannon at Indian rape protest . In addition to banners and cardboard placards, many demonstrators carried Indian flags as they scuffled with police. Authorities also fired tear gas to try to break up crowds. Police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said ""hooligans who had joined the protesters"" hurled stones, injuring 78 officers on Sunday. At least 65 protesters were also injured, he said. Many police vans and a dozen public buses were damaged during the demonstrations, he said. Read more: Indian prime minister calls for calm after violence erupts during anti-rape rallies . By Sunday night, the scene was cleared of all protesters. Earlier in the day, Singh called for calm after clashes escalated. ""We will make all possible efforts to ensure security and safety to all women in this country,"" the Indian leader said. ""I appeal to all concerned citizens to maintain peace and calm."" In his statement, Singh acknowledged that the anger is ""genuine and justified."" Read more: Opinion: India's rape problem needs a rewiring of society's attitude . Authorities haven't released the name of the rape victim, but protesters are calling her ""Damini,"" which means ""lightning"" in Hindi. ""Damini"" is also a 1993 Bollywood film whose lead female character fights for a housemaid, a victim of a sexual assault. ""We support you Damini. We'll keep fighting for you,"" a middle-aged woman at the historic India Gate said Sunday. ""Damini wants justice,"" read a placard at the protest. The rape victim's injuries were so severe she spent days in intensive care in a city hospital, battling for her life. Police said Saturday that she had recovered enough to give a statement to a magistrate from her hospital bed the night before. But on Sunday, she underwent another surgery to wash out infection in her abdomen, her doctors said. The protests were among many anti-rape demonstrations staged across the country over the past week. A video journalist was killed by police gunfire Sunday during a violent protest in India's remote northeastern state of Manipur, authorities said. The journalist, identified by the information and broadcasting ministry as Dhij Mani, was covering a protest against a separate molestation case in the provincial capital of Imphal. Protests have rocked Manipur over the alleged molestation of a local actress by a suspected militant on December 18, during a public performance, authorities say. Protesters torched a vehicle, forcing police to open fire, officer Manik Longjam said Sunday. The journalist died in the gunfire, Longjam said. Police say the molester is still at large. Reported rape cases have increased more than tenfold over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011, according to official figures. New Delhi alone reported 572 rapes last year and more than 600 in 2012. As fury about the assault gathered pace, some Indian lawmakers called for treating rape as a capital crime. ""We'll work collectively to see we make a law which is deterrent and preventive,"" said New Delhi's chief minister, Sheila Dikshit. India's home minister Sushilkumar Shinde told reporters Saturday that the government would work toward increasing punishment in ""rarest of the rare"" rape cases. But pressed on whether the administration would agree to demands for death by hanging in such instances, he said: ""We'll have to see in what way it (the rape sentencing) can be enhanced."" Shinde said the government was pushing for a speedy trial for the attack. Authorities are also taking a number of steps to improve security for women in New Delhi, particularly on public transport, he said. ""(The) government shares the widespread concern and support that has been expressed throughout society for the girl who has so suffered. Government also respects the right of legitimate protest,"" Shinde said. ""At the same time, there is need to exercise calm at this juncture and for everyone to work together to improve the safety and security environment.""","Russian President Vladimir Putin is due visit India Monday .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- The boys were cousins -- playing, as they had many times before, at a beach by the sparkling waters of the Mediterranean when the shelling started. The first shell struck a fisherman's hut on a jetty by the beach where the boys' game had taken them. As a plume of smoke rose from the blast, several of the boys dashed across the sand, seeking cover. But they couldn't outrun the second shell, which whizzed in and exploded right by them. The attack on the Gaza City beach killed four boys, aged between 9 and 11, from the extended Bakr family. Their names were Ismail, Zakaria, Ahed and Mohamed. Growing child death toll . The Israeli military said the case is being carefully investigated and that preliminary results indicate the intended target of the strike was ""Hamas terrorist operatives."" It described the civilian deaths as ""a tragic outcome."" But children have frequently been among the victims of the conflict between Israel and Hamas. Of the more than 200 people killed in the 10 days of Israeli bombardment of Gaza, around 40 are children, according to the United Nations. Killings of the young also played a prominent role in setting off the confrontation. Tensions in the region soared when the bodies of three kidnapped Israeli teenagers were found in the West Bank on June 30. Two days later, a Palestinian teen was abducted and burned alive in an apparent revenge attack in Jerusalem. Journalists witness shelling . The deaths of the four boys on the Gaza beach Wednesday was a particularly stark example of the innocent lives lost in the fighting. They died within eyeshot of a hotel housing several international journalists, some of whom joined in efforts to help people who were wounded in the shelling. Veteran reporters described the harrowing scenes. Nicholas Casey, a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal, said that after hearing a blast nearby, he went downstairs and saw bodies being carried from the scene, including one boy of around 9 or 10. ""His body was fairly mutilated and he was burned, his leg was twisted,"" Casey told CNN's Jake Tapper. Another journalist said he had spent time playing with the boys. ""Minutes before they were killed by our hotel, I was kicking a ball with them,"" NBC News Foreign Correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin said on Twitter. The boys had apparently been told by their fisherman parents not to go outside amid the recurrent Israeli aerial attacks. But the urge to stretch their legs in the sunshine was too strong. ""Why did he go to the beach and play -- for them to take him away from me?"" cried the distraught mother of 11-year-old Mohamed. Fears on both sides . People on both sides of the conflict have expressed concerns about the fate of children caught amid the Hamas rocket barrages and Israeli airstrikes. ""I'm not happy to see Israeli children hurt,"" Mustafa, a Palestinian man who used to work in Israel, told CNN this week. ""I have grandchildren. I don't want them to be hurt. We want to live."" Kindergartens and summer camps in Israeli areas near Gaza have decamped to bomb shelters amid the incessant rocket fire. In one bunker in the southern city of Ashkelon, a mother says she would like take her children away from the line of fire. But Hamas' missiles are reaching farther and farther, and for the time being, she doesn't have the money to move. Another Israeli mother, Tal Tzukan, who lives about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Gaza border, said last week she's had to regularly rush her two small children into a safe room when sirens warn of incoming rockets. From her home, Tzukran can also see the bombs hitting Gaza and says she fears for the families on the other side of the border. ""It's hard not to think about the same situation with little kids over there,"" she said. Anger at funeral . The Bakr boys had no safe house in which to take refuge. And many people in Gaza have complained they have nowhere to go when warned of impending Israeli airstrikes. The boys were buried a little more than an hour after their deaths. Hundreds of people attended the funeral, where angry chants filled the air. The Israeli military says it works hard to try to avoid civilian casualties in its assaults on Gaza, and it accuses Hamas of using people as human shields. On Wednesday, the Israeli military released videos that it said showed air strikes being aborted because of risks to civilians. It also uses telephone messages, leaflets and nonlethal munitions to warn occupants of homes about to be hit. But human rights groups are unconvinced by Israel's efforts, as are members of the Bakr family. ""Were those four small boys firing rockets?"" asked Sufian, one of the boys' relatives. ""They went to the beach to play football."" For Ramiz, the blind father of Mohamed, it's too much to bear. ""I felt as if the world had come to an end when I heard the news,"" he said. ""I wish I had died before hearing he was dead."" Life in Gaza: Search for safety, or wait for destiny .

"(CNN)When he brought his camera to shoot the shrinking German city of Hoyerswerda, you could say American photographer Demetrius Freeman took a few risks. ""One: I don't speak German. And two: There's a heavy neo-Nazi population in the area,"" Freeman told CNN over the phone last week. ""I'm black, so traveling to that part of Germany was, well, very intimidating,"" he said with a chuckle. A generation ago when it was part of the former East Germany, Hoyerswerda was held up as an example of a communist utopia. But when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and Germany reunited a year later, economic reform began choking the city of 72,000. First, jobs began disappearing -- then so did the residents. Many left town looking for better opportunities. In 1991, gangs attacked the homes of hundreds of immigrant workers there, including Vietnamese and Africans, The New York Times reported. Authorities were forced to evacuate the terrified laborers to a military base. By the time Freeman arrived last year, its population had withered to just 35,000. He wanted to document the residents' painful economic struggle to survive. Initially, he thought he'd tell the story through the eyes of one displaced family. ""But when I got there, I found the issue was much bigger,"" Freeman said. ""Everyone was going through it."" So Freeman widened his editorial lens and painted a photographic landscape of a larger issue. It wasn't simply residents' survival at stake. The very existence of the town itself was clearly in jeopardy. Several residents were moved out of their homes to make room for a coal mining operation. One of Freeman's favorite photos shows an odd cardboard cutout in a window, showing happy residents smiling inside their doomed homes. ""It promoted this perfect couple and a perfect world, when it really wasn't perfect,"" Freeman said. ""The town felt eerie,"" he said, ""like I was in some sort of horror film."" Almost always, Freeman and his German guide traveled around the city on bicycles. At one point they found themselves accosted by a group of men at a campsite. ""They stepped in front of us and did the whole, 'Heil Hitler,' putting their hands up and talking in German,"" Freeman recalled. His guide stepped in and began speaking with the men. ""There was an argument, and they told us to get out of their way,"" Freeman said. ""There was a lot of yelling. Finally they moved and continued yelling things as we biked away."" ""Thinking back, it's like, how did I do that?"" he laughed. Freeman first fell in love with photography during his high-school days in Atlanta, after his best friend's father loaned him a small point-and-shoot camera. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Once he started playing with it, he couldn't put it down. Freeman's fascination with creating images led to a question, which later became a goal: How can I make a living as a photographer? A college degree and internships at The New York Times led to his current position as a photographer for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. ""It's really cool ... I feel like the job presents different challenges that don't exist in newspaper and other forms,"" Freeman said. ""You have to find a way to make photographing someone at a podium interesting."" One day, he hopes to have a freelance photo/video company, where he can focus on his true passion: portraits. ""That's really what I love to do -- just capturing someone's character in one frame,"" Freeman said. ""I find it very character-revealing. It's very subtle. And l love that.""

"The U.S. Army plans to launch two stationary ""blimps"" at 10,000-feet in the air next week to better protect the Washington, D.C. area from cruise missiles and other possible air attacks. It's part of a three-year test by the North American Aerospace Defense Command of the so-called JLENS System, which is designed to work with already-existing air defense technology. The tethered large balloons, called aerostats, carry technology that will almost double the reach of current ground radar detection, officials said. The JLENS manufacturer, Raytheon Corp., says the system can provide radar coverage to an area the size of Texas. It will ""increase decision time available to respond efficiently and accurately for the defense of the National Capital Region,"" NORAD said. The JLENS system -- which stands for Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor -- has no firing capability.  Any response to missile attacks would still come from ground missiles, ships and airplanes, according to NORAD. The balloons will fly above the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and do not carry any cameras. ""It's not for surveillance,"" said NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek. ""It's simply for the detection of cruise missiles."" The 242-foot-long aerostats will be tethered to the ground by 1⅛-thick ""super-strong"" cables, according to Raytheon. The tethering system is designed to withstand 100 mph winds and had no problems in 106 mph winds during testing, the company said. The helium-filled aerostats can stay aloft for up to 30 days at a time, making it five to seven times cheaper to operate than using aircraft for the task, Raytheon says. NORAD says the JLENS system will be crewed by 130 personnel at the Maryland base. The agency is working with the FAA so the balloons won't impede air traffic, Kucharek said. Weather permitting, a launch is planned for Monday, just in time to aid NORAD in its most important December task. ""We fully intend to take the information gathered by the system and use it to track Santa,"" Kucharek said.","Army will test balloons around Washington, D.C. that guard against cruise missiles .

"Four people believed to be connected to the drugs found in Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment were arrested late Tuesday night, law enforcement officials told CNN. During the raid that led to the arrest of the three men and one woman, police recovered 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin, the officials said. The bags of alleged heroin were branded  ""black list"" and ""red bull"" -- not the same brands found in Hoffman's apartment, the sources said. Apartments at 302 Mott Street in Manhattan, where the four were arrested, are part of the investigation into Hoffman's death, according to a police source. The source identified the suspects being investigated in connection with drugs sold to Hoffman as Juliana Luchkiw, 22; Max Rosenblum, 22; Robert Vineberg, 57; and Thomas Cushman, 48. Luchkiw and Rosenblum were charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree, misdemeanors, while Vineberg was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree, a felony. Through their attorneys, all three entered pleas of not guilty Wednesday. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office declined to prosecute Cushman because there was no evidence he had any control over the drugs. Vineberg was found to have the actor's phone number stored in his cell phone, a law enforcement official told CNN. Police discovered the largest amount of what is believed to be heroin in his apartment, the source said. Vineberg was described by a former neighbor as a talented musician who used the stage name Robert Aaron and once toured with Wyclef Jean. Vineberg had a wife and daughter, said the neighbor, who lived in the building a number of years ago. ""He used to practice at night,"" said the former neighbor, recounting that Vineberg played keyboards. ""Honestly, he seemed like a nice guy, always playing music. Nothing sinister."" Vineberg's attorney, Edward Kratt, said that he hopes prosecutors will not use his client as a scapegoat. ""These charges have absolutely nothing to do with Philip Seymour Hoffman's unfortunate death,"" Kratt said. Luchkiw's attorney, Stephan Turano, similarly said she had no connection to Hoffman, other than seeing his movies, and that Luchkiw was simply in the ""wrong place at (the) wrong time."" A spokeswoman for the New York medical examiner's office said Wednesday that a determination of the cause and manner of Hoffman's death is pending further study, including toxicology reports. When police were called to Hoffman's fourth-floor Manhattan apartment Sunday, they found the actor lying on the bathroom floor with a syringe in his left arm. He was wearing shorts and a T-shirt, his eyeglasses still resting on his head, according to law enforcement sources familiar with the inquiry. Investigators discovered close to 50 envelopes of what they believed was heroin in the apartment, the law enforcement sources said. They also found used syringes, prescription drugs and empty plastic bags of a type commonly used to hold drugs, the sources said. Also found in Hoffman's apartment was his personal journal, resting on a living room TV stand, two law enforcement sources said. Hoffman's final hours . No fentanyl found . Preliminary tests Tuesday showed the heroin recovered from Hoffman's apartment did not contain fentanyl, a law enforcement official told CNN. More testing will be done. Fentanyl is a powerful narcotic used to treat cancer patients' pain. Last week, Maryland officials said heroin tainted with fentanyl had claimed at least 37 lives since September. And last month, at least 22 people  in western Pennsylvania died after using heroin mixed with fentanyl. While results of an autopsy will definitively reveal exactly how Hoffman, 46, died, the role that heroin may or may not have played is a key part of the investigation. Final hours . Police are trying to piece together the actor's movements last weekend as they look for anyone who might be linked to the drugs that apparently killed him. On Tuesday,  a law enforcement source told CNN that the night before Hoffman died, he withdrew $1,200 from a grocery store ATM near his  apartment. Hoffman got the money in six transactions Saturday night, according to the source. A witness told investigators he saw the Oscar-winning actor talking to two men wearing messenger bags about 8 p.m. Police are also reviewing surveillance video, including video of a restaurant where Hoffman had brunch Saturday morning with two people. How heroin kills you . 'I'm a heroin addict' In a 2011 interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Hoffman discussed his past struggles with drug and alcohol addiction. ""Anything I could get my hands on, I liked it all,"" he said. Fear, Hoffman said, made him sober up. ""You get panicked. ... I was 22 and I got panicked for my life. It really was, it was just that,"" he said. ""And I always think, 'God, I have so much empathy for these young actors that are 19 and all of a sudden are beautiful and famous and rich.' I'm like, 'Oh my God. I'd be dead.'"" But last year, Hoffman said he'd fallen off the wagon, started taking prescription pills and slipped into snorting heroin, according to TMZ. Magazine writer John Arundel said he met the actor at the Sundance Film Festival in Utah two weeks before his death. ""I said, 'What do you do?' And at that point, he took off his hat and he said, 'I'm a heroin addict,'"" Arundel said. ""Didn't look like he was (joking). Seemed like he was having one of those 'coming to God' moments -- where it just struck him as, 'this is the revelatory moment.'"" But actor George Clooney said he had dinner with Hoffman a few months ago, and he seemed  fine. ""I have to say he seemed in pretty good shape,"" Clooney said.  ""I mean, there's no way to explain it."" Filmmaker Chris Barrett interviewed Hoffman January 17 at the Sundance Film Festival. ""He didn't look well at Sundance. His skin color was very pale, but he wasn't disheveled as some media was reporting,"" Barrett told CNN. Dimming the lights . Family and close friends of the actor will hold a private funeral service in New York. Plans are also under way for a memorial service later this month. No information on the dates was available. On Wednesday night, the famed Broadway theater district will dim its marquees for one minute at 7:45 p.m. in Hoffman's memory. He appeared on Broadway three times. Hoffman stayed active on stage even as his star rose in Hollywood. He starred in a Broadway production of ""Death of a Salesman"" in 2012 and was co-artistic director of the Labyrinth Theater Company in New York. That company hosted a candlelight vigil Wednesday night. ""I just was really profoundly affected by his death and felt like it was important for me to be here,"" said Leslie Kritzer, a fellow actor. ""I also just think it's important to be here to remind people to have compassion and love for people that are struggling with the disease of addiction."" Kritzer said she had long admired Hoffman from afar. ""He could do the movies, and he did them brilliantly -- better than anyone else -- but he always came back to his roots and he was a hero for all of us that could only dream of doing what he accomplished,"" she said.","Three enter not guilty pleas; Office decides not to prosecute fourth .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill immediately blamed each other for the failure of a $700 billion bailout package in the House on Monday. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said there would be no revote Monday on the bill aimed at buying up bad mortgages and stabilizing the faltering economy because House members had left the Capitol. It was unclear in what form the congressional leadership would bring the bill back to the House floor. The stock market immediately dipped hundreds of points after it became apparent that the bill would fail. The Dow closed down 777 points at the end of trading Monday, a record plunge.  Watch blocked bailout win or loss? » . The package, which was backed by both the Democratic and Republican congressional leadership as well as President Bush, failed in the House by a vote of 228-205. See roll call of how House members voted (PDF) ""My sense is that this exact same bill couldn't pass,"" said Missouri Rep. Roy Blunt, the No. 2 Republican in the House. ""But this bill could be the basis for final congressional action. They'd have to expect some changes."" Nearly 60 percent of Democrats voted for the bill, and about a third of Republicans supported it. House Republican leaders blamed Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, for the bill's failure, saying she had scuttled a bipartisan compromise with a ""partisan speech"" shortly before the vote. Pelosi started her speech by citing ""the Bush administration's failed economic policies -- policies built on budgetary recklessness, on an anything-goes mentality with no regulation, no supervision and no discipline in the system."" ""I do believe that the vote could have succeeded,""  Boehner said in a news conference. ""But the speaker had to give a partisan speech ... that poisoned our caucus."" Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, rejected the Republicans' accusation as ""absurd."" Rep. Barney Frank, the House Democrats' main negotiator on the package, called the Republicans' finger pointing an excuse. ""Because somebody hurt their feelings, they decided to punish the country?"" Frank said. ""I don't believe they had the votes. They are covering up the fact that they don't have the votes."" Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican, denied that the bill's opponents had voted against it because of hurt feelings. ""I want to assure you that is not the case. We are not babies, sucking our thumbs,"" she said. ""Clearly it is important to get it done quickly, but it is more important to get it done correctly,"" said Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas. After the vote, President Bush was ""disappointed"" that the House failed to pass the bailout, saying, ""We put forward a plan that was big because we got a big problem.  Watch a White House spokesman describe the president's reaction » . ""Our strategy is to continue to address this economic situation head on. We'll be working to develop a strategy,"" Bush said. Bush is scheduled to speak on the bailout plan Tuesday at 8:45 a.m. at the White House. The Senate had planned to take up the bill after the House had passed it, but now it is unclear how the senators will proceed. ""Democrats are doing our part to improve the administration's flawed plan, but we will need the support of more Republicans to get this done,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in a statement. ""With the stock market recording its largest point drop ever in the aftermath of this vote, it has never been more clear how important it is to put politics aside and come together to stabilize our economy for all Americans,"" Reid said. ""I hope House Republicans will reconsider their vote and decide to put country first."" After the House vote, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said lawmakers were ""going to stay here until we get this job done,"" but he admitted he could not say how to push a package through. ""No action is not an answer,"" McConnell said. The House will not be in session Tuesday and Wednesday, but behind-the-scenes work will continue until it reconvenes Thursday. Sen. Judd Gregg, the lead Republican Senate negotiator on the deal, said there would be real consequences if Congress did not approve legislation. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on the bailout .

Before the vote, many House Republicans expressed opposition to the bill, saying it departed from free-market principles. Republican congressional aides also said calls from constituents were running 10 to 1 against the legislation.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Eight U.S. service members and an American civilian contractor were killed Wednesday in a shooting at an Afghan air force compound in Kabul, officials said. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said an Afghan military pilot opened fire on international troops, sparking a ""gunfight."" The Taliban, however, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had been working with the shooter for some time -- an assertion that NATO denied. Also denying the Taliban claim was the brother of the pilot. ""My brother had no connections with the Taliban, and I deny any claims of his connection by the Taliban,"" Dr. Mohammad Hosain Sahebi told a local Afghan TV station in a telephone interview. He said his brother, Ahmad Gull, 48, was in the Afghan Air Force for several years and was injured many times in plane crashes. The Afghan military, however, listed the pilot as being 50 years old. ""My brother had mental sickness as the result of the plane crashes in '80s and also he had economic problems, too,"" Sahebi told local television. One witness, Jon Mohammad, a military pilot at Kabul Airport, told CNN that he jumped from a second floor window to the ground during the incident. He saw foreigners laying on the ground inside the first floor, he said. ""He was religious person, but I'm not sure if he had mental illness,"" Mohammad said of Gull, the pilot. The shooting started at the Afghan national air force compound at North Kabul International Airport after an argument between the Afghan pilot and an international colleague, officials said. The NATO-led force said the Afghan military pilot opened fire on international trainers and a ""gunfight"" ensued. ""A 50-year-old man opened fire at armed U.S. military soldiers inside the airport after an argument between them turned serious,"" said Col. Baha Dur, chief of public relations for the Afghan National Army at Kabul military airport. NATO said the confrontation took place at 10:25 a.m. at the airport, where a quick-reaction force responded to a ""small arms fire incident."" The airport is home to NATO Air Training Command Afghanistan. An initial report indicates the attack occurred in a meeting room at the Afghan Air Force headquarters, a location operated and secured by Afghans, a U.S. military official told CNN. The NATO-led force is investigating, the official said. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the killings ""by an Afghan military pilot."" Zaher Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, said the killings upset Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak and that ""he shares the pain with the families of the victims."" Despite the account by international troops, a Taliban spokesman said a man named Azizullah was responsible. ""One suicide attacker ... managed to attack an Afghan military unit and has managed to kill many Afghan and international soldiers,"" Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said. The Taliban said the man killed nine foreigners and five Afghans before being killed by the Afghan army. ""We had worked hard on this plan for a long time,"" Mujahid told CNN. ""He was cooperating with us since long time and he was providing us information about military air operations for a long time."" NATO disputed the Taliban claim. ""We do not know why it started but there is no indication that a suicide bomber was involved and there are no reports that someone managed to get into the base to do this,"" the NATO-led force said in a statement. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for previous conflicts between NATO service members and members of the Afghan military. CNN could not independently verify the group's claims. The Taliban said the man was once a pilot in an Afghan regime in the late 1980s and early 1990s. ""Since the current Afghan air forces have no planes, he was just going to Kabul airport to show up and earn his salary for a long time,"" Mujahid told CNN. The man ""was holding the rank of colonel at the time and he had an AK-47 with him. After his bullets were finished, then he was shot to death by armed forces,"" Mujahid told CNN. There was confusion about the death toll. The NATO-led force initially said six service members were killed. It raised that toll to nine but backed away temporarily before saying again that the shooting killed nine people -- eight international service members and a civilian contractor. The Pentagon confirmed that all were Americans. Later Wednesday NATO announced that two additional service members were killed in attacks elsewhere in the country, bringing the day's total number of NATO casualties to at least 11. Violence between Afghan forces and NATO troops is a matter of extreme concern for NATO officials, and it is growing in frequency. There have been 36 NATO deaths in the past two years attributed to attacks by people perceived to be Afghan soldiers or police. Officials fear that the increasing frequency of the attacks could undermine trust between NATO troops and the Afghans they are working hard to prepare so they can eventually take over security in the country. The Taliban's claim that the Afghan gunman was their recruit follows a now-familiar pattern of the insurgency stating that attacks are theirs, even though NATO later suggests the gunman was acting out of personal motivation. Out of 16 incidents of Afghan forces shooting NATO personnel that NATO has investigated, eight have been determined to be motivated by combat stress on the part of the Afghan attacker. The other eight investigations are undetermined.

"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- Dazed Southerners on Thursday comforted one another and began the process of rebuilding after a barrage of storms claimed nearly 300 lives and reduced once-familiar neighborhoods to piles of bricks and lumber. The grim death toll from the 24-hour storm period continued to rise, with 294 counted in six states. Among them were two university students in Alabama. Nearly 1 million customers were without electricity. The vast majority of fatalities occurred in Alabama, where at least 207 people perished, according to state and local officials. Gov. Robert Bentley and other officials stood Thursday afternoon in the bright sunshine in Tuscaloosa, the epicenter of the state's misery, to detail the damage and recovery effort. ""People's lives have just been turned upside down,"" Bentley said. ""It affects me emotionally. When I fly over this, it is difficult."" The South endured the second deadliest tornado outbreak in the nation's history since 1950. Weather experts said humidity, cooler temperatures and vertical wind shear made for a deadly concoction. Live blog: Death toll rises in Southern storms . The death toll in the hard-hit city of Tuscaloosa, in west-central Alabama, was at 38 as of Thursday, said Mayor Walter Maddox. Infrastructure losses are hurting recovery efforts, he said. ""My heart is broken,"" Maddox told CNN late Thursday. ""We have a resilient spirit here and it will be on display for the world to see."" A breakdown provided by Bentley's office showed that violent weather claimed lives in 19 Alabama counties, with Tuscaloosa County at the top of the list. Thirty-two people perished in DeKalb County in northeastern Alabama, and 14 died in Jefferson County, home to Birmingham. The death toll for Franklin County stood Thursday evening at 27. Thirty-three people died in Mississippi since Tuesday, all but one on Wednesday and Thursday, emergency officials said. Tennessee emergency officials said 34 people died in that state. Fifteen were dead in Georgia, five in Virginia -- where authorities revised an earlier count down from eight -- and one in Arkansas. The outbreak officially started Monday, and Arkansas officials said they have lost 13 residents since then. See hi-res photos of the devastation . CNN iReporter Thomas I. Carroll Jr., 47, who grew up in Smithville, Mississippi, took photos of the town, which suffered at least 13 deaths. He said at least half the city was gone. ""It looks like something out of Kansas. It's not expected in Mississippi,"" said the dentist, who rushed over Wednesday afternoon to check on his parents, whose house was damaged but they were uninjured. Search crews were looking for the missing in the city of about 900. Entire neighborhoods were leveled and hundreds of thousands of people were without power in the affected regions. As of 6 p.m. (7 p.m. ET), Alabama Power said about 297,000 customers had no electricity. The Tennessee Valley Authority reported 641,000 customers were without power as of 8:30 p.m. ET, at least half of them in northern Alabama. Thursday evening, about 49,000 people in Georgia were without power, according to Georgia Power and the Georgia Electric Membership Corp. ""This could be one of the most devastating tornado outbreaks in the nation's history by the time it's over,"" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Outbreak could set tornado record, experts say . It wasn't just the incredible winds and funnel clouds that made conditions miserable for millions. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency in preparation for the Mississippi River cresting well above flood level. In Mississippi, Gov. Haley Barbour advised residents to prepare for levels 3 feet higher than in 2008. Long before the death toll mushroomed, governors in Alabama, Mississippi and Georgia had declared states of emergency within their borders. Virginia followed suit Thursday. Barbour said he was asking for a statewide emergency declaration. ""Our efforts are to put lives and businesses back together,"" Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal said. President Barack Obama on Thursday called the loss of life from storms in the South ""heartbreaking,"" especially in Alabama. The ""federal government will do everything we can to help (people affected by the deadly storms) recover,"" he said. Storms leave trail of destruction across South . Obama announced late Wednesday he had approved Bentley's request for emergency federal assistance, including search and rescue support. The White House said Obama will travel to Alabama on Friday. Bentley said Thursday he is asking Obama for a major disaster declaration. According to FEMA, such declarations are made when ""an incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond state and local capabilities and that federal assistance is necessary."" In the DeKalb County, Alabama town of Rainsville, 25 bodies were recovered near a trailer park, said Police Chief Charles Centers. Many people are unaccounted for, Centers said. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it was monitoring the Browns Ferry nuclear power plant near Athens in north Alabama, about 32 miles west of Huntsville, after it lost off-site power Wednesday night due to the storms. The three units at the plant shut down automatically when power was lost, it said. TVA spokeswoman Barbara Martocci told CNN no radiation was released as a result of the shutdown, and the plant is currently in a safe shutdown mode. At least one strong tornado swept through Tuscaloosa, leaving dozens of roads impassable and destroying hundreds of homes and businesses. Resident James Sykes said the massive twister was ""like a silent monster. It was just moving at a steady rate and just demolishing everything in its path."" Read the stories of tornado survivors . ""It literally obliterated blocks and blocks of the city,"" Maddox, the Tuscaloosa mayor, said. He told CNN Thursday morning the devastation was ""unparalleled ... the city's infrastructure has been absolutely decimated."" The University of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, escaped mostly unscathed, but two students died. ""From my understanding, these were two separate incidents,"" spokesman Bill McDaniel said. ""The students are not believed to have been together."" McDaniel did not have details on who the students were or where they were at the time. The university will not conduct final exams as scheduled next week and commencement has been rescheduled from May 7 to August 6, according to the school's website. Bentley activated 2,000 National Guard troops Wednesday night and said he will activate more if necessary. In Mississippi, Barbour said he had also activated the National Guard. National Guard spokesman Maj. Tom Crosson in Washington said about 120 troops were in Mississippi and 50 more in Arkansas. Witnesses recount tornado encounters . More than 1,700 people were treated for injuries at trauma centers and hospitals in Alabama, including those treated and released. A Facebook page was set up for users to claim photos and documents found strewn by the storms. ""House mortgage from Tuscaloosa found in Rainbow City,"" said the caption on one photo. The two cities are 116 miles apart. Several meteorological conditions combined Wednesday to create a particularly dangerous mix, CNN's Morris said. ""It is tornado season, but an intensive event like this only will occur maybe once or twice a year,"" he said. ""It's very rare to have all these ingredients come together."" Eight people died and 28 were hospitalized in the agricultural community of Apison, east of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Is severe weather affecting you? Share stories, photos and video . ""We have an overabundance of volunteers and donated food,"" said county emergency services spokeswoman Amy Maxwell. Animals were among storm victims in Apison, Maxwell said. ""We had to put down a horse that had a broken leg and another was killed when a barn collapsed on it."" The town of Ringgold, Georgia, about 17 miles southeast of Chattanooga, was hit particularly hard, officials said. The storm also unleashed as many as 80,000 chickens in Pickens County, Georgia, after four huge coops were destroyed. A tornado severely damaged Reba Self's Ringgold home in a matter of seconds. For a time, she thought she had lost much more than just a place to live, as she frantically searched for her mother, who also lives in the house. Impact Your World: How to help . ""I'm screaming for her, 'Answer me, Mom -- please, Mom, answer me.' I didn't hear anything.

The storms are being compared to the ""super outbreak"" of tornadoes April 3 and 4, 1974, Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator, said Thursday. In that period, 148 tornadoes were reported in 13 states, and 330 people died. States affected were Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.

"Russia needs to keep actively guarding its sovereignty to avoid becoming like a chained bear whose captors ""will pull out his teeth and claws,"" President Vladimir Putin said Thursday. Responding to a question at his annual news conference about Russia's annexation of Crimea, Putin drew an analogy with what would happen if ""our most recognizable symbol ... the bear who guards his Taiga (forest)"" stopped chasing pigs and sat still, ""maybe eating berries and honey."" The President pondered whether the bear would then be left alone before answering: ""They won't leave him alone. They are always trying to put him on a chain. They will always try to put him on a chain and as soon as he is put on this chain, they will pull out his teeth and claws. In today's terms we are speaking about our nuclear deterrence. As soon as, God forbid, this is done, the bear isn't needed anymore."" Once the bear had lost his teeth it might then be stuffed, he concluded. Putin told reporters gathered in Moscow that his country was ready to mediate in the Ukraine crisis, and he denied that Russians killed in Ukraine were members of his country's military. Western powers accuse Russia of sending troops and equipment to help separatists in eastern Ukraine in their fight against Ukrainian government forces. In April, violence broke out in two Ukrainian regions that border Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- as separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Moscow has voiced moral support for the rebels and sent aid convoys into the region, but it has repeatedly denied military involvement. In his end-of-year news conference, Putin said there had been ""a state coup and a military coup"" in Ukraine with which parts of that country had not agreed. He repeated the long-standing Russian line that any Russians killed in Ukraine were volunteers. Putin said he hoped the situation would still be solved through dialogue rather than military means or economic blockades that were ""harmful to the state of Ukraine, the people of Ukraine."" ""The Ukraine crisis must be solved, and the quicker the better,"" he said. A ceasefire deal was reached September 5 in Minsk, Belarus, after talks between representatives of Ukraine's government, Russia and rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. A subsequent agreement on September 19 in Minsk set out more measures. But fighting in Ukraine has since resumed, with a British security official last month telling CNN that the conflict had returned to levels that preceded the ceasefire. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko ""is striving towards a settlement of the Minsk agreement,"" Putin said. ""Our representatives in Minsk signed a memorandum, and the representatives of Donetsk did not sign that protocol -- that is what it's about."" ""The Ukrainian officials are not removing their troops from the Donetsk airport -- they are sitting there,"" Putin told reporters. ""The next step should be following up the Minsk agreement -- it is important that the Kiev authorities use all these agreements,"" he said. But he also said that if Ukraine wanted to restore its territorial integrity, ""it has to be open and honest."" 'We're not attacking anyone' Asked whether its economic problems were the price to pay for annexing Crimea, Putin said Russia was trying to maintain its sovereignty and independence. He said Russia's economic woes were partially due to sanctions imposed against it. Earlier, Putin said ""external economic factors"" provoked Russia's current situation. He cited oil prices, and he praised the Bank of Russia's intervention this week to defend the ruble. Asked to comment on suspicions in the West that he was returning Russia to a Cold War footing, Putin denied that his country was an aggressor. ""As far as our maneuvers and exercises of the military are concerned, you're saying that Russia has made a big contribution to the tensions in the world,"" he responded. ""Russia has only made a contribution where it is supporting its national interests. We're not attacking anyone; we're not warmongers."" Putin said Russia had stopped sending its aircraft on strategic flights in the 1990s and only resumed them in the last two or three years. The United States, he said, has continued its strategic flights despite the end of the Cold War. Furthermore, Russia has two military bases abroad. ""The American bases are throughout the globe, and you want to say we are the aggressors?"" he said. In addition, Putin said the Pentagon's defense budget was ""virtually 10 times more"" than Russia's. ""Are we extending the borders? Who is moving the borders of NATO forward -- the military infrastructure? Not us,"" the Russian President said. Putin added that Russia had not been the country to establish a missile defense system. ""Who were the ones who wanted to set up this system of global security? It was not us. This is a threat for us,"" he said. ""In Romania and Poland -- right next to us -- and you are saying we are carrying out this policy."" He said Russia wanted to develop normal international relations and work as a partner in the areas of security and combating terror, drugs, crime and infectious diseases such as Ebola. As Putin spoke, the Council of the European Union announced that further sanctions had been approved against Crimea and Sevastopol. ""This is to reinforce the EU's policy of not recognizing their illegal annexation by Russia and follows a conclusion by the Foreign Affairs Council of 17 November,"" it said in a statement. The measures would be applied starting Saturday, the European Union said. 'We will get through this period' In the final question of the more than three-hour conference, Putin was asked whether he took personal responsibility for Russia's economic issues and if he would stand in the 2018 presidential elections. He replied that it was too early to make a decision on running and said the economic responsibility was ""nothing I can take on alone, and I don't plan to."" Putin pointed to the ""responsibility of the central bank and different government bodies for the results of the work of each department for which they have responsibility."" He ended the conference on a positive note: ""We will get through this period. It's not easy, of course, but we will strengthen our position in the world economy,"" he said. ""The most important thing is to ensure social prosperity of people despite the cuts in income, the budget. And we can do that, we absolutely can.""","Vladimir Putin compares Russia to a bear trying to protect its forest .

"CINCINNATI, Ohio (CNN)  -- A conservative radio talk-show host said that ""he's had it up to here"" with Sen. John McCain after the GOP presidential candidate repudiated the commentator's remarks about Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama at a campaign event. ""John McCain threw me under a bus -- under the 'Straight Talk Express,' "" Bill Cunningham told CNN on Tuesday, referring to McCain's campaign bus. Earlier Tuesday, Cunningham spoke at a McCain campaign event in Cincinnati and called Obama a ""hack, Chicago-style Daley politician."" ""All is going to be right with the world when the great prophet from Chicago takes the stand, and the world leaders who want to kill us will simply be singing 'Kumbaya' around the table of Barack Obama,"" the commentator told the crowd. Cunningham, known for his flame-throwing style, repeatedly used Obama's middle name -- Hussein -- during his remarks, made as a warm-up for the audience waiting to hear McCain speak. In his first public comment since Tuesday's event, Cunningham defended his use of Hussein, which he called ""a proud Muslim name.""  Watch Cunningham sound off to CNN's John Roberts » . ""I have nothing but respect for my Muslim brothers and sisters,"" he said. ""The ones who oppose that particular name, they're the ones with the problem, not me. His name is Barack Hussein Obama."" The radio-show host also compared Clinton unfavorably to first lady Laura Bush during the rally.  Watch what was said at the Ohio rally » . McCain, who was not onstage as Cunningham spoke, said he was told about the ""disparaging remarks."" ""I absolutely repudiate such comments, and again I will take responsibility -- it will never happen again. It will never happen again,"" he said.  Watch McCain's reaction » . In a statement, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton said that McCain's remarks were appreciated: ""It is a sign that if there is a McCain-Obama general election, it can be intensely competitive, but the candidates will attempt to keep it respectful and focused on issues."" Cunningham said McCain ""ought to attack Democrats and quit attacking conservatives like me."" ""I, for one, regret that John McCain is the nominee of the conservative party,"" he said. McCain on Wednesday said his concern wasn't necessarily with what Cunningham said, but where he said it. ""I don't intend in any way to tell talk-show hosts or anyone else in America what they should say or not say. This is a country that people believe in free speech,"" McCain said. ""The reason why I had to repudiate that was because it was a campaign event associated with my campaign."" Cunningham told CNN that organizers in Cincinnati asked him to speak. ""They told me to fire up the crowd ... get them fired up and give them some red meat,"" he said. Local campaign workers confirmed Cunningham's account. Cunningham also disputed McCain's contention that the two had never met, saying he has met the senator twice. ""But I'm not going to meet him again. I've had it up to here with John McCain. I'm joining Ann Coulter in supporting Hillary Rodham Clinton,"" he said. McCain staffers said the senator does not recall meeting Cunningham, but it is possible that they may have done so briefly at an event. ""But does Sen. McCain know him? No,"" an aide said. McCain has drawn criticism from other conservative voices, including radio hosts Rush Limbaugh, Laura Ingraham, Hugh Hewitt and Lars Larson. The senator from Arizona has been at odds with some of the GOP's conservative base for his stance on immigration, support of campaign finance reform and his votes against President Bush's tax cuts. McCain has said he would make the Bush tax cuts permanent.  E-mail to a friend .

"The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee accused the CIA of secretly removing classified documents from her staff's computers in the middle of an oversight investigation, while another lawmaker said Congress should ""declare war"" on the spy agency if it's true. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said CIA Director John Brennan told her in January that agency personnel searched the computers last year because they believed the panel's investigators might have gained access to materials on an internal review they were not authorized to see. ""The CIA did not ask the committee or its staff if the committee had access to the internal review or how we obtained it,"" Feinstein said in blistering remarks on the Senate floor. ""Instead, the CIA just went and searched the committee's computer."" Feinstein said that she had ""grave concerns"" the search may have violated federal law regarding domestic spying as well as congressional oversight responsibilities under the Constitution. Opinion: Dianne Feinstein is no bomb thrower . ""I have asked for an apology and a recognition that this CIA search of computers used by its oversight committee was inappropriate. I have received neither,"" she said. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina called the allegations ""dangerous to a democracy,"" if it's substantiated that the CIA interfered with a congressional investigation. ""Heads should roll, people should go to jail, if it's true. ... I'm going to get briefed on it.  If it is, the legislative branch should declare war on the CIA, if it's true,"" Graham said. Feinstein's comments pushed into the public spotlight months of behind-the-scenes wrangling over access to and the review of documents around the post 9/11 Bush administration program for handling terror suspects. Brennan disputed Feinstein's claims relating to the committee's efforts to produce a comprehensive report on the practice that ultimately was ended by President Barack Obama in 2009. ""As far as the allegations of CIA hacking into Senate computers -- nothing could be further from the truth.  We wouldn't do that.  I mean that's, that's, that's  just beyond the scope of reason,"" Brennan told the Council on Foreign Relations. He also said that the CIA believes in congressional oversight and often has ""spirited"" conversations about agency techniques. ""We have made mistakes. More than a few. And we have tried mightily to learn from them,"" Brennan said. Brennan said in a statement last week that he was ""deeply dismayed"" that some members of the Senate have made ""spurious allegations about CIA actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama has ""great confidence"" in Brennan and the intelligence community. Carney would not comment on the specifics under review by the Justice Department but said Obama supported the committee's investigation. ""The President has made clear he seeks the declassification, the findings of that report when it is completed,"" he said. Justice Department asked to look into CIA/Senate dispute . The top Republican on the intelligence panel, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, said ""we have some disagreements"" on the facts and cautioned that improving the relationship with the CIA ""is not going to happen if we throw rocks at each other."" However, Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, called the allegations ""disturbing"" and added that ""a full and complete investigation"" is needed. He also stressed that he's ""never had a great deal of confidence with Mr. Brennan"" and therefore has ""no doubt about the politicization of Mr. Brennan,"" a former White House official. The Justice Department is looking at whether to launch an investigation involving the committee's review of millions of documents at a Virginia facility and counterclaims by the CIA about Intelligence Committee staffers gaining access to things they shouldn't have seen. Feinstein took issue with the CIA IG's referral of the case to the Justice Department as an attempt to intimidate the committee. She said committee staff ""did not hack into CIA computers to obtain these documents, as has been suggested in the press."" She said the documents were identified through a search tool provided by the CIA in order to select specific material, and that the pane would follow through with its report as planned. The CIA viewed the committee's accessing the internal review ordered by then-Director Leon Panetta as a breach and confronted committee members about it. The committee launched its full blown investigation after learning in an initial review that the CIA had ""withheld and destroyed information about its detention and interrogation program."" This, according to Feinstein, included its decision in 2005 to ""destroy interrogation videotapes over the objections of the Bush White House and the director of national intelligence.""","Senate Intelligence Committee chair says CIA action may have violated federal law .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House released copies of President Barack Obama's original long-form birth certificate Wednesday, seeking to put an end to persistent rumors that he was not born in the United States. The certificate states, as Obama's advisers have repeatedly said, that the president was born at Honolulu's Kapiolani Hospital on August 4, 1961. Doubters insist Obama was born overseas -- possibly in his father's home country of Kenya -- and may be constitutionally ineligible to serve as president. ""We do not have time for this kind of silliness,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""I've been puzzled at the degree to which this (story) just kept on going."" ""Normally I would not comment on something like this,"" the president said. But the country has ""some enormous challenges out there"" that it will not be able to effectively meet ""if we're distracted."" PDF: See a copy of the certificate . ""We're not going to be able to (meet those challenges) if we spend time vilifying each other,"" he stressed. ""We're not going to be able to do it if we just make stuff up and pretend that facts are not facts. We're not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers."" Obama released a shorter, legally binding ""certification of live birth"" in 2008, but failed to persuade members of the ""birther"" movement. The administration had to make a special request from the state of Hawaii to get the long-form certificate released, White House legal counsel Bob Bauer said. Typically, the state only releases the shorter, computer-generated live birth certification when people request such documentation. CNN investigation: Obama born in U.S. Obama's personal attorney, Judith Corley, picked up certified copies of the long-form document in Hawaii and brought them back to the White House Tuesday evening, Bauer noted. While the president has tried to make light of the controversy, the question has remained political red meat for some of his critics. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll showed that nearly 75% of Americans believe Obama was definitely or probably born in the United States. More than four in 10 Republicans, however, believe he probably or definitely was not born in America. The U.S. Constitution says only ""natural born"" citizens can become president -- a vague clause that followers of the birther movement contend disqualifies Obama from the presidency, since they believe he was born overseas. ""The president believed the distraction over his birth certificate wasn't good for the country,"" White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said. ""It may have been good politics and good (television), but it was bad for the American people and distracting from the many challenges we face as a country. ""At a time of great consequence for this country -- when we should be debating how we win the future, reduce our deficit, deal with high gas prices, and bring stability to the Middle East, Washington, D.C., was once again distracted by a fake issue,"" Pfeiffer said. ""The president's hope is that with this step, we can move on to debating the bigger issues that matter to the American people and the future of the country."" Pfeiffer told reporters that the birther debate has been politically damaging to the Republican Party. Regardless, the issue remains potent in GOP circles. Potential Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump recently seized on the issue, saying he had doubts about the president's background. Following the White House's release of the long-form certificate, Trump told reporters in New Hampshire that he is ""very proud"" of himself for helping to bring about the release of the document. Trump stands by ""birther"" claims . ""I've accomplished something nobody else was able to accomplish,"" Trump said. ""I'd want to look at (the birth certificate), but I hope it's true so that we can get on to much more important matters."" Obama ""should have (released the certificate) a long, long time ago,"" he said. Trump, a billionaire business tycoon and reality television star, blamed the media for repeatedly bringing up the issue. Trump, however, has frequently raised questions about Obama's birthplace during his climb in recent GOP primary polls. What's your take on the birth certificate release? Allegations that Obama was not born in the United States have been repeatedly discredited. A recent CNN investigation turned up no evidence to support the birther claims. ""This has long been a settled issue,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. The president acknowledged Wednesday that the release of the long-form certificate won't satisfy a ""segment of people for which, no matter what we put out, this issue will not be put to rest."" ""But I'm speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press,"" he said. ""We've got better stuff to do."" Later Wednesday, Obama told a New York fundraising event that ""part of what happened this morning was me trying to remind the press and trying to remind both parties that what we do in politics is not a reality show. ... It's serious.""","NEW: Obama says ""what we do in politics is not a reality show""

"Mexico's leader proposed a series of reforms Thursday that he hopes will help combat widespread crime and corruption. President Enrique Peña Nieto has come under fire for what some saw as his slow reaction to the disappearance of 43 college students, and for traveling abroad as protests spread across the country. In September, a group of students boarded buses and vans bound for the nearby city of Iguala, intending to protest about a lack of funding for their school. They have not been heard from since. ""After Iguala, Mexico must change,"" Peña Nieto told a group of politicians and lawmakers. He proposed more than a dozen reforms, including a constitutional change that would give the state control over local police. The plan would be worked out in stages, starting with the states of Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán and Tamaulipas, he said. The President also proposed setting up a nationwide emergency number, like 911 in the United States, and said he wants to boost development by creating three special economic zones in the country's impoverished south. Bodies found in southwestern Mexico . Peña Nieto spoke the same day authorities announced that 11 partially burned bodies of young adults have been found in southwestern Mexico, just an hour's drive from where 43 missing college students went to school. Police haven't publicly identified the remains, and officials have not said whether there is any connection between the bodies and the September disappearances of the 43 students -- a case that has led to unrest over allegations that police abducted them, on order of a mayor, and turned them over to a gang that killed them. The 11 bodies were discovered near Chilapa, about an hour's drive west of Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, a small college devoted to training students to become teachers in Mexico's impoverished countryside. Some of the 11 bodies were decapitated, according to Guerrero state officials. Search for students continues . Authorities say the 43 students intended to protest a speech by the wife of Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca. Prosecutors allege that Abarca ordered police to round up the students. Authorities say they believe the students were captured by Iguala police, turned over to a gang, and then executed in Cocula, 14 miles away. The gang burned the bodies and dumped them in a river, authorities say, but investigators have yet to link any remains to the missing students. Mexican prosecutors have called Abarca the ""probable mastermind"" in the disappearances, charging him with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide, authorities said. In all, at least 75 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances. Earlier this month, authorities investigating the case said human remains were found in at least one garbage bag in the San Juan River. Mexican Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said DNA tests were needed to identify the remains; no results have been announced. The Iguala incident sparked protests across Mexico, some of them violent. The governor of Guerrero state, who was criticized for not acting quickly enough after the abductions, has taken a leave of absence.","President Enrique Peña Nieto proposes giving the state control over local police .

"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- Hopes of finding trapped survivors dwindled Friday evening in Alabama, the epicenter of storms that obliterated neighborhoods and towns and claimed scores of lives across the South. Gov. Robert Bentley, speaking in Birmingham, said the long road to recovery will now begin. ""We've gotten past the rescue stage,"" Bentley said. ""We have begun the recovery stage."" Earlier Friday, President Barack Obama toured rubble-strewn neighborhoods in Tuscaloosa, declaring the devastation brought by a series of powerful storms and tornadoes was beyond anything he had ever seen. The storms killed at least 326 people in six states and left entire neighborhoods in ruins. Obama promised expedited federal aid to states affected by the tornadoes. Has the severe weather affected you? Share stories, photos and video with iReport. ""We're going to do everything we can to help these communities rebuild,"" he said. Wednesday's outbreak of severe weather brought what the National Weather Service categorized as a rare EF-5 tornado to one Mississippi town. And according to the weather service, it's possible another twister was on the ground for 200 miles from Mississippi through Alabama. The extent of the devastation became evident by Friday, when the death count in Marion County in northwest Alabama rose from three to 21, according to the state Emergency Management Agency. It said 20 people were missing. See hi-res photos of the devastation . Marion County Sheriff Kevin Williams put the number even higher -- 29 people dead in the city of Hackleburg and six in Hamilton. The Hackleburg fatalities included 16 on the scene and 13 who died at several hospitals, he told CNN. ""It's pretty much wiped out,"" Williams said of the town. ""It looks like a war zone."" The possible tornadoes destroyed a Wrangler clothing plant, a pharmacy, doctor's office and three schools, officials said. Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Virginia and Louisiana . Alabama suffered the greatest of loss of life, with fatalities in 19 counties confirmed by the state Emergency Management Agency. The agency reported Friday evening that the state's death toll had risen to at least 238. In Tuscaloosa, Obama's motorcade passed street after street of homes reduced to splinters, crushed and flipped cars, and widespread debris on the way to his first stop to visit with families affected by the storms that pounded the region Wednesday and Thursday. ""I've gotta say I've never seen devastation like this,"" Obama told reporters. Tuscaloosa city officials reported 45 deaths as of Friday afternoon, but later revised that to 39 because of a counting error. That change was not immediately reflected in the state's total. People's lives have just been turned upside down . Nearly 450 people were unaccounted for Friday afternoon in the city, although they were not necessarily missing. The president's visit took place as emergency responders in Alabama and five other states continued to assess the damage wreaked by one of the worst outbreaks of violent weather in the southeastern United States in decades, experts said. The storms leveled neighborhoods, rendered major roads impassable and left nearly 800,000 customers still without power Friday evening. CNN iReporter Stephen Bozek, a broadcast news major at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, snapped a photo of a U.S. flag affixed to an overturned vehicle. ""The neighborhood is torn to pieces and the flag flying represented the unity (of) this town,"" Bozek wrote. In Mississippi, where 34 were confirmed dead, Gov. Haley Barbour told reporters that some people remain unaccounted for and rescuers could still find bodies in the rubble or in the waters surrounding Smithville, where 14 of the state's known death's occurred. He said the city was a scene of ""utter obliteration."" On Friday, the National Weather Service said the tornado that struck Smithville on Wednesday was an EF-5 storm with peak winds of 205 mph. The last such tornado recorded in the United States struck May 25, 2008, in Parkersburg, Iowa. The scene at Tuscaloosa's 'Ground Zero' The tornado, the Weather Service said, destroyed 18 homes, a post office, a police station and a water treatment system. In addition to the 14 deaths, it caused 40 injuries, the weather service said. Obama issued a federal disaster declaration for seven Mississippi counties. The storms also left 34 people dead in Tennessee, 15 in Georgia, five in Virginia and one in Arkansas. In Alabama, emergency management officials said Friday that 35 teams have been deployed to Tuscaloosa and six other counties hit hardest by the storms to assist in recovery efforts. Officials also warned Tennessee motorists not to cross the Alabama state line without filling up their tanks first. Widespread power outages and devastation from the storms have likely rendered functioning gas stations in northern Alabama hard to find, according to a statement released by officials in both states. The storms cut swaths of death and destruction along U.S. Highway 72 in northern Alabama and Interstate 59 from Tuscaloosa County to the northeastern corner of the state. Tuscaloosa Mayor Walter Maddox said at least one strong tornado swept through the city, leaving dozens of roads impassable and destroying hundreds of homes and businesses. ""It literally obliterated blocks and blocks of the city,"" Maddox said. The city remained under a curfew for Friday night that was scheduled to expire at 6 a.m. Saturday. City officials early Friday also advised Tuscaloosa residents who live south of the Black Warrior River and east of McFarland Boulevard to boil their tap water. Obama had signed a disaster declaration for Alabama, which enables storm victims and damaged businesses in eight counties to seek federal aid. Outbreak could set tornado record, experts say . Such aid will be critical, Birmingham Mayor William Bell told CNN affiliate WBMA. ""It's beyond our local resources so we're going to have to get the federal government involved,"" Bell said. ""The president assured us that he would do that."" The storms are being compared to the ""super outbreak"" of tornadoes on April 3 and 4, 1974, Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator, said Thursday. In that period, 148 tornadoes were reported in 13 states, and 330 people died. States affected were Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.","Alabama town ""looks like a war zone""

"Ezequiel Mora's voice trembled as he revealed the news. Investigators used DNA testing from a bone fragment to confirm that they'd found his 19-year-old son's remains in a plastic bag, he told CNN en Español. ""They gave me the news that my son is now ... he is now dead,"" Mora said. Alexander Mora Venancio, the youngest of eight siblings, was one of 43 students from a rural teacher's college in Mexico's Guerrero state who went missing on September 26. Authorities have said they believe the students' remains were burned at a landfill, then placed inside plastic bags and thrown into a river. But so far, Alexander Mora's remains are the only ones that have been identified. For weeks, his family has been pushing for answers about the students' whereabouts. Alexander's friends from school have donated money to help them as they wait for a response, his father told CNNMexico. ""Everyone comes and gives me their support ... but now no one is going to return him to me,"" he said. Federal authorities say they heard confessions from drug traffickers indicating that the college students were rounded up on the orders of a local mayor and then delivered to the drug gang to be murdered. Mounting fury over government officials' response to -- and possible role in -- the students' disappearance has fueled demonstrations across the country. At a protest in Mexico City on Saturday night, a group of parents said the search for the rest of the group is not over, despite the announcement. ""My son, wherever you are, I'll keep looking for you, even if my heart is breaking by the news,"" one father said. Felipe de la Cruz, a spokesman for the students' families, said they received confirmation of Alexander Mora's death Friday from Argentine forensic experts who are working on behalf of the families. But he said the families still believe the remaining students are alive. ""If these murderers think that with a DNA match of one of our boys, we are going to stop and cry, we want to tell them that they have been mistaken, that after today, this day of action will continue until we find the remaining 42 alive,"" he said. At a news conference Sunday, Mexican Attorney General Jesús Murillo Karam confirmed that Alexander Mora's remains had been found. He showed images of the garbage dump and the river, read from a detailed DNA analysis from scientists at Austria's Innsbruck University and vowed that the investigation would keep going. ""Based on my own conviction and the orders of the President, we're going to continue with this investigation until we detain all the culprits,"" Murillo said. So far, 44 police officers have been arrested inthe case, and authorities are searching for 16 others, he said. Authorities have accused Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca of being the ""probable mastermind"" in the students' disappearance. He's been charged with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide and is now being held in a federal prison, authorities said. In all, at least 80 people have been arrested in the disappearances and the deaths, and the governor of Guerrero has taken a leave of absence amid scorching criticism that he responded too slowly to what's been called one of the most serious human rights abuses in recent Latin American history. Families of the missing students have said for weeks that they don't accept the official version and demand proof of what happened. This weekend, Alexander Mora's cousin told CNN en Español that she was unconvinced by the DNA match. ""I don't believe he's dead,"" she said. ""What about the rest of them?

"Gov. Martin O'Malley will sign into law Thursday a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in Maryland, making it the seventh state to do so. ""All children deserve the opportunity to live in a loving, caring, committed, and stable home, protected equally under the law,"" O'Malley said in a statement after the vote. The Maryland House of Delegates approved the measure less than two weeks after Washington legislators voted to legalize same-sex marriage. That measure will take effect in the summer if it survives a likely court challenge. Six states and the District of Columbia already issue same-sex marriage licenses -- Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont. Five states -- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- allow civil unions that provide rights similar to marriage. New Jersey lawmakers approved same-sex marriage this month, but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed the legislation. He has said voters should decide the issue in a statewide referendum. Voters in North Carolina and Minnesota, meanwhile, will consider proposals in May and November, respectively, to ban gay marriage in those states. New Hampshire lawmakers may also consider a repeal of its same-sex marriage law, according to the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage. Lawsuits seeking to expand civil unions or turn back laws banning same-sex marriages are working through the courts in at least 12 states, including Hawaii, Minnesota and California, the organization said. Same-sex marriage became a national issue in 1993, after the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that a ban on same-sex marriages violated the state constitution. Legislation was introduced recently to allow same-sex marriages in Illinois, and bills from 2011 remain technically active in Hawaii and Minnesota, said Jack Tweedie of the National Council of State Legislatures. It's unclear whether any will see significant action, he said. An effort is also underway to put a proposal to legalize same-sex marriage on the November ballot in Maine, where voters previously overturned a 2009 state law authorizing same-sex marriage. In California, meanwhile, a federal appeals court recently ruled against a voter-passed referendum that outlawed same-sex marriage. It said such a ban was unconstitutional and singled out gays and lesbians for discrimination. The case appears to be eventually headed to the U.S. Supreme Court.","When the bill is signed, Maryland will be the eighth state to allow same-sex marriage .

"It's a long road to recovery for Spanish nurse's assistant Teresa Romero Ramos. Discharged from hospital six weeks ago after beating Ebola, she faces life without her beloved dog, Excalibur, put down by Spanish authorities for fear he might harbor the deadly virus. And questions remain about how she contracted the virus while helping to care for Spanish missionaries brought back from West Africa with Ebola, and the way her own case was handled. Romero was in court Thursday to seek 150,000 euros in damages from the then-Madrid health minister she accuses of blaming her for catching the disease. He publicly apologized for the comments and later resigned. She is also taking legal action against regional health authorities over the death of Excalibur. Speaking to CNN from Madrid, in her only global TV interview since leaving hospital, Romero became tearful as she recounted how she learned her adored dog had been put down. ""Due to my serious illness, no one was telling me what was happening in the outside world,"" she said. Unbeknownst to her, locked away in a hospital isolation room, animal rights activists had campaigned to prevent the dog's euthanasia, with an online petition gathering more than 400,000 signatures. But their efforts failed. Can pets get or spread Ebola? Finally, on the day Romero received a negative blood test for Ebola, her husband Javier Limon broke the news in a phone call to her room. ""My husband decided to wait in order to tell me about it and to me it was a very sad piece of news, totally unexpected. I haven't got words to talk about it,"" she said, her emotion obvious. It was probably better not to tell her while she was ill, she said, but the loss still affects her today. ""I've forgotten about everything except the death of Excalibur -- not the death itself, but the way in which this was done without finding out first whether the dog was infected,"" she said. ""I think it would've been much wiser to put the dog in quarantine and keep an eye on it, rather than to sacrifice the dog like that."" This was what happened in the case of Texas nurse Nina Pham, whose dog Bentley was quarantined while she was treated for Ebola. After testing negative for the virus, the pet was eventually returned, tail wagging, to its grateful owner. Romero: Experience was surreal . It was ""easier"" for the Madrid authorities to have her dog put down, Romero said, but it made what was already a traumatic situation for her far harder. And she still asks herself why it had to be that way. ""It's a lack of sensitivity, a lack of human feelings, it's really nasty, nasty. Everything has been this way, but we forget about everything except the death of my dog."" The ""everything"" Romero refers to relates to the way her infection with Ebola was first diagnosed and then handled. After she was taken to the Alcorcon Hospital in Madrid by ambulance, suffering symptoms including vomiting and a rash, she underwent a battery tests. But such was the apparent state of confusion, she said, that she found out she'd been confirmed as having Ebola not from medical staff -- but by seeing the news story on her cell phone. ""It is surreal, nobody tells you anything and they come and put you inside a bubble and they take you away. And they didn't tell you anything. It is really odd."" She said she later found out that the emergency room doctor who first treated her was not informed about her two positive blood tests either. ""Surprising as it is, this is how it happened,"" she said. ""No doctor told me about it, nobody told me anything about it, nothing. I think that they were going crazy. This took us all aback."" CNN is seeking comment from the Spanish Health Ministry over Romero's allegation that news that she had tested positive for Ebola was given to the press before she found out. It's still not clear how this leak transpired. 'You think about it' Meanwhile, Madrid's superior court has already ruled once on the case of Excalibur -- saying that regional health officials did not act recklessly in putting him down. But Romero's legal team is planning to take them to court again, seeking 150,000 euros compensation for his death. She also wants to see a change in the official protocols for caring for suspected Ebola cases so others don't undergo the same ordeal. This could include recording the medical staff as they work so any errors in taking off the protective gear could be spotted and lessons learned, according to Romero. She says she still does not know how she herself contracted the virus -- and likely never will. ""I followed the protocols. I followed the guidelines. I did everything that needs to be done,"" she said. ""What you are doing is something so serious, you are risking your life every time you walk into a room -- so you think about it."" Last month, the hospital's Director General Dr. Rafael Perez-Santamarina, said that through Romero's case, the hospital had learned many lessons about the treatment of Ebola patients and how to protect staff caring for them. Romero said she was not yet completely physically recovered from the virus -- which has killed more than 6,000 people in West Africa -- but was slowly getting better. Meanwhile, her anger and grief over Excalibur's fate continues to burn strongly. ""If I had known about the killing of the dog, I would never have volunteered"" to care for the Spanish missionaries, she said.","Teresa Romero Ramos is suing Madrid regional authorities for putting down her dog .

"Although it's been in the works -- and riled alarmists (Whoopi Goldberg had some choice words to share back in May) -- for a while, New York City's ""Latch On NYC"" initiative, which will be put into practice in 27 of the city's 40 hospitals beginning on September 2, has caught a recent wave of inflammatory flack among various 'news' sources, mom bloggers, and more. NYC's Mayor Bloomberg announced the initiative shortly after the AAP released its new breastfeeding recommendations, which cite an ever-growing body of data supporting breastfeeding's benefits to babies, moms, and the economy, and stressed hospitals' important role in this picture. His initiative also followed the public appeal of dozens of consumer and health organizations, to hospitals, to stop doling out corporate formula swag bags to every new mom they discharge. Breastfeeding's health benefits are indisputable, as are its dismal rates among American moms. Parenting.com: 15 toddler superfoods . On the up-side, however, studies have shown repeatedly that exposure to information about breastfeeding increases moms' desire to give it a whirl. And early, hands-on support (followed by a supportive workplace and public sphere) helps make it really happen. Since US health officials hope to almost double the nursing count by 2020, hospitals seem like the logical place to start. It surprises me that Latch On NYC has received such vocal criticism. And frankly, much of the recent criticism is based more in the alleged ""Breastfeeding Debates"" and their crossfire than in, you know, reality. More on that in a minute. First, here's the Latch On NYC Plan: In addition to a pro-breastfeeding public transport poster campaign (not the first in the country by any means), voluntarily complying hospitals will: . - Enforce the New York State hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula unless medically indicated and documented on the infant's medical chart- Limit access to infant formula by hospital staff- Discontinue the distribution of promotional or free infant formula- Prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula advertising or promotional materials in any hospital location . What this means is:Nurses must document the dispensing of formula to new moms, citing a medical reason for its necessity. I.e. nurses will need to actually talk with new moms, and provide them with information and support in trying to breastfeed before they hand out formula. Given the difficulty I had in getting any breastfeeding support after my NYC hospital delivery, I would have welcomed some policy backing my requests. But for new moms who just plain don't want to breastfeed, this definitely represents a change of tides... not by much, though. No one will be forced to breastfeed if they truly don't want to, obviously. Parenting.com: Best cities for families . This policy provides an official way to hold hospitals accountable, rather than to condemn women's choices. In fact, the initiative clearly states that ""Mothers who decide to formula feed and cannot afford formula will be referred to WIC (Women, Infants and Children), a food and nutrition program for low-income families."" I.e. the government is still giving out free formula to those who want to feed it to their babies but can't afford to buy it. This is hardly an anti-formula-feeding campaign. (But it definitely is a pro-breastfeeding one). Next up, limiting formula access means only that there'll be an extra step between a mom delivering her baby and a nurse handing her formula. Namely, the mom will need to ask for it. Again, I read this as a way to hold hospitals accountable for attending to each patient personally. Finally, Discontinuing corporate swag (promotional materials and actual formula) is a big deal, and a huge step. Karol Markowicz's (of the New York Post) opinion that ""a mother isn't going to choose to feed her baby formula because she got a free lanyard or tote bag"" notwithstanding, the fact is that corporations are, by definition, the opposite of charitable organizations; they vie for access to new moms in-hospital because, a) brand loyalty is not to be underestimated, and b) mothers assume hospitals have their patients' (i.e. the moms and babies they care for) best interests at heart. Parenting.com: 36 tips for breastfeeding success . So if a given formula is provided -- along with ""informational literature"" -- actually IN the hospital, that formula must be, by affiliation, a baby's-best-interest choice. (It's a subconscious, logical conclusion.) Of course babies can, and do, thrive on formula, but there's no debate in the medical field as to breast milk's nutritional superiority. By providing education and support around breastfeeding, and removing formula manufacturers from the picture, hospitals are actually operating with increased professional integrity; they are actually providing the best possible care to patients. And in some cases, this will mean providing formula to babies... Is it really so horrible that this won't come with a bunch of PR from Nestle? No.As far as the controversy and crossfire is concerned, the Post's Karol Markowicz, despite her anything-but-objective objections to the initiative, made one apt, if obnoxiously-presented, point in her critique. Lisa Paladino, of Staten Island University Hospital, had been quoted in this other Post article, explaining that under the new system, a nurse will need to sign out each bottle of formula issued. Markowicz writes, ""Perhaps Paladino has never been around a hungry infant, but she should anticipate a cacophony of screams while perpetually understaffed hospitals find nurse's aides to sign out formula like it's morphine."" While her analogy is rather unhinged, her point about understaffing is important; I was really kind of freaked out, post-delivery, by how little the nurses seemed to care for -- or even check on --  my well-being. When the 'nurse button' proved pointless, I ended up hobbling down the hallway, barefoot, in search of a glass of drinking water. I was, meanwhile, nervous about my own abilities with a newborn, and the lack of nurse oversight made me afraid that if my baby needed something while with me in my room (something even more urgent than breastfeeding support, which definitely wasn't forthcoming), there wouldn't be a good way to get medical help... In a hospital. Yeah. I know my breastfeeding experience -- and entire post-delivery experience -- would have been improved with better post-natal care, along with one-on-one breastfeeding help. Bloomberg's initiative, along with the recent research pointing to the crucial role that hospitals play in breastfeeding success, will hopefully motivate hospitals to equip themselves with adequate nursing staffs in order to really attend to helping new moms get their bearings -- around breastfeeding, and otherwise. If they don't, this plan could backfire. But if they do, and it succeeds, it could prove to be a positive model for hospitals to follow, nation-wide. Parenting.com: The most awkward pregnancy photos ever . For her part, Markowicz has little else to offer. She dubs Bloomberg's initiative an ""anti-formula crusade"" and writes that breastfeeding hardly needs a policy-backed boost, stating, ""a mere 50 years ago, 75 percent of American infants were using formula; breastfeeding was the odd way to feed a child."" True, but fifty years ago -- 1962 -- was not exactly a progressive time in American history, particularly for women and babies: Thalidomide for morning sickness? Twilight Sleep births? Hello? Markowicz has cited the least natural point in mainstream American birth practices as a way to ostensibly 'naturalize' formula feeding's prime place in our hospitals today. It's a flimsy argument, and a strange respose to a (voluntary) change in policy here in 2012.Those who are kicking up (badly-written, and poorly supported) dust around Latch On NYC are fueling negativity for its own sake, as well as divisiveness for the sake of attention (and page views, which add up to advertising sales). Let's not get sucked in. At the end of the day, the post-delivery hospital stay is, under normal circumstances, quite brief. A couple of days won't keep formula-minded moms from feeding their babies formula. But it can make all the difference in getting moms who want to breastfeed onto a successful track. And greater numbers of successfully breastfeeding babies will make for a healthier population of babies, and moms, overall. This is a fact. This is why Bloomberg jumped in to this incredibly controversial territory -- breastfeeding issues and corporate interests in health care (wow, double-whammy) -- in the first place. Getting swept up in demonizing him, or in any uproar around this new policy, distracts from what the initiative really means for new moms (more support) and for hospitals (step it up).It's going to be okay! It's not 1962 anymore. What do you think of the Latch On NYC initiative?

"Gays hoping to join the Boy Scouts will have to wait until at least May after the organization's executive board put off a vote on lifting its outright ban on openly homosexual scouts and troop leaders. The board had been expected to vote Wednesday on a proposal to let local groups set their own policies, but said instead that it needs more time to get comment on the issue from its members. ""After careful consideration and extensive dialogue within the Scouting family, along with comments from those outside the organization, the volunteer officers of the Boy Scouts of America's National Executive Board concluded that due to the complexity of this issue, the organization needs time for a more deliberate review of its membership policy,"" the board said in a written statement. The decision will now be made at the organization's annual meeting in May. About 1,400 members of the group's national council will take part during that gathering, the board said. In the meantime, the organization will ""further engage representatives of Scouting's membership and listen to their perspectives and concerns."" Opinion: Ban on gays hurts Scouting . The decision disappointed critics who had hoped to see the organization end its ban despite a 2000 Supreme Court ruling saying it had the right to keep it. ""Every day that the Boy Scouts of America delay action is another day that discrimination prevails,"" said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin. ""Now is the time for action. Young Americans, gay and straight, are hurt by the inaction associated with today's news. The BSA leadership should end this awful policy once and for all, and open the proud tradition of Scouting to all."" Others hope the delay will provide time to lobby the Boy Scouts to scrap the plan. ""This issue is not a gay rights issue,"" said Utah scout leader Eric Montague. ""It's a gender attraction issue and it's also a politics issue. As a local scout leader, I don't need to worry about gay rights -- that shouldn't be my role; that shouldn't be what I do.  And to push that decision upon me is not the best way to go."" Conservative groups and some religious organizations have argued against making any change, saying it would dilute the Boy Scout message of morality and potentially destroy the organization. The Boy Scouts announced last month that the organization would consider changing the policy, a sharp reversal of its previous support for excluding openly gay members and scout leaders. The new policy would allow local leaders to decide ""consistent with each organization's mission, principles or religious beliefs"" whether to open troops they sponsor to openly gay people, the group said in a statement at the time. The proposal comes more than a decade after a Supreme Court ruling that found the organization has the right to keep gays out, but also amid declining participation in the venerable American institution. Membership in Boy Scouts has declined by about a third since 1999. About 2.7 million people now participate in scouting nationwide, with more than 70% of troops affiliated with a church or religious groups. The organization has also endured frequent criticism from gay rights groups and other critics who say the Boy Scouts should not endorse discrimination. Activists hail a watershed moment in gay rights movement . Among more recent controversies, the organization came under fire last year after Jennifer Tyrrell, an Ohio den leader, was dismissed by her local Boy Scout officials for being a lesbian. On Tuesday, Tyrell delivered a petition she said was signed by 1.4 million people supporting the change. Before Wednesday's announcement of the delay, she said she was looking forward to the change, but added it would not go far enough. ""If this ban is lifted, it's a great first step,"" she said Wednesday on CNN's ""Starting Point."" ""But it's still going to lead to kids being rejected. Families are still going to be turned away."" Brandy Pryde, a troop leader who participated in a prayer vigil outside the Boy Scouts headquarters Wednesday, said her church would pull support from scouting if the change goes through. ""What happens when we go camping and there's units that allow gays and homosexuals and there's units that don't, how are we going to keep them separated from those units and how are we going to instill in our kids Christian values and the biblical truth if that's allowed in our program?"" she said. A poll released Monday suggests the public is in favor of lifting the ban. The poll, conducted January 30 to February 4 by Quinnipiac University, found 55% of respondents favored lifting the ban. The school said 33% were opposed. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points. President Barack Obama, who is honorary president of the national organization by virtue of his office, also supports opening troops to everyone. On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the administration had no comment on the Boy Scouts decision. ""You know that the president believes the Boy Scouts is a valuable organization that has helped educate and build character in American boys for more than a century,"" Carney said. ""He also, as you know, opposes discrimination in all forms. And as such, believes -- as he said just on Sunday -- that gay Americans ought to be able to participate in the Boy Scouts. But in terms of the process of their evaluation of their policies, I don't have a comment."" Conservative politicians and religious leaders have said that changing the policy would dilute the organization's voice and mission. Scouting goes through a rough patch . Some, including former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, have argued the change could destroy scouting. Richard Land of the Southern Baptist Convention said the change could be a ""catastrophe."" ""What they've said to us and to other religious leaders is that they are doing this under pressure, and we're going to give people what basically amounts to a local option,"" Land said. ""You can't have a local option of a core conviction."" Changing the policy against having openly gay leaders or Scouts ""would be a grave mistake,"" the conservative Family Research Council and dozens of other groups said in a half-page ad in USA Today this week. The message called on the Boy Scouts to ""show courage"" and ""stand firm for timeless values."" ""Every American who believes in freedom of thought and religious liberty should be alarmed by the attacks upon the Boy Scouts, who have had core convictions about morality for 100 years,"" the ad said. ""Every Scout takes an oath to keep himself 'morally straight.' The Boy Scouts have every right to include sexual conduct in how they define that term."" But others say scouting is suffering because of its policy on gays, not despite it. Eagle Scout Zach Wahls, founder of Scouts for Equality, says the ban has backfired. When he was 10, Wahls' Cub Scout pack had to find a new home because the Boy Scouts of America's policy violated the nondiscrimination rule of the school district that hosted it. ""I was confused, because my den mother, Jackie -- who is my actual mother -- was a lesbian, and nobody in our unit had any issue with that,"" Wahls wrote. The pack managed to find another sponsor -- a nearby church -- but ""some parents pulled their kids from the pack, uncomfortable with entrusting their sons to an organization they believed engaged in discrimination.""","""This issue is not a gay rights issue,"" Utah scout leader who opposes change says .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- The death toll on both sides of the Gaza battle jumped Monday, as Palestinian officials reported scores more killed and Israel announced seven more soldiers died -- including several on Israeli soil. About 576 Palestinians have been killed, Gaza Health Ministry officials said. It's unknown how many were militants, but the United Nations has estimated that 70% are civilians. Israel has reported dozens of terrorists killed by its forces. In total, 27 Israeli soldiers have died, including three believed killed by friendly fire. Nine of the soldiers were killed Monday. Four were on Israeli soil, killed as a result of infiltration by Hamas operatives, the Israel Defense Forces said. Two of the soldiers who died over the weekend were dual Israeli-American citizens: California native Max Steinberg and Sean Carmeli, from South Padre Island, Texas, the U.S. State Department said. Two Israeli civilians have also been killed. Israel's Iron Dome defense system helps protect its residents from missile attacks. Gaza hospital shelled . The Shuhada Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza was hit by shelling, leaving five people dead -- one patient and four relatives, the Gaza Health Ministry said. Hamas TV showed upper floors damaged. Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni told CNN that the reports of hospital shelling are being questioned, ""and we will make all the facts found public."" The Israel Defense Forces said an initial investigation shows that a cache of missiles was stored in the immediate vicinity of the hospital and was targeted. ""Civilian casualties are a tragic inevitability of the brutal and systematic exploitation of homes, hospitals and mosques in Gaza,"" the IDF said. ""While the IDF takes every possible measure to minimize civilian casualties, Hamas and its deliberate tactic of embedding terrorist activities within the urban environment is ultimately responsible."" Israel also blames Hamas for other civilian deaths in Gaza, noting that the group has encouraged people to stay in their homes despite repeated warnings from Israel in advance of airstrikes. But some Palestinians have said they feared that even if they left they could face the same violence anywhere in Gaza. More than 83,000 Palestinians have taken refuge in U.N. facilities. ""Nobody is safe and nobody can flee anywhere because everywhere is targeted,"" said Enas Sisisalem, a mother of two who lives in the al-Remal neighborhood of Gaza City. ""When we hear the shelling my kids will cry."" Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti accused the Israeli government of ""acting in a criminal way."" ""What happened in Gaza during the past 10 days is nothing but a massacre,"" he told CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""This has to stop."" Israeli kindergarten struck . A rocket fired from Gaza struck a kindergarten, which was empty at the time, in the Israeli town of Sha'ar Hanegev, the IDF said. More than 2,000 rockets have been fired at Israel since the start of Operation Protective Edge, it said. Hamas said Monday it had killed Israeli soldiers in an ambush and that the Hamas fighters were uninjured. It also said it successfully targeted Israeli troops in several places. Israel killed more than 10 Hamas terrorists who entered the country through tunnels ""to attack two different kibbutzim,"" or communal areas, ""where farmers are trying to conduct their daily lives,"" government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN. ""We will see Hamas come out of this substantially weakened, their arsenal of dangerous weapons diminished,"" Regev vowed Monday in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""They will understand they can't shoot at our people with impunity."" In a meeting late Sunday, U.N. Security Council members expressed ""serious concern about the growing number of casualties,"" according to the body's president, Ambassador Eugene-Richard Gasana of Rwanda. And as the bloodshed continued Monday, U.S. President Barack Obama announced that he has instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to ""push for an immediate cessation of hostilities."" Kerry arrived in Cairo on Monday and said the United States would provide $47 million in humanitarian assistance to Gaza. The talks should focus on a return to the Gaza-Israel cease-fire agreement of November 2012, the President said at the White House. ""We don't want to see any more"" civilian deaths in Gaza or Israel, he said. Hamas speaking with other countries, not Egypt . Israel has slammed Hamas for refusing to consider a cease-fire proposal made by Egypt last week. Senior Hamas political figure Izzat Risheq in Qatar told CNN on Monday that Hamas is not speaking directly with Egypt, but several other nations are involved: Turkey, Qatar, and Kuwait. Hamas political leader Khaled Meshaal traveled from Qatar to Kuwait on Sunday, Risheq said. Hamas postponed a scheduled news conference, at which Meshaal was going to speak, due to ongoing talks, Risheq said. Kerry told CNN on Sunday the United States has ""shown our willingness to try to deal with the underlying issues,"" but Hamas ""must step up and show a level of reasonableness."" ""No country, no human being, is comfortable with children being killed, with people being killed, but we're not comfortable with Israeli soldiers being killed either, or with people being rocketed in Israel,"" he said. While steadfastly supportive of Israel in public comments, Kerry appeared to let slip some frustration when caught on an open microphone between television interviews Sunday. After one of his deputies mentioned the latest number of Palestinian casualties, Kerry was heard to say, ""It's a hell of a pinpoint operation."" Obama spoke Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the second call in three days. Obama reiterated U.S. condemnation of Hamas attacks against Israel ""and reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself,"" the White House said in a statement. Obama also ""raised serious concern about the growing number of casualties, including increasing Palestinian civilian deaths in Gaza and the loss of Israeli soldiers."" UN: 'Massive' airlift under way . The United Nations is sending supplies into Gaza in what Chris Gunness, spokesman for the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, described as a ""massive humanitarian airlift."" ""In the coming days, more airlifts are scheduled to arrive in Amman, from where (the U.N. agency) will truck the aid into Gaza for distribution,"" he said on Twitter. The IDF, meanwhile, tweeted, ""While Hamas continues its attacks, tons of goods are reaching Palestinians in Gaza from Israel,"" including 148 trucks of food and medical supplies. Israeli soldier captured? Hamas said Sunday it had captured an Israeli soldier. ""He is a prisoner, and if Zionists lie about the dead and wounded, then the fate of this soldier is their responsibility,"" Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida said. Gunfire and cheers erupted in Gaza in apparent celebration of the soldier's capture. Israel's ambassador to the United Nations later disputed that claim. ""There's no kidnapped Israeli soldier, and those rumors are untrue,"" Ron Prosor said. But Monday morning, the Israeli government said it was unsure. ""It could just be Hamas bravado. We're looking into it,"" Regev said. ""We don't underestimate Hamas. Hamas has built a formidable military machine. We see that with these rockets that they can shoot at the center of our country -- at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. That network of tunnels under the Gaza Strip, there's a whole subterranean terror world there in Gaza. Some of those can go into Israel and pop up on our side of the frontier with arms, with explosives and can cause murder and mayhem on our side. So we take the Hamas threat very seriously."" If the claim is true, it will be ""a game changer immediately because it's going to change what the Israelis are doing on the ground in that sector. They're going to be looking for him,"" said CNN military analyst Lt. Col. Rick Francona. But, he added, ""overall, the Israeli strategy is not going to change. They're committed to this mission."" In 2006, Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was captured. He was released some five years later in exchange for more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Hezbollah reaches out to Hamas . The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah reached out to Hamas to express its support Monday. Hassan Nasrallah, the group's secretary-general, spoke with Hamas political chief Khaled Meshaal, who lives in Qatar. Nasrallah ""praised the steadfastness of the resisters and their creativeness in the battlefield, the enormous patience of the wronged people of Gaza and their stand behind their resistance,"" according to a CNN translation of a Hezbollah statement. Nasrallah also spoke with Ramadan Shallah, head of Islamic Jihad, another Palestinian militant group, the statement said. Shallah is one of the FBI's most wanted terrorists. CNN's Karl Penhaul and Ian Lee reported from Gaza City, Josh Levs and Ali Younes from Atlanta and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr called on followers to stop shooting and cooperate with Iraqi security forces Sunday, a move Iraq's government praised as a step toward ending six days of fighting that has left hundreds dead. A Shiite fighter runs toward an Iraqi Army armored vehicle Sunday after clashes near a TV station in Basra. ""We announce our disavowal from anyone who carries weapons and targets government institutions, charities and political party offices,"" al-Sadr said in a nine-point statement issued by his headquarters in Najaf. The statement was accompanied by demands that the Iraqi government issue a general amnesty to his followers and release any being held. The statement was distributed across Iraq and posted on the Internet. The move was welcomed by Iraq's government, whose forces have been fighting al-Sadr's militia, the Mehdi Army, in six days of clashes with so-called ""outlaws"" who had taken control of much of the southern city of Basra. U.S. and coalition troops have been supporting the Iraqi offensive. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who had vowed not to leave Basra until his government reclaimed control of the city, called al-Sadr's statement a ""step in the right direction"" and said he hoped it would help to stabilize the region. ""We renew our assurance that the process of enforcement [of] the law in Basra does not target any political or religious group, including the Sadr movement,"" al-Maliki said in a prepared statement. Witnesses reported continued clashes throughout the day in Basra even after Sunday's announcements. But Iraqi authorities said after al-Sadr's announcement they would lift an indefinite curfew that had been imposed on Baghdad since Thursday.  Watch how the cease-fire affects Shiite vs. Shiite fights » . The curfew is scheduled to be lifted 6 a.m. Monday (11 p.m. Sunday ET), said Gen. Qassim Atta, an Iraqi military spokesman. But a vehicle ban will stay in place in three Shiite militia strongholds -- neighborhoods in the capital, including Sadr City, Kadhimiya and Shulaa, Atta said. A curfew that was imposed on Basra was lifted Saturday. Al-Sadr's statement came after what an aide described as direct talks between al-Sadr's representatives and the Iraqi government in Najaf that started Saturday night. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh denied there were talks with al-Sadr's representatives, directly or indirectly. But speaking on Iraqi state TV, al-Dabbagh said ""A large number of people will listen to Muqtada al-Sadr's call."" ""Life will return to all of Iraq as before,"" he said. ""The statement is positive and responsive; we as the government of Iraq believe this effort will be in the common interest and help the security efforts that the government is working to achieve."" Death tolls are difficult to obtain, but reports from Iraqi and coalition authorities suggest more than 400 people have died since fighting began Tuesday. The fighting has been heaviest in Basra, Iraq's second-largest city and major oil port, and a U.S. military analysis of the battle indicated the government push was not going as well as American officials had hoped, several U.S. officials said Friday. In Washington, CIA Director Michael Hayden told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" Sunday that about 70 percent of Basra was under the control of ""criminal elements"" when the assault was launched. Though the increase in violence was disappointing, he said, the government assault ""was something that we all knew we had to go through."" ""This was inevitable. This had to be resolved. You just can't have the second major city in the country -- economically, the most important city in the country -- beyond the control of the government,"" Hayden said. Top U.S. officials, including President Bush, have praised al-Maliki's operation as a sign of a strengthening Iraqi government. But Hayden and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the Iraqis did not consult them before launching their offensive. ""We'll see how well the Iraqi army fought. We'll see how well it was planned and executed. And we may find that the Iraqi army did not do a very good job of planning and executing this effort,"" Graham, a Senate colleague and close ally of Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain, told ""Fox News Sunday."" Graham said the militia fighters that Iraqi troops are battling are backed by Iran, which he said was ""killing Americans"" by arming the militias. But Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed said Iran has close ties to all of Iraq's Shiite factions, including al-Maliki's Dawa party and the country's largest Shiite religious party, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. ""The notion that this is a fight by American allies against Iranian-inspired elements is not accurate,"" said Reed, a leading Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Al-Sadr's political movement holds 30 seats in Iraq's 275-member parliament and was once a partner in al-Maliki's ruling coalition. The party quit the government in 2007 after al-Maliki refused to demand a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The cleric's supporters have linked the government offensive to provincial elections slated to take place October 1. Nassar al-Rubaie, an official in al-Sadr's political movement, said the army and police were being used ""for political reasons."" A high-ranking Iraqi security official said at least 200 people have been killed and 500 wounded in Basra battles since Tuesday. More than 100 had been killed in Baghdad as of Sunday, with another 100-plus killed in clashes in other cities in southern Iraq, Iraqi authorities reported. U.S. and British forces have supported Iraqi troops with airstrikes and shelling in Basra, as well as reconnaissance and intelligence, coalition military officials have said. U.S. troops have also conducted raids and engaged in gun battles with militia fighters alongside Iraqi troops. U.S. airstrikes killed at least 15 people in Baghdad neighborhoods known to be Mehdi Army strongholds Sunday morning, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said. And Baghdad's International Zone -- where many Iraqi government buildings and embassies are located -- was targeted again Sunday by rockets or mortars, but no injuries or damage was immediately reported, a U.S. Embassy official said. Also on Sunday, roadside bombings in northern and western Iraq killed two U.S. troops, while attacks on Iraqi police and others left another 19 dead, Iraqi police and U.S. military officials reported. One roadside bombing killed a U.S. soldier north of Baghdad, while a Marine died in another bombing in the western province of Anbar, the U.S. military headquarters there reported. No details of the attacks were released. The latest attacks bring the U.S. death toll in the 5-year-old war to 4,009. Other developments . • In northern Iraq, five Iraqi police officers were killed and two bystanders were wounded when gunmen attacked a police patrol in the town of Dhuluiyah Sunday, Samarra police said. • The U.S. military said Sunday it found a mass grave with 14 bodies near Muqdadiya. The bodies, which showed signs of torture, appeared to have been in the grave for two to six months. They were found 100 yards from where 37 bodies were found buried Thursday, the military said. • Ten people were killed Sunday when a suicide car bomb struck a checkpoint manned by members of the Awakening Council, Baiji police said. Four members of the council were among the dead. Awakening Councils are largely Sunni security groups that have been recruited by the U.S. military. • Also in Baiji, a child was killed and seven civilians were wounded when a mortar landed in a residential area Saturday afternoon, Baiji police said Sunday. • In Samarra, gunmen stormed the home of an Awakening Council member, killing him and his son. His wife and daughter were wounded in the Saturday morning attack, Samarra police said Sunday.  E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- International leaders expressed shock and dismay Monday over the Israeli Navy's pre-dawn storming of a flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian aid for Gaza that resulted in nine deaths. The situation rapidly escalated from a deadly incident at sea to a major diplomatic international crisis. ""I condemn the violence, and Israel must explain,"" said United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, speaking in Uganda after the official opening of the International Criminal Court Review Conference. In New York, the Security Council met in emergency session to discuss the matter. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said the flotilla was trying to circumvent Israel's naval blockade of Gaza and defended its move as justified. ""This happened after numerous warnings from Israel and the Israel navy that were issued prior to the action,"" it said in a posting on its website. ""During the interception of the ships, the demonstrators on board attacked the IDF naval personnel with live fire and light weaponry including knives and clubs."" Q&A on Israel's Gaza blockade . But Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said there was no excuse for an attack ""by armed forces on a humanitarian convoy."" ""The Palestinian government strongly condemns this crime, which portrays, once again, Israeli disrespect for the lives of innocent civilians, and its disrespect for international law,"" Fayyad said. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for three days of mourning in the Palestinian territories, while Saeb Erakat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said the attack was ""on civilians who came from all over the world peacefully with wheelchairs and food supplies and medical supplies."" International response was overwhelmingly critical. Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for Hamas, said: ""The Israeli occupation tries to deny this massacre by saying that the activists on the boat are from Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood and this is a lying campaign, because the activists are international activists."" The U.N. urged Israel to take no further steps that could endanger civilian lives. ""We wish to make clear that such tragedies are entirely avoidable if Israel heeds the repeated calls of the international community to end its counterproductive and unacceptable blockade of Gaza,"" said a joint statement from Robert Serry, U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, and Filippo Grandi, commissioner general of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency. White House Spokesman Bill Burton said the United States ""deeply regrets the loss of life and injuries sustained and is currently working to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragedy."" That did not impress Namik Tan, the Turkish ambassador to the United States, who called the U.S. response ""sort of weak."" Tan called the attack ""unacceptable"" and an ""act of piracy"" and said he ""expects a strong reaction from the United States."" Asked what Turkey wants the United States to do on any potential statement or censure from the Security Council, the ambassador said the question was too ""hypothetical."" He added, however, ""Israel should not get away with this."" Turkey has long been Israel's only real Muslim friend in the Middle East. In Istanbul, demonstrators tried to storm the high-rise building in which the Israeli Consulate is located. ""Zionist dogs!"" some chanted. Indonesia condemned the Israeli raid, saying in a statement that the blockade against Gaza ""constitutes a violation of international law."" The government of Indonesia ""will work closely with the international community to ensure that Israel is held accountable for its action in accordance with international law,"" it said. In Damascus, Syria, a senior adviser to President Bashar al-Assad, Buthaina Shaaban, called the attack ""a terrorist crime against innocent civilians and supporters of the Palestinian people who had no weapons, no armaments with them."" Moscow condemned the action as a ""gross"" violation of international law, according to the Interfax news agency. ""Condemnation and deep anxiety are being expressed in Moscow, primarily in view of the fact that some of the participants in the humanitarian convoy were killed or injured,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a news release, according to Interfax. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak condemned Israel's use of force as ""excessive and unjustified."" Former Prime Minister Tony Blair, an envoy to the Middle East on behalf of the so-called Quartet, a group of nations working toward peace in the region, called for a ""full investigation"" and said in a statement: ""I repeat my view that we need a different and better way of helping the people of Gaza and avoiding the hardship and tragedy that is inherent in the present situation."" A number of nations, including Italy, France, Greece and Sweden, summoned their ambassadors to explain. According to CNN Swedish affiliate TV4, 11 Swedes were among the activists aboard the ships. In addition, three members of Germany's Die Linke party were among those on the boat where nine people were killed, the party said Monday. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle called for a ""thorough and transparent investigation"" and called for border crossings to be opened to humanitarian aid convoys. ""I hope that the tragic events of last night will not make even more difficult the indirect talks between Israelis and Palestinians which have begun,"" he said. ""We believe it vital that this process go forward."" Norway's Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg said Norwegian citizens were aboard the convoy and called for an independent international inquiry ""as soon as possible."" After meeting with the Israeli ambassador, the Greek Foreign Ministry said that the visit of the Israeli Joint Chiefs -- scheduled for Tuesday -- was being postponed, and that the Greek-Israeli military exercise that was in progress had been discontinued. A Greek Foreign Affairs Ministry official could not say how many Greeks were aboard the six ships in the flotilla. Turkey recalled its ambassador from Israel, canceled three planned military exercises with the Israeli military and called home its youth national football team, which had two games scheduled in Israel, said Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc. ""This operation will leave a bloody stain on the history of humanity,"" he said. Protests occurred Monday outside the Israeli Embassy in Istanbul, Turkey. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri predicted the raid would inflame the region. ""Lebanon strongly condemns this attack and calls on the international community, and specifically on the major countries which are supposed to be responsible about the peace process, to take action in order to stop this continuous violation of human rights, which is putting the international peace at risk,"" Hariri said. Pakistan said it was concerned about the well-being and whereabouts of two journalists who were aboard the flotilla. ""The government of Pakistan strongly condemns the use of brazen force by Israel against a humanitarian mission that was embarked on delivering humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people in Gaza,"" the country's foreign ministry said. ""The killing of members of this humanitarian mission, which also included women, is brutal, inhuman and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and norms."" In a statement on its website, the Kingdom of Bahrain said it ""strongly condemns the Israeli navy's barbaric attack.""

"(CNN) -- Over this past weekend, Hezbollah, the militant Shiite group that is headquartered in Lebanon, reportedly used drones to bomb a building used by the al Qaeda affiliated Nusra Front, along Lebanon's border with Syria. The armed drones, combined with fire from Hezbollah ground troops, killed 23 Nusra Front militants and wounded some 10 others, according to a report by an Iranian news agency. Iran is the key sponsor for Hezbollah and has plausibly claimed for the past several years to have succeeded in manufacturing armed drones. Hezbollah's use of drones marks a milestone for terrorist groups worldwide: It would be the first time a group other than a nation state used armed drones successfully to carry out an attack, marking an important step towards closing the gap between the technological capabilities of countries such as the United States and militant groups such as Hezbollah. After all, it was only in the months immediately after 9/11 that the United States mastered the technology of arming drones and began to use them in combat. Now, 13 years later a militant organization appears to have reached the same milestone. Previously, drones were known to have been used by militant groups only for surveillance purposes. Last month, ISIS uploaded a video to YouTube that showed aerial views of Syrian Army Military Base 93 in Raqqa province in northern Syria that had purportedly been shot by a drone. Libyan opposition fighters targeting Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi used sophisticated drones for surveillance in the summer of 2011. Hezbollah had used drones for surveillance before, but the drones were used on Lebanon's border with Israel. In April, the Israeli military said it had shot down a drone off the coast of Haifa and that Hezbollah operated it. Although Hezbollah denied responsibility for that drone, it did claim that it had operated another drone that flew 35 miles into Israel in October. If Hezbollah does indeed have armed drones, it joins an elite group of nations: Only the United States, United Kingdom, and Israel and are known to have deployed armed drones in combat. According to a count by New America, some 80 countries have some kind of drone capability -- but few of them have succeeded in arming their drones. Russia, China, and Iran possess armed drones but have yet to use them in combat. Hezbollah's use of drones to target another militant group shows how warfare is changing: The monopoly of states on the use of military force is eroding, and new technology is leveling the playing field between states and militant groups. So what can the United States and other nations do to protect themselves from this dawning threat? It's a subject, of course, of great interest in Israel where accounts of Hezbollah's drone strike on the Nusra target over the weekend were all over Israeli media during the past 24 hours. Most armed drones are relatively easy to shoot down if you have a sophisticated air defenses or a fleet of jet fighter aircraft. Western countries generally have these, but one can imagine a dystopian future where terrorist groups are able to deploy armed drones against less well defended targets. Indeed, that future may have already arrived.","Iranian news agency reports Hezbollah used an armed drone .

"Republicans launched a blistering attack Friday on the health care reform law upheld by the Supreme Court, seeking to rally their base's opposition to the measure to bolster their fortunes in the November election. Using the court's finding that the centerpiece of the law -- the individual mandate -- amounted to a legal exercise of congressional taxing power, GOP leaders accused President Barack Obama and Democrats of deceiving the nation about the Affordable Care Act during debate on the measure in 2009 and 2010. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky led the charge, saying Democrats used a ""deeply dishonest sales pitch"" to overcome public opposition to the measure back then. ""Nearly every day since then, the promises that formed the heart of that sales pitch have been exposed for the false promises they were,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor, adding that the Supreme Court decision Thursday provided ""powerful confirmation of what may have been the biggest deception of all."" He urged Democrats to stop ""trying to defend the indefensible"" and join with Republicans to repeal the health care law. Health care ruling gives GOP new attack line . Meanwhile, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, a tea party favorite and leading opponent of health care reform, said she and congressional colleagues were sending a letter to state officials urging them not to implement the health care bill until after the November vote. ""All across job creator boardrooms today, decisions are being made by millions of employers to drop the employer covered health insurance,"" Bachmann claimed Friday on CNN. ""That's why we're telling the states just stop, take a breath, because we're going to turn the economy around after November."" The polarizing law is the signature legislation of Obama's time in office, and opposition to it helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement. Friday's rhetoric by McConnell and other Republicans reflected their shock and anger at the high court decision, which rejected the challenges of opponents who contended the health care law was unconstitutional. Breaking down the court's decision . In a 5-4 ruling, the court decided the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance was valid as a tax, even though it was impermissible under the Constitution's Commerce Clause. The most anticipated Supreme Court ruling in years allows the government to continue implementing the health care law, which doesn't take full effect until 2014. That means popular provisions that prohibit insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions and allow parents to keep their children on family policies to the age of 26 will continue. Opinion: Chief Justice Roberts: The decider . However, Republican opponents of the law's expansion of government vowed to continue fighting to repeal it, with certain presidential nominee Mitt Romney saying that defeating Obama in November is the only way to meet that goal. Both presidential campaigns are citing fundraising spikes after the Supreme Court's decision. Romney's organization said Friday that it had raised $4.6 million online, and Obama's operation, while not revealing specific numbers, said it had surpassed that total. The individual mandate is the linchpin of the health care law signed by Obama in 2010 after an epic brawl in Congress in which no Republicans supported the measure. Obama has denied that the mandate is a tax, including in a 2009 interview with ABC in which he compared it to state requirements that motorists carry auto insurance. ""Nobody considers that a tax increase,"" Obama said then. ""People say to themselves, 'that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car, that I'm not covering all the costs.' "" At least 4 million people are expected to pay a penalty for not having health insurance when the rule takes full effect in 2016, bringing in about $54 billion to help offset the $1.7 trillion, 10-year cost of the act, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It's one of several revenue-raising provisions in the health care law, according to Lawrence Jacobs, a University of Minnesota political scientist and co-author of a 2010 book on the health care battle. Who's going to treat you? Under the health care law when it is fully implemented in coming years, most Americans will be covered by employee health plans, either their own or that of a head of household, or by existing government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid or veterans' benefits, Jacobs noted. Of the roughly 6% of the population remaining, a large portion of those will be exempted from the mandate because of poverty, religious beliefs or other reasons, he said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday that the fine for failing to have health insurance once the law is fully implemented is ""a penalty, because you have a choice"" of whether to obtain it. ""If you don't buy it, and you can afford it, it is an irresponsible thing to do to ask the rest of America's taxpayers to pay for your care when you go to the emergency room,"" Carney said. ""So your choice is to purchase health (insurance), or a penalty will be administered."" By the numbers: Health insurance . Bachmann's allegation that the health care law would lead to fewer U.S. jobs was challenged on CNN by Democratic Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware. ""If they're not hiring, it's because they don't have demand,"" Markell said. ""What they care most about when they're deciding whether to hire is where do they have access to the greatest work force. I mean, these charges are just ridiculous."" Democrats also noted that Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, implemented an individual mandate similar to the concept in the federal law. Romney contends that the Massachusetts law was tailored to the state's needs and that such a solution was improper at the federal level. He called the law known as Obamacare bad policy and a bad law on the federal level. That didn't stop Democratic Rep. Steve Israel of New York from noting on CNN that Romney ""actually defended what he called a penalty"" during his term as Massachusetts governor. ""Not my words, Mitt Romney's words, were the free riders -- who chose not to get health insurance but shift those costs onto society -- need to pay their fair share,"" Israel said. ""I didn't call them free riders. Mitt Romney did."" In Thursday's majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that ""the federal government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance. ... The federal government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance."" Roberts joined the high court's liberal wing -- Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- in upholding the law. Read the ruling (PDF) Four conservative justices -- Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas -- dissented. ""To say that the individual mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it,"" the dissenting justices wrote in their opinion. ""Imposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry."" How the court voted . An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday indicated that 37% of Americans would have been pleased if the law had been found unconstitutional, compared with 28% who would have been pleased if it had been found constitutional. And the poll of 1,000 U.S. adults found that nearly four in 10 surveyed would have ""mixed feelings"" had the justices struck down the whole law. Obama, in televised remarks, called Thursday's Supreme Court ruling a victory for the nation. He used the focus on the issue to spell out the benefits of the law that remains unpopular with many Americans. The principle upheld by the high court's ruling is that no American should go bankrupt because of illness, the president said. ""I know the debate over this law has been divisive,"" Obama said. ""It should be pretty clear that I didn't do this because it was good politics. I did it because I believe it is good for the country."" He said the country can't afford ""to refight the political battle of two years ago or go back to the way things were."" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, who helped push through the law when she was House speaker, cited the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a longtime proponent of health care reform who died before the bill became law. ""Now he can rest in peace,"" she said, echoing what she'd earlier told Kennedy's widow by phone. In his opinion, Roberts appeared to note the political divisions, writing that ""we do not consider whether the act embodies sound policies."" ""That judgment is entrusted to the nation's elected leaders,"" the opinion said. ""We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions."" The narrow focus of the ruling on key issues such as the individual mandate -- limiting it to taxing powers rather than general commerce -- represented the court's effort to limit the government's authority. ""The framers created a federal government of limited powers and assigned to this court the duty of enforcing those limits,"" Roberts wrote. ""The court does so today."" In another part of Thursday's decision, the high court ruled that a part of the law involving Medicaid must change. The law calls for an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, which involves spending by the federal government and the states, and threatens to remove existing Medicaid funding from states that don't participate in the expansion. Thursday's ruling said the government must remove that threat.","White House says health care fine for lacking insurance is not a tax .

"Boston (CNN)Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told a judge Thursday he was satisfied with his defense lawyers at what is expected to be the final public hearing before his death penalty trial begins on January 5. Wearing gray slacks a white button-down shirt under a black sweater, Tsarnaev said, ""Yes, sir,"" to a series of questions from the judge, including whether he was pleased with his defense and had been kept informed about his case. It was the first time Tsarnaev -- suspected with his older brother Tamerlan of planting two bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 others near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013 -- appeared in a Boston federal court since he pleaded not guilty last year. One of the more colorful developments happened as the 25-minute hearing ended. Elena Teyer -- mother-in-law of Ibragim Todashev, a Tamerlan Tsarnaev associate whom an FBI agent shot and killed in Florida last year during what authorities say was a separate murder investigation -- was in attendance and shouted in support of Dzhokhar as he was led away in handcuffs. ""I said in court, 'Dzhokhar, you have a lot of supporters. We pray for you. ... We know you're innocent,' "" Teyer told reporters afterward. Todashev, like the Tsarnaev family, was from Chechnya -- though the Tsarnaev brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan. Also at Thursday's hearing, a potential defense expert witness who has been interviewing Tsarnaev's relatives was a center of contention between the prosecution and the defense. The prosecution says it doesn't want the witness to offer an opinion on whether Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was under his older brother's control. Dzhokhar was 19 at the time of the bombings; Tamerlan, who was killed in a police encounter days after the incident, was 26. The defense, in a status hearing in April, called the Tsarnaev family dynamic key to their case. The judge did not immediately rule on the witness. Possibly another trial delay? Tsarnaev attorney David Bruck said his team could file yet another motion to have the trial delayed. In September, defense attorneys succeeded in moving the trial from November 3 to January 5. But they wanted it delayed much longer -- until September 1, 2015 -- citing a large volume of information in the case. But unless Bruck files another motion and a judge grants it, Tsarnaev is set to stand trial in less than three weeks. Authorities say Tsarnaev and his older brother planted two pressure-cooker explosives, hidden in backpacks, near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. As spectators watched runners finish the race in the afternoon, the bombs exploded 12 seconds apart, killing 8-year-old Martin Richard, 29-year-old Krystle Campbell and Lingzi Lu, a Boston University graduate student from China, and injuring more than 260 others. Timeline: The bombing, manhunt and investigation . Three days later, after the FBI released surveillance photos of the suspects, the Tsarnaevs shot and killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, authorities say. Early the next day, authorities say, the brothers hijacked a car in Cambridge, and then threw explosives out the car windows and exchanged gunfire with police who pursued them. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died of wounds he suffered in the encounter, but Dzhokhar got away, leading to a massive manhunt. He was found that night in a motorboat dry-docked in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home, covered in blood from bullet wounds sustained in that morning's shootout. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces more than 30 federal charges, including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death. Federal prosecutors announced earlier this year that they will seek the death penalty against him, arguing he acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner"" and lacks remorse. Prosecutors have said they expect to call between 80 and 100 witnesses in a three- to four-month trial. From fears to cheers: The final hours that paralyzed Boston . In September, a federal judge denied Tsarnaev's bid to move his upcoming trial out of Massachusetts. His lawyers had argued that pretrial publicity and public sentiment jeopardized his opportunity for a fair trial. U.S. District Judge George O'Toole rejected the argument that 12 impartial jurors couldn't be found in the area, saying Massachusetts' eastern federal district had about 5 million people. As for Todashev, authorities said an FBI agent fatally shot the 27-year-old at his Florida apartment in May 2013. This happened as FBI agents and Massachusetts state troopers questioned him about a 2011 Boston-area triple murder that they thought could have been tied to Todashev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. A report by Florida's 9th Circuit state attorney, Jeffrey Ashton, concluded this year that Todashev's killing was justified -- a finding that concurred with a reviews by the FBI and the Florida state attorney for Orange and Osceola counties. The report cites FBI documents that said Todaschev was writing a confession to the triple murder when when he attacked, flipping the table he was writing on and striking an FBI agent in the head. Todaschev ran to the kitchen and was heard frantically grabbing items before reappearing in the doorway wielding a long metal handle of a mop or broom. The report said Todashev took an attack stance with the pole and lunged violently at the agent, who shot him, with fatal wounds to his head and his heart, according to the documents. Todashev's family has disputed that he posed any threat to the law enforcement officers and agents in his apartment. U.S. law enforcement officials said Todashev made statements implicating himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the 2011 killings. Boston bombing suspect's friend convicted .

"The Mexican Senate has just passed, 72-2, an 8% tax on candy, chips and other high-calorie foods. It continues to debate a special additional tax of about 8 cents per liter on sugary soda. You can understand why Mexican leaders are worried about their nation's eating habits. Mexicans consume more sugary soft drinks per person than any other people on earth. Mexico suffers the highest incidence of diabetes among the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Mexicans are more likely to be obese even than Americans, the next runner-up. Taxes on junk foods constitute just a part of a vast fiscal reform proposed by Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto. The overall plan aims to rationalize tax collections, curtail tax evasion and shift Mexico away from dependence on oil revenues. That's all a topic for another day. The question for today is: Will fat taxes work? There's reason for pessimism. In 2011, Denmark became the first country to impose a tax on fatty foods. Less than a year later, it became the first country to abolish the tax. In the words of the Danish tax ministry: ""The fat tax and the extension of the chocolate tax, the so-called sugar tax, has been criticized for increasing prices for consumers, increasing companies' administrative costs and putting Danish jobs at risk. At the same time it is believed that the fat tax has, to a lesser extent, contributed to Danes traveling across the border to make purchases."" Economists doubt that the moderate tax increases imposed in Denmark or proposed for Mexico will suffice to alter behavior. Adjusting for inflation, soda prices have declined by nearly 40% in the last three decades, and soda consumption was already disturbingly high in 1980. To counteract such a price drop would require very large tax increases. But high soda taxes would likely encourage smuggling, tax evasion and other efforts to game the system. It might work better to pay people to eat better, rather than tax them for making unhealthy choices. Britain's Daily Telegraph reported in 2012 on a study at Northwestern University in which participants were offered cash if they ate more fruits and vegetables and exercised more. Researchers were surprised to see that the participants kept up their new good habits even after the payments stopped, according the study's lead author, Bonnie Spring. ""We thought they'd do it while we were paying them, but the minute we stopped they'd go back to their bad habits. But they continued to maintain a large improvement in their health behaviors."" The Mexican fat-tax experiment isn't bolstered by payouts of pesos. But it's probably still worth a try, and for three reasons: . First, the Danish failure is not dispositive. Denmark is a small place with a lively tradition of cross-border shopping. From Copenhagen, it is an easy 35-minute drive to Malmo, Sweden's third-largest city. Southern Denmark conveniently adjoins shopping in northern Germany. Mexico's population is concentrated in and around the capital city, far from any border. Second, while incentives may work better than penalties in controlled experiments, it seems administratively unfeasible to operate such schemes on any large scale. It's one thing to weigh and pay 204 people, a very different thing to weigh and pay millions of them. Finally Mexico's obesity problem is much worse than Denmark's -- and trending fast in the wrong direction. Even marginal improvements are worth pursuing there. In particular, simply reducing Mexican soda consumption could yield substantial benefits. When things are bad enough, policymakers have more reason to say: ""What the heck, it's worth a try."" There's one last thing that needs to be said about Mexico's emerging experiment with fat taxes. When Americans talk about immigration from Mexico, there exists a tendency to speak of Mexico as a nation of desperate poverty, a kind of Somalia on the Caribbean, from which people naturally wish to flee by any means possible. In fact, by any global standard, Mexico is a reasonably successful country. Mexico is not especially poor: Gross domestic product per capita is well above the global median. Within the Americas, Mexico is poorer than Chile and Argentina, but richer than Brazil and oil-producing Venezuela. Mexico's election system is fairer, more impartial and more reliable than that of the United States. Mexico is a country of free speech and free exercise of religion. It scores poorly on international rankings of social mobility. But so does the United States, and the indications are that Mexicans who migrate to the United States face particularly poor opportunities here. There is one respect, however, in which Mexico has historically done poorly: providing enough work for all its people. Mexico's economy is slowed by a wasteful and expensive public sector and by rules biased toward monopoly and oligopoly in the private sector. Mexican elites have historically preferred to address their employment problems by encouraging the discontented to migrate northward. Almost one in 10 of people born in Mexico now live in the United States, mostly illegally. This migration has helped Mexico avoid reckoning with its domestic problems, by the simple device of transferring the people disadvantaged by those problems to another jurisdiction. Very understandably, Mexicans want jobs and higher wages. Aware that powerful interest groups in the United States have paralyzed the enforcement of immigration laws, many ambitious Mexicans have ignored U.S. law to seek those jobs and higher wages north of the border. That migration has had real costs for Americans, however. And when it is suggested that those who migrated illegally be pressed to return home, immigration advocates respond with horror: How can any decent person propose such a thing? Return these destitute people home to starve? But as the Mexican Senate acknowledges, Mexicans are not fleeing starvation. Just the opposite. Americans should pay Mexico the respect of acknowledging its success and advances -- and expect in return that Mexican authorities will respect American law and cooperate in its enforcement.","David Frum: Mexican Senate passed junk food tax and is mulling a tax on sugary soda .

"By any measure, the Mitt Romney for president campaign has had a painfully bad week. What went wrong? The bad news began Wednesday. That day, Romney addressed the NAACP convention in Houston. The speech was poorly received, so much so that Romney, in an interview that afternoon on Fox Business, told host Neil Cavuto that he had ""expected"" boos. Some interpreted that comment as proof that Romney had actually wanted to be booed by the NAACP in order to rev up elements of the conservative base. The Romney campaign next reacted by whispering to the Drudge Report (which acts as a kind of message board for Romney) that it was seriously considering Condoleezza Rice as a running mate. That story excited the press for half a day, until reporters remembered two hard realities: Party conservatives won't accept a pro-choice running mate, and Rice has made repeated public statements of lack of interest in the VP job. The NAACP story probably moved few votes. But it's interesting in its own right -- and as a warning of the bigger trouble that hit the campaign on Thursday. The NAACP incident shows a hyperactive campaign war room, overcorrecting one way (""the boos are no big deal; everything's going according to plan!"") and then overcorrecting the other way (""we weren't trying to generate TV images of racial confrontation; why, look, here's Condi Rice!""), spinning and counterspinning without any forethought for how this hour's aggressive statement would sound when the next hour's realities arrived. And it was that ""win the hour"" mentality that got the Romney campaign into much more serious trouble when the Obama campaign launched a big push on Romney's business record the next day. Gergen: Obama's charges vs. Romney don't hold up . Thursday morning, the Obama campaign released a tough ad attacking the record of downsizing and outsourcing at Romney's old firm, Bain Capital. The Romney campaign reacted with outrage. That same day, it announced a multimillion-dollar purchase of airtime for an ad that bluntly accused President Obama of lying. In support of the ad, Romney's team argued that he had left Bain Capital in February 1999; the incidents alluded to by the Obama campaign all occurred after that date and had nothing to do with Romney. Wham. The first attack on Romney had been a jab, dropping Romney's guard against the haymaker: On Friday, the Obama team counter-charged that it was Romney who was lying in his ads or who had committed a felony, lying on 140 official forms that he signed as CEO and sole shareholder of Bain between 1999 and 2002. Romney now chased the Obama story, granting five TV interviews to reiterate his version of events. The more he talked, the more deeply into trouble he sank. By Sunday, even Romney supporters were urging the thing he wants least: release of more income tax returns. And here again, what got Romney into the trouble was his war room. It was the too-fierce response to Attack 1 -- the adamant insistence that Romney had nothing, nothing to do with anything that happened at Bain after February 1999 -- that set up Romney for Attack 2: Did he lie on SEC forms? And now he will struggle through the rest of the election trying to reconcile his answers. Yes, it is technically true that Romney ended his operational role at Bain before he ended his titular role. It was also technically true (as Josh Marshall points out) that John Kerry did vote for the $87 billion before he voted against it. Romney's core problem is this: He heads a party that must win two-thirds of the white working-class vote in presidential elections to compensate for its weakness in almost every demographic category. The white working class is the most pessimistic and alienated group in the electorate, and it especially fears and dislikes the kind of financial methods that gained Romney his fortune. Romney has a strong potential defense: Bain was in the business of making companies more efficient and profitable. Downsizing and outsourcing were necessary -- and often indispensable -- means to that end. In a growing economy, the workers who lost their jobs should find new jobs elsewhere, and it's precisely the relentless search for profitability that causes economies to grow in the first place. That's an argument that, to borrow an old joke of Henry Kissinger's, is not only convincing but has the additional merit of being true. However, it's not an argument that appeals much to the voters Romney most intensely needs to win. Hence his unleashing of the war room -- but in the end, there's only so much a war room can do. And this time, by trying to do too much, the Romney war room may have blasted its own side with lethal friendly fire.

"(CNN) -- Some of the country's best firefighters matched wits Wednesday with a fiendish Colorado wildfire that has scorched structures and sent tens of thousands fleeing from Colorado Springs and other communities. As predicted, erratic winds kicked up again in the afternoon, increasing the chance of embers jumping fire lines and creating more havoc, officials said. ""We are learning as we fight this fire some of its tricks,"" said incident commander Rich Harvey. ""And one of its tricks is to run down these hills that way. You can fool us once, maybe, but not twice."" Officials said they had not completed an inventory of homes and other structures lost or damaged Tuesday by the Waldo Canyon Fire, which was only 5% contained. They were making plans to schedule a meeting with affected residents. ""It really is a loss, and there is a grieving process that has to take place,"" said Steve Cox with the Colorado Springs mayor's executive team. The FBI's Denver office, meanwhile, said it was working with other agencies to determine whether any of a dozen wildfires across the state resulted from criminal activity. Nearly 1,000 firefighters tried to corral the 15,517-acre blaze that moved into Colorado Springs. Gov. John Hickenlooper told CNN's ""John King USA"" that the number of evacuations grew Wednesday to 36,000. ""We're still fighting with everything we've got,"" he said. Harvey said progress had been made in some portions of the Waldo Canyon Fire, and firefighters were taking an aggressive stance against hot spots. ""It's been house to house, door to door, street to street, hill to hill activity,"" he said of one location. Higher humidity and cloud cover Wednesday night might aid firefighting efforts, but there was no guarantee conditions would not be similar to Tuesday's conflagration, Harvey told reporters. Some rain did fall Wednesday on a separate fire burning near Boulder, Colorado, according to the National Weather Service. President Barack Obama will travel to the Colorado Springs area Friday to survey the damage and thank responders battling the blaze, the White House said. The Waldo Canyon Fire captured attention because of its proximity to landmarks such as Pikes Peak and the Air Force Academy, and also to Colorado Springs, a city of about 400,000, the state's second largest. ""We have rehearsed and practiced disasters,"" said Dave Rose, public information officer for El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs. ""We have never seen one like this before."" Winds gusting to 65 mph through mountain canyons blew the wildfire through containment lines into northwest Colorado Springs on Tuesday afternoon. It roared downhill, burning to the ground the Flying W Ranch, a popular Western-style tourist destination. CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen likened conditions to a double-edged sword. While temperatures were down a bit Wednesday, high-based thunderstorms will be fed by rising air, wind and low humidity, he said. Such storms produce lightning and rain, but dry air will suck up most of the precipitation before it hits the ground. Lightning can reach the parched soil and possibly ignite additional fires, according to Hennen. Open Story: iReporters share their harrowing views of the western wildfires . Richard Brown, the Colorado Springs fire chief, on Tuesday described the Waldo Canyon Fire as a ""firestorm of epic proportions."" Stan and Darlene Colbert were among the last families in the evacuation zone to pull out. They waited, hoping the fire would subside, but after watching the flames from their back porch, they knew it was time to go. The first things the couple -- married 43 years -- packed were the family photos. ""Every one of them I could find. Every photo because I can't replace those,"" said Darlene Colbert. Many residents waited anxiously to get word of whether their homes had been spared. Becky Schormann was one. Her family managed to take some sentimental items with them when they left, but still had to leave behind a boat, a pair of ATVs, a china cabinet and an antique doll collection. ""I keep telling myself: It's going to be OK,"" she said. Schormann told CNN that flames came to within 20 feet of their home but were beaten back. ""Our volunteer fire department is just awesome,"" she said. The Schormanns are staying in an RV at their daughter's home. The family's two dogs, a pony and a donkey also came along for the ride. The flames came dangerously close to the Air Force Academy's main campus, and an evacuation order was issued for about 700 residents in its Pine Valley Housing and 1,400 in Douglass Valley Housing, said public affairs officer John Van Winkle. The facility was closed to visitors Wednesday, with only essential personnel asked to report. Reactions: Monster fire terrorizes a Colorado city . The academy's powered flight, glider and parachuting operations have been called off since Saturday so that the U.S. Forest Service could use runways for helicopters used to fight fires along Colorado's Front Range, Van Winkle said. The academy's Class of 2016 -- all 1,045 cadets -- is still scheduled to arrive Thursday, but officials are making contingency plans in case they have to report to a different location on the base. Rose, the county information officer, said one in four callers to the joint information center are offering food for firefighters, shelter for displaced neighbors or to volunteer in some capacity. ""It is a somber resolve,"" Rose told CNN. ""There's no doubt that we have a grim reality that we have lost a number of structures. Our western border mountain vista has dramatically altered."" Colorado wildfires had consumed 181,426 acres by Wednesday afternoon, according to the Colorado Division of Emergency Management. The largest of the fires was the High Park Fire, which began June 9 and has now consumed 87,284 acres, the U.S. Forest Service said. It was 65% contained Wednesday. The total number of homes burned stood at 257. An estimated $33.1 million has been spent trying to contain the blaze. The brotherhood of Disaster City .

"North Korea fired two short-range missiles off its eastern coast Monday, the second such launch in less than a week, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. The defense ministry said it is on high alert and monitoring the situation. It called on the North to stop the missile launches. The weapons launched were Scud missiles that flew more than 500 kilometers (311 miles), according to the defense ministry. The missiles landed in the sea, South Korea's semi-official Yonhap news agency reported. On Thursday, four Scud missiles with a shorter range were fired into the sea off North Korea's eastern coast -- flying about 220 kilometers (137 miles), according to Yonhap -- just days after the start of annual joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States. North Korea opposes such exercises, which routinely cause friction among the three countries. North Korea's missile capabilities . Last year's exercises triggered weeks of heightened tensions between the nations and North Korean threats of nuclear war. Thursday's launch was the first time North Korea had fired Scud missiles, which have a range that covers the whole of the Korean Peninsula, since 2009, South Korea said. Foreign policy experts say the North Korean missile firings may not herald a repeat of last year's saber rattling from Pyongyang, which included threats of preemptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea and the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is null and void.

"Santiago, Chile (CNN)  -- As the sun set in Chile on Saturday, a picture of the immense structural damage wrought by an early morning earthquake had come clearly into focus, with the nation's president estimating that 2 million people had been affected in some way. More than 300 people were killed, according to Chile's Office of Emergency Management, and 15 are missing. The carnage from the 8.8-magnitude quake didn't begin to approach that unleashed by January's earthquake in Haiti, which left 212,000 people dead and more than a million homeless, even though it was considerably less forceful, with a 7.0 magnitude. Saturday's quake was 700 to 800 times stronger, but at a greater depth -- 21.7 miles -- compared to the shallow 8.1-mile depth of the Haiti quake, which contributed to much of the damage there. Coastal Chile has a history of deadly earthquakes, with 13 quakes of magnitude 7.0 or higher since 1973, the U.S. Geological Survey said. As a result, experts said that newer buildings are constructed to help withstand the shocks. Still, the damage from Chile's earthquake was widespread. A 15-story high rise near the southern city of Concepcion collapsed; the country's major north-south highway was severed at multiple points; and the capital city's airport was closed after its terminal sustained major damage. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet announced that all public events would be canceled for the next 72 hours and that the start of the the school year -- originally scheduled for Monday -- would be delayed until March 8. ""The forces of nature have hurt our country greatly,"" Bachelet said in a nationally televised message Saturday night. ""We are now having to face adversity and stand again."" The quake struck at 3:34 a.m. (1:34 a.m. ET) off the Pacific coast at a depth of nearly 22 miles (35 km) and about 60 miles (100 km) northwest of Chillan, Chile, the USGS said. Santiago, the capital, is 200 miles (325 km) northeast of the epicenter. Saturday's epicenter was just a few miles north of the largest earthquake recorded in the world: a magnitude 9.5 quake in May 1960 that killed 1,655 and unleashed a tsunami that crossed the Pacific. The quake was followed by 76 aftershocks of 4.9 magnitude or greater, according to the USGS. That includes a 6.1-magnitude temblor in Argentina that killed a 58-year-old man and an 8-year-old boy in separate towns, the government-run Telam news agency said. Some buildings in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, were evacuated, though the city is 690 miles (1,111 kilometers) from Santiago. Earlier Saturday, a large wave killed three people and 10 were missing on the island of Juan Fernandez, 400 miles (643 km) off the coast of Chile, said Provincial Governor Ivan De La Maza. Across Chile, desperate relatives spent the day searching for missing loved ones. Many used the Internet to ask for help in finding relatives. Millions of other Chileans began swapping tales of fear and confusion in the early morning hours, soon after the quake struck. CNN iReporter Matias de Cristobal said many homes in her Santiago neighborhood were destroyed. Cristobal tried to climb upstairs to check on her three children after she began feeling tremors Saturday, but she was slowed by shifting ground and falling objects. Mirko Vukasovic, a 25-year-old illustrator in Santiago, had been dancing at a club early Saturday when the disco ball began swinging wildly. A chaotic evacuation was already under way when the lights went out, and everyone managed to escape, Vukasovic said. ""Broken windows and falling building parts was what welcomed us in the streets,"" he said. Many initially greeted the quake with disbelief. ""It was 3 or 4 in the morning and I had come home late,"" said Aneya Fernando, an American who teaches English in Santiago. ""Suddenly my bed was moving so violently that it woke me up."" ""I'm on the 10th floor of a building and it was swaying and shaking,"" Fernando, 23, said. ""Suddenly [the shaking] was just gone and I was confused. I thought it was in my head."" When Fernando's electricity returned 30 minutes later, she learned of the earthquake on TV. The task of trying to rescue survivors and recover the dead continued into the night. Buildings lay in rubble, bridges and highway overpasses were toppled and roads buckled like rumpled paper. Mangled cars were strewn on highways, many of them resting on their roofs. Santiago, the capital, lost electricity and basic services, including water and telephones. A chemical fire in the city that was spreading from one building to others forced the evacuation of everyone within 500 meters. Chilean television showed buildings in tatters in Concepcion, in coastal central Chile. Whole sides of buildings were torn off, and at least two structures were engulfed in flames. Emergency teams rescued 30 people from one collapsed building in Concepcion. iReport.com: Did you feel it? Share information, images with CNN . President-elect Sebastian Pinera, who will take office in March, also was monitoring the situation and warned, ""The number of victims could get higher."" Bachelet declared areas of catastrophe, similar to a state of emergency, which will allow her to rush in aid. She noted that two of the nation's largest hospitals had suffered structural damage and patients were taken to other facilities. Other public institutions also were affected. ""There were reports of riots at one of the jails,"" Bachelet said. ""The jails have, of course, received significant damage... We are looking into possibly moving some of these inmates."" Two airlines, LAN and Cencosud, announced they were temporarily suspending services. Several international humanitarian groups pledged help for Chile's relief effort, with AmeriCares announcing it was sending medical aid and an emergency response team to Chile. Oxfam said it's sending a team of water engineers and logisticians from Colombia and senior humanitarian staff from Mexico to help in relief efforts. In a televised address Saturday, President Obama said that the United States has resources positioned to assist Chile if it requests help. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she will proceed Sunday with her planned trip to five Latin American countries, including Chile. Meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a major tsunami warning for parts of its coastline, indicating the possibility of waves 9 feet or higher. Tens of thousands of coastal residents were evacuated ahead of the potential surge. Follow tsunami warning information . The Philippines Institute of Volcanology and Seismology also issued a tsunami alert, with the first waves expected in the Philippines around 1 p.m. on Sunday (midnight Saturday ET).

"Targeted assassinations or the capture of senior insurgent leaders in larger counterinsurgency operations can provide both positive and negative outcomes according to a classified CIA document posted by the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks on Thursday. The use of so-called high-value targeting, or HVT, programs are the subject of a document titled ""Best Practices in Counterinsurgency"" and labeled as secret -- and not for the eyes of foreign nations -- dates back to July 2009 in the early days of the Obama administration. According to the document, the CIA assessed the results of such operations by either U.S. government personnel or other countries during operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Israel and eight other countries. Use of high-value targeting programs can have beneficial effects such as eroding insurgent effectiveness, weakening insurgent will, and fragmenting or splitting the insurgent group among others. However, the report cites the possibility of increasing the level of support for insurgent groups, radicalizing an insurgent group's remaining leaders and creating a vacuum for additional radical groups to enter as potential adverse effects for such operations. A CIA spokesperson told CNN the agency does not comment on the authenticity or content of purported stolen intelligence documents. Several case studies from various high-value targeting operations spanning 50 years formed the basis of the report. Efforts to target senior members of the Afghan Taliban since 2001 were constrained by the limited reach of the central government beyond Kabul, along with the Taliban's ""high overall ability to replace lost leaders"" illustrate the limits of high-value targeting operations according to clandestine and U.S. military reporting that formed the basis of that research. But the report cites the Colombian government's use of high-value targeting operations against the FARC guerilla movement, and the overall psychological impact produced by the strikes on the broader population boosted the ""government's legitimacy"" and reduced morale within the FARC over time. And the continued use of targeting senior al Qaeda leaders served to weaken Osama bin Laden's control of his organization before his death at the hands of U.S. Navy SEALs in 2011. Bin Laden's efforts to avoid detection ""including his reliance on low-technology communications, his reluctance to meet with subordinates and his contentment with leading from a sequestered distance via infrequent contact,"" affected his ability to lead the organization according to the report. The document purports to provide both lessons and a framework for evaluating high-value targeting operations for US policy makers and military leaders involved in their ultimate authorization. Multiple sources of information formed the basis for the CIA's findings according to the document. ""Most of our source information relies on clandestine and defense attache reporting, discussions with HVT practitioners, a CIA-sponsored study on HVT operations in counterinsurgencies and our review of current and historical case documents,"" the report says.","A classified CIA document was posted by the anti-secrecy group Wikileaks on Thursday .

"Washington (CNN)Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes is threatening to ask courts to stop Republican Rand Paul from running for the Republican presidential nomination and re-election to the Senate at the same time. ""The law is clear. You can't be on the ballot twice for two offices,"" Grimes, the Democrat who challenged soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this fall, told WHAS in Louisville. Her comments came in Grimes' first interview after losing by 15 percentage points to McConnell. Republicans in Kentucky are pushing to change the state law to allow Paul to appear on the ballot twice, but Democrats who control the statehouse have objected. Grimes said as the state's chief election officer, she won't be ""bullied"" by Paul. ""We'll look to the court for any guidance that is needed,"" Grimes said. ""And at the end of the day, we're not going to be bullied. I've done my job as secretary of state for the people of Kentucky and I'll continue to do that."" To challenge Paul in court, though, Grimes would need to run for re-election as secretary of state in 2015 -- a decision she said she hasn't made yet. Kentucky has several statewide offices on the ballot next year. State Attorney General Jack Conway is the only Democrat who's entered the race to replace outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear, and Beshear's son, Andy, is running for attorney general. Grimes was coy in the interview with WHAS when asked about her own future. ""I'm taking time to reflect with family and friends on what has been an amazing journey,"" Grimes said, ""And, my hope is that I will continue to remain committed to the causes that I committed myself to over the course of this past year.""","Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes hopes to block Sen.

"The children of an elderly West Virginia couple who passed away months apart in late 2012 and early 2013 are blaming their deaths on a restaurant chain's meatloaf. Mark and Ann Starcher say a tainted meal that their parents shared from a local Bob Evans restaurant in October 2012 made them so ""violently ill"" that it ultimately led to their deaths, according to a lawsuit they've filed against the Ohio-based chain. According to the complaint, about nine hours after consuming a meal of meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy, broccoli and a roll, Virginia Starcher -- who went by ""Ginny"" -- ""fell violently ill"" shortly before Harold Starcher ""also became violently ill but was able to call 911 for ambulance transport for both."" Both were told by emergency room staff at Jackson General Hospital in Ripley, West Virginia, that they had suffered from food poisoning ""from consuming the tainted meal from Bob Evans."" The next day, the children allege that their dad -- who went by the nickname ""Punk"" -- ""suffered a stroke after becoming violently ill from consuming the tainted meal from Bob Evans,"" resulting in both parents being moved into a rehabilitation facility. Neither would return home. About two months later, Ginny, who served in the West Virginia Legislature in the 1980s, died in hospice care. Punk -- who was healthy, active and still operating his business at the time of the Bob Evans meal, according to the suit -- deteriorated rapidly thereafter. The next few months of his life would be spent in an intensive care unit before he, too, passed away. Protect yourself from food poisoning . Mark and Ann Starcher want $250,000 for medical expenses from Bob Evans Restaurants, as well as an unspecified amount for the ""pain, suffering, emotional distress, mental anguish and the loss of ability to enjoy life"" that were caused by their parents' deaths. A spokesman for the restaurant chain, which has 600 locations in 19 states, said that while it's the company's policy not to comment on pending litigation, ""we believe this is an appropriate and important exception to the rule."" ""Bob Evans is committed to serving the safest, highest-quality foods for our guests -- that is our responsibility and our priority,"" said Scott Taggart, who added that the company ""sympathize(s) with this family for the loss of their loved ones.""  However, Taggart said that the company had done ""a thorough review of the alleged claims in this matter, and quite simply, there is no basis to the allegations contained in the complaint and the suit is entirely without merit.""

"""Be kind, please rewind,"" the signs used to say in video stores, urging customers to return their rented VHS tapes spooled back to the beginning. If only Blockbuster could rewind back to the 1990s. That was the time when the video chain was the colossus of the movie-rental business, with stores in seemingly every city shopping district and suburban strip mall in America. Visiting the store was a weekly rite for many people, who would show up on Friday evenings to check out the latest releases, navigating a crush of couples and families who had exactly the same idea -- only to find out that the last copy of ""Air Force One"" or ""The Lion King"" had already been snagged. That custom is now as gone as a world with three television networks, a UHF station's late show and a Zenith Space Command. On Wednesday, DISH Network, which purchased Blockbuster in 2011, announced it was closing the chain's 300 remaining U.S.-based retail stores, as well as its distribution centers. ""Consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment,"" said DISH president and CEO Joseph P. Clayton in the press release about the closures. His statement echoes many from recent years about the migration of entertainment from physical objects -- CDs, DVDs, books, games -- to bits, bytes and pixels available on various screens and portable devices. Blockbuster will continue its Blockbuster @Home brand to DISH customers, as well as its Blockbuster On Demand streaming service. And an additional 50 Blockbuster stores not owned by DISH will remain open for the time being. Reaction: Jokes and shrugs . The action was long expected. Blockbuster had been closing stores for years, as is obvious from the yawning vacancies still present in many of those very same strip malls. The chain was done in by Netflix, streaming video and a world of Internet options. Reaction from that Internet was, of course, swift and pithy. Several posts on Twitter made fun of the store's late fees -- the bane of people who couldn't get their rental back in the standard 48 hours -- and the VHS tapes that made Blockbuster's name. ""I knew this day would come. I'm mere months away from owning a VHS copy of The Mighty Ducks without paying my late fees to Blockbuster,"" wrote Brian Essbe. ""Yes! All the Blockbuster Video Stores are closing!  That means they'll never get back that VHS tape of Vampire In Brooklyn. I won!"" added actor and comedian Paul Scheer. Other commenters just shrugged. Many said they didn't even realize Blockbuster had any stores left. In a headline, The New York Times put it best: ""Internet Kills the Video Store."" But Dan Herbert, author of the forthcoming book ""Videoland"" and a film professor at the University of Michigan, wants to praise Blockbuster, not bury it. The stores were clean and family-friendly, with wider aisles and a bigger emphasis on movie selection than the mom-and-pops that dotted the landscape in the 1980s, he said. ""They really standardized video rental in general,"" Herbert said. As with many franchises, at its height Blockbuster often came in for criticism. The chain put many mom-and-pop stores out of business. Befitting its name, it generally catered to a blockbuster mentality: Hit releases filled shelves by the dozens, but independent and foreign-language films could be hard to come by. The stores wouldn't carry NC-17 films at all. And then there was the Blockbuster clerk, easily recognized in a blue knit shirt, who was often depicted as either clueless or snotty, depending on how frustrated you were on those crowded Friday nights. But Herbert, a former video clerk himself -- though not at Blockbuster -- points out that Blockbuster was successful for a reason. It had more variety than many video stores: Blockbuster stores were required to have a minimum of 7,000 movies and averaged 10,000, more than many of its competitors, he said. By doing so, it opened up more of America to more movies (and, later, TV show collections). Even though Blockbuster itself primarily stuck to cities and suburbs, it became a model for other chains that opened stores in small towns. Playing catch-up . If people compared Blockbuster to McDonald's, that wasn't necessarily a knock, said Herbert. ""They self-consciously modeled themselves on McDonald's, and at various points hired members of McDonald's upper management,"" he said. But over the last decade, business took one hit after another. In a September article, The Billfold's Christopher Tucker described how independent video stores were put out of business. The same trends affected Blockbuster. First there were DVDs, which were relatively inexpensive and intended for purchase, especially compared to the VHS titles that cost stores up to $100 a pop. With the advent of broadband, people started downloading movies and shows -- not always legally. Netflix and Redbox used the slim size of DVDs to their advantage. And finally, ""Hulu was launched, and your average Joe and Josephine were introduced to Cloud Media,"" Tucker said. Even Blockbuster's late fees came back to bite the chain in an unlikely way. In 1997, a man named Reed Hastings returned a late copy of ""Apollo 13"" to his local Blockbuster. He was assessed a $40 fee. Two years later, he founded Netflix. Blockbuster was caught flat-footed by many of these changes. It could have purchased Netflix for $50 million in 2000, but passed. As Netflix rose, Blockbuster's attempts to compete on Netflix's terms -- especially  through the mail -- foundered. It also tried to compete with Redbox using standalone kiosks. That didn't work, either. By the time Blockbuster was sold to DISH in 2011, it was down to 1,700 stores, more than 7,000 fewer than its peak just seven years earlier. People had long since started devoting their Friday nights to streaming and downloading at home -- and if they were heading out, it wasn't to a Blockbuster. The Onion, of course, nailed it. In a 2008 video headlined ""Historic 'Blockbuster' Store Offers Glimpse Of How Movies Were Rented In The Past,"" the satiric site showcased a Michigan venue that ""aims to transport visitors to a time before the Internet."" Like a version of Colonial Williamsburg, it had actors playing clerks and customers who described how the rental process worked. Onlookers watched the performance, stunned. ""It's really amazing that people had to go through so much just to get a movie,"" says a visitor in the skit.","Blockbuster climbed high in the 1990s on the videotape-rental business .
The company announced Wednesday it would close its remaining U.S. stores .

"Washington (CNN) -- A political summit between President Barack Obama and congressional leaders Tuesday yielded further talks on how to extend Bush-era tax breaks scheduled to expire at the end of the year, as well as an acknowledgement from Obama that he needs to reach out more to Republicans. The meeting, dubbed by some the ""Slurpee summit"" for a campaign dig by Obama at congressional Republicans, involved the president and leaders of both parties from the House and Senate. It came in the aftermath of the November midterm election in which Republicans took control of the House and gained six seats in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Originally proposed by Obama as a half-day event that could extend into dinner, the meeting was postponed once by Republican leaders and ended up lasting about two hours. Afterward, Obama and Republican leaders said they wanted to work together, but they also made clear that sharp differences exist on major issues. ""There are real philosophical differences, deeply held principles to which each party holds,"" Obama said. ""And although the atmosphere in today's meeting was extremely civil, there's no doubt that those differences are going to remain no matter how many meetings we have."" Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the expected incoming House speaker, said the fact that the meeting was civil did not guarantee success or progress. ""We've had a lot of nice meetings,"" Boehner said. ""The question is whether we can find common ground."" Both Obama and congressional Republicans emphasized the talks on the tax cut issue as a major issue in the meeting. ""That process is beginning right away, and we expect to get some answers back in the next couple of days,"" Obama said. However, he cautioned that both parties still have deep disagreements, even as they attempt to find ""sensible common ground"" on the tax provisions. Boehner said talks involving the treasury secretary, White House budget officials and members of Congress from both parties will examine the tax issue. The congressional negotiators will be Sen. Max Baucus of Montana and Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland for the Democrats, with Sen. Jon Kyl of Arizona and Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan for the Republicans. However, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky indicated that there is little leeway in the GOP stance, saying that all Senate Republicans and some Democrats want all the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 to be extended. Obama and the Senate Republicans described the talks as civil and frank. Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia said he was encouraged that Obama acknowledged that he should have reached out more to Republicans in his first two years in office and that Tuesday's meeting would be the first in a series of discussions on working together. Boehner also said Obama conceded not spending enough time working with Republicans. During the election campaign, Obama and Democrats repeatedly characterized Republicans as obstructionists with a policy of opposition to everything proposed by Democrats in order to score political points. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs confirmed that Obama told the GOP leaders that he needed to do a better job in seeking consensus. ""I think the president laid out that in order for us to work together, we're going to have to communicate,"" Gibbs said. ""The president was pretty clearly in acknowledging that he needed to do better, and he would."" Asked whether Obama was bending to Republicans by saying he needed to reach out more to them, Gibbs said: ""I'm not sure I call that bending; I call that trying to work together."" In remarks after the event, Obama said he invited Republican and Democratic leaders to meet with him again several times in the future, including one summit at Camp David. On the tax cut issue, Obama has called for Congress to extend the lower tax rates for most Americans before they expire December 31. The president's proposal would extend the lower rates for people earning up to $200,000 a year or families earning up to $250,000 while allowing the rates for those earning more to return to the higher levels of the 1990s. Republicans want the lower tax rates extended for all Americans regardless of income level. A possible compromise floated by Democrats would raise the income threshold for the lower rates to those earning up to $1 million. McConnell said Republicans oppose differing policies for different taxpayers, based on income. ""It is the view of 100 percent of Senate republicans and a number of Senate Democrats as well that ... we ought to treat all tax rates the same,"" McConnell said. Another issue expected to come up at the meeting was a new nuclear arms treaty with Russia. The START treaty, which requires Senate approval, would resume mutual inspections of U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each. Obama has called approval of the treaty an immediate priority, saying it's critical to national security and a cornerstone of U.S.-Russian relations. However, 10 GOP senators -- led by Kyl -- have urged a delay until the next Congress over concerns about the current Senate workload and the need to modernize the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In particular, Kyl and McConnell complain that Senate Democrats want to push through Democratic proposals in the current lame-duck session before their larger majority goes down in the new Congress in January. McConnell said Tuesday that issues such as repealing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy banning openly gay and lesbian soldiers and the DREAM Act -- which would create a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who came to the country as children and get a college degree or complete two years of military service -- were less important than the tax rate issue and a needed agreement on government funding for the rest of the fiscal year, which expires at the end of September. Gibbs, however, said Obama and Democrats believe that all of the pending issues are important to Americans and that there is plenty of time for the Senate to take them up in the lame-duck session that runs through December. Boehner and McConnell, in a piece that appeared on The Washington Post website Tuesday, said Republicans and Democrats can work together. ""The clock may be winding down on this session of Congress, but there is still time to do the right thing,"" the opinion article stated. ""If President Obama and Democratic leaders put forward a plan during the lame-duck session to cut spending and stop the tax hikes on all Americans, they can count on a positive response from Republicans. If the president and Democratic leaders don't act before the end of the year, however, House and Senate Republicans will work to get the job done in the new Congress. But we hope it doesn't come to that."" During midterm election campaigning, Obama often used a car analogy to describe his efforts, backed by congressional Democrats, to help the U.S. economy recover from a recession they inherited. His stump speech described Democrats working to ""dig the car out of the ditch"" while Republicans sat back ""sipping on a Slurpee,"" a frozen drink. When Obama originally proposed the meeting with congressional leaders, White House reporters immediately called it a ""Slurpee summit."" ""Let's hope the president will be willing to work with us to cut spending, stop the tax hikes and get our economy working again,"" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said this month. ""Then we can all go get Slurpees together."" CNN's Ed Henry, Tom Cohen and Dana Bash contributed to this report.","NEW: Party leaders name negotiators for tax talks .

"(CNN)In June of 1960, my father was a 14-year-old Cuban boy with a round-trip airline ticket from Havana to Madrid, Spain. He spent the summer with family in Spain while Cuba fell deeper and deeper into Fidel Castro's revolution. He didn't realize the extent to which his life back home was quickly crumbling and that the winds of revolution were about to change his life forever. At the end of that summer, my grandfather told his son that he would not be coming home; that he should stay in Spain and wait for the rest of the family to join him.  It was a long wait. It would take my grandfather more than 10 years to get out of Cuba. I've always wondered if that summer vacation was part of my grandfather's plan to make sure that my father would not be trapped in socialist Cuba. Maybe if my father had known he wasn't coming back home, he would have put up a fight to stay in Havana. My mother recently found that unused airline ticket sitting in a box of my father's things. The ticket to a flight that never happened is a heartbreaking slice of family history still frozen in time. For many Americans, the reaction to the news that the United States and Cuba have announced plans to normalize relations was, ""It's about time."" For many Americans, Cuba is nothing more than a forbidden playground with cigars, rum, beautiful beaches and baseball players. They want to experience a taste of this island trapped in time. They want to see the classic American cars rolling through the streets of Old Havana. To the families of Cuban exiles, the island is much more. It's a complex and sad reality. Cuba is not a novelty or an unchecked box on a bucket list. Cuba is the rhythmic heartbeat of a life lost long ago but still beating in our souls. Castro's revolution split my family apart like so many others. I still have extended family in Cuba. I've had only a few chances to spend time with them. (I've worked as a journalist twice in Cuba, covering Pope John Paul II's visit in 1998 and former President Jimmy Carter's visit in 2002.) I'm the only person in my family who has traveled to Cuba since most of my family left. All my life, I've wondered if this historic moment would ever come in my lifetime. In my mind, it was supposed to be a moment like the Berlin Wall coming down; a highly anticipated event the world would watch together. But instead, the news seemed to come out of thin air on the week before Christmas. Unexpected and unpredictable, that's the way it always seems to be with Cuba. Hard times for ordinary Cubans . With normalized relations, many people want to see a boom of foreign investment, led by Americans flocking to a place that's been locked behind the gates of the Cold War for more than 50 years. But I ask you to understand, as best as I can explain, the fear and apprehension this news means to many Cuban exiles. People often tell me that they'd love to travel to Cuba because it seems like such a fun place. I tell them of my uncle who, well into his old age, would wake up at 4 in the morning to get in line for a ration of bread. I remember the first time I visited Cuba, I watched my uncle come home with a piece of bread that had more in common with a hockey puck. I couldn't believe that my elderly uncle would wake up every morning to stand in line for that. People often tell me they want to walk the streets of Old Havana and see the crumbling buildings. I tell them of the countless young girls who work as ""jineteras"" -- slang for Cuban prostitutes -- to help earn money for their families who live crammed inside those walls. It's sickening to think that so many men from around the world come to Cuba for just this reason. These are the kinds of things Cuban exile families think about when they think of Cuba. It's overwhelming sadness. There's a very privileged class in Cuba. The families of those in power live a life that rivals that of the most comfortable Americans. So when Cuban exiles hear of normalizing relations, they worry that it's Cuba's privileged class that will benefit the most at the expense of ordinary Cubans. Fear that the status quo will prevail . Many Cuban exiles feel that the Castro regime has won the war for more than 50 years and that normalizing relations is another victory for a corrupt and evil dictatorship. ""They always win"" is a common sentiment among Cuban exiles who have such a distrust of the Castro regime. Many exiles fear a wrong move will provide another victory for a dictatorship that took so much from them. For more than 50 years, Cuba's story has surprised and saddened many exiles and their families, and we can't help but fear history will repeat itself. We see family and friends left behind on the island who've spent decades fighting and scraping for the most meager of lives. ""No es facil,"" said President Obama, the Spanish phrase often used to describe life in Cuba. It translates to life ""is not easy."" And that's putting it mildly. Perhaps it's inevitable that U.S. and other foreign investment will swoop into Cuba one day. Maybe it's just a matter of time before a McDonald's restaurant sits on the Malecon, Havana's famous oceanfront boulevard just 90 miles from South Florida. Or maybe Americans will rush in to buy up oceanfront property with amazing views on the most beautiful beaches of Cuba. But I ask you this: What kind of view will ordinary Cubans get? My father didn't live long enough to see this moment. My grandparents aren't here to see it either. And most in my family have mixed emotions about what this will really mean. This Christmas, we'll argue about it over black beans and rice and roasted pork. The children of Cuban exiles, like me, all dream of walking the streets of Cuba with our parents and grandparents to finally feel that rhythmic beat of our Cuban soul that still sits in our hearts.","Many Americans see Cuba as a playground of cigars, rum, beautiful beaches and baseball .
But the Cuban revolution broke up families, and there's a big gap between nation's rich and poor .

"President Vladimir Putin's news conferences aren't at all like news conferences I used to attend in Washington, when I covered the White House. First, there are the stuffed animals. Since there are more than 1,200 journalists in the giant hall, they have to attract President Putin's attention some way, so some bring stuffed animals, raise home-made signs, or wear T-shirts specially printed up to advertise the region or news organization they come from. Then there's the length of the conference. This one was the usual length -- three and a half hours. Others have been longer. This was Vladimir Putin's 10th news conference and it couldn't have happened at a worse time. As the Russians say, the smell of kerosene was in the air. The value of the Russian currency, the ruble, was dropping like a stone, the U.S. and Europe were just announcing yet more sanctions, Russia was on the verse of a recession, but the president refused to call it a ""crisis."" Striding into the hall, Putin appeared cool, calm and collected. Close-ups of the president's face were broadcast on two giant screens on either side of the hall, his every glance, every gesture visible. Putin's first challenge was to assure his fellow citizens that Russia can overcome what he called an ""unfavorable scenario"" and he promised that would happen -- in two years, maybe less. There was no real mea culpa for Russia's economic predicament. Putin admitted only that the Russian Central Bank and the government could have reacted more quickly to the economic challenges. Instead, he blamed Russia's economic woes on ""external"" factors, asserting that economic sanctions account for just ""25 to 30%"" of Russia's economic problems. When a BBC reporter asked him about a ""new"" Cold War, Putin leaned forward like an athlete, insisting that that Russia is simply defending its own interests. Moscow, he said, has only two military bases outside its territory but the U.S. has bases ""all over the world."" They told us there would be no NATO expansion, he complained, and now the West is building new virtual walls around Russia. Putin is adept at turning the tables. One journalist asked him about reprisals by Chechen authorities against the families of alleged terrorists, accusing Russia's government-financed TV channels of igniting hatred in society. Putin quickly pointed to the torture report just released by the White House. The U.S. he said, ""legalized torture"" and even developed a method for carrying it out. ""How do you explain that?"" he asked indignantly. Putin spoke for several minutes on the image of the Russian ""bear."" The West, he claimed, won't leave the bear in peace, but wants to ""chain"" it, ""de-claw it,"" unless it sits obediently in the forest, eating berries. If there was one promising note, it was the Russian president's statement that the conflict in eastern Ukraine should be settled peacefully. He acknowledged that there were Russians in eastern Ukraine, but they were ""volunteers."" Surprisingly, the president called on some journalists who are not known as being friendly to the Kremlin and there were some uncomfortable questions. When Putin said there's a ""fine line"" between the opposition and a ""Fifth Column"" -- in other words, traitors to Russia -- reporters twice followed up with pointed questions, including a demand that he name those members of the ""Fifth Column."" He did not. Others asked him what is the salary of Igor Sechin, head of the Russian oil giant Rosneft? He said he didn't know. In one of the most dramatic questions, a Russian reporter asked Putin if he is worried that members of his inner circle could carry out a ""palace coup?"" Putin, who in spite of his somewhat fierce image abroad, does have a sense of humor, defused the question with a smile. ""We can't have a palace coup because we have no palaces,"" he said. Stability is based on support of the Russian people, he said, and ""the people believe we are acting in their interest.""","Putin's first challenge was to assure Russians they can overcome an ""unfavorable scenario""

"A 7.3 magnitude earthquake rumbled early Saturday in the Pacific Ocean about 200 miles east of Japan's main island, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The Japanese Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami advisory for the Japanese coastal areas including the Fukushima prefecture, warning people to leave the coast."" The same organization canceled all such advisories and warnings a short time later. Sea levels might change slightly in some coastal locales, but no damage from a tsunami was expected, according to the agency. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no widespread tsunami threat around the greater Pacific region. Saturday's quake happened at about 2:10 a.m. local time, with an epicenter about 203 miles east-northeast of Tokyo, the USGS said. The quake hit at a depth of about six miles. The Fukushima prefecture was where a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami damaged several nuclear reactors in March 2011. More than 15,000 people were killed in that quake and tsunami, and material damage related to the incident was estimated to be about $300 billion.","Japanese agency cancels tsunami warnings and advisories .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- Those who knew Nidal Malik Hasan before he was a major in the Army -- and the suspect in last week's mass killing at Fort Hood -- say he was long known for militant Islamist views. Doctors who crossed paths with Hasan in medical programs paint a picture of a subpar student who wore his religious views on his sleeve. Several doctors who knew Hasan spoke to CNN, but only on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation of the shooting, which left 12 soldiers and one civilian dead and dozens of other people wounded. Hasan, an Army psychiatrist who faces 13 counts of premeditated murder, ""was clearly espousing Islamist ideology"" during his time as a medical student at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, one of his former classmates told CNN. Hasan's family has revealed little about him, saying in media interviews that Hasan was a ""good American"" and a lifelong Muslim who complained he was harassed in the Army because of his religion. His former classmates describe a much more militant Hasan. His presentations for school were often laced with extremist Muslim views, one source said. ""Is your allegiance to Sharia law or the United States?"" students once challenged Hasan, the source said. ""Sharia law,"" Hasan responded, according to the source. The incident was corroborated by another doctor who was present. The source recalled another instance in which Hasan was asked if the U.S. Constitution was a brilliant document. Hasan replied, ""No, not particularly,"" according to the source. The former classmate told CNN that he voiced concerns about Hasan to supervisors at the school. A second former medical school colleague of Hasan said several people raised concerns about Hasan's overall competence. Even though Hasan earned his medical degree and residency, some of his fellow students believed Hasan ""didn't have the intellect"" to be in the program and was not academically rigorous in his coursework. Hasan ""was not fit to be in the military, let alone in the mental health profession,"" this classmate told CNN. ""No one in class would ever have referred a patient to him or trusted him with anything."" The first classmate echoed this sentiment. Hasan was ""coddled, accommodated and pushed through that masters of public health despite substandard performance,"" the classmate said. He was ""put in the fellowship program because they didn't know what to do with him."" The second classmate said he witnessed at least two of Hasan's PowerPoint discussions that included what he described as extremist views. In these presentations, which were supposed to be about health, Hasan justified suicide bombings and spoke about the persecution of Muslims in the Middle East, in the United States and in the U.S. military, the source said. Some in the crowd rolled their eyes or muttered under their breath, he said, and others were clearly uncomfortable. Those in the audience, which included program supervisors, did not loudly object to Hasan's presentations, but did complain to their higher-ups afterward. The supervisors expressed ""appreciation, understanding and agreement"" that the complaints would be discussed, but it was unclear what action, if any, came, the source said. When the classmate challenged Hasan personally, Hasan dodged the questions, the source said. Despite the controversy that his schoolwork created, classmates did not view Hasan as mentally unstable or psychotic, the source said. Questions remain over how much Hasan's behavior and actions in school were reflected in his personnel files. Col. Kimberly Kesling, deputy commander of Clinical Services for Darnell Medical Center at Fort Hood and Hasan's supervisor at the post, told reporters last week that Hasan was doing a good job in Texas. ""As a supervisor, I am aware of the job performance of people coming into our organization, that is part of our credentialing process,"" Kesling said. ""The types of things that were reported to me via his evaluation report were things that concerned me, but did not raise red flags toward this [the shootings] in any way, shape, or form."" ""His evaluation reports said that he had some difficulties in his residency, fitting into his residency, and we worked very hard to integrate him into our practice and into our organization, and he adapted very well, was doing a really good job for us,"" she said. Prompted by reports of former classmates, however, Army investigators would like to speak with people who have had contact with Hasan and who may have information about his activities and behavior, Maj. Gen Kevin Bergner, head of U.S. Army public affairs, said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates weighed in on the information surfacing about Hasan. ""I deplore the leaks that have taken place,"" he said on a trip to Oshkosh, Wisconsin. People are talking about ""what they know, which is one small piece of the puzzle."" ""They don't know whether or not what they're leaking might jeopardize a potential criminal investigation and trial,"" he said. ""People who have a piece of this, frankly, ought to keep quiet and let the authorities go forward on this in an organized and comprehensive way,"" Gates said. Hasan came under investigation last year when his contacts with radical imam Anwar al-Awlaki were intercepted by terrorism investigators monitoring the cleric's communications, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. An employee of the Defense Department's Criminal Investigative Services, assigned to the Joint Terrorism Task Force, decided to drop the investigation after reviewing the intercepted communications and Hasan's personnel files. Hasan remained hospitalized Thursday from gunshot wounds he received from two police officers who responded to last week's shooting. CNN's Brian Todd and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","NEW: Defense Secretary Gates: Leaks should stop, because they might jeopardize probe .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea will ""firmly"" respond to future provocations from North Korea, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said Monday, declaring that his nation ""cannot remain patient"" in the face of continued hostility from Pyongyang. ""Fellow citizens, at this point, actions are more important than words,"" Lee said in a televised address Monday morning. ""Please have trust in the government and the military and support us."" The divided peninsula -- tense at the best of times -- has been near the boiling point since Tuesday, when four people died in a North Korean artillery barrage that targeted the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong. Lee called that attack an ""inhuman crime"" that followed decades of previous attacks from North Korea, including the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March. ""It is difficult at this point to expect North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons or military adventurism,"" he said. ""We are now clearly aware that we cannot stay patient and be generous. That will only give rise to bigger provocations."" Lee's address came a day after South Korean and U.S. forces started joint military exercises Sunday, prompting a furious response from North Korea. The aircraft carrier USS George Washington is set to join South Korea's forces near the coasts of China and North Korea for the four-day drill, which the North called ""no more than an attempt to find a pretext for aggression and ignite a war at any cost,"" according to the official Korean Central News Agency. China, North Korea's closest ally, called Sunday for an emergency meeting of the six major powers involved in talks about the Korean peninsula. Top diplomats from the six nations -- which also include Japan, the United States and Russia -- need to meet soon to ""maintain peace and stability on the peninsula and ease the tension"" in the region, Beijing's special representative for the region, Wu Dawei, said Sunday. A top Chinese envoy met with Lee on Sunday, and a high-ranking North Korean official will visit Beijing this week, China's Xinhua news agency said. South Korea said Sunday it did not think the time was right for a resumption of the six-party talks, but said it would ""bear in mind"" the Chinese proposal. In Washington, meanwhile, a State Department spokesperson told CNN that it is consulting with its allies, but resumed six-party talks ""cannot substitute for action by North Korea to comply with its obligations."" ""Clear steps by North Korea are needed to demonstrate a change of behavior,"" said the spokesperson, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. And U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday that the flare-up exposed the failure of ""continued appeasment"" of North Korea by Republican and Democratic administrations. He said the United States has given North Korea more than $1 billion in aid over the past 15 years with the goal of getting them to the negotiating table. ""It seems the purpose of everything is to get the North Koreans to the table,"" said McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""The North Koreans' only claim to their position on the world stage is their nuclear capability. And they have a terrible, most repressive, oppressive regime in the world. They have hundreds of thousands of people in slave labor camps. And all of that seems to be sacrificed in the altar of, quote, 'negotiations.'"" In his Monday speech, South Korea's Lee said efforts to resolve the international standoff through negotiations and humanitarian assistance to the North were met with ""nuclear development and the sinking of the Cheonan."" He said the attack on Yeonpyeong Island would have been unlawful even in wartime, adding, ""I cannot but be angered at their cruelty."" North Korea said the South provoked the attack because shells from a South Korean millitary drill landed in the North's waters. And it has consistently denied responsibility for the sinking of the Cheonan, which killed 46 South Korean sailors. A group of 124 people left Yeonpyeong Island by boat Sunday. The South Korean defense ministry is urging journalists to leave the island voluntarily because of the instability, the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Seoul said Sunday. The North called reports of civilian casualties part of South Korea's ""propaganda campaign"" and accused the ""enemy"" of creating ""a human shield by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation."" The violence has sparked anger and political turmoil in South Korea. The country's defense minister, Kim Tae-young resigned after the exchange of fire, and veterans of the South Korean military protested Saturday on the streets of Seoul, stating they were angry that their country's government had not done enough to respond to the North's shelling. The tense maritime border between the two Koreas has become the major military flashpoint on the Korean peninsula in recent years. The Yeonpyeong attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting. North and South Korea are still technically at war. Journalists Andrew Salmon and Jiyeon Lee and CNN's Stan Grant and Tim Schwarz contributed to this report.","NEW: Lee condemns last week's shelling as an ""inhuman crime""

"Washington (CNN) -- In what resembled more a revival than a political rally, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck urged the large crowds at his ""Restoring Honor"" event Saturday to ""turn back to God"" and return America to the values on which it was founded. ""Something beyond imagination is happening,"" he told participants who packed the National Mall in Washington. ""America today begins to turn back to God. For too long, this country has wandered in darkness."" The rally drew fire for its timing and location. People filled the park by the Lincoln Memorial's reflecting pool, in the shadows and echoes of the most pivotal civil rights address in America's history -- the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech, which he delivered there 47 years ago. Some of those who marched with King said Beck had usurped the day for his own political gain. The Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN that Beck was mimicking King and ""humiliating the tradition."" Other civil rights activists gathered nearby with the Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network in a ""Reclaim the Dream"" rally. Participants marched from a high school in northwest Washington, D.C., to the site of the future Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial, just a few blocks from the Lincoln Memorial. Beck said the site of his rally was appropriate to reflect on the legacy of King, ""the man who stood down on those stairs and gave his life for everyone's right to have a dream."" A hero to many conservative voters across the country, Beck said his rally was nonpolitical and its mission was to honor American troops. He struck a spiritual tone throughout the day, saying his role was to wake America up to the backsliding of principles, values and most importantly, faith. Earlier, he said ""God dropped a giant sandbag on his head"" to push him to organize the event. ""Look forward. Look West. Look to the heavens. Look to God and make your choice,"" he said. ""Do we no longer believe in the power of the individual? Do we no longer believe in dreams?"" Beck, keenly aware of his critics, opened the rally shortly after 10 a.m. with the national anthem and immediately drew attention to the large crowd that stretched for six city blocks from the Lincoln Memorial along the parks surrounding the reflecting pool. ""I have just gotten word from the media that there are over 1,000 people here today,"" Beck said sarcastically. ""We are humbled that you are here,"" he said. ""The reflecting pool holds about 200,000 people. This field back here holds about 250- to 300,000 people. They are not only full here, they're full in that field, they're full behind me, and they are now across the street approaching the Washington Monument."" Tea Party activists from across the country attended the event. Speakers included former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, a Fox News contributor, who said she came to speak not about politics but as ""something more"" -- as the mother of a soldier. She said America's men and women in uniform exemplified the virtues and values of America. ""Say what you want to say about me, but I raised a combat vet and you can't take that away from me,"" she said to a crowd that broke out in chants of ""U.S.A! U.S.A!"" She also noted the anniversary of the famous civil rights speech, saying, ""We feel the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."" ""We are so honored to stand here today,"" Palin added. Rally organizers said Saturday's event was not political and asked participants not to carry signs, unlike past Tea Party demonstrations. The atmosphere Saturday was almost festival-like and participants were careful to say: ""We're not angry."" Sue Maliszewski of Phoenix, New York, described herself as not conservative but someone who feels that her beliefs are no longer reflected in government. ""I believe that we are dysfunctional as a country,"" she said. ""I believe it's hopeless unless we get back to our roots,"" Maliszewski added. ""And that means our faith, and it means, reorganize our time. We have been so busy earning a living and raising our children that we have let different small groups overpower our opinions. And we're here to ... reclaim what's wonderful about this country."" Beck had been heavily promoting the event on his Fox News Channel program and on his radio broadcasts. He said that the timing of the rally wasn't intentional. ""It was not my intention to select 8-28 because of the Martin Luther King tie. It is the day he made that speech. I had no idea until I announced it,"" he said on his radio show in June, soon after the announcement of the rally. ""Whites don't own Abraham Lincoln. Blacks don't own Martin Luther King. Those are American icons, American ideas, and we should just talk about character, and that's really what this event is about. It's about honoring character,"" Beck said. Alveda King, a niece of the late civil rights leader, also participated in the ""Restoring Honor"" rally, saying that her uncle would have approved of the event. ""If Uncle Martin could be here today, he would sure commend us of giving honor where honor is due,"" she told a large, cheering crowd. King said earlier she's been accused of hijacking ""the dream,"" but on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Friday night, she said ""the dream"" is in her genes. ""I don't have to reclaim the civil rights movement, I'm part of the civil rights movement,"" she said, noting her family's home and her father's church were bombed when she was younger. While the NAACP put out a cautious statement regarding the rally, there has been plenty of criticism of the event. Lenny McAllister, an African American Republican, was asked by the Tea Party to speak at Saturday's rally but declined. He said the rally was disrespectful to the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. ""I cannot sit on stage and co-sign on this irresponsibility,"" he said. ""I made sure I wore my elephant pin today. I am a proud Republican but I am also a proud African American man."" But Lloyd Marcus, another black Republican, said he supported Beck's efforts. ""Go Beck,"" he said. ""This is a fantastic rally and the people there don't give a hoot about race."" CNN's Paul Steinhauser, Kate Bolduan and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","America today begins to turn back to God, conservative talk show host Glenn Beck tells the crowd .

"(CNN)In space there's no atmosphere, it's never cloudy, and in geosynchronous orbits it's never night: a perfect place for a solar power station to harvest uninterrupted power 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The concept has been around since the 1940s when science fiction writer Isaac Asimov posited the idea of a robot-manned space station that delivered energy to Earth via microwaves. Today, the idea is less science fiction than a steadily advancing reality. Clean energy from above . The United States, China, India and Japan all have projects at various stages of development that would see robots assemble solar arrays that could provide the Earth with massive amounts of clean and renewable energy delivered wirelessly. Some variants of the idea could even see as much as 1GW of energy beamed to receivers on Earth -- enough to power a large city. According to Dr Paul Jaffe, spacecraft engineer at the US Naval Research Laboratory, the concept is scientifically sound. ""NASA and the US Department of Energy did a study in the late 70s that cost $20 million at the time and looked at it in pretty great depth,"" Dr Jaffe told CNN. ""The conclusion at that time was that there was nothing wrong with the physics but the real question is the economics."" The cost lies in the number of space launches required to build the power-transmitting satellite. With costs as high as $40,000 per kilogram for some space launches, the final price-tag for the first space-based solar power station could be as high as $20 billion. Private contractors . While the recent entry of private space companies stands significantly to cut costs, basic physics dictates that getting payloads into space is still an expensive undertaking. ""The subject is revisited every 10 years when the technology changes and some of the factors affecting the economics change."" He said the wars in the Middle East gave new impetus to the space-based solar power as scientific researchers with the military wrestled with the problems of delivering energy to troops in hostile areas. Multiple, and potentially hidden, receivers could tap space-based solar power and relieve the military of the expensive and often dangerous task of supplying troops with generator diesel by either road or air, he said. ""If you could deliver electricity from space, that would be kind of attractive,"" he said. Safety concerns . Two proven ways of getting the power to Earth exist in the form of either laser beams or microwaves. The laser beam option would involve sending small laser-transmitting satellites into space at the relatively low cost of between $500 million and $1 billion. The self-assembling satellite would lower costs and the small diameter of the laser beam would make it easier to collect on the ground. But at just 1MW to 10MW per satellite, many satellites would be needed to provide enough energy. As well as this, laser transmitting satellites would have difficulty beaming power through clouds and rain. The microwave option would have the advantage of uninterrupted transmission through rain, hail or any other atmospheric conditions and could provide gigawatts of power. Microwave technology, Dr Jaffe explained, has been established for decades: as early as 1964, scientists were able to power a helicopter using microwaves. Dr Jaffe said with a large receiving area the energy from the microwaves was so dissipated that it would present no danger to life. The chief disadvantage, however, is the fact that as many as 100 launches into space would be required to construct the space stations with costs running into tens of billions. ""Unfortunately, too, from a public relations standpoint, both microwaves and lasers have negative connotations for most people because they associate microwaves with the oven in their kitchen and lasers with science fiction space battles,"" Dr Jaffe said. The power sandwich . His research is currently concentrated on the so-called ""sandwich module"" -- the part of the solar array that actually converts the sunlight into power. One side of the 'sandwich' receives solar energy with a photovoltaic panel, electronics in the middle convert the current into a radio frequency and the other side has an antenna to beam it away. ""People might not associate radio waves with carrying energy,"" says Jaffe, ""because they think of them for communications, like radio, TV, or cell phones. They don't think about them as carrying usable amounts of power."" Despite the technology already being available for space-based solar power, Dr Jaffe believes the first space power station is still decades away even though the Japanese have already made it one of the pillars of their space program. ""Without the similar research base that we have in the United States for, say, fusion energy it's unlikely to make meaningful progress,"" he said. ""If the Japanese make progress in the next five years people might start to notice and say 'Why aren't we doing that here.' Ultimately, he said, space-based solar energy is like most novel ideas. ""It's hard to tell if it's nuts until you've actually tried."" Read more from Tomorrow Transformed: . Wind farms of the future go underwater . Is the Darknet a glimpse into the web of the future?

"In Texas, where voters will go to the polls on Tuesday, politics can be brutal. Case in point: the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. It's rough and dirty and personal. And, whether it ends Tuesday or continues on to a run-off on July 28, it could blow up all the bridges that Republicans in Texas built over the years to Hispanic voters. This is because, in the 11th hour, the primary went down a muddy road. That is, if you think that accusing a candidate with a Spanish surname of favoring ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants -- with no evidence to back it up -- is hitting below the belt because it raises questions about divided loyalties and feeds into the perception that all Hispanics favor open borders and unlimited immigration. No kidding. There are those Americans who are convinced that Hispanics are working behind lines to help Mexico reclaim the Southwest in an elaborate ""reconquista."" The impact of the 'Latino vote' beyond Texas . I remember the reader who, sweet as you please, wrote to tell me: ""I think most people who read your columns understand that you're pro-Mexican invasion because you're Mexican."" U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz is not Mexican. Nor is he Mexican-American. He is Cuban-American. And a funny thing happened to him on his way to Washington. After months of campaigning as a generic, run-of-the-mill, appeal-to-the-base Republican, Cruz was hit by a negative radio ad put up by a super PAC that supports his opponent, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. The spot claimed that Cruz supports giving the undocumented a pathway to earned legal status (""amnesty"" in right-wing parlance) as evidenced by the fact that he sits on the advisory boards of two business groups that support that view. The ad charges: ""Cruz helps run two national organizations that have been leading the push to give amnesty to illegal immigrants."" Opinion: How Romney can win over Latino voters . That sounds awfully thin. I've known Cruz for about 10 years, and I couldn't tell you what his immigration views are. I do know that, during this campaign, he has lurched to the right in order to snuggle up to the tea party and that he said during one interview that he ""categorically opposes amnesty."" But what does that mean, anyway? According to polls, most Americans oppose amnesty. The concept is all about getting something for nothing. Most of the immigration proposals being bandied about in Washington offer something in exchange for something else. Political Ticker: Santorum endorses Cruz in Texas Senate race . For me, the bigger issue is why this accusation was leveled at Cruz in the first place, let alone in the closing days of the GOP primary, when he couldn't do much to respond. It's not like the former Texas solicitor general and graduate of Harvard Law School is considered soft on illegal immigration by any means. Rather, he is pro enforcement with a capital ""p."" In fact, while serving as the state's chief litigator, Cruz took on the George W. Bush administration, the World Court, and 90 foreign nations who challenged Texas' right to execute an illegal immigrant who had raped and murdered two teenagers in the state -- and he won. So why target Cruz with this kind of slimy attack? The only explanation is that someone at the pro-Dewhurst super PAC cynically thought an accusation of being ""pro-amnesty"" would be especially explosive aimed at a Hispanic candidate because it feeds into existing prejudices. That might well be, but this is short-term thinking. I doubt that the strategist thought about the effect an ad like this is likely to have on any Hispanics who might be considering voting Republican. It makes it less likely. Rubio on voter ID laws and Latinos: 'What's the big deal?' That's what makes this story so perplexing. This is Texas, after all, where Republicans can't figure out whether they want to reach out to Latino voters -- or repel them. In one camp, you have Republicans like George W Bush, who achieved historic inroads with Hispanic voters both as governor and president and fought members of his own party to open the debate on immigration reform, and Rick Perry, who signed a law allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities and defended that decision on the national stage while running for president. In the other camp, you have the folks behind this ad, which could well include Dewhurst, who hasn't disavowed the spot. Republicans aren't unified, either on immigration policy or on the need to attract Hispanic voters. And they're not doing themselves any favors with lame stunts like this. They only wind up portraying themselves as unfriendly and unwelcoming. Whereas the GOP was once described as a big tent, today the party is more like a private club. And there is a guard at the door. That's true in Texas, but it's also true across the country. Republicans have to figure out -- and fast -- whether they see Hispanics as a foil or as their future. If they want to survive in a country that is becoming more Hispanic by the day, they had better choose the latter.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's family will not hold a public or private viewing of his body at the Neverland Ranch, a spokesman for the family said Wednesday. Graumann's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles is the scene of a makeshift Michael Jackson memorial Wednesday. ""Plans are under way regarding a public memorial for Michael Jackson, and we will announce those plans shortly,"" Ken Sunshine said in a written statement. Jackson's will, which was filed in court Wednesday and dated July 7, 2002, did not specify where he wished to be buried. Jackson placed his entire estate, which he estimated to be worth at least $500 million, in the Michael Jackson Family Trust, which was described in another document not filed in court. Sunshine's statement also said the Jackson family had just hired his public relations firm. Confusion and speculation spread in recent days over where and when a memorial service for Jackson might be held. Planning had been under way for a motorcade to carry Jackson's body from Los Angeles to the Neverland Ranch in Santa Barbara County, California, which state and local officials suggested would be difficult and costly. A public viewing at Neverland Ranch on Friday had also been under consideration, law enforcement sources said. The mother of Jackson's two oldest children was left out of Jackson's will. ""I have intentionally omitted to provide for my former wife, Deborah Rowe Jackson,"" the will said. The pop star died Thursday at age 50. While it will be up to a court to decide who gets custody of Jackson's three children, the singer chose his mother, Katherine Jackson, as their guardian. If Katherine Jackson, 79, is not living, Jackson said, ""I nominate Diana Ross as guardian."" The children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- have been placed under his mother's temporary guardianship. Jackson attorney John Branca, attorney Barry Siegel and John McClain, a music industry executive and longtime Jackson friend, were named as executors of the will.  Watch as the details of the will are revealed » . Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff held an emergency hearing Wednesday morning to consider a request to immediately turn over control of the estate to Branca and McClain. Beckloff decided there was no urgency to replace Katherine Jackson, whom he appointed temporary administrator this week. Another hearing has been set for next Monday. Branca and McClain issued a joint statement Wednesday: ""The most important element of Michael's will is his unwavering desire that his mother, Katherine, become the legal guardian for his three children. As we work to carry out Michael's instructions to safeguard both the future of his children as well as the remarkable legacy he left us as an artist we ask that all matters involving his estate be handled with the dignity and the respect that Michael and his family deserve."" The question of what killed Jackson last week has gone unanswered pending toxicology results. Fans across the globe Tuesday continued to mourn Jackson five days after the 50-year-old singer went into cardiac arrest. The Drug Enforcement Administration has joined the investigation into whether prescription drugs were involved in the death of singer Michael Jackson, a source told CNN. The source, who did not want to be identified because he cannot comment publicly on the matter, said DEA agents will be looking at various doctors involved with Jackson, their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply. In New York, thousands lined the streets Tuesday outside Harlem's Apollo Theater, the hall that helped launch Jackson's career. At 9, the singer won a 1967 Apollo amateur night showcase with his brothers. ""We left our house at 4 o'clock in the morning and got here at 9, and we were lucky to get here,"" said Angela Staples, who came from Pennsylvania with daughter Jasmine. For many of Jackson's fans, the cause of his death bore less significance than remembering his life. On Wednesday, the top nine positions on Billboard magazine's top pop catalog albums chart housed Jackson-related titles.  Watch how singer's death has spurred sales » . Jackson's hometown of Gary, Indiana, angled to have its favorite son buried there and planned a massive memorial service at a local ballpark in July. Gary Mayor Rudy Clay told a Chicago, Illinois, radio station Tuesday that he has been in contact with the Jackson family about the burial. A burial site could be near a proposed Jackson family museum and a performing arts center, said mayoral spokeswoman Lalosa Burns, who said Clay hadn't received any confirmation. Clay told WGN that he expects Jackson's body, at the least, will be taken to Gary for a July 10 memorial service at U.S. Steel Works ballpark. Jackson's father, Joe, has said Neverland Ranch has been ruled out as a burial site, but the family has given no public indication of where the singer's final resting place may be. Michael Jackson purchased Neverland Ranch -- named for the fictional world in J.M. Barrie's ""Peter Pan"" -- in 1987 and filled it with animals and amusement rides. Tom Barrack Jr., the billionaire who engineered Jackson's financial rescue last year and gained control of the ranch through his company, said the property's future will be discussed later.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republican presidential front-runner Sen. John McCain on Thursday defended his statement that U.S. troops could spend ""maybe 100"" years in Iraq -- saying he was referring to a military presence similar to what the nation already has in places like Japan, Germany and South Korea. Sen. John McCain defends his stance on troops in Iraq Thursday on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" This week, Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama both took McCain to task for the comments, saying that if he's elected he would continue what they call President Bush's failed policies in Iraq. ""It's not a matter of how long we're in Iraq, it's if we succeed or not,"" McCain said to CNN's Larry King. ""And both Sen. Obama and Clinton want to set a date for withdrawal -- that means chaos, that means genocide, that means undoing all the success we've achieved and al Qaeda tells the world they defeated the United States of America. ""I won't let that happen."" Last month, at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire, a crowd member asked McCain about a Bush statement that troops could stay in Iraq for 50 years. ""Maybe 100,"" McCain replied. ""As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, it's fine with me and I hope it would be fine with you if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al Qaeda is training, recruiting, equipping and motivating people every single day.""

""Well, I want them home within 60 days of my becoming president of the United States."" Obama took a similar tack. ""Sen. McCain said the other day that we might be mired for 100 years in Iraq -- which is reason enough not to give him four years in the White House,"" Obama has said on several occasions. McCain told King he thinks opponents are taking the quote out of context. He said any long-term troop presence in Iraq would depend on agreement from the Iraqi government. ""If they don't want to and we don't feel a need to do so, obviously, the whole thing is keyed to Americans being able to withdraw and come home with honor, not in defeat,"" he said. McCain was endorsed Thursday by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, once considered his fiercest rival for the GOP nomination. Former Arkansas Gov.

"Washington (CNN) -- A coalition of liberal and progressive groups, including unions and civil rights activists, rallied in Washington Saturday to press for good jobs, immigration and education reform and to make a show of strength one month out from midterm elections. The ""One Nation Working Together"" rally was held at the Lincoln Memorial, just five weeks after Tea Party enthusiasts met in Washington. NAACP President Ben Jealous told CNN the ""One Nation"" movement is not ""the alternative to the Tea Party, we're the antidote to the Tea Party."" Jealous said he welcomes Tea Party members, but takes issue with extremists in the movement who critics say harbor racist views. Still, Jealous says he invited a well-known conservative to speak at Saturday's rally. He refused to name the person, who did not address the group. It was not immediately clear why. Jealous said the coalition of liberal organizations came together to offer a positive alternative to negative rhetoric, and to demand better education and more economic opportunities. The ""One Nation"" movement, he said, would rather see jobs for 99 percent of Americans instead of tax cuts for one percent of Americans. ""We want America to be something that represents every kind of diversity in this country,"" said Sergio Sanchez, with the Farm Labor Organizing Committee, who attended the rally. ""We're here because we want to show that we have a presence and that we want America to head in the right direction."" The rally began with an Interfaith service at 11 a.m. ET. As the service started, crowds were already beginning to thicken at the National Mall near the Lincoln Memorial, where the rally took place. Rally signs range from benign to fiery. They include: ""The Left is What's Right,"" ""Stop Racism Now,"" We March for Hope Not Hate,"" ""Proud to be a Democrat,"" ""Stand with Obama,"" ""Silence GOP Lies,""""No Cuts to Social Security"" and ""Axis of Ignorance - Tea Party, Republicans, Fox News."" Organizers claim a wide range of supporters, some of whom are already associated with liberal causes -- like union workers, environmentalists, gay activists and student leaders. But ""One Nation"" also claims backing from less obvious quarters -- like senior citizens, veterans and faith leaders. The group's website sets out a list of basic principles and priorities. These include direct assistance for unemployed workers and assistance for small businesses and local governments trying to hire new workers; a minimum wage increase; health care reform; immigration policy changes; increased bankruptcy and foreclosure protection; and more money for education, from kindergarten through college. The rally comes on the heels of another rally by conservatives in August. Commentator Glenn Beck drew Tea Party activists to the Lincoln Memorial for his revival-style rally August 28. The timing and site of the rally provoked controversy among civil rights activists because it was on the 47th anniversary of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech and in the same place. Around noon Saturday, a variety of speakers and performers began to take the stage. The program mixed speeches by activists and orators with music, historical readings, and even video clips. Among those who spoke was the Rev. Al Sharpton, who used the opportunity to urge people to get involved and vote in the next election. ""We've got to get ready for the midterm exam. We can't stop in '08!"" he said to roaring applause.","""One Nation Working Together"" activists rally at the Lincoln Memorial .

"In the space of two weeks, two different courts have come to two different results in evaluating the legality of two similar voter identification laws. In Pennsylvania, a state trial judge upheld the newly enacted voter ID law under the state's constitution, while Thursday in Washington, a federal panel rejected Texas' similar ID law under the federal Voting Rights Act. Despite their differences, both courts were quite right to agree on a central proposition:  We really don't know how large an impact these voter ID laws will have on elections.  In the end, the question, both legal and moral, often boils down to who should have the burden of proof: Should states be forced to show their laws are justified because they prevent demonstrable fraud or should opponents be forced to show that the law prevents large numbers of people from voting? Voter ID cases often pit an invisible plaintiff against an imaginary problem.  It is difficult to find voters who absolutely cannot vote because of an ID law, just as it is challenging to find instances of the type of fraud such laws intend to prevent. The plaintiffs are invisible because very few people have the means to bring the federal case to challenge such laws but don't have the ability to navigate the barriers at the Department of Motor Vehicles to get an actual ID. Also, although we do know about 10% of Americans might not have the ID necessary to vote, we don't know how many won't vote specifically because of this extra burden, how many will be motivated to get an ID or how many will resort to absentee ballots, which do not require ID. In the Pennsylvania case, the lawyers had the perfect plaintiff, Viviette Applewhite, a 93-year-old, wheelchair-bound African-American woman who had no driver's license and no birth certificate because she was born at home. For such people, getting the required documents can be burdensome and sometimes expensive.  For Applewhite, unlike most of us, exercising her right to vote was worth the fight in court. (Did I mention she also marched with Martin Luther King Jr.?)  It also turned out that once she lost her case, she was able and willing to get through the bureaucratic maze necessary to get her ID. The moral of the story:  If you are one of those people who considers voting a right worth dying for, you'll most likely be able to do what is necessary to get to vote.  Such is not the case, however, if you are one of the unfortunate few who can never get the right documents you need. Or if you're one of the great many nonvoters for whom any additional hindrance makes you think it's not worth it -- that the added costs of registering and voting exceed the intangible benefit of knowing you have participated in the democracy. Even after an election takes place, another reason makes plaintiffs difficult to find and the effect of voter ID laws uncertain: It's unclear whether the laws are actually enforced as intended.  For any number of election regulations, there's a huge gap between the law on the books and the practices in the polling place. When the poll worker's neighbor shows up without an ID, the odds are that she might let him vote anyway -- that is, assuming he has been neighborly.  Of course, that might not happen if she doesn't recognize him or she has trouble understanding his accent. Indeed, political scientists find that huge numbers of voters in states even without ID laws report being asked for photo ID on Election Day.  And at least one election administrator in Pennsylvania has even pledged not to enforce the new law. Against the invisible plaintiffs in these cases is the imaginary problem of voter impersonation fraud -- the kind of fraud where someone goes to the polling place and votes using the name of someone else. Even though we have few documented cases and prosecutions, make no mistake about it:  Voter impersonation does happen.  It probably happens with the same frequency as voters collapsing in line while waiting to vote, or getting nauseous when they see the names on the ballot.  And yes, if every election were to be a replay of the 2000 election, then any mishap -- fraudulent or otherwise -- could determine the outcome.  As of yet, however, we have not required all polling places to be prepared with smelling salts. The reason voter impersonation fraud is so rare is that it is an incredibly stupid and inefficient way to rig an election. Shepherding hordes of fraudsters from one polling place to the next to vote in other people's names would take a lot of time and effort and expose them to trouble with the law with little potential payoff.  Successful fraud  is usually perpetrated at the wholesale, rather than retail, level. Absentee ballots, in particular, have proven to be the fraudster's method of choice.  They are cast in private out of the view of suspecting eyes of poll workers or fellow voters.  They are ripe for coercion and undue influence from whoever might be sitting next to the absentee voter -- think union or corporate bosses.  And multiple ballots can be collected over the course of several weeks, saving the expense and rush of a one-day voter impersonation campaign. The greatest irony of the new crop of voter ID laws is that they do nothing to combat the more frequent problem of absentee ballot fraud. In fact, they might even make such fraud more likely because the number of absentee voters might increase, given that absentee voters do not need to have a photo ID in order to vote.  Worse still, absentee votes are much more likely to be otherwise disqualified because of errors committed by either the voter or the vote counter. They present the perfect storm of fraud and mistakes that conjures up images of the cockeyed Florida vote counters in the 2000 election. I happen to be in the camp that believes a state should provide a compelling justification for new election laws even if they have an admittedly uncertain effect on voters' rights.  But you do not need to be a fellow traveler or even to be preoccupied with voting rights to worry about the implications of these laws. Enforcement of these laws will be spotty.  They will cause confusion in the polling place as relatively untrained, volunteer poll workers come up to speed with sometimes complicated new regulations.  Some voters will choose not to vote, while others will cast provisional ballots -- so-called because the legality of the vote will be determined after Election Day if the voter can come up with ID in time for the ballot to be counted. This will all be done in the name of preventing voter fraud. Yet if these laws lead unwittingly to an increase in the number of voters casting absentee votes out of public view, then they will not even have addressed the fraud they intend to solve.  Indeed, they might even make it worse. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter .","Voter ID laws recently have been upheld in Pennsylvania and rejected in Texas .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say it's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique, according to a poll released Tuesday. Michael Mukasey said waterboarding is repugnant, but he stopped short of saying it was torture. Asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture, more than two-thirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes; 29 percent said no. Asked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists, 58 percent said no; 40 percent said yes. In the procedure, water is used on restrained prisoners to make them feel like they are drowning. The practice became an issue during the recent confirmation hearings for attorney general nominee Michael Mukasey, who has refused to categorically reject the practice. Mukasey told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that while he finds waterboarding personally ""repugnant,"" he could not answer ""hypothetical"" questions about whether the technique amounts to torture. Senators' reaction to Mukasey's statements on waterboarding and the president's power to order warrantless electronic surveillance threw his nomination into doubt. But his confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democratic senators said they will vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy.  See which key senators support Mukasey » .

"A California poultry producer announced Monday that it is working with the federal health officials after an estimated 278 illnesses were reported in 18 states. Raw chicken products from Foster Farms plants have been identified as the likely source of this outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg. Illnesses were linked to the facility through investigations conducted by local, state, and federal officials. The outbreak is continuing and no recall has been issued. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, has been unable so far to identify the specific product or production period, but raw products from the potentially affected facilities bear one of the following numbers on the packaging: P6137, P6137A, P7632 and mainly distributed to retail outlets in California, Oregon and Washington state. Food poisoning: What you need to know . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is partnering with state health departments to monitor the outbreak while FSIS continues its investigation, but due to the government shutdown, current information may not be available on the agencies' websites. ""While the company, FSIS and CDC continue to investigate the issue, Foster Farms has instituted a number of additional food safety practices, processes and technology throughout company facilities that have already proven effective in controlling Salmonella in its Pacific Northwest operations earlier this year,"" Foster Farms said in a statement on its website. The Food and Drug Administration recommends a minimum internal temperature of 165 degress Fahrenheit in order to ensure that harmful bacteria is killed off. The reading should be taken from the thickest part of the flesh, not touching a bone. Washing poultry before cooking it is not recommended. Bacteria in raw meat and poultry juices can be spread to other foods, utensils, and surfaces. Cooking (baking, broiling, boiling, and grilling) to the right temperature kills the bacteria, so washing food is not necessary. Consumers with food safety questions can ""Ask Karen,"" the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov.

Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. Fast facts on salmonella . The CDC reports that people in a normal state of health who ingest Salmonella-tainted food may experience diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, which typically begin within 12 to 72 hours. This may be accompanied by vomiting, chills, headache and muscle pains. These symptoms may last about four to seven days, and then go away without specific treatment, but left unchecked, Salmonella infection may spread to the bloodstream and beyond, and may cause death if the person is not treated promptly with antibiotics. Children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune symptoms should practice extreme caution, as salmonellosis may lead to severe illness or even death. About 48 million people contract some form of food poisoning each year, according to the CDC. Salmonella was the top cause of foodborne illness, according to the CDC's 2012 report card on food poisoning. However, the overall incidence of Salmonella was unchanged from the 2006-08 data, the agency said. The report card is based on reports from 10 U.S. regions, representing about 15% of the country.

"Authorities have identified the man who opened fire at Fort Hood in Texas on Wednesday, killing three people before committing suicide, as Specialist Ivan Lopez. Sixteen more people were injured Wednesday when he opened fire at Fort Hood, the sprawling Army post in Texas still on edge after a mass shooting there left 13 dead in 2009, officials said. The gunman also died. He was engaged by military police before he fatally shot himself in the head, said the Army post's commander, Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley. The suspect, a soldier who had served in Iraq, ""had behavioral health and mental health"" issues, Milley told reporters late Wednesday. The general said there was no known motive for the shooting. ""There is no indication that this incident is related to terrorism, although we are not ruling anything out,"" he said. The initial report is the incident started as a soldier-on-soldier attack, law enforcement sources told CNN. Scott & White Hospital in Temple, Texas, was treating eight patients with another expected to arrive shortly, said Dr. Glen Couchman, the chief medical officer. Three patients were in critical condition, while ""the remaining are all seriously injured,"" he said. Other patients were taken to Darnall Army Medical Center, not far from the Medical Brigade building where the shooting occurred, according a soldier who lives nearby and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The suspected shooter was wearing combat fatigues, said a U.S. official briefed on the shooting. He was armed with a .45-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun that he purchased recently, said Milley. President Barack Obama was briefed and said Wednesday evening ""we're heartbroken something like this might have happened again."" He was referring to the November 2009 massacre. ""I want to just assure all of us we are going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened,"" the President said. While aboard Air Force One, Obama received an update from top defense and FBI leaders about Wednesday's shooting at Fort Hood, the White House said in a statement. He commended ""military personnel, first responders, and medical staff who responded swiftly and heroically to the horrific shooting."" The President also called for ""his team to utilize every resource available to fully investigate the shooting."" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also was monitoring the situation. He described what happened as a ""terrible tragedy."" Earlier, Fort Hood's official Twitter feed asked that all personnel on post shelter in place. Sheriff's deputies from Bell County and state troopers assisted by securing the area around the post, according to Bell County Sheriff's Lt. Donnie Adams.  Authorities in the town of Killeen, just outside the gates, were also standing by to help. ""We are very concerned. Fort Hood is always there for us and we want to be there for them,"" said Killeen Mayor Dan Corbin. He continued: ""They are used to dealing with combat situations, and I'm sure they are very capable of handling this."" The lockdown was lifted just prior to 9 p.m. (10 p.m. ET), military personnel at the front gate told CNN. On November 5, 2009, Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan opened fire at Fort Hood, killing 13 people and injuring 32. He shot fellow soldiers at the processing center. Prosecutors maintained that the American-born Muslim underwent a progressive radicalization that led to the massacre. Hasan allegedly picked that day because it was when the units he was scheduled to deploy with to Afghanistan were scheduled to go through the processing center. The former Army psychiatrist was convicted of premeditated murder, and a military jury recommended that Hasan be put to death. Wednesday's shooting reminded many in the central Texas community of that incident. ""Today, Ft. Hood was once again stricken by tragedy. As Texans, our first priority must be caring for the victims and their families. Ft. Hood has proven its resilience before, and will again. Texas will support those efforts in any way we can, with any resources necessary,"" said Gov. Rick Perry. U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said in a statement that no community should have to experience such violence once, let alone twice. ""Tonight, Texans' hearts are once again very heavy. The scenes coming from Fort Hood today are sadly too familiar and still too fresh in our memories,"" he said. According to the Fort Hood website, the post is one of the largest in the world with 45,414 assigned soldiers and 8,900 civilian employees. The installation, which encompasses 214,000 acres, is home to two divisions -- the Army's 1st Cavalry and the 4th Infantry (Mechanized).

"The operator of the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant has said they need help from outside Japan to stabilize and safely decommission damaged reactors at the facility. This follows the news that regulators are poised to declare a fresh toxic water leak at Fukushima a level 3 ""serious incident,"" the gravest warning since the massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that sent three reactors into meltdown. Zengo Aizawa, vice president of the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), told reporters at a press conference late Wednesday that there are ""many other countries outside of Japan that have experienced decommissioning reactors, so we hope we can consult them more and utilize their experience. ""In that sense, we need support, not only from the Japanese government but from the international community to do this job."" Earlier Wednesday, Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) said the new leak was expected to be classified as a level 3 incident on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale, though this will be done once they have received an opinion from the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The NRA said they have received a first response from the IAEA asking for more details about the leaking tank, especially the structure and its initial role. ""The current situation is at the point where more surveillance won't be enough to keep the accidents from happening,"" Shunichi Tanaka, chairman of the NRA, said at a news conference Wednesday. ""Our job is now to lower the risk of these accidents from becoming fatal."" The leak previously had a level 1 ""anomaly rating"" on the scale, which ranges from zero, for no safety threat, to seven, for a major accident like the meltdowns at the plant after the earthquake and tsunami. TEPCO, which is in charge of the plant, has struggled to manage the vast quantities of contaminated water at the plant since the tsunami, which swamped the facility. Water pumped out of the stricken reactor buildings is being stored in large water towers at the site. Fukushima leaks: Japan ponders freezing ground . In response to the latest leakage of 300 tons of toxic water, a TEPCO spokesman said Wednesday the company has finished removing radioactive water from a leaky tank and transferred it to another tank at the plant. The leaky container is designed to hold as much as 1,000 tons of water, TEPCO said. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was aware of reports that the Nuclear Regulation Authority plans to rate the leak as a level 3 incident. ""The IAEA views this matter seriously and remains ready to provide assistance on request,"" the agency said. Scientists have pointed to high radiation levels in the waters off the plant for more than a year as evidence of problems with the company's efforts to contain the water. In July, TEPCO admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the Pacific Ocean from the plant, even though an underground barrier was built to seal in the water, underscoring a growing sense of crisis at the site. Fukushima tuna study finds miniscule health risks . The authority said in a statement on its website that the plant ""remains in an unstable condition, with various risks to be addressed, and in particular managing the issue of contaminated water as a high priority."" Michael Friedlander, a nuclear engineer and former U.S. power plant operator, said the level 3 classification was warranted for the type of situation faced by TEPCO, but he said the risk to the public outside the plant was very low. ""This is extremely radioactive water, and it would pose a very significant risk to the workers who are going to be in a position to clean it up,"" he told CNN. ""It's a very difficult situation because we don't know exactly know where the leak is coming from."" But TEPCO spokeswoman Mayumi Yoshida disputed Friedlander's assessment of the risk posed by the contaminated water. She said workers removing the water from the tank have sufficient protective clothing to prevent exposure. Amid growing concerns this month about contaminated groundwater leaching into the ocean from the plant, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered his government to find ""multiple, speedy and sure"" ways to stop the water's spread. ""We have to deal with this at a national level,"" he said. But experts say that any potential solutions are likely to be difficult, technologically and politically.

"MANAMA, Bahrain (CNN) -- U.S. Navy snipers fatally shot three pirates holding an American cargo-ship captain hostage after seeing that one of the pirates ""had an AK-47 leveled at the captain's back,"" a military official said Sunday. Cargo ship Capt. Richard Phillips is shown aboard the USS Boxer shortly after his rescue Sunday. The captain, who'd been held in a lifeboat in the Indian Ocean since Wednesday, was rescued uninjured, Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney told reporters. Capt. Richard Phillips' ship, the Maersk Alabama, was stormed by pirates 350 miles off Somalia on Wednesday morning. He was ""resting comfortably"" on the USS Boxer after his rescue Sunday night, according to the Navy. Phillips contacted his family and received a routine medical exam after his rescue at 7:19 p.m. (12:19 p.m. ET), the Navy Central Command said. Video from aboard the Boxer showed a smiling Phillips shaking hands with Navy personnel. ""The captain is in good health. He's showered up and in a clean set of clothes,"" Gortney said in a telephone news conference from Navy Central Command in Bahrain. In Phillips' hometown of Underhill, Vermont, Maersk spokeswoman Alison McColl said Phillips' wife, Andrea, had spoken to her husband by phone after his rescue. ""She was laughing while she was on the phone with him,"" McColl told reporters. ""She was saying his trademark sense of humor was still very much intact, and he's in great spirits. If you guys could have seen her light up when she talked to him, it was really remarkable.""  Watch spokeswoman read statement from Phillips' family » . U.S. forces moved to rescue Phillips after seeing him in imminent danger on the lifeboat, Gortney said. A fourth pirate was negotiating Phillips' fate aboard the nearby USS Bainbridge. ""While working through the negotiations process tonight, the on-scene commander from the Bainbridge made the decision that the captain's life was in immediate danger, and the three pirates were killed,"" Gortney said. ""The pirate who surrendered earlier today is being treated humanely; his counterparts who continued to fight paid with their lives."" The three pirates, who were armed with AK-47 rifles, were killed by shooters who were aboard the Bainbridge, Gortney said.  Watch how U.S. forces believed Phillips was in danger » . The on-scene commander gave the shooters approval to open fire after seeing that ""one of the pirates had an AK-47 leveled at the captain's back,"" Gortney said. Seas in the area were getting rough at the time of the rescue, Gortney said, and the Bainbridge was towing the lifeboat presumably to calmer waters with a towline about 82 feet long. A senior defense official told CNN that each pirate was shot in the head. After the shooting, special operations personnel shimmied along the tow rope to ensure the pirates were dead and freed Phillips, the official said. The official added that the pirates had become increasingly agitated over the past day, and negotiations were not going well. The fourth pirate was aboard the Bainbridge most of the day and told military negotiators that he wasn't going back to the other pirates, according to a defense official with knowledge of the situation. Federal prosecutors would be ""reviewing the evidence and other issues"" to determine whether that pirate would be prosecuted in the United States, Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd said. It's the first time in modern history that the United States has in custody a pirate who carried out an attack on a U.S. citizen, said a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the situation. The source said figuring out what to do with the pirate is a sensitive issue. Phillips' rescue came a day after he dove into the water in an attempt to escape his captors, Gortney said. The pirates ""shot in the water at him"" but eventually recaptured him, Gortney said. Maersk Line Limited President and CEO John Reinhart called Phillips ""a leader of men ... [and] a brave and courageous man."" He said he has spoken with Phillips and said the captain is ""feeling quite good."" Phillips and his family, through Reinhart, expressed gratitude to the U.S. Navy. ""I actually was more concerned for his family,"" said Adm. Rick Gurnon, head of the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, where Phillips had trained. ""As a captain in sea, in a lifeboat, he was comfortable -- even if he was sharing it with Somali pirates.""  Watch Massachusetts Maritime Academy celebrate rescue » . Gurnon stressed that while Phillips was rescued, more than 200 mariners remain captives at sea. ""The pirates have a great business model that works for them: See ships, take ransom, make millions,"" he told reporters. At the White House, President Obama issued a statement saying he is ""very pleased that Capt. Phillips has been rescued and is safely on board the USS Boxer."" ""His safety has been our principal concern, and I know this is a welcome relief to his family and his crew,"" Obama's statement said. ""We remain resolved to halt the rise of piracy in this region."" Obama had given standing orders for the military to take ""decisive action"" if Phillips was in ""imminent danger,"" Gortney said. Phillips offered himself as a hostage after the pirates stormed the U.S.-flagged Alabama Wednesday morning, according to Maersk. Crew members have said that after the pirates stormed the ship, they overpowered one pirate and tied him up. The crew released the pirate Wednesday, hoping to exchange him for Phillips, but the pirates instead retreated to the lifeboat with Phillips, leaving the Alabama to its crew.  View a timeline of the attack and its aftermath » . Maersk Alabama crew members, who guided the ship to port in Mombasa, Kenya, on Saturday, were ""jubilant"" when they received word of the rescue, a statement from the company said.  Gortney said the Alabama had reported being harassed by pirates the day before the pirates' successful attack on Wednesday. When the Alabama crew made the call, ""our closest vessel from all the navies that were out there -- we have 16 navies that are patrolling those waters -- and the closest one was the USS Bainbridge, and it was over 300 nautical miles"" away he said.

"(CNN) -- Americans should avoid buying treatments for the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu, online, the Food and Drug Administration warned. FDA has warned Americans away from online H1N1 medication and toward regulated distribution points. ""Products that are offered for sale online with claims to diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat or cure the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus must be carefully evaluated,"" FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said. The FDA issued the warning Thursday after it had purchased products over the Internet that were supposed to be Tamiflu and analyzed them. Tamiflu is one of two approved anti-viral treatments for H1N1. The other is Relenza. None of the products received by the FDA were approved for sale in the United States, and they contained various levels of oseltamivir phosphate, the drug in Tamiflu. ""Medicines purchased from Web sites operating outside the law put consumers at increased risk due to a higher potential that the products will be counterfeit, impure, contaminated or have too little or too much of the active ingredient,"" Hamburg said. In addition, the products did not arrive soon enough to treat someone infected with H1N1, or who had been exposed to the virus.","FDA issued the warning after it had purchased products over the Internet .

"After a week of demonstrations nationwide, as well as calls for justice and an uproar over hoodies on Capitol Hill, the focus of the Trayvon Martin saga on Saturday will once again return to the Florida city where it all began. Thousands of activists are expected to turn out for a Saturday morning march to the headquarters of the Sanford Police Department, whose members have faced extensive criticism for not arresting the 17-year-old Martin's shooter, George Zimmerman. On February 26, Zimmerman has said, he killed Martin in self-defense in a gated community in that central Florida city. He told police that the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk before the fatal shooting, according to an Orlando Sentinel report that was later confirmed by Sanford police. Authorities have said Zimmerman was not immediately charged because there were no grounds, at the outset, to disprove his account that he had acted to protect himself. Yet critics say that Zimmerman, who is Hispanic, deemed Martin ""suspicious"" and decided to follow him against the advice of a police dispatcher because the teen was black. Shooting divides a community . That sentiment is expected to be well represented at Saturday's march and subsequent rally. The participants include the president of the Hispanic advocacy group La Raza, teachers union representatives and various NAACP leaders. Other notables will be the Rev. Jesse Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton, both of whom have been regulars throughout the debate and in close contact with Martin's family. The late teenager's parents are not expected to attend. An open letter on the NAACP's website -- directed at Angela Corey, the special prosecutor assigned to the case -- points to what it calls ""evidence of racial bias, investigative mishaps, and the true nature of the circumstances surrounding Trayvon's killing (that) have shaken us to the core... ""However, nothing shakes us more than the knowledge that Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, remains free."" Video: Zimmerman in handcuffs . The letter ends with a plea for Corey ""to prosecute the case judiciously, and to passionately pursue justice."" Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee announced earlier this month that he was stepping down ""temporarily"" as head of the department amid the public uproar over the shooting. State's Attorney Norman Wolfinger, from Florida's 18th District, also stepped aside in the case. Gov. Rick Scott has appointed Corey as a special investigator, after which she said that her office could charge Zimmerman, clear him or send the case to the grand jury. In an interview Thursday with CNN's Piers Morgan, the shooter's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., questioned the competence of and the job done by Corey's office thus far. Opinion: Martin's death more than teachable moment . He cited leaks of details -- which have not been confirmed to have come from Corey or her office -- and described the account that his brother ""chased a person"" as ""absolutely false."" ""Ms. Corey's investigation has been compromised,"" the brother said. Yet Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi stood staunchly behind Corey, in an interview Friday with CNN's John King. She noted that Scott appointed Corey after consulting with her. Corey ""is ethical. She is honest. She is tough as nails. She is compassionate,"" Bondi said. ""And if any leaks are coming out of this investigation, it is certainly not from Angela Corey's office."" Bondi added that she thought criticism of Corey -- both by those, like Robert Zimmerman Jr., who support George Zimmerman and those calling for his prompt arrest -- ""completely undermines the integrity of the investigation."" In Depth: CNN peels back the layers . She said that she's spoken to Martin's parents, whom she called ""amazing people,"" as well as the family's lawyers, whom she described as ""friends of mine."" Everyone involved, Bondi said, would be best off if they ""wait and let (the investigation) happen."" That means being patient in the face of fervent demands from activists that Zimmerman be detained and charged as soon as possible, said the attorney general. ""You never want to make an arrest too soon,"" Bondi said. ""We need justice, but you never want to make an arrest without having all the answers."" While George Zimmerman has not spoken out about the case, his family members have taken their case public this week. Besides the brother, Robert Zimmerman Sr. -- the shooter's father -- told Orlando TV station WOFL that Martin ""continued to beat George"" and he said something to the effect of, ""You're going to die now."" What the witnesses are saying . But on CNN Miami affiliate WFOR, Martin's brother Jahvaris Fulton said he finds it ""baffling how people ... just take (Zimmerman's) word for it, as if that's exactly what happened."" He was especially incredulous about his brother's alleged threat to kill. ""That doesn't sound like my brother at all,"" said Fulton, a 21-year-old student at Florida International University. Florida law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. It has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in the state. But as more information surfaces, the picture of what happened between Martin and Zimmerman becomes more complicated. Despite the twists and turns, Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, has said that she still has faith in authorities investigating her son's case. ""I feel confident that they're going to do a thorough investigation,"" she said. ""We're trying to be patient, even though it's been over a month. We're trying to be patient, and we're trying to press on for justice.""","Florida's attorney general defends the special prosecutor in the Martin case .

"(CNN) -- A new anti-government movement has sprung up among protesters in Iran -- and now among their supporters in other countries -- with men posting pictures of themselves on the Internet wearing women's head scarves as a political statement. The movement began in recent days as an online backlash after the arrest of one anti-government protester, Majid Tavakoli. The day after his arrest, an Iranian news agency published a picture of Tavakoli dressed in a chador, a black head-to-toe garment worn by Iranian women. The government claimed the man had been caught wearing the garment in an attempt to hide himself and avoid arrest, but opposition bloggers insisted that the photo published by the semi-official Fars news agency had been manipulated. Within hours of the Fars report on the arrest of the 22-year-old protester, men both inside and outside Iran responded using a what appears to be a new tactic for the opposition -- they began posting pictures of themselves online wearing head coverings that are mandated for women in the Islamic republic. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian studies at New York's Columbia University, told CNN Sunday that the pictures are an attempt at causing the Iranian government's tactics to ""humiliate, intimidate or stifle this movement"" to backfire. iReporters cover heads to support protests . ""They (Iranian government officials) use a standard cliche to try to humiliate men, as if being a woman were something bad, and thousands of Iranians respond by posting these pictures, showing there is absolutely nothing wrong with women or veiling,"" said Dabashi, who is a supporter of the arrested protester, Tavakoli. Adding to the controversy is the Fars agency's decision to juxtapose the photos of Tavakoli alongside a decades-old photo of the first president of the Islamic republic, Abolhassan Banisadr. Years ago, Iranian officials accused Banisadr of using women's clothes to try to escape arrest. In the nearly 30-year-old image, Banisadr, who was president for one year at the beginning of Iran's post-revolutionary period, is shown wearing what appears to be a white floral head scarf. Though many question the authenticity of the picture, state media at the time used it as evidence that Banisadr attempted to escape the country in a ""cowardly"" way after his ouster in 1981. The Fars report gave no explanation for publishing Banisadr's photo alongside Tavakoli's, and the two men have no other apparent links. A blog that focuses on religion and politics in the Muslim world -- Spittoon.org -- interpreted the juxtaposition as being an attempt by the authorities ""to humiliate [Tavakoli, using] an old practice by the government to prove to the public that the opposition leaders are 'less than men,' lacking courage and bravery."" One commentator on that site wrote, ""It is ironic how [the] head scarf, which was traditionally seen as a symbol of women's oppression ... is now being used by men to show membership in a liberation movement."" A Facebook page created Friday night for Tavakoli exhorts supporters to ""condemn the state media's behavior towards Majid Tavakoli,"" and ""act in solidarity ... to affirm his status as a known symbol of integrity."" The page adds that the invitation to wear a head covering is ""without connotations to hijab as a religious practice,"" and that the group's leaders are ""against any kind of forced or imposed hijab."" Hijab refers to religiously sanctioned dress for men and women in Islam. Thus the new protest also speaks to the societal aspect of Iranian women being forced to accept a dress code, according to Dabashi. Alongside his own photo on Facebook, Dabashi describes the varied shades of meaning that this particular form of protest holds for him, referring to his rusari, the loosely tied head scarf that covers only the hair. ""Proud to wear my late mother's rusari, the very rusari that was forced on my wife in Iran, the very rusari for which my sisters are humiliated if they choose to wear it in Europe, and the very rusari that the backward banality that now rules Iran thinks will humiliate Majid Tavakoli if it is put on him -- He is dearer and nobler to us today than he ever was."" Tavakoli remains in custody of Iranian security forces, and it is not known what he thinks about becoming associated with this particular protest tactic. He was arrested after a protest demonstration last Monday. December 7 is ""Students Day"" in Iran, an annual observance extolling the virtues of the Islamic Revolution that toppled the Western-backed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran. The holiday remembers the killing in 1953 of three university students by the shah's security forces. In a speech before his arrest, Tavakoli played on the theme of the day's historical significance in light of current anti-government protests. ""Stand up against dictatorship and scream all you can against dictatorship. We don't accept a dictatorship any more,"" Tavakoli said, according to a video of his speech posted on YouTube.com. ""Let's go to the gates of the university and one more time let's show our solidarity and unity."" Columbia University's Dabashi said the head scarf protest is a way of showing the same solidarity against a system that came into being after the Iranian Revolution. ""We Iranian men are late doing this,"" Dabashi said. ""If we did this when rusari was forced on those among our sisters who did not wish to wear it 30 years ago, we would have perhaps not been here today.""","Anti-government protester Majid Tavakoli recently arrested .

"(CNN)The Champions League is back -- but there were no big winners on the opening night of the knockout round. Paris Saint-Germain was held to a frustrating 1-1 draw by Chelsea in the French capital, while Bayern Munich finished goalless in Ukraine with Shakhtar Donetsk. PSG will be the most annoyed -- Laurent Blanc's side had chance after chance to win the tie and put a dent in Chelsea's Champions League hopes. In the end, Edinson Cavani's strike ensured parity after Branislav Ivanovic, the Serbia defender, had given the visitors a first half lead. It could have been so different for the home side had it not been for Thibaut Courtois, the Chelsea goalkeeper. Courtois denied PSG time and time again, much to delight of his manager, Jose Mourino. ""We could have lost, so I think the result is a positive one,"" Mourinho told ITV. ""I don't say very good because it depends on the result of the second leg but it is a positive result against a very good team with fantastic technical players. It was a difficult match. Asked if Chelsea got away with it, he added: ""When you see the performance of our goalkeeper you have to say yes, he made two or three important saves in the game. ""I am happy with the result because two legs is now one leg with everything to be decided at Stamford Bridge."" Mourinho, who is hoping to become the first man to win the competition with three different clubs, cut a relieved figure at the full time whistle. Time and time again the visitors were indebted to its goalkeeper, Courtois, who produced a number of fine stops to deny the French champion. At just 22, it's frightening to think how good the Belgian could become. Here, against a PSG side determined to take some sort of lead to Stamford Bridge in three weeks time, he ensured Chelsea got out of jail. Laurent Blanc's men began the better of the two teams and Courtois was forced into action within the first 10 minutes. Cavani, seemingly constantly linked with a move to England, found space on the left and when his cross was headed powerfully towards goal by Blaise Matuidi, Courtois was forced to fly into action. The Belgian goalkeeper was soon busy again, this time saving from Zlatan Ibrahimovic as the forward's header bounced towards goal, while Cavani also went close with an effort which was tipped away. Chelsea, seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, slowly began to grow into the contest but it still came as something of a surprise when it took a 36th minute lead. John Terry, the captain, crossed from the left and after Gary Cahill had flicked the ball on, Ivanovic rose unopposed to head the ball into the far corner. That goal was harsh on the home side, which emerged revitalized after the interval and was soon level. Matuidi, one of the most impressive performers on the field, found space on the left and his cross was headed home by the unmarked Cavani. Chelsea, normally solid and resolute in defense, was struggling to repel the French champion and Courtois was forced to save from Ibrahimovic once again as the Swede waltzed his way through the defense. Cavani, alert to the rebound, thought he was set to give side the lead when the ball broke, but his effort  was blocked by César Azpilicueta. PSG, third in its domestic league, continued to dominate and Cavani wasted a glorious opportunity with 10 minutes remaining when he slid his effort inches wide of the far post. Ibrahimovic might have stolen a dramatic winner at the death but his header was brilliantly tipped away by the overworked Courtois. Chelsea will now be confident of progressing to the quarterfinal stage with the second leg to come at Stamford Bridge in three weeks time. Last season, it was beaten 3-1 in Paris at the quarterfinal stage before recovering to win the second leg 2-0 and progress on the away goals rule. At least this time it heads home level and with designs on the last eight. ""Both teams were feeling each other in the first half,"" said Chelsea captain Terry. ""Thibaut Courtois pulled off some great saves and we go away with a happy draw. ""Last year we made it very difficult for ourselves but we are in a lot better position now. ""PSG keep the ball very well, David Luiz's range of passing is very good so they were able to stretch us but I thought it was very even tonight. ""Branislav Ivanovic has been different class defensively this year and always has been, attacking he always poses a great threat."" In the night's other game, Bayern Munich was held to a goalless draw by Shakhtar Donetsk in Lviv. It was a frustrating night for the 2013 winner which had Xabi Alonso sent off in the second half. The Spanish midfielder, who was celebrating the occasion of his 100th appearance in the competition, was dismissed with 25 minutes remaining after picking up a second yellow card. Shakhtar, which is forced to play its Champions League home games over 1,200 kilometers away from its home stadium because of the ongoing conflict in the region, had not played a competitive fixture since December following the winter break.","European Champions League last 16 began Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Not everyone will remember ""Death of a President,"" the 2006 movie that included a controversial scene in which President George W. Bush was killed by a sniper. (I, on the other hand, can't forget it because my fiancÃ© is an actress and had a big role in that movie). Another thing I can't forget is the outrage that DOAP sparked among some conservative commentators, including some of those very same people who are now defending Sony's film ""The Interview,"" about the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""Death of a President"" won an award at the prestigious Toronto Film Festival and was slated to play in several theater chains in America. That is, until some on the right went ballistic over it. Rush Limbaugh slammed the movie, reportedly calling the film's director a ""sicko"" and saying the movie was part of an ""age of insanity."" Fox News' Michelle Malkin denounced the film in an article she penned for the conservative website, ""Town Hall"" titled, ""Kill Bush Mania."" Matt Drudge used the word ""SHOCK"" (all in caps) to describe the film on the front page of his Drudge Report. And Sean Hannity grilled the film's director on his Fox News show with questions like ""Do you not have a responsibility to think of the impact, the impressions that could be made on people"" by depicting the shooting of Bush? The outrage wasn't confined to the media. Rep. Peter King of New York, then chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, dubbed the film disgusting, claimed it ""could incite real violence"" and reportedly warned that the filmmakers ""would have blood on their hands if anything should ever happen."" King went on to call for no movie theater or TV network in America to show the film: ""Any theater that would show this, any TV station that would show this, is acting irresponsibly. It would be a disgrace for it to be shown anywhere."" In response to this outrage, the film was indeed pulled from the big theater chains and relegated to a handful of art house theaters. As a then-spokesperson for Regal Entertainment Group, one of the movie theater chains that caved into the pressure, reportedly stated, ""We do not feel it is appropriate to portray the future assassination of a president, therefore we do not intend to program this film at any of our cinemas."" Yet fast forward to 2014, and The Drudge Report reads, ""SURRENDER: SONY PULLS 'INTERVIEW."" (Apparently Drudge's computer is stuck in ""caps lock"" mode.) Malkin's Twitter feed, meanwhile, is filled with retweets that denounce Sony's puling of the film. But the award for the biggest flip-flopper of them all goes to Peter King. The man who in 2006 called for theaters to not screen the film that portrayed Bush being assassinated sang a far different tune when interviewed earlier this week by CNN's Wolf Blitzer. When Blitzer asked King if it was appropriate for a film to depict a world leader being assassinated, King responded, ""There's no reason not to do it."" King went on to state -- as if he had no recollection of what he said in 2006 -- that there have ""been terrible things said about our presidents and our leaders in movies. ... This is something that, in a free society, we tolerate."" Look, if you are going to credibly defend freedom of expression, it requires that you be consistent. You can't just defend the words or images you agree with. That's not how freedom of expression works. And deep down, I know that King and the pundits on the right know this. But too often they are playing to their political base or the consumers of their media outlets at the expense of intellectual honesty. (And to be candid, some on the left are just as guilty, though typically not in the area of freedom of expression.) Will the future bring any changes? Tough to say, although to be honest it seems unlikely. It's how some of them remain in office and attract fans to their websites and TV shows. But thanks to a thing called Google we can discover in a matter of minutes the selective outrage and outright hypocrisy of these people. At least then we can dismiss their words as being nothing more than hollow pandering.","Dean Obeidallah: Conservatives were outraged by ""Death of a President""

Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton blasted McCain, saying he ""talked about bipartisanship, but didn't mention that he's been a Bush partisan 90 percent of the time, that he's run a Karl Rove campaign, and that he wants to continue this president's disastrous economic and foreign policies for another four years.""

McCain referred to the 5½ years he spent as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, explaining that the experience changed his life.

Lindsey Graham praised McCain's character, saying he is leading the nation to victory in Iraq by his unflinching support for the surge.  Watch Graham say the surge is working » . ""We know the surge has worked,"" Graham said. ""The only people who deny it are Barack Obama and his buddies at MoveOn.org. Why won't they admit it? ""Because Barack Obama's campaign is built around us losing in Iraq."" Graham said it was McCain's insistence on the surge, when thousands more U.S. combat troops were deployed in Iraq in January 2007, that ""stopped Congress from losing this war."" ""Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying Barack Obama doesn't care. I'm just saying he doesn't get it,"" he said, echoing Obama's dig at McCain during Obama's acceptance speech last week. ""The surge was a test for Barack Obama. He failed miserably. Our troops deserve a commander in chief who acknowledges their success, has walked in their shoes, speaks their language, shares their sufferings and will lead them to victory in a war we cannot afford to lose. ""That person is my dear friend John McCain.""  Watch Graham on Obama: ""He doesn't get it"" » . Graham is one of McCain's closest friends in Congress. Another close friend, former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, said McCain has ""unique qualifications for the presidency."" ""I speak to you about a warrior who has sometimes stood alone ... and always shown the way,"" he said. Palin was nominated earlier Thursday on a voice vote that Sen. Mitch McConnell recognized as unanimous approval, prompting chants of ""Sarah! Sarah!"" As governor of Alaska, Palin has won praise for backing tough ethical standards for politicians. During the first legislative session after her election, her administration passed a state ethics law overhaul. Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said in nominating Palin that she had the leadership skills ""born out of experience, hardship, disappointment and success."" ""She's a hockey mom -- a hunter, a hard-hitting reformer -- and quite frankly, she's not afraid to raise a little hell amidst the Washington elite. Which is just what America needs!"" Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty then took the stage and warmed up the crowd for the GOP presidential nominee. He said McCain ""understands the concerns of everyday Americans like you and me."" ""John McCain connects with Sam's Club voters. He gets it,"" Pawlenty said. Overnight, crews transformed the stage at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota, so delegates would surround McCain while he addressed the convention. The change was done to make the speech feel more like the town hall-style meetings the Republican presidential nominee is known for, aides said. CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report.","McCain: ""We need to change the way government does almost everything""

"At least 905 children have called in sick to schools in a suspected case of mass food poisoning in Japan's Shizuoka Prefecture, forcing the local government to cancel classes at 15 elementary schools to prevent the outbreak from spreading. The children from Hamamatsu, a coastal city about 125 miles southwest of Tokyo, suffered vomiting and diarrhea, officials said Thursday, while 41 teachers and staff showed the same symptoms. Authorities suspect the outbreak was caused by norovirus, a common source of foodborne illness. The highly contagious virus was ""detected in about half of the stool samples taken from sick pupils,"" said Horihiro Ishizaka, a Hamamatsu city public relations official. The city's hygiene office is testing school lunches eaten by the students to confirm the cause of the outbreak, Ishizuka said. Local news reports said the schools used an ingredient from one shared supplier. The city has closed most of the affected schools and canceled classes at others through Friday in wake of the incident, which comes less than a month after 1,400 people across Japan fell ill after eating frozen foods that may have been tainted with pesticides.","Hundreds of children fall ill with symptoms of food poisoning in Hamamatsu, Japan .

"(CNN) -- Jordan Axani planned to travel around the world with his girlfriend Elizabeth Gallagher, until they broke up. Now, he'll embark on Sunday on the circumnavigation with Elizabeth Gallagher. No need for a double-take: The name may be the same, but the person answering to it isn't. Axani had booked his-and-her airline tickets in his name -- and his girlfriend's, he said. So, after his ex went overboard, he had to find a new co-passenger with the same name, he said, because the tickets were non-transferable. Axani is Canadian, as is his ex, so the new Elizabeth Gallagher needed to be, too, to make the switch work. So, he took to social messaging service Reddit to find her. After threw out the offer in early November for a free round-the-world trip, social media posts avalanched down at the hashtag #ElizabethGallagher. Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher from Nova Scotia quickly tweeted Axani a photo of her passport. Scrawled on the shot in hot pink, the words ""Take me!!!"" He did, he announced on Wednesday, but though ""Quinn"" came at him straight out of the chute, making the final choice wasn't that simple, Axani said in a statement. Many deserving women had contacted him. Founded charity . Some of their stories told of such compelling real-life heartbreak and perseverance, that Axani started a crowd-funding initiative, A Ticket Forward, to buy trips around the world for them, too. The first four he hopes to fund are a victim of Lymphoma, a single mother with an autistic son, and two women who fled violence in their native countries. But Axani settled on Quinn from Cole Harbour, Nova, Scotia, as his travel partner. He said she stood out with her volunteer work at a homeless shelter and her wish to become a social worker. From the get-go, Axani told prospective EG's that he would put no pressure on them to do him any favors. He was not looking for his ex's doppelganger to mend a broken heart. ""I am not looking for anything in return. I am not looking for companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front of the Christmas Market in Prague,"" he wrote. But he had nothing against a few bills to sooth the financial pain. ""If you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks, great. Really the only thing I ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness."" Axani and Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher are to depart New York City on Sunday for Milan, Italy. From there, the two will hop to Prague, Paris, Bangkok, New Delhi and back to Axani's home of Toronto, provided Canadian authorities allow the new Elizabeth Gallagher to board with the ticket booked for the ex. CNN has reached out to the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority to find out whether they have any security measures in place that would prevent Elizabeth Gallagher 2.0 from traveling.","Jordan Axani booked an around-the-world trip for him and his girlfriend .

"With Florida finally called and the 2012 presidential election falling into the rear view mirror, here's a look at another reason why President Barack Obama won re-election: The Democrats held their ""blue wall"" -- the cluster of eastern, Midwest and western states that have traditionally gone Democratic and were crucial to his victory. ""Democrats held the entire 'blue wall'. They have now won 18 states in at least six consecutive elections, the most states they have won that often ever, since the formation of the modern party system in 1828,"" says CNN Senior Political Analyst and National Journal Editorial Director Ron Brownstein. What states make up this so-called ""blue wall""? When history speaks: Lincoln's three lessons for an Obama second term . Start in the Mid-Atlantic and head north into New England: Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine. The only state not included in this list is New Hampshire, a perennial swing state. Add three West Coast states (California, Oregon, and Washington State) and Hawaii, and the reliably blue Midwestern states (Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). Put all those states together and add the District of Columbia, and you total 242 electoral votes. That's a nice starting point for any Democratic nominee, considering that 270 is the magic number needed to win the White House. CNN Electoral College map: You do the math . Many of the October public opinion polls indicated the president with the slight edge in the eight swing states (according to CNN's electoral map). That may explain why Romney became the latest GOP presidential nominee to try to make a last-minute bid to breach the ""blue wall,"" with moves in Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Michigan. But once again, it didn't work. As the nation's demographics continue to shift, New Mexico and even Nevada may eventually be added to the ""blue wall,"" making the GOP's path to the presidency increasingly difficult. ""Until Republicans can crack the 'blue wall,' Democrats start with a base of 242 Electoral College votes, which means a GOP nominee must thread the needle, or practically run the table, to get to 270,"" adds Brownstein. The Republicans, on the other hand, have their ""red wall"" -- the large southern, Plains and Mountain states that cover a lot of geography but not as many electoral votes, like Utah, Idaho, Texas, Mississippi, South Carolina and others. But together, the ""red wall"" only nets Republicans 177 electoral votes at  most. The big question confronting Republicans: ""how to crack that wall""? With director Steven Spielberg's new film ""Lincoln"" opening to critical praise, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland sees a comparison of today's ""blue wall"" to the coalition of states that put Republican Abraham Lincoln in the White House in 1860. Avlon: Election a call for purple politics . ""There are some differences: Washington and Hawaii weren't in the Union at the time and Delaware and Maryland were slave-holding states. Lincoln also added New Hampshire, Iowa and Indiana to the list of ""blue wall"" states in order to win the White House,"" says Holland. ""The GOP was the 'big government' party back then, willing to use the government's power not just to resolve the slavery issue, but also for big government programs like the Transcontinental Railroad, the land-grant college program, and the Homestead Act -- all projects which a lot of Democrats opposed at the time as going beyond the bounds of the government's authority. The parties have changed sides, but it looks like the underlying attitudes in those states that put them in the 'blue wall' category may be similar to what they were in Lincoln's time,"" adds Holland.","'Blue wall' states traditionally go Democratic in presidential elections .
Those states accounted for 242 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House .
Republican 'red wall,' on the other hand, only makes up 177 electoral votes, at most ."
"(CNN) -- A veteran House representative from Texas is under fire for awarding charitable scholarships associated with the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation to her family members and relatives of an aide. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) has said she will repay all the scholarship money this week that went to relatives, a foundation spokeswoman told CNN's ""AC 360."" Todd Gillman, The Dallas Morning News' Washington bureau chief, told ""AC 360"" that new documents show Johnson awarded scholarship money to her grandsons, David and Kirk Johnson, as well as the children of her Dallas district director, Rod Givens, last year. Each of the relatives were awarded two scholarships last year. Johnson is a former chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus and is a former board member of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, which gives each member $10,000 every year to award as scholarships to students in each member's district. The scholarship money comes from tax-deductible charitable donations. The newspaper reported that Johnson has awarded more than $25,000 in scholarships to two grandsons, two great-nephews, and Givens' children in the past five years. David Johnson received scholarships three years in a row, and Kirk Johnson won scholarships four years in a row. Johnson's great-nephew Preston A. Moore received scholarships for three consecutive years, and her great-nephew Gregory D. Moore II received money for two consecutive years. The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's rules state eligible students must attend school in the district of the caucus member and not be related to anyone affiliated with the caucus. In addition to violating the latter rule, none of Johnson's nor Givens' relatives who received scholarships lived in Johnson's district, according to the newspaper. ""AC 360"" invited Johnson and Givens to appear on the show Monday night, but was told they were unavailable. Muriel Cooper, spokeswoman for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, told CNN's Anderson Cooper the organization is taking the situation very seriously. ""Rep. Johnson told us that she did not know the rules of our scholarships, and that once she realized she erred, she would make retribution to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation in terms of returning the money,"" she said. ""This is the first time, to our knowledge, this has happened."" When asked about oversight and whether the foundation has ever investigated where the scholarship money goes, Cooper said, ""We've had no reason to investigate."" She said the foundation's board members will examine the situation, and board members will go back and review applications to ensure students met the qualifications. But Johnson is a former board member of the foundation, and some wonder whether an independent investigator needs to be involved. ""I can't address that issue,"" Cooper said. ""All I can say is that we will send it back to our board. But certainly we don't want this to happen again."" Johnson has told the newspaper that when she signed off on the list of names of students who were to receive scholarships, she recognized the names, but also said, ""immediate family doesn't include grandchildren."" But according to her website, ""Congresswoman Johnson counts among her greatest accomplishments her son, Kirk, and her three grandsons, Kirk Jr., David, and James."" Johnson told the newspaper if there had been more ""very worthy applicants in my district,"" she probably would not have given the scholarship money to the relatives. Some students in Johnson's district may not have known the opportunity existed. Unlike other members of the Congressional Black Caucus, Johnson does not publicize the scholarship on her website. Scholarship applicants also have to sign off on an agreement saying they are not related to anyone associated with the caucus or the caucus foundation. It's unclear whether the relatives of Johnson and Givens were instructed to say they were not related. Johnson is running for her 10th term as representative of Texas' 30th Congressional district, which covers parts of Dallas and the surrounding area.","The money comes from donations to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation .

"(CNN)As the United States gets ready to blame the Sony hack on North Korea, a troublesome question is emerging: Just what is North Korea capable of? Experts say the nation has spent scarce resources on building up a unit called ""Bureau 121"" to carry out cyberattacks. North Korea has been blamed in the past for attacks in South Korea, but the Sony hack -- if indeed North Korea is behind it -- would seem to represent an escalation of tactics. ""I think we underestimated North Korea's cybercapabilities,"" said Victor Cha, director of Asian Studies at Georgetown University. ""They certainly didn't evidence this sort of capability in the previous attacks."" Cha was referring to attacks on South Korean broadcasters and banks last year. In March 2013, South Korean police said they were investigating a widespread computer outage that struck systems at leading television broadcasters and banks, prompting the military to step up its cyberalert level. The South Korean communications regulator reportedly linked the computer failures to hacking that used malicious code, or malware. An investigation found that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by the North previously, said Lee Seung-won, an official at the South Korean Ministry of Science. North Korea denied responsibility. A spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army labeled the allegations ""groundless"" and ""a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme phase,"" according to KCNA, the North Korean state news agency. North Korea has similarly denied the massive hack of Sony Pictures, which has been forced to cancel next week's planned release of ""The Interview,""  a comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. But KCNA applauded the attack. ""The hacking into the SONY Pictures might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK,"" it said, using the acronym of its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. ""The hacking is so fatal that all the systems of the company have been paralyzed, causing the overall suspension of the work and supposedly a huge ensuing loss."" Experts point to several signs of North Korean involvement. They say there are similarities between the malware used in the Sony hack and previous attacks against South Korea. Both were written in Korean, an unusual language in the world of cybercrime. ""Unfortunately, it's a big win for North Korea. They were able to get Sony to shut down the picture. They got the U.S. government to admit that North Korea was the source of this and there's no action plan really, at least publicly no action plan, in response to it,"" said Cha. ""I think from their perspective, in Pyongyang, they're probably popping the champagne corks."" CNN's Gregory Wallace, Brian Stelter, Evan Perez, K.J. Kwon and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","The United States is set to blame North Korea for the massive hack at Sony .

"""Embrace the YES!"" said the subject line. Uh, no. The Washington Post reported that almost 300 students who had been rejected by Johns Hopkins University received a joyous shock over the weekend when the prestigious Baltimore school sent them emails telling them to ""Embrace the YES!"" They'd been admitted after all. Hadn't they? It didn't take long for joy to turn to sadness when the school followed up with another email on Sunday afternoon: ""Please note that this email was sent in error. The decision posted on the decision site reflects the accurate result of your Early Decision application."" Whoops. The email was the result of ""human error,"" David Phillips, vice provost for admissions and financial aid at Hopkins, told the Post. ""We apologize to the students affected and to their families,"" Phillips said. ""Admissions decision days are stressful enough. We very much regret having added to the disappointment felt by a group of very capable and hardworking students, especially ones who were so committed to the idea of attending Johns Hopkins that they applied early decision."" Johns Hopkins isn't the first to make such a mistake. Last December, Fordham University sent 2,500 students acceptances, when their status was still unresolved. Cathy Stephenson, a parent of a Hopkins hopeful, told the Post she was upset. ""You don't crush somebody's feelings twice,"" she said.","Students rejected by Johns Hopkins get acceptance by mistake .

"What kind of privacy will you have 10 years from now? Will you have given up trying to keep secrets and be willingly sharing all your personal information online? Or will new tools and laws give you control over your private data, allowing you to pick and choose what to share, even sell? A new survey on the future of privacy finds that experts are split fairly evenly between these two visions of the future. But one thing they do agree on is the present: We are already living under constant surveillance, willingly offering up chunks of personal information online, where it is collected, tracked and used to make money. Pew's Internet Project released its latest report on the future of privacy Thursday, a collaboration with Elon University's Imagining the Internet Center. The report is a survey of more than 2,500 experts about what they think online privacy will look like in 2025. It collected opinions from professors, researchers, futurists, policymakers and heads of major companies. When asked if there would be ""a secure, popularly accepted and trusted privacy-rights infrastructure by 2025,"" 45% of those surveyed said yes. The other 55% said no, citing lack of incentive for governments and companies to self-regulate, the logistical challenges of creating a workable global system and the growing apathy of Individuals about their own privacy. ""Most experts believe that businesses and governments have little incentive to bolster privacy. This is, in part, because people have proven that they will give away personal information for something as small as a free cup of coffee,"" said Janna Anderson, director of Elon's Imagining the Internet Center. The volume of information we share will only increase in the coming decade. Right now, every online purchase, search query, location check-in, email and social-network post is another drop of information that can be collected by tech companies and data brokers. The next wave of technology -- like fitness trackers, homes that track your habits to save energy, smart cars and facial recognition -- will generate even more personal information about people. Anderson said the experts who knew the most about the impact of these new technologies were more likely skeptical about privacy rights in 2025. Some of the respondents predict a fierce battle between companies, governments and individuals over control of personal information. However, many don't think the public will put up much of a fight. For the great privacy wars to get started, people may need motivation in the form of a major incident -- what some analysts call a ""privacy Chernobyl."" For now, most people are just starting to understand the value of their personal data. ""People are becoming more attuned all the time to the fact that they are paying for 'free' services offered by Google, Facebook, Twitter and other popular companies by giving up personal information that is sold as a commodity by those companies,"" said Anderson. Even though governments can tap that data to monitor people, and companies can collect it to make more money off of customers, some people just won't care. For them, oversharing isn't all doom and Big Brother. A few of the experts in Pew's survey think the potential benefits to consumers will actually make it a desirable trade-off. ""The benefits of cloud-based, personal, digital assistants will be so overwhelming that putting restrictions on these services will be out of the question,"" said Google's chief economist Hal Varian. ""Everyone will expect to be tracked and monitored, since the advantages, in terms of convenience, safety, and services, will be so great."" Convenience could be all it takes to talk people out wanting privacy. ""While Americans claim to care about privacy, they care even more about convenience. Americans have happily sacrificed their privacy over the last several decades, and will continue to do so, even as they complain,"" said Paul Saffo, a consulting professor at Stanford University. ""Privacy has already shifted from being a right to a good that is purchased."" A handful of other respondents also predicted that privacy could be bought back in the future, creating classes of people who can't afford privacy. What happens if privacy disappears? Many respondents think the public will easily accept the new norm, especially the younger generation. ""We will adapt to 100% transparency and the utter loss of privacy, accepting that secrets no longer exist. The societal impact of scandals (exposed secrets) will diminish because it is impossible to react with constant indignation when secrets are revealed all the time,"" said futurist Marcel Bullinga. Google Vice President Vint Cerf also thinks social norms will shift. ""The uploading and tagging of photos and videos without permission may become socially unacceptable. As in many other matters, the social punishment may have to be accompanied by legislation -- think about seat belts and smoking by way of example,"" he said. Another thing respondents seem to agree on: Whatever happens next, it's going to be a roller coaster ride. ""I expect the dynamics of security and privacy are going to be a bloody mess for the next decade, mired in ugly politics and corporate greed,"" said Microsoft research scientist Danah Boyd.","New Pew survey asks experts what privacy will look like in 10 years .
Living in public is expected to become the new default .
Some people willingly trade their privacy for convenience and services .
New tools might give people control over their data, at a cost ."
"Deja vu? Yesterday's news? Nope, it's just another series of air dramas involving disruptive Chinese air travelers. It hasn't been the most peaceful fortnight in the aviation industry -- we've seen the aftermath of a Korean Air exec's ""nut rage"" and R&B singer Jeremih arrested for attempting to force open a closed airplane door after missing the last call for boarding. In the midst of this unruly behavior have come no fewer than four inflight dramas involving Chinese tourists. On the heels of a ""Gimme my cup noodle water!"" meltdown and two emergency exit incidents, a bizarre fight between multiple passengers broke out over a dispute involving a crying baby. The poor kid probably just couldn't get any sleep with all the fuss going on. Hot water throw down . The fortnight of infamy was highlighted by the cup noodle row heard 'round the world -- or at least across Asia. On December 11, four tourists threw a series of tantrums on an Air Asia flight from Bangkok to Nanjing. The episode began during takeoff when, observing safety rules, cabin staff refused to serve hot water to a couple who wanted to immediately get going on their cup noodle. The couple retaliated by crushing nuts on the floor. The man, Wang, was allegedly still fuming when a flight attendant for the budget airline brought him a cup of hot water after the plane reached cruising altitude, then attempted to charge him 60 Thai baht ($2) for the water. ""You think I can't afford it?"" Wang demanded, using the word ""laozi,"" a pompous way of referring to one's self as a boss or superior. A video captured Wang yelling at the attendant. As the quarrel dragged on, the man's girlfriend, Zhang, threw hot water on the back of the flight attendant. Thai authorities eventually ordered Zhang to pay 50,000 baht ($1,500) to the flight attendant. Each passenger involved in the incident was fined amounts between $3 and $6. Chinese government not amused . The China National Tourism Administration issued a stern statement after the Air Asia episode, saying it had ""severely damaged the overall image of Chinese people"" and demanding local authorities review the case. Air rage is a common sight in delay-prone China. In recent years, state media has reported numerous dramatic incidents involving irate passengers, ranging from blocking moving aircraft on an active runway to fistfights with airport employees. During an official visit to the Maldives in September, President Xi Jinping personally asked Chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad. Last year the government released a lengthy list of do's and don'ts aimed at turning Chinese travelers into ""civilized tourists."" All the warnings and cajoling seem to have fallen on deaf ears, though. Quickest way off a plane? Emergency exit! Impatient or lacking fresh air or ... something ... Chinese passengers in separate incidents in the past two weeks decided to deal with their ""stuck on a plane"" dilemmas in unexpected fashion. Upon landing in Sanya on December 8 after a China Eastern flight from Xi'an, a fidgety passenger not content to suffer through the excruciating disembarkation process -- Don't judge! We've all been there! -- went ahead and opened the emergency exit door, engaging the aircraft's inflatable slide. Xinhua news agency said the reason for the man's action was unknown, but The Nanfang website from southern China reported that the passenger said he simply wanted to depart the plane sooner. His solution, to borrow loosely from Jane Austen, did display a certain amount of sense, if not sensibility. Regardless, the shortcut cost the airline $16,000 and a two-hour delay, according to Xinhua. That unauthorized exit was followed by an incident on December 14 during which a first-time flier on a Xiamen Air flight reportedly felt the urge for some fresh air while waiting for his plane to take off. His fix? Open the emergency door for better ventilation. The man wasn't fined or punished because the act didn't cause any damage, stated the airline. Baby mama drama . Calm in the skies reigned for three entire days before being shattered on Thursday when a minor brawl broke out on an Air China flight from Chongqing to Hong Kong. The imbroglio began when a pair of passengers complained about the crying baby seated behind them. The child's mother, meanwhile, spared no words in expressing her own displeasure with the people in front reclining their seats into her space. Unable to compromise, the quarrel escalated into a full-on fight. A photo in which one woman appears ready to slap another woman -- who herself seems to be floating almost perpendicular to the floor of the aircraft, perhaps readying to deliver an unorthodox blow of her own -- quickly circulated online. ""A group brawl above 7,500 meters. Our plane was almost turned around,"" wrote a passenger who shared the incident and picture on Weibo, China's Twitter. The plane wasn't diverted, though Hong Kong police were called in to keep everyone calm and carrying on once the plane landed. Meanwhile, no air rage incidents have been reported for 24 hours ... and counting ...","Past two weeks have seen media coverage of four separate incidents of Chinese tourists misbehaving on planes .

"North Korea's fury over the movie comedy ""The Interview"" appears to have taken the secretive state's oversensitivity to new extremes. Kim Jong Un's regime had already branded the film ""the most undisguised terrorism and a war action."" Now, the U.S. government is set to blame Pyongyang for the hacking of Sony Pictures, the studio responsible for the movie starring Seth Rogen and James Franco that shows the assassination of Kim. Sony has pulled the film after a threat was made against people going to see it in theaters. ""North Korea has provided a new gold standard for weakness in international politics: a state that feels threatened by a Seth Rogen movie,"" tweeted Jennifer Lind, an associate professor at Dartmouth College who specializes in East Asian security issues. North Korea reserves most of its rage for matters like U.N. sanctions over its nuclear program and U.S.-South Korean military drills near its borders. But ""The Interview"" isn't the first case of Pyongyang freaking out over seemingly innocuous things. Here are some striking examples: . Christmas trees . The festive season is rarely full of cheer across the heavily armed border between North and South Korea, known as the demilitarized zone. Christmas decorations put up on the South Korean side have become a recurring sore point. Pyongyang especially disliked a 30-meter tower in the shape of a Christmas tree that sat atop a hill with tens of thousands of lights that could be seen from well inside North Korean territory. The North reportedly said the decorations were an attempt to spread religion over the border and, in 2011, threatened ""unexpected consequences"" if the lights were turned on. South Korean authorities recently took down the ageing structure, but they have approved plans by a Christian group to build a new tower. North Korea's track record of ""Bah! Humbug!"" goes back decades -- it was objecting to Christmas trees at the border as long ago as the 1960s. A report in The New York Times from 1964 said Pyongyang had also complained about American troops throwing snowballs at North Korean soldiers around the demilitarized zone. Soap operas . North Korea is well known for its efforts to rigidly control what information from outside its borders filters through to its citizens. But that apparently doesn't stop some of them from eagerly seeking out illicit copies of TV shows from South Korea and other countries. South Korean dramas are reported to be particularly popular. The potential risks of watching the shows, which highlight the disparities between North Korea's largely impoverished population and its neighbor to the south, are enormous. South Korea's National Intelligence Service told lawmakers in October that officials from the North's ruling party had been executed by firing squad for viewing a South Korean soap opera. Despite the regime's draconian stance, its young leader has shown plenty of enthusiasm for Western culture. Kim, who is believed to have gone to school in Switzerland, has been shown watching a performance featuring Disney characters and has befriended the eccentric former NBA star Dennis Rodman. K-pop . As relations between the two Koreas soured in 2010 after the sinking of a South Korean warship, Seoul retaliated by broadcasting an anti-North Korean radio show. The broadcast opened with a pop song from the South Korean girl band Four Minute. The South Korean government also began setting up groups of huge speakers along the border to blast propaganda across into North Korea, something it hadn't done for years because of a thaw in relations. Infuriated, Pyongyang threatened to bomb the loudspeaker positions and turn Seoul into ""a sea of flame."" Tightly cropped photos . Foreign visitors to North Korea face a range of tight restrictions on where they go and what they do. Those limits encompass what kind of photos they take. ""There are many restrictions on photography that have to be obeyed in DPRK,"" warns the travel agency Koryo Tours, using a shorthand term for North Korea. Photographers who have spent time in the country say that particular care must be taken when snapping pictures of statues of North Korean leaders. ""It's seen as an insult to crop out hands, feet or head when taking photos of statues or pictures of government leaders or officials,"" Olaf Schuelke, a documentary photographer, wrote in an article for CNN. His comments were echoed by photojournalist Julia Leeb, who told NPR about her experience. ""You have to bow ... out of respect, and if you take pictures, you should take the entire statue,"" she said. ""You cannot take a portrait, for example ... because it's a lack of respect. And you cannot take pictures from behind.""  Leeb also warned that you're not allowed to fold a newspaper with an image of the leader on it. Balloons . OK, so we're not talking about party balloons. The North Korean regime regularly works itself into a lather of rage about balloons floated over the border by South Korean activists. Their anger is directed specifically at the cargo carried by the balloons. That can include items like dollar bills, DVDs and tiny AM/FM radios that show the prosperity in South Korea, as well as documents criticizing the North Korean regime. The balloons sometimes even carry Choco Pies, cheap snacks that are viewed as high-value treats in North Korea. The balloons drive the regime in Pyongyang nuts, drawing regular threats of violent reprisals. The North's state media have warned in the past of ""merciless strikes"" against the launches. In October, the North Korean military blasted anti-aircraft rounds at one flock of balloons, prompting South Korea to respond with a burst of heavy machine gun fire. The Bible . In a state built around an extreme personality cult, other belief systems can be touchy subjects. That's what Jeffrey Fowle, a municipal worker from Ohio, discovered to his considerable cost earlier this year. During a visit to the country, Fowle left a Bible at a club for foreign sailors. North Korean authorities interpreted the act as a violation of its laws and held the father of three prisoner for five months. ""I'd read about the persecution of the Christians in the country -- I felt compelled to help them in some way,"" Fowle told CNN in October after he was released by North Korea and flown out on a U.S. government plane. Although North Korea has some state-controlled churches, the regime forbids independent religious activities. One that isn't true . Skewering the issue with its inimitable brand of satire, The Onion summed up North Korea's melodramatic tendencies in 2006 with a spoof article about Kim Jong Un's father and predecessor, entitled, ""Kim Jong-Il Interprets Sunrise As Act Of War.""","North Korea has described the movie ""The Interview"" as ""terrorism and a war action""

"The deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, was ""likely preventable"" based on known security shortfalls and prior warnings that the security situation there was deteriorating, the majority of the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded in a report released on Wednesday. Separately, the findings also noted what the FBI had told the panel -- that 15 people  cooperating with its investigation had been killed in Benghazi, undercutting the investigation. It was not clear if the killings were related to the probe. Moreover, it said that people linked with various al Qaeda-related groups in North Africa and elsewhere participated in the September 11, 2012, attack, but investigators haven't been able to determine whether any one group was in command. The report placed some blame for the outcome on the State Department, saying it should have ""increased its security posture more significantly"" in Libya's second-largest city because of general warnings that U.S. personnel were at risk. The intelligence community ""provided ample strategic warning"" that Americans and U.S. facilities were in danger, though it didn't offer a single warning that would have predicted the Benghazi attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, the report said. But the findings didn't spare the intelligence community, saying it might have flagged potential threats to the compound had it done more analysis of ""extremist-affiliated social media."" It also blasted U.S. intelligence for inaccurately reporting -- without ""sufficient intelligence to corroborate it"" -- that a protest might have led to the attack. The report said the intelligence community took too long to correct the erroneous reports, ""which caused confusion and influenced the public statements of policymakers."" The Obama administration initially believed the armed assault was triggered by outrage over a U.S.-produced anti-Muslim film. It has since classified it as an organized terror attack. Investigators haven't found evidence of pre-planning and suggest at least part of the attack was ""opportunistic."" That suggests a vulnerability for diplomatic facilities, because attacks can happen with little warning, the report said. Questions around security and intelligence as well as the slow-to-evolve and changing explanation fueled a ferocious response from Republicans in Congress, who have sharply criticized the administration and continue to investigate. New York Times report casts doubt on al Qaeda involvement in Benghazi . A State Department spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said the report largely affirms the findings of an independent review of the Benghazi matter that recommended steps -- since undertaken by the agency -- to improve security at diplomatic facilities worldwide. On the issue of whether the attacks were preventable, Harf noted that ""we have repeatedly said there was no specific threat"" pointing to an attack. ""Obviously, we've talked at length about the fact that we knew there were extremists and terrorists operating in Libya and in Benghazi.  But, again, we had no specific information indicating a threat an attack was coming,"" she said. The Intelligence Committee report follows the release on Monday of previously classified information by the House Armed Services Committee. According to the documents, senior military officials told the panel there were no discussions related to any specific threat in Libya despite general warnings about the possibility of terror attacks around the anniversary of 9/11. As a result, additional military assets were not deployed to the area. On the investigation, the FBI was quoted in the report as saying the 15 deaths have severely hampered its probe. ""The FBI's investigation into the individuals responsible for the Benghazi attacks has been hampered by inadequate cooperation and a lack of capacity by foreign governments to hold these perpetrators accountable, making the pursuit of justice for the attacks slow and insufficient,"" the report said. ""As a result, key information gaps remain about the potential foreknowledge and complicity of Libyan militia groups and security forces, the level of pre-planning for the attacks, the perpetrators and their involvement in other terrorist activities and the motivation for the attacks."" Several Intelligence Committee Republicans issued a separate set of conclusions. Committee Vice Chairman Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, and Dan Coats of Indiana said failures that led to the attack could be partly related to Obama's failure, in their words, to establish a clear detention policy for terror suspects that gets the most out of intelligence collection. Instead of sending terror suspects directly to the military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the administration has temporarily interrogated suspects on Navy ships, sometimes for weeks at a time, before sending them to the United States for trial. ""President Obama and his administration must end their efforts to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and must develop a clear, cogent policy for the detention and interrogation of suspected terrorists,"" the Senators wrote.

"Established in 2007 following the Red Mosque siege, the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), or Pakistani Taliban, is now a prominent actor in that country's politics. It is a diverse umbrella group uniting some 30 militant groups across the Kyber-Pasktunskwa and other tribal areas bordering Afghanistan. It is estimated that there are some 30,000 TTP operatives. Each of these groups aims to establish local spheres of Sharia law, impose a particular restrictive vision of Islamic living, and resist federal governance in the region. They also collectively condemn Pakistani support for the United States in the ""war against terror."" It is worth remembering that the TTP movement initially enjoyed some local support in the region before their violent methods began to alienate the population. In Swat, the TTP targeted landowners and gave local peasants greater access to vacated land and gemstones mines, which, through profit-sharing agreements, also afforded the movement a new revenue stream. The TTP message of religiously derived, quickly administered justice independent of the slow and arguably corrupt court system seemed to resonate with locals.  However TTP violence over the years should not be underestimated. A report by the Pakistan Peace Institute reveals that last year in the Khyber-Pashtunwakha alone 476 attacks were carried out by the TTP and associated groups, leaving 572 civilians dead (along with 115 security personnel) and injured another 1,529 (including 216 security personnel). The majority of those affected are the civilian poor. Some have criticised Pakistan for not addressing the TTP and other militant groups sooner, or not taking the threat they pose seriously enough. Jihadi 'tourist resort' The delay by the military and police in tackling these groups was because they were not considered a substantive threat to the Pakistani state as a whole -- little is considered as great a threat to the existence of Pakistan as India and militants have been used as ""proxy warriors"" in that fight. Pakistani novelist Mohammad Hanif said the practice has turned the country into ""an international jihadi tourist resort."" Rather they were seen as misguided individuals dedicated to helping the good cause in Afghanistan or dismissed as a local rebellion. Nevertheless since 2009, there have been annual military offensives against the TTP and affiliates, leading to thousands of internally displaced people, collateral damage and a few militant deaths. This year, the Pakistani state relied more on airstrikes than in previous years, leading to claims of higher than ever civilian casualty rates, but also greater the usual number of TTP combatant deaths. Following these operations, the TTP have been widely predicted to fall: military jets had successfully bombed TTP hideouts, doctrinal splits over ""non-Islamic practices"" seemed to paralyze them, in September parts of the TTP had announced a ceasefire and renounced violence, and a high turnover of leadership positions (the current spokesperson only being in place for a few weeks) leading to uncertainty among TTP foot soldiers and rumors of desertion. Another revenge attack . Tuesday's school attack can be seen as another act of revenge, as the TTP spokesman said: ""We selected the army's school for the attack because the government is targeting our families and females ... We want them to feel the pain."" Thus TTP violence cannot be divorced from the violence carried out by the state and state agencies in Pakistan against civilians in countless military operations, through police brutality, curfews, drone strikes and extrajudicial ""disappearances."" We should not be surprised by the spike in violence now. As is typical of splintering militant groups and of those facing increased external pressure, the frequency, scale, and scope, of TTP violence has increased as the new leadership seeks to assert its authority and demonstrate strength to external audiences. The dramatic attack on the military school this December follows on the attack in the summer on Karachi airport, the bombing of a flag ceremony on the border with India, and in 2013 they carried out a daring jailbreak in Dera Ismali Khan, resulting in 35 ""high value"" militants escaping (along with 240 other prisoners). The group also, infamously, targeted the Nobel prize winner Malala Yousafzai, who had campaigned for girls education in Pakistan. Schools, especially girls' schools, are a frequent target of the TTP. The targeting of a school this week -- especially one where most of the students are children of military personnel -- is not just about gaining shock and awe but a continuation of its campaign to violently target those who challenge its moral order. More than a thousand schools have been destroyed by Islamist militants from one faction or another in the province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa in the past five years. Schools symbolize government authority and are seen as un-Islamic. Pure Islamic order . The TTP -- convinced of the possibility of a pure perfect Islamic order -- seeks to exclude from public politics and from the public spaces those that are ""unperfectable:"" women, homosexuals and the unrighteous who support infidels. The TTP target public spaces that distract from their vision of the perfect life: shrines, barber shops, Eid prayer congregations, market squares, music shops, political rallies, and schools. This attack near Peshawar is a reminder that the military, and wider Pakistan, are not exempt from this desired order. Therefore revenge and demonstrations of strength are only a partial explanation of this attack. It also reflects their broader aim to confine politics to a restricted group of people (""righteous males""), a limited range of activities (excluding fine arts and public expressions of merriment), and a severely constrained public space. Pakistan is a resilient country, surviving one crisis after another. It is culturally rich, with a vibrant tradition of public politics and plurality. From the kite flying festival to Eid prayer congregations, from dancing girls to worship at Sufi shrines, Pakistani's expressions of joy and togetherness are excellent enactments of Pakistan. The best antidote to the TTP would be to embrace this side of Pakistan. If people hide behind closed doors, remain uneducated, the TTP's ideal of a restricted politics and an empty public sphere will become reality.","Taliban condemn Pakistani support for the United States .

"A mysterious castaway claiming to have been lost at sea for 13 months is now safely back on land, but many questions remain about how he could have lived on his small boat for so long as it drifted across the Pacific Ocean. The man calling himself Jose Salvador Alvarenga turned up in a heavily damaged boat on a remote coral atoll in the Marshall Islands, claiming that he had been living off fish and turtles he had caught and relying on rainwater, and sometimes his own urine, to drink. Authorities are trying to determine the veracity of Alvarenga's story. The Mexican government issued a statement Monday confirming Alvarenga's identity and saying he was an El Salvador national who was living in Tonala in Chiapas state. Alvarenga is from Garita Palmera in El Salvador, where CNN caught up with some members of his family. They hadn't heard from him in ages and thought he might be dead. He has a 12-year-old daughter there who doesn't remember her father. ""My heart would tell me that my son was not dead, but I wondered about it so often that I had started to lose faith,"" said Julia Alvarenga, his mother. ""God willing, my son is not dead. God willing, my son is alive. And we're going to see him again one day. I'm very happy after learning that he's alive and that we will have him back home soon,"" his father, Ricardo, said. Alvarenga was found on sparsely populated Ebon Atoll, a 22-hour boat ride from the Marshall Islands capital of Majuro, on Thursday. The southernmost of the Marshall Islands' atolls, Ebon has only 2.2 square miles of land, one phone line and no Internet service. The government airplane that services the atoll was not working, so Alvarenga did not make it to Majuro until Monday morning. Video from Majuro shows Alvarenga walking a gangplank from a government boat to a waiting ambulance. Waving to those gathered around the dock, he is supported by a medical assistant as he walks. From inside the ambulance, he gives a thumbs up before it drives away. Alvarenga, who says he is 37, is now in a local hospital recovering from his ordeal, said Tom Armbruster, U.S. ambassador to the Marshall Islands. ""He's in much better shape than one would expect after such an ordeal,"" Armbruster said. In a hospital-bed interview with The Telegraph of London, Alvarenga told of how he hit land. ""I had just killed a bird to eat and saw some trees,"" he is quoted as saying. ""I cried, 'Oh, God.' I got to land and had a mountain of sleep. In the morning, I woke up and heard a rooster and saw chickens and saw a small house. I saw two native women screaming and yelling. I didn't have any clothes; I was only in my underwear, and they were ripped and torn,"" The Telegraph quotes Alvarenga as saying. Teen survives 26 days adrift . People on the island where he was found Thursday say the 26-foot fiberglass boat was in very bad condition, covered in barnacles and with the carcasses of several turtles littering the deck. Alvarenga is said to have set off from the Mexican town of Costa Azul, according to Reynaldo Aguilar Martinez, undersecretary for the state of Chiapas. He claims to have left for what was supposed to be a one-day expedition to catch sharks on December 21, 2012. Alvarenga said that he and a teenage companion were blown off-course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm, eventually losing use of their engines. How to survive being stranded at sea . According to Anjenette Kattil of the Marshall Islands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Alvarenga said that four weeks into their drift, he lost the young man because he refused to eat raw birds. There are no details on what Alvarenga did with the young man's body. Alvarenga told the Telegraph his companion's death had him contemplating suicide. ""For four days, I wanted to kill myself. But I couldn't feel the desire; I didn't want to feel the pain. I couldn't do it,"" he is quoted as saying. Kattil said Alvarenga worked for a company named Camaroneras de la Costa in Mexico. He has told authorities that he is a citizen of El Salvador but has lived in Mexico for the past 15 years and wishes to be repatriated back to Mexico. Armbruster, the U.S. ambassador, said Alvarenga indicated that he had relatives living the United States and U.S. officials would attempt to locate them. Massive tuna drags fisherman into ocean . Government officials have been in contact with Mexico's ambassador to the Marshall Islands, who is based in the Philippines, concerning Alvarenga in hopes he can contact El Salvadoran authorities. The Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement saying it has sent personnel from its embassy in the Philippines ""to learn directly about the case."" If Alvarenga's story proves true, the trip across the Pacific would have taken him across roughly 6,700 miles (10,800 kilometers) of open ocean before ending in the Marshall Islands, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, in the northern Pacific. Such an amazing journey isn't unheard-of in the small Pacific nation, as three Mexican fishermen made a similar drift voyage in 2006 that lasted nine months. Those men lived off fish they caught and rainwater, and they read the Bible for comfort. Conditions in the Pacific make the timeline of Alvarenga's journey plausible, according to Judson Jones, a producer for CNN Weather. Jones said the currents between Mexico and the Marshall Islands would have carried a boat about 27 miles (42 kilometers) a day. That would mean the journey would take about 208 days if the boat stayed in the current. But Jones said a meandering journey in and out of the currents was most likely, making a 13-month journey believable.","His family in El Salvador thought he was dead .

"Michelle Javian remembers the exact moment she got the news that her father had a massive heart attack. She was driving her car. Her mother called her. ""I just remember stopping in the middle of the street, just in complete shock,"" Javian said. Doctors were able to save her father's life that day, but he spent the next two years in and out of a New York City hospital to treat his heart disease. Fortunately, Javian and her family lived near the city and could easily travel to and from the hospital. But she met countless families in the hospital who were not as lucky. ""They were living in the waiting rooms day in and day out, taking showers wherever and whenever they could, eating really unhealthy,"" said Javian, 31. ""They were emotionally drained."" New York City boasts world-class hospitals for cardiac care. But it is also one of the most expensive cities, putting hotels, transportation and even food out of reach for some families. After her father passed away in 2008, Javian teamed up with a friend to co-found Harboring Hearts. The New York City nonprofit provides financial and emotional relief to families battling heart disease. ""We try to help them with what they would normally be able to handle on their own, but because of their attention and focus and dedication to their family member, they're unable to meet those needs,"" Javian said. Harboring Hearts helps cover expenses such as transportation, housing, meals and child care. Keeping family together . Javian and her group consult with social workers from three hospitals to identify families who need them the most. For families such as the Gambinis, the support they receive from Harboring Hearts can be a lifesaver. Brandon Gambini had a heart transplant when he was 5 weeks old.  Since then, the now 13-year-old has required medication and regular tests at the hospital to make sure his body is not rejecting his heart. His mother, Jacqueline, was introduced to Harboring Hearts in 2012, after Superstorm Sandy flooded the family's home and car. A single mother of three, Jacqueline had nowhere to turn to find a safe, clean place for her son. The family went to a crowded shelter, but because of Brandon's weak immune system, they could not stay there. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . ""It was a really bad time. I had no money. I lost everything at once,"" Jacqueline said. ""I told the hospital I needed help."" Within 48 hours, Javian's group was able to find a hotel for the family. The organization also helped cover their mortgage and purchase new furniture for their house once they were able to move back in. Recently, the group funded the Gambinis' transportation to New York City and a hotel room near the hospital during Brandon's stay. ""Having them is like having part of the family, and having someone you can ask when you need help,"" Jacqueline said. ""It's a support -- something I don't have right now."" From one heart to another . Since 2009, Harboring Hearts has helped cover more than $150,000 in services for families, Javian said. The group also hosts roughly six community events a year, where recipient families can connect with each other. Nearly 3,000 families have participated in the events. ""They can really relate to one another,"" Javian said. ""Whether it is similar financial experiences or it is emotional, they connect and bond."" For Javian, her efforts are a chance to keep her father's memory alive. ""After my father passed away, it was really difficult, and I wanted to do something positive from the loss,"" she said. ""I feel like it's one of my life's purposes ... to do good and bring happiness and relief and support to the families in need."" Want to get involved?

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Ralph Nader is entering the presidential race as an independent, he announced Sunday, saying it is time for a ""Jeffersonian revolution."" Ralph Nader is running for president as an independent. ""In the last few years, big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevent us from trying to improve our country. And I want everybody to have the right and opportunity to improve their country,"" he told reporters after an appearance announcing his candidacy on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Asked why he should be president, the longtime consumer advocate said, ""Because I got things done."" He cited a 40-year record, which he said includes saving ""millions of lives,"" bringing about stricter protection for food and water and fighting corporate control over Washington. Nader's decision, which did not come as a surprise to political watchers, marks his fourth straight White House bid -- fifth if his 1992 write-in campaign is included. The two contenders for the Democratic nomination were quick to pounce. ""He thought that there was no difference between Al Gore and George Bush and, eight years later, I think people realize that Ralph did not know what he was talking about,"" Sen. Barack Obama said a town hall meeting Sunday.  Watch Nader describe whom the Democrats should be ""going after"" » . Calling Nader's move ""very unfortunate,"" Sen. Hillary Clinton told reporters, ""I remember when he ran before. It didn't turn out very well for anybody -- especially our country."" ""This time I hope it doesn't hurt anyone. I can't think of anybody that would vote for Sen. McCain who would vote for Ralph Nader,"" she said. Nader was criticized by some Democrats in 2000 for allegedly pulling away support from Democrat Al Gore and helping George Bush win the White House. Noting that he ran on the Green Party ticket that year, Clinton said Nader ""prevented Al Gore from being the 'greenest' president we could have had."" Nader has long rejected his portrayal as a spoiler in the presidential race. In his NBC interview Sunday, he cited the Republican Party's economic policies, the Iraq war, and other issues, saying, ""If the Democrats can't landslide the Republicans this year, they ought to just wrap up, close down, emerge in a different form."" But Clinton said, ""Obviously, it is not helpful to whoever our Democratic nominee is. But, you know, it is a free country."" Nader said political consultants ""have really messed up Hillary Clinton's campaign."" Long-shot GOP contender Mike Huckabee said Nader's entry would probably help his party. ""I think it always would probably pull votes away from the Democrats and not the Republicans, so naturally, Republicans would welcome his entry into the race,"" Huckabee said Sunday on CNN. Nader said Thomas Jefferson believed that ""when you lose your government, you've got to go into the electoral arena."" ""A Jeffersonian revolution is needed in this country,"" he said. Nader told NBC that great changes in U.S. history have come ""through little parties that never won any national election."" ""Dissent is the mother of ascent,"" he said. ""And in that context I've decided to run for president."" Nader, who turns 74 this week, complained about the ""paralysis of the government,"" which he said is under the control of corporate executives and lobbyists. Obama also criticized Nader earlier this weekend. ""My sense is that Mr. Nader is somebody who, if you don't listen and adopt all of his policies, thinks you're not substantive,"" he told reporters when asked about Nader's possible candidacy. ""He seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work."" Obama said Nader ""is a singular figure in American politics and has done as much as just about anyone for consumers."" ""I don't mean to diminish that,"" he said. ""There's a sense now that if someone's not hewing to the Ralph Nader agenda, he says they're lacking in some way."" Responding to those remarks, Nader called Obama ""a person of substance"" and ""the first liberal evangelist in a long time"" who ""has run a good tactical campaign."" But he accused Obama of censoring ""his better instincts"" on divisive issues. Nader encouraged people to look at his campaign Web site, votenader.org, which he said discusses issues important to Americans that Obama and Sen. John McCain ""are not addressing.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama is planning to nominate at least three key members of his national security team at an event in Chicago, Illinois, on Monday, including Sen. Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, according to two Democratic officials. Sen. Hillary Clinton will be nominated to be Barack Obama's secretary of state, sources say. The officials said Obama is also expected to confirm that he is keeping Defense Secretary Robert Gates in his current post and naming retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones as his national security adviser at the White House. The officials said that after much contemplation, Jones officially agreed to take the job in the past few days. All of the selections are hardly a surprise after weeks of fevered speculation. In fact, they're such an open secret that retiring Republican Sen. John Warner, a veteran member of the Armed Services Committee, released a statement Saturday night praising all three nominees before they have been officially named at Monday's rollout. ""The triumvirate of Gates, Clinton and Jones to lead Obama's 'national security team' instills great confidence at home and abroad and further strengthens the growing respect for the president-elect's courage and ability to exercise sound judgment in selecting the 'best and the brightest' to implement our nation's security policies,"" Warner said.","President-elect to name key members of security team, Democratic officials say .

"Alec Baldwin is at it again. And this time, a journalist is on the receiving end of his expletive-filled rant. The actor waged a war of words with a Daily Mail journalist over a report alleging Baldwin's wife was tweeting during actor James Gandolfini's funeral Thursday. ""The pregnant yoga instructor's social media feed was full of upbeat posts while 'The Sopranos' star's friends, family and co-stars were gripped with grief at a New York Catholic church,"" journalist George Stark wrote. ""Messages included a request for ideas about wedding anniversary presents and promotional notes about her upcoming appearance on the Rachael Ray show."" In a statement hours later, Baldwin said his wife, Hilaria, left her phone in her car. ""It's disgraceful that a reporter would manufacture and publish a story and not call for comment or explanation -- especially when it's intended to take away attention from honoring the memory of a beloved figure like James Gandolfini,"" he said Friday. His statement came after a series of fiery tweets aimed at the journalist. ""My wife and I attend a funeral to pay our respects to an old friend, and some toxic Brit writes this f****** trash,"" he tweeted. ""My wife DID NOT use her phone, in any capacity, at our friends funeral."" The star of the award-winning comedy ""30 Rock""  threatened to find the writer of the story and ""f****...you...up,"" referring to  Stark as a ""toxic little queen."" Attempts to reach the journalist were unsuccessful. Baldwin's wife also weighed in on the report. ""I hope that this reporter knows how much pain and drama he has caused from his poor journalism,"" Hilaria Baldwin tweeted. ""Lying and bullying are shameful."" Twitter, which lets users post messages in 140 characters or less, also allows the advance scheduling of tweets to post later. It is unclear whether that was the case. Shortly after the rant, Baldwin deleted his Twitter account. On Friday, GLAAD, an LGBT advocacy group, published a statement Baldwin gave to the organization: ""My ill-advised attack on George Stark of the Daily Mail had absolutely nothing to do with issues of anyone's sexual orientation."" Baldwin also wrote, ""I would not advocate violence against someone for being gay and I hope that my friends at GLAAD and the gay community understand that my attack on Mr. Stark in no way was the result of homophobia."" Baldwin told the online publication Gothamist that he won't be going back to Twitter. ""Twitter and Tumblr and Vine and Instagram and Facebook and Myspace, all these things are social media tools that we were all told we had to have, and what we're realizing is that no you don't! No you don't. All this energy goes into these things, and for what?"" he said. This is not the first time the actor has been engaged in a public confrontation. In 2011, he was booted off an American Airlines flight because he refused to turn off his cell phone after the plane's doors were closed for departure. He later apologized.","Baldwin says his wife left her phone in her car .

"Tucson, Arizona, public schools suspended their Mexican-American studies program after an administrative law judge ruled it violated a new state law and the state said the local district was going to lose $15 million in annual aid, officials said. The Governing Board of the Tucson Unified School District voted late Tuesday to suspend immediately the Mexican-American studies department, marking a turning point in a yearlong controversy over a new state law banning certain ethnic studies. ""The district shall revise its social studies core curriculum to increase its coverage of Mexican-American history and culture, including a balanced presentation of diverse viewpoints on controversial issues. The end result shall be a single common social studies core sequence through which all high school students are exposed to diverse viewpoints,"" the governing board said in a statement. ""The district shall study and bring to the board new measures designed to narrow the achievement gaps for traditionally underserved and economically disadvantaged students,"" the board said. The board action came in the wake of Friday's order by Arizona State Superintendent John Huppenthal to withhold 10% -- or about $15 million a year -- of state aid to the Tucson district retroactive to August 15, 2011, according to a copy of the order posted on the district's website. The state superintendent's order was, in turn, made after last month's ruling by an administrative law judge that found the program's curriculum was teaching Latino history and culture ""in a biased, political, and emotionally charged manner,"" and upheld state officials' findings that it violated a state law passed in 2010. The Tucson Unified School District had appealed a decision by the law's chief backer, then-state schools superintendent Tom Horne, to shut down the program. Horne left office at the end of 2010, but his successor, Huppenthal, backed Horne's ruling in June. Under the law, the state can withhold 10% of its funding for the school district until the district changes the course. During their appeal, district officials pointed out that an audit commissioned by Huppenthal praised the program and found ""no observable evidence"" that the classes violated state law. A witness for the school system argued that teaching students ""historical facts of oppression and racism"" was less likely to promote ""racial resentment"" -- something specifically banned by the 2010 law -- than ignoring that history. In last month's ruling, administrative law judge Lewis Kowal said the auditors observed only a limited number of classes. He added, ""Teaching oppression objectively is quite different than actively presenting material in a biased, political, and emotionally charged manner."" Tucson educators who have challenged the constitutionality of the new law in court have defended the Mexican-American studies program as no different than African-American or Native American studies classes. Tucson school board member Adelita Grijalva has charged that the new law provided no due process and was unconstitutional. She has said the new law is part of an anti-immigrant political climate in the Arizona statehouse. At Tuesday night's meeting, Grijalva unsuccessfully urged the board to preserve the program, saying the district should appeal, according to CNN affiliate KGUN. ""This is a group of passionate people about their education and the education of their children. This is not a militarized group that wants to overthrow the government. This is not a group that is seeking ethnic solidarity. This is a group that wants their children to understand about their culture and their role in our American history and our lives,"" Grijalva said during the board meeting. Grijalva was the sole ""no"" vote in the board's 4-1 decision to suspend the program. The new schools law is the latest controversy in a state already roiled by an immigration crackdown law, known as SB 1070, that is being challenged on constitutional grounds in federal court. The Arizona-Mexico border is considered the nation's busiest for illegal immigration. The law authorizes the state superintendent to stop any ethnic studies classes that promote the overthrow of the U.S. government, promote resentment toward a race or class of people, are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group or advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals.","The program is suspended after an administrative judge said it violated a new state law .

"(CNN) -- Cincinnati Bengals football player Chris Henry died after he fell from the bed of a moving pickup truck during a fight with his fiancée, police said Thursday. ""Chris Henry died as a result of his injuries sustained during this incident,"" a Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police news release said. ""Department detectives continue to work diligently on this active investigation."" Henry died at 6:36 a.m. ET Thursday, the statement said. Shortly before noon Wednesday, Henry's fiancée tried to drive off during a ""domestic situation,"" only to have Henry jump into the bed of the truck, police said. ""The domestic situation continued between the operator and Mr. Henry,"" according to a police statement. Henry ""came out of the back of the vehicle"" about half a mile from the house, it said. Henry was a native of Belle Chasse, Louisiana, according to the Bengals' Web site. He and his fiancée, Loleini Tonga, had planned to be married in March, the team said. Henry leaves three children -- two sons and a daughter, the team said. Tonga's family lives in Charlotte. Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said he told players of Henry's death, speaking to them a couple of times Thursday. He declined to tell reporters what was said. ""That's between us,"" Lewis said. Authorities described Henry's injuries Wednesday night as ""life-threatening."" He was taken to the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. The 26-year-old receiver played for the Bengals for five seasons but was on the injured reserve list after suffering a fractured forearm during a November 8 game against the Baltimore Ravens. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound Henry caught 12 passes for 236 yards and two touchdowns in eight games this season before being hurt. Henry played at West Virginia University and joined the Bengals as a third-round draft pick in 2005, the team said. He was in Cincinnati, Ohio, last weekend for an examination and was cleared to return to Charlotte to be with Tonga and her family, as no rehabilitation was necessary beyond periodic adjustments to his cast, a team statement said. An article on the Bengals Web site called Henry ""one of the best comeback stories in the NFL"" before being injured, saying he had rebuilt ""his life and career in a three-year climb from a series of off-field problems."" The problems, the article said, included four arrests, three NFL suspensions and a release from the Bengals in April 2008. But Henry had since ""put his life back together,"" according to the article. ""He's a big part of what we are,"" left tackle Andrew Whitworth said in the article. ""I really admire how he carries himself, how he's changed his life, and how he's made his career his passion. That's what this team has done. He's one of the guys that has helped give this team that attitude."" Mike Brown, the club's president, told reporters Thursday he didn't regret giving Henry a second chance. Watch team management reflect on Henry's life . Henry had ""finally seemingly reached the point where everything was going to blossom, and he was going to have the future that we all wanted for him and he wanted for himself. And then this tragedy cut him down,"" Brown said. ""It's a terrible tragedy that just at the time he was running to daylight, if you will, his life was snuffed out."" Funeral details were pending and will be released later, Brown said. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement, ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to Chris' family, including his Bengals family. We have been in contact with the Bengals to offer our support through this difficult time."" Lewis said when he talked with Henry in August about coming back, ""there was a different man that was sitting across from me and a different person. From that point on, we've seen pretty much a continual growth."" Tonga ""had been a very steadying force in Chris' life,"" Lewis said. According to an article on the Bengals' Web site, right guard Bobbie Williams spoke to his teammates during a locker room huddle. ""Maybe go home tonight and hug your family a little tighter,"" he reportedly said. Wide receiver Chad Ochocinco broke into tears before the cameras and could not finish, according to the article. Ochocinco was wearing Henry's No. 15 jersey as practice got under way Thursday. Brown, Lewis and others spoke of Henry's gentle and soft-spoken nature, his big heart and his love for his children. ""Our football team, what they're feeling yesterday and this morning ... they watched a guy mature as a young man and work through adversity,"" Lewis said, adding that Henry became ""a beacon of hope."" Lewis recalled seeing Henry at rookie camp, catching the first ball thrown to him and sticking up his finger in celebration. Read SI.com's take on the death . ""I told the receivers coach at that time, 'You better get him,' "" he said. At West Virginia, Henry tied the school's single-season touchdown reception record with 12. He was second in the university's career touchdown receptions with 22 and eighth in career yardage with 1,878. The Bengals are one win away from clinching the AFC North title. Players will leave Friday for Sunday's game in San Diego, California. A memorial helmet decal and a coaches' pin will be worn during the game to honor Henry, the Bengals said.","NEW: Teammate reportedly cries for Chris Henry, wears his No. 15 jersey to practice .

"Here's a look at the timeline of events in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida, and the ensuing uproar. February 26 . About 7 p.m.: George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old neighborhood watch captain, calls 911 to report ""a suspicious person"" in the gated community Retreat at Twin Lakes. Zimmerman says he is following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don't need you to do that."" Zimmerman pursues Martin anyway, but then says he lost sight of him. About 7:10 p.m.: Phone records show Martin was on the phone with his girlfriend around the time he saw Zimmerman while returning on foot from a convenience store to his the home of his father's fiancee. At a March 20 news conference, Martin family attorney Benjamin Crump says the girl heard someone ask Martin what he was doing and Martin asking why the person was following him. The girl gets the impression that there is an altercation, during which the earpiece falls from Martin's ear and the connection goes dead, according to Crump. According to an Orlando Sentinel story later confirmed by Sanford police, Zimmerman tells authorities that after Zimmerman briefly lost track of Martin, the teen approached him. After the two exchange words, Zimmerman says, he reaches for his cell phone, and then Martin punches him in the nose. Zimmerman says Martin pins him to the ground and begins slamming his head into the sidewalk. About 7:25 p.m.: Martin is shot and killed. It is raining. At the time of his death, the teenager is unarmed and carrying a small amount of cash, a bag of Skittles candy and a can of iced tea. Several neighbors of the gated community call 911, with authorities eventually releasing the contents of seven such calls. In one, a man whispers, ""Hurry, please. ... There's someone screaming outside. There's a gunshot. Hurry up. ... There's someone screaming. I just heard a gunshot."" Another neighbor says, ""There were gunshots right outside my house. There's someone screaming. I just heard a guy shot. Hurry up. They are right outside my house."" In another call, a woman begs dispatchers to send help, saying someone is ""screaming and hollering"" for help. Moments later, she describes a light at the scene of the shooting. ""Oh, my God,"" she says. ""There's still somebody out there walking with a flashlight."" About 7:30 p.m.: Zimmerman tells police he shot Martin in self-defense. In a police report, Officer Timothy Smith writes that Zimmerman is bleeding from the nose and back of the head. March 8: Trayvon Martin's father, Tracy Martin, family members and attorneys hold a news conference calling attention to the case. March 12: Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee says Zimmerman has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his account of the events. March 14: CNN's David Mattingly reports that police have concluded their investigation and turned the file over to the state attorney, who will decide whether to file charges. Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, create a petition on the website Change.org calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Within a week, it is the second most-popular petition in the website's history, with 877,110 signatures. The NAACP asks the Justice Department to get involved in the investigation. March 15: In a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, George Zimmerman's father writes that his son has been unfairly portrayed as a racist. Robert Zimmerman writes that his son is Hispanic and grew up in a multiracial family. March 16: Authorities release seven calls to police from the night of the shooting. In one of the 911 recordings, Zimmerman says he is following Martin. Also in one of the recordings, a voice can be heard in the background screaming ""Help, help!"" followed by the sound of a gunshot. March 19: The Justice Department announces that it has launched an investigation into Martin's death. Florida Gov. Rick Scott asks state officials to assist in the investigation. March 20: Florida Rep. Dennis Baxley, who sponsored the ""stand your ground"" law in 2005, says nothing in it allows people to ""pursue and confront."" The law allows people to use deadly force to defend themselves anywhere they feel a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. The Justice Department sends representation to Sanford to investigate and ""to address tension in the community."" March 21: CNN analyzes one of the tapes of Zimmerman's call to dispatch, in which he is purported to have used a racial slur. The results are inconclusive. March 22: Police Chief Lee announces that he is stepping down temporarily as head of the department, which has been criticized for its handling of the shooting. Scott announces that he is appointing State's Attorney Angela Corey of the 4th Judicial Circuit as special prosecutor, replacing Norman Wolfinger. As the petition calling for Zimmerman's arrest reaches 1 million signatures, according to Change.org, civil rights activists, politicians, family and supporters converge on Fort Mellon Park in Sanford to rally for swift judicial action, including Zimmerman's arrest. March 23: President Barack Obama speaks publicly for the first time on the growing controversy, saying the incident requires national ""soul-searching."" March 24: A handful of members from the New Black Panther Party offer a $10,000 reward for the ""capture"" of George Zimmerman. March 26: One month after Martin was killed, demonstrators rally across the country calling for Zimmerman's arrest. In Sanford, the City Commission holds a town hall meeting on the incident and its aftermath. March 28: Zimmerman's father, Robert, appears on television and says Martin threatened to kill Zimmerman and then beat him so badly that Zimmerman was forced to shoot. March 29: Zimmerman's brother, Robert Zimmerman Jr., appears on CNN and says medical records will prove that his brother was attacked and his nose was broken by Martin before he fatally shot the teen. March 29: A witness, who asks not to be identified, tells CNN of having heard voices, ""opening a window and then seeing -- with two men or two people on the ground, one on top of each other"" on the night Martin was shot dead. March 31: Civil rights leaders join throngs of protesters carrying ""Justice for Trayvon"" signs on Saturday, marching to the Sanford, Florida, police headquarters to demand the arrest of Zimmerman. April 2: Audio experts tell CNN that they don't believe it's Zimmerman who can be heard yelling ""Help!"" in the background of a 911 call. They compare those screams with Zimmerman's voice, as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a ""suspicious"" black male, who ended up being Martin. April 5: Zimmerman says he whispered ""punks,"" not a racial slur, in the moments before he shot Martin, his attorneys tell CNN. CNN's editorial staffers repeatedly review the tape but can reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. April 9: Special prosecutor Corey decides against using a grand jury in the case. ""We believed, from day one, that they had enough evidence to arrest the killer of Trayvon Martin and now, as the evidence has continued to unfold, we think there has been a plethora of evidence to simply effect probable cause to do an arrest -- not for a conviction, but for an arrest,"" says family attorney Benjamin Crump. April 10: Attorneys for Zimmerman say they have lost contact with their client and no longer represent him. Lawyer Hal Uhrig says Zimmerman has, on his own, called Sean Hannity of Fox News and the office of the special prosecutor appointed to lead the investigation. Uhrig also suggests that Zimmerman has left Florida. Zimmerman's now-former lawyers and friend Frank Taaffe confirm the authenticity of a website as having been launched by the neighborhood watch volunteer to warn supporters about groups falsely claiming to be raising funds for his defense and to solicit donations for himself. April 11: Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of Martin, says special prosecutor Angela Corey. ""This is a very, very major charge,"" says CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It carries the potential of life in prison. The jury instructions that the jury will receive is he can only be convicted if he showed a depraved attitude toward Trayvon Martin's life. That's a tough burden for a prosecutor to meet. But she has access to facts that we don't."" April 12: An affidavit of probable cause in Florida's case against Zimmerman says he ""profiled"" Martin and disregarded a police dispatcher's request that he await the arrival of police. Zimmerman's relatives say that he did not profile Martin and that he shot him in self-defense. They say Zimmerman killed Martin after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk. April 18: A Florida judge approves a motion to disqualify herself from the case, according to the court. Zimmerman's defense team had requested that Seminole Circuit Judge Jessica Recksiedler, who was assigned to the case, be removed after she revealed that her husband works with a CNN legal analyst. Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. is appointed to take her place. April 20: Speaking during a court hearing, Zimmerman apologizes to Martin's family. Moments later, a Florida judge sets bond at $150,000, allowing Zimmerman the chance to get out of jail while he awaits trial. April 23: Zimmerman enters a written not-guilty plea after being released on bail shortly after midnight. He has been fitted with a GPS monitoring device that allows authorities to track his location, the sheriff's department says. Lee resigns as Sanford police chief, but city commissioners vote against accepting his resignation.","February 26: George Zimmerman shot, killed Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida .

"Since the early days of his first presidential run, Barack Obama made a pledge -- to talk directly with America's enemies -- that most other politicians found naive. The approach famously drew snickers from Republicans and Democrats alike, who derided it as irresponsible -- a criticism that followed Obama into the White House. In the twilight of his administration, Obama's Wednesday announcement on normalizing relations with Cuba represented his last best chance to turn this idea into a doctrine that outlives his presidency. ""Change is hard — in our own lives, and in the lives of nations,"" Obama said. ""Change is even harder when we carry the heavy weight of history on our shoulders. But today we are making these changes because it is the right thing to do."" The challenge for Obama has always been to turn lofty foreign policy concepts into concrete results. The administration is also working on a groundbreaking nuclear deal with Iran, which, like Cuba, has been estranged from the United States for decades. But those talks, while showing signs of progress, aren't complete and have been bogged down by details and domestic politics in both countries. Taken together, Obama's approach to Cuba and Iran could decide whether he leaves the White House as a global statesman or as a president with unfulfilled big ideas. That dynamic is already playing out in the nascent 2016 presidential race. Republicans looking to retake the White House are slamming the Obama policy as reckless and say it leaves America less safe. Jeb Bush, a day after declaring he was exploring a 2016 run, called the move a ""dramatic overreach"" of Obama's executive authority. Marco Rubio branded the move as a ""dangerous and desperate attempt by the President to burnish his legacy at the Cuban people's expense."" Anticipating fierce blowback against Obama's moves, a senior administration official also stressed that the president would not tone down his calls for the protection of human rights and democratic development in Cuba. Soon after moving into the White House in 2009, Obama instructed Hillary Clinton's State Department to explore ways to promote an opening with Cuba, by then being led by Raul Castro. But the capture of US contractor Alan Gross a few months later put the process on hold. It was only when a deal was reached for the release of Gross on Wednesday, and a parallel swap of intelligence assets between the two sides, that the wider initiative to engage Cuba was unlocked. Mirroring his approach with his bid to end the 30-year standoff with Iran, Obama authorized a secret diplomatic track with the Cubans in the spring of 2013, senior US officials said on condition of anonymity. The first of a sequence of face-to-face talks which addressed the full range of irritants between the two sides took place in Canada in June last year. The US delegation was led by Ben Rhodes, a speechwriter who has become one of Obama's closest foreign policy confidants, and Ricardo Zuniga, the top National Security Council expert on Latin America. In retrospect, Obama's handshake with Raul Castro at Nelson Mandela's memorial service in South Africa a year ago might have offered a hint at the high stakes diplomacy going on behind the scenes. But Wednesday's actions were clearly those of a president who, eying his legacy, with only two years left in office, is still chasing blockbuster political achievements that eluded his predecessors. ""This is a legacy grabbing moment,"" Julia Sweig, an expert on Cuba at the Council on Foreign Relations told CNN. Carl Meacham, a Latin America scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the Cuba initiative had the potential to flesh out a presidential resume needing big wins. ""For a presidency that has at best modest achievements in the region ... to take the United States to the pathway of normalization is a clear legacy for Barack Obama,"" he said. Obama's presidency has in many ways often been a quest for the dramatic 'Nixon to China'-style initiative — from his early calls for the elimination of nuclear weapons, his request for a ""new beginning"" with Muslim nations in his Cairo speech in 2009 and his drive for a nuclear deal with Iran. But often, Obama's best intentions have been overtaken by chaotic global politics. The Arab Spring uprisings and subsequent authoritarian crackdowns and civil wars rendered his Cairo musings irrelevant. The rise of ISIS has challenged Obama's claim to have ended the Iraq war and the fate of Afghanistan looks deeply uncertain following the end of NATO combat operations this month. Other initiatives have also fizzled, like the much heralded first term ""reset"" of relations with Russia trashed by the return to the Kremlin of Vladimir Putin. Kerry's Middle East peace drive has failed. Still, the U.S. effort to promote political change in Myanmar has been a success — though is hung up on tricky questions of how much democracy the Southeast Asian nation's military will permit. Cuba has the potential to bolster Obama's reputation in the Western Hemisphere, where regional leaders had been piling on pressure for serious opening toward Havana. ""This president is going to get an enormous amount of support from most of the heads of government in Latin America,"" said Sweig. The Cuba bombshell is also another indication of the growing geopolitical opportunities opening up for the Obama administration as global oil prices collapse. Cuba's leaders may well have been more receptive to US advances, given the fact that Venezuela, its patron in the region is tanking along with energy prices. Another Cuban ally, Russia, is seeing its own economy slump for the same reason and analysts said Havana may have decided that its best hope for economic stability may lie in closer ties with its old enemy -- the United States -- in a twist of fate that gives Obama one more chance to make good on that promise he made back in 2007.","Obama makes good on vow to engage US enemies .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Embattled President Hosni Mubarak said early Saturday that he asked the country's government to resign after thousands of angry Egyptians defied a government curfew and faced stinging police tear gas as they marched for change. ""I asked the government to resign today and I will commission a new government to take over tomorrow,"" Mubarak said in a national address on Saturday shortly after midnight. As Mubarak spoke, Egyptian tanks rolled into the country's major cities after the nation's police force had been largely faced down by protesters on Friday. Demonstrators burned many police stations in Cairo and Alexandria and overturned and torched police vehicles. Mubarak faces toughest challenge . U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with the Egyptian president after Mubarak's address. ""When President Mubarak addressed the Egyptian people tonight, he pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity,"" Obama said from the White House. ""I just spoke to him after his speech, and told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words, to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise,"" Obama said in a televised appearance. ""Violence will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people. Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away."" ElBaradei: The man to lead a free Egypt? Mubarak gave no indication that he would step down or leave the country. ""I assure you that I'm working for the people and giving freedoms of opinion as long as you're respecting the law,"" he said. ""There is very little line between freedom and chaos."" Are you there? Send images, videos . At the same time, Mubarak said that ""these protests arose to express a legitimate demand for more democracy, need for a greater social safety net, and the improvement of living standards, fighting poverty and rampant corruption."" ""I understand these legitimate demands of the people and I truly understand the depth of their worries and burdens and I will not part from them ever and I will work for them everyday,"" he said. ""But regardless of what problems we face, this does not justify violence or lawlessness."" CNN Arabic . A senior Obama administration official, meanwhile, said Friday evening that Mubarak's speech was ""hardly conciliatory and highly disappointing, but what did you expect?"" It's clear, the official said -- speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter -- that Mubarak believes he can ride this out, ""and this time, we're not so sure that is the right assumption."" Administration officials had hoped Mubarak would promise an immediate and open dialogue, the official said. The streets of downtown Cairo appeared to calm somewhat overnight Friday as the army -- a much more respected force than police among Egyptian civilians -- took control of the country. The army was much less aggressive with protesters than the police had been, and many Egyptians applauded the arrival of its tanks in Cairo, Alexandria and elsewhere. One of the key questions ahead of sunrise in Egypt on Saturday is whether people will continue to welcome the army as a protective force or reject it as a tool of Mubarak. Celebratory crowds that had gathered overnight Friday ahead of Mubarak's speech, expecting him to announce his resignation, quickly transformed into street demonstrations when the president announced he was staying put. The government cracked down throughout Friday with thousands of riot and plainclothes police, later joined by army troops in tanks and armored personnel carriers equipped with gun turrets. Undeterred, people ran, screamed, hurled rocks and accosted walls of security as they tried to make their way to central Cairo. Anti-government demonstrators have taken to the streets in Egypt since Tuesday to demand an end to Mubarak's rule. The protests come weeks after similar disturbances sparked a revolution in Tunisia, forcing then-president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee the country. Both Egypt and Tunisia have seen dramatic rises in the cost of living in recent years and accusations of corruption among the ruling elite. In downtown Cairo, a calm seemed to be settling in overnight Friday amid little sign of authority. ""There is no authority ... there's nobody to protest against,"" CNN's Ben Wedeman said, speaking of the capital's downtown area. ""State authority in much of downtown Cairo has disappeared."" Mubarak imposed a nationwide curfew from 6 p.m. Friday to 7 a.m. Saturday. State-run Nile TV said the curfew was in response to the ""hooliganism and lawlessness"" of the protesters. Vans packed with riot police circled Cairo neighborhoods before the start of weekly prayers in the afternoon. Later in the day, Egyptian soldiers moved onto the streets, the first time the army has been deployed to quell unrest since 1985. But protesters defied all warnings to demand an end to Mubarak's authoritarian 30-year-rule. They chanted ""God is Great"" and that the dictator must go. ""Down, Down, Mubarak,"" they shouted. Plumes of rancid, thick smoke billowed over the Nile River as, by nightfall, chaos reigned in the bustling metropolis. The headquarters of the ruling National Democratic Party was ablaze Friday night. Nile TV said protesters ransacked the building and set it afire. Police fired water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas with force and impunity. A tourist on the balcony of his 18th floor hotel room told CNN he had to run in and wash his eyes and face from the stinging gas. Police confiscated cameras from people, including guests at the Hilton Hotel. At least six people have died in the demonstrations this week, according to Egypt's Interior Ministry. But Nile TV reported Friday that 13 have died and 75 were injured in Suez, south of Cairo, citing medical sources . As the government cracked down on protesters across Egypt, opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei, who returned home to Cairo to join the demonstrations, was placed under house arrest, a high-level security source told CNN. ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, was warned earlier not to leave a mosque near downtown Cairo where he was attending Friday prayers. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said that the U.S. is reviewing its aid to Egypt ""based on events now and in the coming days."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addressed the Egyptian crisis Friday, urging all parties to be peaceful and engage in dialogue. ""We are deeply concerned about the use of violence by Egyptian police and security forces against protesters and we call on the Egyptian government to do everything within its power to restrain its security forces,"" Clinton said. ""At the same time, protesters should also refrain from violence and express themselves peacefully."" The protests sent ripples around the world, with stocks plunging on news of Egypt unrest. The Dow dropped 166 points on Friday, its largest loss since November. The State Department urged Americans to defer all non-essential travel to Egypt and within the country. Delta Air Lines said its last flight from Cairo will depart Saturday; all other Cairo service was indefinitely suspended, said spokeswoman Susan Elliott. American Airlines and British Airways will allow customers with tickets between Friday and Monday to or from Cairo to change their flights at no charge, according American Airlines spokesman Edward Martelle. Egypt is the most populous nation in the Arab world and often a barometer for sentiment on the Arab community. ""What happens in Egypt will have an impact throughout the Arab world and the Middle East,"" said Edward Djerejian, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and Syria. In the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on Friday, at least 1,000 protesters gathered and youths hurled rocks through black clouds of gas. Crowds ran through the streets toward the city's central square. There was no indication of a curfew in that city either, as people remained out well after the time it was to begin. In Suez, 15,000 riot police were out, using tear gas to disperse crowds, Nile TV said. Riot police also confronted protesters in the cities and towns of Ismailia, Fayoum and Shbin Elkoum, according to the anti-government group Egyptian Liberation. A CNN crew covering the clashes in Cairo felt the wrath of the police. CNN's Wedeman and Mary Rogers were under an overpass and behind a column as police tried to hold back protesters. Plainclothes police wielding clubs surrounded the CNN team and wanted ""to haul us off,"" Wedeman said. In a struggle, police grabbed Rogers's camera, cracked its viewfinder, and confiscated it. Wedeman said the police threatened to beat them. Egypt's Interior Ministry forbade protests Friday, but some Egyptians went door to door in Cairo, urging their neighbors to participate. The main opposition bloc, the Muslim Brotherhood, urged its supporters for the first time to take to the streets. Hours ahead of the protests, the internet went dark in many parts of the country. Some text messaging and cell phone services appeared to be blocked. Even though it was difficult to use Twitter and Facebook within Egypt, thousands of others outside the country ran with the powerful social media tool to provide a real-time chronology of events. ""Mubarak"" was a trending topic. Authorities arrested a prominent Muslim Brotherhood leader early Friday, detaining the party's main speaker, Issam al-Aryan, according to a relative. Other government critics voiced their opinions -- amazingly -- on state-run television. A popular morning show on state-run Nile TV included comments from guests calling for the resignation of government officials and increased dialogue between authorities and arrested protesters. The network carried coverage of the protests, even at times calling them large and peaceful. They followed days of unrest that have roiled several Arab countries. Demonstrations in Tunisia were followed by protests in Algeria, Egypt, Yemen and Jordan. ""They all want the same,"" said Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in the Middle East, speaking of protesters in different Arab countries. ""They're all protesting about growing inequalities, they're all protesting against growing nepotism. The top of the pyramid was getting richer and richer."" People are also fed up with authoritarian regimes that do not afford the people proper representation. Mubarak has not been seen in public for some time. He is 82 and there has been speculation of failing health. Many Egyptians believe Mubarak is grooming his son, Gamal, as his successor, a plan that could be complicated by demands for democracy. CNN's Nic Robertson, Frederik Pleitgen, Salma Abdelaziz, Housam Ahmed and Caroline Faraj contributed to this report.","Tanks roll into Egyptian cities as army takes control .

"In broad daylight, with no fear of being seen, a group of Honduran girls -- some as young as 14 -- cross illegally into the United States. ""Because I want to see my parents in Austin,"" one tells CNN. Moments later, another group of Hondurans admits crossing the Rio Grande to get here, McAllen station, a border crossing into the United States. ""Thank God nothing happened,"" they say of the perilous journey. This group quickly grows to 22. Most are children who traveled without any adults. Unlike other stories of illegal immigration across a porous border, these immigrants aren't sneaking in. They're showing up and announcing themselves. ""We are seeing hundreds turning themselves in daily. And I mean hundreds at a time,"" said Chris Cabrera, a leader of the local chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union representing U.S. Border Patrol agents. Many of the immigrants use rafts to cross the Rio Grande, equipped with instructions to follow the river until reaching the Border Patrol site to surrender. ""They know that once they get to the station, we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the United States,"" Cabrera says. U.S. law prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico. Instead, the children are turned over to Department Health and Human Services supervision ""within 72 hours of DHS taking them into custody,"" an official said. ""Most of the time, they're getting released to relatives in the U.S.,"" Cabrera said. ""There's nowhere to put them, so they're released on their own recognizance and have a pending court date. I'd say between 95 and 97% of adults or youths don't show up for court."" The numbers are staggering. He estimates that more than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles will cross in 2014 and that the numbers will rise from there. ""You're talking kids from 17 years old, on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old, traveling by themselves,"" Cabrera says. More on CNN iReport: Your immigration stories . Last year, roughly 10% of people caught by Border Patrol agents were minors, according to a Border Patrol official. Texas has been so overwhelmed that federal officials are transporting busloads of immigrants, including minors, to Arizona. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer slammed the move. ""Not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy, it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here,"" she said in a statement. Official: Obama administration will enforce its priorities, not Arizona's . As of late last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was no longer releasing ""large family groups"" at bus stops in Arizona, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman said, but children under age 17 are continuing to be transferred to the state. ""The situation with the kids are they came by themselves, they have no relatives here, and the consulates can't keep up. They're in limbo. There's no one (back home) to deport them to,"" a DHS spokesman told CNN. Obama: 'Urgent humanitarian situation' President Barack Obama declared the crossings ""an urgent humanitarian situation requiring a unified and coordinated federal response."" Earlier this month, in a memo to the heads of executive departments and agencies, he announced an ""interagency Unified Coordination Group to ensure unity of effort across the executive branch in responding to the humanitarian aspects of this situation."" The group will oversee coordination with state, local and other agencies. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is establishing the group. In a statement, he said that ""addressing the rising flow of unaccompanied children crossing our southwest border is an important priority of this administration and the Department of Homeland Security."" Border facilities don't have enough food, beds or sanitary facilities to provide for the children. Johnson vowed that DHS and other agencies will coordinate to ensure a ""rapid government-wide response in the short-term and to undertake broader, longer-term reforms to address the root cause behind these recent migration trends."" Senior administration officials said they had prepared for a greater influx of children across the Southwest border, but the numbers were much larger than anticipated in past weeks. Administration officials would not offer specifics on the number of children in custody, most of whom are being processed for possible repatriation to their home countries. Why now? Numerous factors have come together to create this unprecedented surge. Many children are looking to escape violence and worsening economic conditions in their Central American countries. Some want to reunite with their parents who left them behind with relatives and plan to return for them when they can. Better weather is also cited as a factor leading some immigrants to decide to make the trek now. Cabrera says these crossings began to spike two years ago after the Obama administration announced it would stop deporting young illegal immigrants who entered the United States as children if they met certain requirements. Political battle . Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, calls the situation ""an administration-made disaster."" ""Word has gotten out around the world about President Obama's lax immigration enforcement policies and it has encouraged more individuals to come to the United States illegally,"" he said in a statement. Columnist Linda Valdez, who writes about the issue for CNN affiliate azcentral.com, blames both sides. Goodlatte is ""a card-carrying member of the Republican majority that has blocked immigration reform,"" she says. And ""Obama isn't off the hook. He's been quietly managing disaster instead of yelling 'fire' in this burning building."" The children flocking across the border in search of the American dream ""shouldn't come,"" she says. But they ""wouldn't come if their undocumented parents didn't find it so easy to work in a country that loves cheap labor -- but treats cheap laborers like a disposable commodity.""

"Earlier this month, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, rolled out to much fanfare a new ""branding effort"" for the Republican Party, focused on broadening its appeal and helping the middle class. It seemed hopeful at the time. Sadly, today it is laughable. We are days away from severe forced spending cuts that will do nothing but hurt the very people the GOP is trying to win over.  Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana recently declared that Republicans had to stop being ""the stupid party"" if they were ever going to put together the long-term winning coalition they needs to reach the White House in 2016. Sorry, governor: your party didn't listen. If the forced cuts, known as the sequester, go through, 14,000 teachers could get laid off -- affecting thousands of middle-class families, including many African-American and Latino families. Construction jobs, manufacturing jobs, first-responder jobs -- all well-paying middle-class jobs, will get cut. Castellanos: On cuts, Washington throws a tantrum . Domestic violence programs will be slashed as $20 million gets cut from the Violence Against Women Act. Public safety in many ways will suffer.  Food inspectors will get laid off. Up to 5,000 Border Patrol agents will be called from the border -- the mother of ironies for the Republicans who complain that the administration isn't doing enough on border security. This is not what was supposed to happen.  Sequestration was designed to be a bipartisan stink bomb so noxious to both parties that neither would allow it to happen. It was a release valve that allowed the parties to reach a deal on the debt limit in the summer of 2011 to avoid sending the nation into default, with the understanding that a broader agreement on the debt and deficit would be reached. If it wasn't, off went the bomb. What happened between then and now? President Barack Obama won reelection by voters who support his idea of dealing with the debt and deficit -- by asking everyone to put some skin in the game. He was seen as the protector of the middle class, and importantly, as the one who understood that government is not the enemy. That in fact, a lean, efficient, smart government, can help level the playing field and help all Americans and businesses get ahead. Opinion: Cuts too deep? No, not deep enough . This argument was overwhelmingly supported by Latinos, African-Americans, women and young people and helped propel the president to a second term. Then came the fiscal-cliff debacle, where again, majorities of Americans sided with the president on how to fix it. Republicans acquiesced, and it seemed they knew they had to change their tune. In his GOP rebranding speech, Cantor said: ""We will advance proposals aimed at producing results in areas like education, health care, innovation and job growth."" That sounded smart enough. But in this current showdown du jour, Republicans have proven they are unserious. The party cannot see beyond its insistence on protecting the rich from paying even a single penny more, while welcoming draconian cuts to programs that hurt the middle class and the most vulnerable, especially in the areas of education, health care, innovation and job growth. Zelizer: If spending is cut, GOP will get the blame . Instead of trying to find a way to avoid these steep cuts, and to keep faith with their newfound concern for the middle class, Republicans are doubling down on the ""my way or the highway"" mentality that put them in an electoral hole to begin with. The party's deficit among these key voting groups will only get bigger if the GOP allows the spending cuts to go through. The risk to their standing among the American people is quite real. They are making a choice to protect loopholes for millionaires and their corporate jets while kicking 70,000 kids off critical Head Start programs -- and many of these kids come from low-income African American and Latino families. Thousands of middle-class American jobs are on the chopping block because the Republican Party did not learn the lesson of the election. While there is political risk for everyone, including Obama, if these cuts happen, he enjoys something the GOP does not: the trust of the American people. Recent polling suggests up to half of Americans would blame Republicans. Less than a third would blame President Obama. Polls also show that an overwhelming 76% of voters, and 56% of Republicans, agree with the president  that the solution to our fiscal woes should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Obama's  approval rating is at 55%, a three-year high. He is at 73% of support with Latinos, up 2 points from his 71% election victory -- not a promising trend for Republicans. When you are in a hole, the best advice is to stop digging. The GOP seems to prefer to grab a bigger shovel.","Maria Cardona: Looming cuts make Cantor's strategy to draw middle class to GOP laughable .
She says forced budget cuts will hurt thousands of the very people GOP wants to attract .

"(CNN) -- Robert Allenby overcame an ankle problem to claim a share of the lead after the first round of the Sony Open in Hawaii. The Australian suffered the injury after falling of a curb in Honolulu earlier this week, but still managed to fire a five-under-par 65 in his first PGA Tour appearance of 2010. He was joined at the top of the leaderboard by five other players despite windy conditions at the Waialae Country Club on Thursday. His score was matched by former Masters champion Zach Johnson, Davis Love III, John Merrick, Ryan Palmer and PGA Tour Qualifying School winner Troy Merritt. They were one shot ahead of a group of 10 players including current Masters champion Angel Cabrera of Argentina, world No. 3 Steve Stricker, Sweden's Carl Pettersson and former U.S. Ryder Cup captain Tom Lehman. ""I twisted my ankle on Monday and didn't know whether I was going to play, tried it out yesterday and sort of scraped it around the golf course,"" Allenby told reporters. ""I kind of did the same things today really. It's all a bit abbreviated, the old swing, but the short game's good and that's what counts. You need that when you're not 100 percent."" British Open champion Stewart Cink was further back in another big group of 11 tied on two-under along with South Africa's Rory Sabbatini and Japan's Ryuichi Oda. Former world No. 1s Ernie Els and Vijay Singh were among those another stroke back alongside two-time major winner Retief Goosen. Meanwhile, David Lynn is set to take a one-stroke lead into the third round of the European Tour's Joburg Open in South Africa after Friday's action was halted by bad weather with 30 players still out on the course. The Englishman, who has won only once in more than 300 starts, followed up his opening 63 with a four-under-par 67 at Royal Johannesburg and Kensington East. He was five shots clear of compatriot John Parry and South Africa's Andrew Curlewis, who were the highest placed of those yet to complete their rounds, each with three holes to go. Home favorite Charl Schwartzel, also one of four players to score 63 in the first round, was second on 11-under after a 68. Irishman Darren Clarke, seeking to regain his place in Europe's Ryder Cup team this year, was tied for third on 10-under after a 69.","Robert Allenby overcomes ankle injury to claim share of lead after first round of Sony Open .

"In the latest move in China's anti-corruption campaign, more than 1,000 people in Guangdong Province have been marked as ""naked officials"" -- those suspected of storing graft gains with overseas family members. According to Chinese state media, Xinhua news agency, an unnamed official source says 866 of the implicated officials have been removed from their posts, including nine at a mayoral level. Another 200 have asked their families to return to China, in exchange for keeping their posts. Many officials have family overseas, including President Xi Jinping, whose daughter is currently enrolled at Harvard University. ""Naked officials"" refers to civil servants who have sent their families overseas allegedly with their ill-gotten assets. Moving money and family abroad is often seen as a precursor to officials' own flight. A report by the Ministry of Commerce cited in the English-language China Daily showed 4,000 corrupt officials had fled the country with at least $50 billion between 1978 and 2003. The names of the implicated Guangdong officials were not released, but Xinhua reported that 127 of the demoted officials are from Dongguan, a manufacturing hub dubbed ""sin city"" for its thriving prostitution trade. The southern Chinese city was also the target of a government vice crackdown in February. Another 128 officials were demoted in the city of Jiangmen. One of the first to lose their position from the crackdown is Fang Xuan, the deputy chief of the Guangzhou Party Committee. This month, Fang applied for retirement five months earlier than planned after being ""found as a naked official,"" Xinhua also reported. China's netizens have largely been skeptical of the top-down anti-graft move. Many commented that the latest crackdown is inadequate for stamping out corruption. ""The anti-corruption drive is basically using guerrilla warfare tactics, shooting in one place then moving on to another. It agitates the chickens and the dogs, but the tigers just relocate their dens,"" wrote Weibo user ""Qin Qianhong."" Since last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping has vowed to clean up the tarnished image of the Communist Party, pushing anti-graft campaigns and pledging to target ""mosquitoes"" -- minor officials -- as well as ""tigers"" -- top officials. Critics say the war on corruption is just Xi's excuse for removing political opponents. Earlier this year, a report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists found that relatives of current and former top Chinese leadership are shareholders in offshore companies, allegedly storing away billions of illicit graft gains. The report included details of assets of two of former Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's children.","""Naked officials"" are suspected of storing illicit graft cash with families overseas .

"Ex-NFL star Aaron Hernandez fired the shots that killed Odin Lloyd, a man who'd been with him told a mutual friend, according to a court document. A Florida police spokeswoman cited the court document  Tuesday. The conversations allegedly involved two people who were with Hernandez when he picked up Lloyd from his Boston apartment early on June 17, hours before a jogger found Lloyd's body in a North Attleborough, Massachusetts, industrial park. All three men are now in custody. Prosecutors accuse Hernandez, a standout tight end whom the New England Patriots cut soon after his June 26 arrest, of orchestrating Lloyd's death. The 23-year-old is now in a Massachusetts jail; he has pleaded not guilty to murder charges. The information in a document filed in Florida -- as detailed by Miramar, Florida, police spokeswoman Tania Rues -- may help authorities as they build their case against Hernandez as the triggerman. Nearly 1,500 miles from the crime scene, Miramar is where Ernest Wallace turned himself into authorities on June 28 after seeing news reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for him. He was charged the next day with being an accessory after the fact of murder. Bail hearing for Hernandez associate moved to August . The other man arrested in the case -- Carlos Ortiz, who hails from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut -- told authorities that Wallace told him Hernandez fired the shots that killed Lloyd, the document cited by the Miramar police spokeswoman says. The document was part of a search warrant executed at a Wallace family home. This detail comes out the same day that, following a judge's orders, Massachusetts authorities released a number of documents pertaining to the 27-year-old Lloyd's death. Among other details, these documents explain authorities' account of an interaction with Hernandez at his southeast Massachusetts home after Lloyd's death but before the football player's arrest. Hernandez at one point told police that he didn't remember specifically when he last saw Lloyd. Later in the conversation, he ""became argumentative"" with two police officers questioning him, then went in his home and got a business card for his lawyer to give to them. ""We informed Mr. Hernandez that this was a death investigation,"" the document states. ""Mr. Hernandez slammed the door and relocked it behind him. ""Mr. Hernandez did not ask the officers whose death was being investigated. Mr. Hernandez's demeanor did not indicate any concern for the death of any person."" By contrast, when police first told Hernandez's fiancee about the death of Lloyd, who her sister was dating, ""she immediately began to cry."" Judge orders Hernandez case evidence documents to be released . According to the same court document, the same woman told authorities that she and Hernandez went out to dinner for Father's Day, then she went to bed while her fiance was out all night. Police say that, at one point, Hernandez called the woman and told her ""his sports agent said she should not speak with us and that she should request to speak with her attorney,"" a document states. Documents also reveal details, some of them previously disclosed, of Lloyd's texts on the day he was killed. One of them, sent at 12:22 a.m. on June 17 to Hernandez's cell phone, reads: ""We still on."" About three hours later, a man who works at NeedleTech -- a medical device manufacturer with a facility in North Attleborough, near where Lloyd's body was found -- told police he was taking a break in his car when he heard ""three gunshots and (a) car door slamming."" A different affidavit for a search warrant features three black-and-white photos from a home surveillance camera that show Hernandez and two other men. The three men leave the garage of the North Attleborough home around 1 a.m., the document states. The video shows them returning to the same residence around 3:26 a.m., including Hernandez going to-and-from the basement on ""several different occasions.""","Document: Hernandez's fiance ""began to cry"" after hearing of Lloyd's death .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- With 10 American Baptist missionaries in Haiti now charged with kidnapping for attempting to take 33 children out of the country, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday the case is for Haitian courts to decide. ""Obviously this is a matter for the Haitian judicial system,"" Clinton told reporters at the State Department. ""We're going to continue to provide support as we do in every instance like this to American citizens who have been charged and hope that this matter can be resolved in an expeditious way, but it is something that a sovereign nation is pursuing based on the evidence that it presented when the charges were announced."" Clinton said the U.S. Embassy in Haiti is providing consular services and the American ambassador is speaking with his counterparts in the Haitian government. ""We have full access"" to the Americans, she said. A judge has not ruled on the missionaries' petition for bail, said their attorney, Edwin Coq. However, under Haitian law, anyone accused of kidnapping a child is not eligible for bail, the attorney general's office said earlier. The 10 missionaries, including group leader Laura Silsby, were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association. Haitian authorities split up the group, which was being held in a city jail, on Friday, Coq said. Coq said the five men have been sent to the national penitentiary, which was damaged in the massive January 12 earthquake that leveled much of Port-au-Prince. The five women have been sent to a prison in nearby Petionville. Court hearings will be held Monday and Tuesday for his clients, Coq said. Conviction on the kidnapping charge would carry a maximum penalty of life in prison; the criminal association charge would carry a penalty of three to nine years, according to a former justice minister. The Americans were turned back a week ago as they tried to take the children across the border into the Dominican Republic without proper documentation. They said they were going to house them in a converted hotel in that country and later move them to an orphanage they were building there. The Americans have said they were just trying to help the children leave the earthquake-stricken country. Some of the detained Americans have said they thought they were helping orphans, but their interpreters told CNN this week that they were present when group members spoke with some of the children's parents. Some parents in a village outside Port-au-Prince said they had willingly given their children over to the Americans, who promised them a better life, and who said the parents could see their children whenever they wanted to. Coq said he felt Silsby, who was leading the missionary group, was responsible for the situation. ""Let me tell you my personal impression,"" Coq said Friday, ""the nine other people are victims. They knew absolutely nothing about these stories. They were extremely touched by the disaster which struck Haiti. They only came here to show their solidarity and compassion. ""They did not know this story that Laura wanted to leave with children."" The Dominican consul general has said he warned Silsby about trying to cross the border without proper documents. Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" Thursday that the judge in the case has three months to decide whether to prosecute. ""We hope that he will decide long before those three months,"" he said. ""He can release them, he can ask to prosecute them."" If a decision is made to prosecute, the case would be heard before a jury, he said. Bellerive told CNN the Haitian government was open to the possibility of the case being transferred to a U.S. court, but said the request would have to come from the United States. ""Until now, I was not asked,"" he said. In Washington, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley confirmed that ""we have not had any discussions with Haitian officials about shifting prosecution to the United States."" ""This is a Haitian legal process. Obviously the 10 American citizens have been charged under Haitian law,"" he said. ""It would appear, based on the reporting that we've seen, that they ... were attempting to move those children out of Haiti without the authorization of the Haitian government. We recognize that that is a potential violation of Haitian law. The judge in this case has interviewed the Americans, he has evaluated the evidence that has been presented to him."" U.S. officials are talking with Haitian officials about how the cases will unfold, and the United States will continue to monitor the situation closely, Crowley said. Former President Bill Clinton, the U.N. envoy to Haiti, said Haitian leaders don't want the issue to become a distraction to the recovery effort. ""I think what's important now is for the government of Haiti and the government of the United States to get together and work through this because the government of Haiti understands that they're not looking for some big fight here,"" Clinton said Friday. ""They just want to protect their children."" He added, ""I think they will find a way to defuse the crisis and work through this."" Government approval is needed for any Haitian child to leave the country, and the group acknowledged that the children had no passports. Some members of the group belong to the Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho, where the pastor asked for privacy and would not discuss the matter. ""I know you have many questions but we don't have answers right now,"" said Assistant Pastor Drew Ham in a note to reporters. CNN's Jill Dougherty in Washington and Lonzo Cook in Port-au-Prince contributed to this report.","NEW: Attorney says he believes group's leader is responsible for the situation .

"The pilot of a jet that crashed near a U.S. Navy range in Nevada was killed, the Navy said in a press release Sunday. The pilot's name is being withheld until family has been notified. The crash of the U.S. Marine Corps F/A-18C happened about noon ET Saturday at Naval Air Station Fallon, about 60 miles east of Reno. The aircraft appears to be a ""total loss,"" the Navy said. It took several hours for Navy personnel to reach the crash site because it was in remote, mountainous terrain, and an overnight snowstorm made getting to the scene more difficult. The Navy had initially said the aircraft was a Navy Hornet, but it was actually a Marine Corps F/A-18C on loan to the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center for use as a training aircraft, the Navy said. The aircraft was not carrying any weapons or other munitions on the training flight, the Navy said, and no other injuries or property damage have been reported. The cause of the crash is being investigated. Naval Air Station Fallon is a popular training site because of its weather, which provides ""more than 300 clear flying days per year"" and its facilities, which include four bombing ranges, an electronic warfare range and a 14,000-foot runway, the longest in the Navy, the base's website says.

"In further proof that seemingly nothing can bring Silvio Berlusconi down -- not even a potential jail sentence -- Italy's most colorful public figure is back in contention to lead his country for a fourth time. Another spell in Italy's highest office would be just the latest chapter in the life of the charming, billionaire three-time former prime minister. In October Berlusconi was sentenced to four years in prison for tax evasion, but has since appealed the verdict. Until recently, Berlusconi appeared to be leading a charmed life. His vast business empire spanned media, construction and football, making him the 118th-richest person in the world, according to Forbes, with a net worth of $6.2 billion, and he was Italy's longest-serving post-war prime minister before quitting in 2011. But last year he became embroiled in charges that he had paid for sex with a 17-year-old girl; his coalition government became ever more fragile; and Berlusconi resigned his premiership as Europe's financial crisis threatened to embroil Italy. Despite the many scandals that have dogged Berlusconi since he entered politics nearly two decades ago, the 76-year-old is indisputably one of life's survivors. In Parliament, opponents tabled 51 confidence votes in him in the past three years alone, but Italians have thrice elected him as prime minister. In this election Berlusconi is appealing to tax-burdened Italians' desire for some relief. He has promised not only to abolish the hugely unpopular property tax on primary residences, known as the IMU, he is also promising to pay back the property taxes people have already paid. Berlusconi is also vowing to cut corporate taxes and income taxes and spend the economy out of the recession. However his promises have met with considerable skepticism. Prominent journalist Gad Lerner has long been critical of the former prime minister. ""Berlusconi has transformed Italian politics into a big show and he is always looking for a spectacular center for his propaganda."" Businessman Gianvencenzo Coppi traveled to Rome to hear center-left rival, Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani, talk about his commitment to the private sector, but he told CNN he hadn't made up his mind whom he would vote for, but it was unlikely to be Berlusconi. ""He's making promises in my opinion he cannot maintain,"" said Coppi. ""He's promising to cut taxes, the IMU ... and no one knows in which way he can do it."" Cruise ship crooner . Born in Milan in 1936, Berlusconi gave notice early on of his showman side by working as a lounge room crooner aboard a cruise ship to help fund his university tuition -- he studied law. Various low-level commercial enterprises followed before the fledgling entrepreneur enjoyed his first real success in property development in the late 1960s when he was involved in a project to build Milano Two -- nearly 4,000 flats -- outside Milan. After amassing a fortune from his property portfolio in the 1970s, he diversified his interests by setting up a TV cable company, Telemilano, and buying two other cable channels in an effort to break the national TV monopoly in Italy. In 1978, these channels were incorporated into his newly formed Fininvest group, which included department stores, insurance companies and even AC Milan -- one of the world's biggest football clubs. Berlusconi turned his attention to politics in 1993 when he formed the center-right Forza Italia Party and the following year, in a snap election, he won the post of prime minister. However, a dispute with his right-wing coalition partners from the Northern League Party, as well as an indictment for alleged tax fraud, ended Berlusconi's tenure in the job after barely seven months. He was acquitted on appeal in 2000 after the statute of limitations had expired. After defeat in the 1996 election to his political nemesis, Romano Prodi, he became embroiled in other financial scandals, including a charge of bribing tax inspectors. He denied any wrongdoing and was cleared again on appeal in 2000. His fortunes turned again in 2001 when he was sworn in as prime minister for a second time. But Prodi -- a former European Commission president -- ended Berlusconi's more successful reign with his center-left Union coalition victory in 2006. At that time, the tycoon had presided over the longest-serving post-war Italian government. Return to power . Despite having a pacemaker implanted to regulate his heartbeat after he collapsed during a political rally, he refused to slow down. Sporting a hair transplant, cosmetic surgery and a tan, Berlusconi returned to power for a third time in 2008 under the banner of the newly created People of Freedom party. The next year proved to be one of extremes for the veteran politician. He was praised for his handling of the devastating earthquake that struck the Italian town of L'Aquila in April 2009, and survived criticism after urging survivors to see their plight like ""a weekend of camping."" But the following month, Berlusconi's second wife, Veronica Lario, filed for divorce -- alleging Berlusconi had an inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old aspiring model whose birthday party he had attended. Berlusconi said she was the daughter of a friend and that he had done nothing wrong. In December that year, a man with a history of mental illness hit Berlusconi in the face with a replica of Milan's cathedral at a campaign rally, breaking several of his teeth and fracturing his nose. Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that the irrepressible Berlusconi continued to shake hands with supporters for ""a couple of minutes"" after being hit. With the country's economy reeling amid the financial crisis, pressure on Berlusconi grew. Gianfranco Fini -- a former party ally -- lashed out, accusing him of a lack of attention to the economy and structural reforms that Italy needs. The prime minister survived three votes of confidence in Parliament during 2010 and 2011, winning one by just three votes, but his authority continued to ebb. Economists said Berlusconi commanded neither sufficient political authority to push through spending cuts nor the moral high ground to squeeze more taxes out of Italians while he faced trial on various charges. Other European leaders criticized him for failing to implement economic reform with sufficient urgency. Bunga bunga charges . Meanwhile, Berlusconi faced a serious personal challenge with charges of sex with an underage nightclub dancer and abuse of power. Q&A: Silvio Berlusconi's legal woes . Berlusconi had sex 13 times with underage dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed ""Ruby the heart-stealer,"" say prosecutors who allege the prime minister abused his position when he intervened in May 2010 to get her released from the jail where she was being held on charges of theft. El Mahroug has said she never had sex with Berlusconi and that she lied to him about her age, telling him she was 24. In September 2011, prosecutors submitted transcripts of approximately 100,000 pages of wiretaps -- from 2008 and 2009 -- to a court in Bari. The prosecutors have accused eight people of paying young women to attend so-called ""bunga bunga"" parties at Berlusconi's home. Berlusconi denied the charges and accused prosecutors of conspiring against him in a left-wing plot. ""Communism never changes in Italy. There are still people who use the penal code as a weapon in their ideological battles,"" he said earlier this year. But, according to the transcripts of the calls, Berlusconi made several controversial remarks, vowing at one point to leave Italy, which he described as a ""s****y country"" that ""sickened"" him. When confronted with these remarks, Berlusconi laughed off this and other gaffes.","Three-time former PM Berlusconi standing for fourth term .

"The death and damage wrought by new tornadoes that plowed through Oklahoma won't be completely known until the sun comes up Saturday morning. A handful of fresh storms killed at least five people Friday, authorities said, less than two weeks after a monstrous cyclone waylaid the town of Moore, a suburb of Oklahoma City. At least 71 others were injured statewide. Two of the victims in Oklahoma died within twenty miles of Moore, said medical examiner spokeswoman Amy Elliot. Though the tornadoes were not as strong as the EF-5 twister that killed 24 on May 20, fear drove some people into their cars to flee them, some of whom got caught in heavy rains and flash flooding. A mother and her child were killed, when an apparent tornado sucked them out of their vehicle. Though the state's transportation authorities strongly advised citizens not to drive, some interstate highways in Oklahoma were jammed with stalled traffic, as heavy rains drenched roadways and flooded low-lying areas.  Officials described parts of Interstates 35 and 40 near Oklahoma City as ""a parking lot."" City flooded . The first floor of the capital's city hall was covered in an inch of flood water, after heavy rains poured down across Oklahoma City, said city spokeswoman Kristy Yager. ""We've seen widespread flooding throughout the entire 621 square miles,"" she said. Flooding stranded five city buses, but no passengers were on board, she said, and numerous accidents were reported.  Some motorists were stranded after driving into flooded streets. ""We saw flooding in areas that we don't see flooding. We were overwhelmed,"" said police Lt. Jay Barnett. Rising waters also hit apartments in low areas of town, Yager said.  Oklahoman's are growing weary of the dangerous storms. ""We really needed a break after last (week), and there's just no rest,"" she said. Widespread trouble . More than 210,000 customers have lost electricity in the areas affected by the storm, according to a CNN tally. The severe weather has knocked out power to nearly 120,000 customers in Oklahoma, according to electricity provider OG&E. Missouri governor Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency, as the storm front moved into his state. Heavy rains in the past days have left the area vulnerable to flooding, he said.  An apparent tornado damaged homes near St. Louis. The storm system has shifted to the East towards Illinois and Indiana, triggering tornado warnings and watches in its path. A roof flew off a school gymnasium in Macoupin County, Illinois, according to an emergency management spokesman.  ""About 25 to 30 homes were damaged,"" said Jim Pitchford. Moore traumatized . Sirens howled over the ruins of Moore, Oklahoma, Friday pushing storm-weary residents who stayed behind to rescue their homes from the previous weather disaster to take cover. Mayor Glenn Lewis sat in a storm shelter, as he spoke with CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""This is unbelievable that it could possibly even hit again,"" he said. ""We just started picking up (debris) two days ago."" He fears the new storms scattered it all around again.","Storms move east, causing damage in Missouri and Illinois .

"Amanda Knox describes her strange actions after her roommate's murder as the behavior of a ""tone-deaf girl in a trauma"" during a wide-ranging and at times tearful interview that aired Tuesday. Knox, whose memoir, ""Waiting to be Heard,"" has been equally panned and applauded, said she also hopes to earn Meredith Kercher's parents' forgiveness and, one day, permission to visit her study-abroad roommate's gravesite. ""My need for justice for myself is not in contradiction with theirs,"" she said during the ABC interview. ""[I hope] that eventually I can have their permission to pay respects."" Knox and boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted in the 2007 rape and slashing death of 21-year-old Kercher at Knox and Kercher's apartment in Perugia, Italy. A jury overturned the conviction in 2011, and Knox flew home to Seattle. An Italian appeals court overturned Knox's acquittal earlier this year, but experts disagree over whether the U.S. State Department will extradite her to be retried. Kercher's parents have repeatedly said they simply want the truth surrounding their daughter's death. They said after Knox's exoneration that they were not yet ready to reach out to the now-25-year-old, who says she'd like to be re-evaluated as someone other than ""Foxy Knoxy."" Knox opens her memoir with her reaction to the Italian court's verdict and sentencing during the 2009 trial. Opinion: What Amanda Knox can and can't tell us . ""Over all the noise and confusion, I could hear my sister and mother sobbing. My legs couldn't support me. The guards held me up by my armpits and carried me, crumpled, out of the courtroom. In the chaos of my shattered world, I never heard the judge sentence me: 'Twenty-six years.' Done. It was done,"" she wrote. During Tuesday's interview with Diane Sawyer, Knox provided details of her reaction after the murder, a response that would be key to the prosecution painting her as a sex-mad killer with no emotions. Knox explains how she was drawn to Sollecito because he reminded her of Harry Potter and how they stayed in smoking marijuana, having sex and watching ""Amelie"" the night Kercher was killed. ""We smoked. We had sex. We were together. We just hung out together. We made faces at each other. We were being silly and together,"" Knox recalled. ""I had smoked a joint with Raffaele, and what that did to my memories was it made them less concrete, but it didn't black them out and it didn't change them."" When she got up the next morning, she went home to bathe because Sollecito had a ""crummy shower."" When she got home, she ignored the open front door because the latch was sometimes broken. The ""speckles of blood"" in the sink? She just figured they were something Kercher had failed to clean up, or perhaps it was from her own newly pierced ears, she said. ""I had never before experienced anything in my life that was drastic. I didn't think, 'Oh my God, someone's been in here and murdered someone,' "" she said. After Kercher's murder, Knox was filmed smooching on Sollecito outside the murder scene. At the police station, Knox reportedly sat on Sollecito's lap, making faces. She told Kercher's friends she must have suffered. ""How could she not? She got her f***ing throat slit,"" she reportedly said. Analysis: Case was complicated, confusing mess . Knox told Sawyer that, at the time, she was thinking that under different circumstances it could have been her dead in the house. She felt lost, alone, vulnerable, she said. ""I wish I would've been more mature about it. ... I think everyone's reaction to something horrible is different,"" she said. ""My friend had been murdered, and it could have just as easily been me. Somehow she died in the house where we were living, and it could've been me."" Reminded of some of the monikers applied to her by the ever-colorful Italian tabloids -- ""she-devil with an angel face,"" ""heartless manipulator,"" ""sphinx of Perugia"" -- she teared up. ""I haven't heard those. I mean, I've heard the gist of them, and they're wrong."" She further said she doesn't know anything about the case that she hasn't shared with police or written in her memoir. ""I wasn't there,"" Knox told Sawyer, referring to the night of Kercher's murder. Knox's book, for which she was reportedly given a $3.8 million advance, has drawn quite opposite reactions from readers. Reviews have ranged from complimentary, noting that the tales of police corruption and lesbian prison guards harassing her will make it a big seller, to indifference. On Amazon, its dozens of reviewers were diametrically split, with only two reviewers as of Wednesday afternoon giving the book a rating other than one or five stars. Barbie Latza Nadeau, Rome bureau chief for Newsweek and author of ""Angel Face: Sex, Murder, and the Inside Story of Amanda Knox,"" told CNN that Knox's book demonstrates she has a ""selective memory."" ""She really glossed over the night of the murder,"" Nadeau said, explaining she read the book hoping to hear why Knox's and Sollecito's alibis were so incongruous and fluid. Knox told Sawyer she's much different from the girl who in 2009, as she explains in her memoir, ""walked into the ancient Perugian courtroom, where centuries of verdicts had been handed down, praying that a tradition of justice would protect me now."" ""I'm not quite as chirpy anymore,"" she said. After viewing a video her sister made before she left for Perugia, in which a fresh-faced Knox says with a playful grin how attractive she finds guys, Sawyer asked what she would tell the youngster on the tape. ""I want to tell her not to be afraid of what's going to happen because what happened to me hit me like a train, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.""","Amanda Knox tells ABC that she wants to one day visit the gravesite of Meredith Kercher .

"Hundreds of voters voted Tuesday in Sanaa's old town section to replace Yemen's longtime ruler, Ali Abdullah Saleh, in an election marred by sporadic violence. While the election was short on candidates -- the only person on the ballot was Vice President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi, who became acting president in November as the result of a power transfer brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council after months of protests -- it appeared to be long on hope. ""It's the first time people in Yemen are electing somebody on their own, without being influenced by political parties,"" said Mohammed al-Rowdy, a voter who works with the Interior Ministry. ""This is a people's election. That's why we are optimistic things will get better."" In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton congratulated the people of Yemen ""on today's successful presidential election,"" calling it ""another important step forward in their democratic transition process."" But she said that more work remains. ""As part of the GCC Initiative, Yemenis will convene a National Dialogue Conference to address critical issues of national unity and the fundamental structure of Yemeni government and society, while taking steps to address urgent economic, social, and humanitarian challenges,"" she said. ""The United States, along with its partners in the international community, will continue to support Yemen as it works to implement these reforms and confront these challenges so that all Yemenis will have the opportunity to realize their potential."" Officials in Sanaa described a successful effort Tuesday, but conditions in the southern port city of Aden were different.  Four people were killed in clashes between gunmen and security forces, two senior security officials in the city said. Another 14 people were injured and were treated at a hospital, security officials said. In the port city of Mukalla, southwest of Sanaa on the Gulf of Aden, a soldier was killed Tuesday and four were wounded when polling centers were stormed, Yemen's official news network SABA reported, citing an official source. ""Gunmen have ambushed the soldiers, as they were removing stones from a street in Ghuaizi area in Mukalla,"" the agency reported. ""Outlaws"" were blamed for breaking into polling centers in two districts of Hadramout, the source said. And a sniper killed a member of the security forces at a polling station, said members of the Supreme Commission for Elections and Referendum. But there were no signs of such problems in Sanaa's At Altabari school -- one of the oldest in the capital. Voters left with ink on their fingers and thumbs, proof of their participation in a historic election that signifies the formal end of Saleh's 33-year reign. ""I was particularly very impressed in seeing the women turning out,"" said Michele Cervone d'Urso, European Union ambassador to Yemen, who was observing the polling station. ""The women are the key for this county, for sedating this country,"" he said in reference to the need to calm conditions there. ""They have to be recognized as a key part of society."" Security around Sanaa and elsewhere was tight Tuesday. Around the capital, posters of Hadi have replaced posters of Saleh. ""A New President for a New Yemen,"" read a banner hanging from Change Square, which was the epicenter of the anti-government  movement last year. Some who took part in the protests said they were not  particularly excited about Tuesday's vote. ""Maybe you can call them elections,"" Nadia Abdullah said. ""But for me, elections should have more than one candidate."" Still, Abdullah said she would stand by Hadi as long as he made good on his promises. ""If he goes through with it, we will stand hand in hand with him,"" she said. ""If he doesn't, or if we see a lot of game-playing between him and the government, I believe the youth will remain in the squares. They would say, 'Leave,' as they did to Ali Abdullah Saleh."" Abullah al-Saidi, 27, an accountant volunteering as an election observer, told CNN he voted against Hadi by putting an ""X"" next to the name instead of a check. He said he believes many people do not realize they have the option of voting against the vice president. ""He is old school -- I don't believe he will change a lot,"" al-Saidi said of Hadi. D'Urso said the elections are not ""simply for vice president Hadi. These are the elections for process, a different Yemen. And you can see Yemenis want to move to a different type of society, one of co-existence and tolerance. It's not going to be easy. I think transition in this country will probably take a generation, but I think we are moving forward, and we have kicked off in the right way today, at least here in Sanaa."" Human Rights Watch called on Hadi to make changes without delay. ""Yemen's potentially historic transition will be off to shaky start unless Hadi makes an immediate break with the abuses of the past,"" said Letta Tayler, HRW's Yemen researcher. ""Yemen's new leader needs to move decisively to usher in promised reforms that uphold human rights and the rule of law."" The 65-year-old Hadi is a British-, Egyptian- and Soviet-trained army officer, recently promoted to field marshal. He has been vice president since 1994 and is running for a two-year term as president on pledges of improving security and creating jobs. But he's never had much of a power base, and Yemen's problems are expected to take longer to fix than the two-year mandate he's expected to receive. Yemen is the poorest country in the Middle East, with a severe shortage of water and rising levels of malnutrition among its population of about 25 million. Even before last year's upheaval, Saleh faced a separatist movement in the south, sectarian tensions in its north and the growing presence of what Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. For some, particularly in the once-independent south, Hadi is too closely tied to Saleh's rule to represent any change. ""Why do people expect southerners to celebrate that Saleh is gone?"" asked Mohammed Mosed Okla, a separatist leader in Aden. ""His regime is still in control, and his family still controls all the major security factions in the country. We will not be tricked again, and southerners will not celebrate until complete change takes place in south Yemen."" Hussein al-Aqil, a professor at Aden University and another separatist leader, said Hadi simply watched as Saleh ""oppressed us for more than two decades."" ""I was imprisoned for three years because I expressed my opinion and rejected the corruption that Ali Saleh stood behind,"" al-Aqil said. ""The old regime tortured me and made me suffer for years. Hadi is part of the old regime and will not be recognized as a southern leader."" Ahead of the vote, officials had set up at least 10 checkpoints in Aden. But late Monday, hours before polls opened, explosions rocked four neighborhoods. Security officials said no one was hurt. Saleh handed power to Hadi as part of a deal brokered by Persian Gulf states and will formally relinquish his office after the vote. Saleh is in the United States for medical treatment for wounds suffered in a June assassination attempt at his presidential palace during battles between government troops and tribal fighters. The United States has been backing Yemeni efforts against al Qaeda and has periodically struck targets inside Yemen, as occurred in September, when a drone strike killed American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. Gerald Feierstein, U.S. ambassador to Yemen, said the transition laid out in the Gulf plan as well as efforts to boost the economy and deliver basic services will be critical ""in terms of our ability to defeat al Qaeda and other violent extremist organizations in the country.""","Violence reported in several areas .

"Pedro Valdez, a Vietnam veteran, wanted help. And he knew where to get it -- through the Phoenix VA -- or so he thought. Again and again, starting in December 2012, Valdez would try to schedule with -- and would even show up to see -- doctors at Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities in Arizona about his shortness of breath, according to his daughter. He thought he had gotten confirmed appointments; even toting cards with a specific date and time. ""He'd have the card in hand, go to check in, and they'd tell him, 'Mr. Valdez, you don't have an appointment in the computer. We have no idea what you're talking about,"" his daughter Priscella Valdez told CNN. In October 2013, Pedro Valdez showed up at his daughter's house after going in for another appointment that never happened. His daughter set out then to make sure Valdez had a firm time in the VA computers, not just written down on a card. The next available slot he could get, after all that effort, was in three months, on January 6, 2014, according to his daughter. Pedro Valdez never made it. On New Year's Eve 2013, he struggled for breath and was rushed to a private hospital.  Valdez was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure; ""he was only breathing at 50%,"" according to his daughter. The next day, he was in intensive care. And six days later -- on January 7, a day after he was to finally see a doctor at the Phoenix VA -- he was dead. He was 66. Priscella Valdez remembers her dad as a man who ""made it out of a gruesome, gruesome, gruesome war,"" who dutifully worked in construction, who raised three children on his own and who never put himself first. More than anything, she remembers him as her ""best friend."" She believes that the system that was supposed to care for him -- a man who'd risked his life for his country -- instead let him down. ""They took a man and broke him down and kicked him when he was down, when he needed them,"" Priscella Valdez said. ""... These people who were supposed to take care of him are able to live freely."" The Valdez family is not the first to levy accusations against the federal agency charged with overseeing health care and benefits of veterans and their dependents. CNN first reported six months ago about allegations of alarming shortcomings within the VA medical care system that, according to the VA, led to 23 deaths. The VA's troubled history . The allegations include the possible destruction of a secret waiting list for care at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System. There have also been claims of delayed care and cooked books at VA facilities nationwide. The VA did not respond to a CNN request for a response to the Valdez family's specific allegation. And because of privacy laws, it is hard to know if Pedro Valdez was on anyone's list at the Phoenix VA, secret or not. Phoenix officials deny there's a secret wait list . The VA's Office of the Inspector General is now investigating these various allegations at 26 VA facilities, and there have been hearings on Capitol Hill. Priscella Valdez has been among those speaking up; CNN first learned of her family's story after she appeared at a forum in Phoenix featuring Sen. John McCain in the wake of the scandal. Much of the focus has been on the VA's management back in Washington, including calls for Secretary Eric Shinseki to be fired. Yet Priscella Valdez says no one looking into this matter can fully comprehend the frustration and the torment experienced by families like hers, who just want their loved ones looked after in a fair, responsible, humane way. ""I don't think anybody clearly understands what's going on,"" she says, ""unless you actually lived it and you're going through it.""

"She arrived on a suspicious flight. Her story didn't sound right. And then there was the blood ... under her breasts. An airport security check in Spain led to an operating table for a passenger -- where, authorities said, they found she had tucked packs of cocaine in her breast implants.

Ninety percent of cocaine trafficked into the United States, for example, comes from Colombia, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The passenger came under the scrutiny of security agents, who weren't satisfied with the vague answers she kept giving about why she was in town, Spain's interior ministry said. Her behavior aroused the suspicion of officers that she might be carrying drugs either in her luggage or on her. When a female officer patted down the woman, she found bloodied bandage material under the passenger's breasts. The gauze, the officer found, was covering incisions. And the breasts were hiding  ""a white foreign material."" Fresh breast implants, the suspect mustered an explanation. Must not have healed up right. The story didn't convince police, who hauled her off to a hospital. ""There, a medical team extracted a bag-shaped prosthesis from each breast containing a white pasty substance,"" the ministry said.

"Kevin Trudeau, the television pitchman and author who amassed a fortune telling consumers his secrets about how to get free money, how to lose weight and how to cure a number of illnesses the natural way, is headed to federal prison. Trudeau, 51, was sentenced to 10 years on Monday for criminal contempt for violating a 2004 federal court order that prohibited him from making misleading infomercials and misrepresenting his weight-loss books. During Monday's sentencing hearing he also got a tongue-lashing from U.S. District Judge Ronald Guzman, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago. ""Since the age of 25, (Trudeau) has attempted to cheat others for his own personal gain,"" Guzman said. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors called Trudeau an ""unrepentant, untiring, and uncontrollable huckster who has defrauded the unsuspecting for 30 years."" Trudeau was convicted of criminal contempt by a jury in November 2013 and has been in federal custody since his conviction. Evidence was presented at his trial that Trudeau appeared in three infomercials in 2006 and 2007, and in those infomercials he misrepresented the contents of one of his weight-loss books. The U.S. attorney said those infomercials were not only untrue, but they violated the 2004 court order that prohibited the infomercials.

"Defense attorneys for Amanda Knox are expected to present their final arguments in Italy Thursday continuing an effort to to counter prosecutors' portrayal of her as a  cunning ""femme fatale."" Knox's attorneys statements Thursday follow arguments presented earlier this week by the lawyer of  her co-defendant . Lawyer Giulia Bongiorno  said on Tuesday that Knox is not the character the media has painted her as and urged a jury to acquit Knox and his client,  Rafaelle Sollecito, of murdering Meredith Kercher. Bongiorno compared Knox to the voluptuous cartoon character Jessica Rabbit, who protests, ""I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way,"" in the movie ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" Bongiorno, who represents Sollecito -- Knox's former boyfriend -- said the whole trial was based on DNA evidence ""on which mistakes were made,"" and urged the jury to ""abandon imagined fantasies"" and acquit the pair. Knox and Sollecito are fighting their conviction for killing Kercher -- Knox's roommate -- in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. As she began her closing arguments Tuesday, Bongiorno said there was no physical trace of Knox or Sollecito in the room where Kercher was found murdered. ""The room speaks only of Rudy"" Guede, the other man convicted separately of killing Kercher, Bongiorno told the jury. Knox and Sollecito's defense teams have suggested Guede, who is already serving a 16-year sentence for the murder, could have been the sole killer. Evidence that Guede was in the room shows that ""no one could enter that room and not leave any trace,"" said Bongiorno, who represents Sollecito. She urged the jury to think about her client as they made their decision. ""The lives of this kid and his parents have been destroyed. You must today evaluate if - if - if these kids committed the crime,"" Bongiorno told jurors. Bongiorno, one the highest-profile lawyers in Italy, attacked media coverage of the trial as sensational, saying it could have affected what witnesses told the court. She rejected the notion that Knox and Sollecito were into violent sex, saying they rubbed noses in ""Eskimo kisses."" The lawyer also attacked the circumstances under which Knox was interrogated by police the night of the murder, saying she was interrogated by ""hostile"" officers, which made it impossible to trust what she said that night. ""If one is not calm, anything can happen,"" Bongiorno argued. And she hammered home attacks on DNA evidence that have been a key part of the appeal. She said police could have contaminated the crime scene or the evidence, playing video from the police investigation itself to make her point. Knox and Sollecito are appealing the convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial. Both defendants were in court Tuesday, with Knox in a long-sleeved pink sweater and Sollecito in a long-sleeved prune-colored shirt. Their parents were in court as well. On Monday, the lawyer for Kercher's family showed photos of the British murder victim's bloodied body, pointing out multiple stab wounds. He urged the Italian jury not to overturn Knox and Sollecito's convictions. ""I show you these pictures to show you the pain of Meredith,"" Francesco Maresca said. ""She didn't have defensive wounds. It means that she was tied up, that she had more than one aggressor,"" the lawyer said. ""Given the type, number and locations of the wounds, there had to be multiple attackers,"" he insisted, rejecting the defense theory that Guede acted alone. He attacked as ""useless"" a review of DNA evidence that may cast doubt on the original convictions. Knox avoided looking at the photographs of Kercher's body as they were shown. Lawyers for the civil suits related to the case presented their closing arguments Monday. At the hearing, another lawyer called Knox two-faced and ""diabolical."" ""Within her lives a double soul: one which is angelic, good, compassionate ... tender and ingenuous,"" Carlo Pacelli said. But she had another side, he said: ""A Lucifer-like, demonic, satanic, diabolical one which sometimes leads her to borderline and dissolute behavior,"" saying that was the Knox who had killed her roommate. Pacelli sought to portray Knox as sexually promiscuous and a difficult roommate as he fights for damages for his client, Patrick Lumumba. Knox accused Lumumba of the murder in 2007. He was arrested but released after his alibi checked out. He later sued Knox for libel, winning 40,000 euros ($54,000) in damages. A verdict in the appeal could come as soon as October 1.","The case is adjourned to Thursday, when Knox's lawyers will give their final arguments .

"In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent Jamie McIntyre reflects on the historic promotion of Gen. Ann Dunwoody, the first woman to achieve Army's highest rank. Gen. Ann E. Dunwoody will command 133,000 personnel worldwide in the Army Material Command. (CNN) -- Watching Army Chief of Staff George Casey swear in his newest fellow four star -- the first woman to achieve the Army's highest rank -- it was hard not to feel something truly historic was happening before your eyes. The cavernous Pentagon auditorium was packed with a constellation of multistarred senior officers, mostly men. The mood was festive. There were broad smiles everywhere. It was both a sign of how far women have come in the U.S. military and a reminder that women are still not full equals to their brothers-in-arms. ""It's taken a long time, probably longer than it should have,"" Casey admitted in his congratulatory remarks. Gen. Ann Dunwoody was beaming as Casey and her husband pinned the four stars on each of her shoulders, stars that carry with them the heavy burden of a ""historic first."" ""I didn't appreciate the enormity of the events until tidal waves of cards, letters, and e-mails started coming my way,"" Dunwoody said. ""And I've heard from men and women, from every branch of service...from moms and dads who see this promotion as a beacon of hope for their own daughters."" One such letter came from Master Sgt. Michael Bergener, who served with Dunwoody at Fort Bragg. ""Now, you get to pin on our nation's highest military rank, and I get to tell my 5- and 7-year-old daughters that they really can be anything that they want to be, even a general in the United States Army."" Well, almost anything. Technically, women are still barred by Congress from serving in direct ground combat -- a distinction that seems increasingly disconnected from the reality of modern warfare. Still, I couldn't help think how much attitudes had changed from when I first reported on the women in combat debate in 1993. Bill Clinton was president, and Defense Secretary Les Aspin had ordered an end to the ban on women flying combat aircraft. The military saluted smartly and began trumpeting the breakthrough, even as some senior officers harbored deep reservations. I remember questioning the Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Tony McPeak, who made no secret of his personal opposition to allowing women in the cockpits of his fighter jets, about how he felt. ""I'm comfortable with it, and there's always the small chance I was wrong,"" McPeak said. It sounded like self-deprecating humor, but anyone who knew Tony McPeak knew he really did think there was only a small chance he was wrong. At the time -- in the early '90s, after Desert Storm -- the prevailing thought was summed up by Kate O'Beirne, a former member of the Presidential Commission on Women in Combat. ""I do not believe the American public is ready to see America's daughters and sisters being paraded in downtown Baghdad as POWs. And we know that our pilots run that risk,"" she said at the time. That's no longer a theoretical question. The fact is American women have been fighting and dying alongside men in both Iraq and Afghanistan -- two wars with no front lines. So far, 115 women have laid down their lives for their country in those wars. But the reason it took so long for a woman to earn four stars is because most full generals prove their mettle in combat. Dunwoody, though she served the Airborne, rose through the ranks of the Army Materiel Command. ""History will no doubt take note of her achievement in breaking through this final brass ceiling to pin on a fourth star,"" Defense Secretary Robert Gates said at Dunwoody's promotion ceremony, ""But she would rather be known and remembered first and foremost as a U.S. Army soldier."" Dunwoody has a proud military history. A Dunwoody has fought in every American war since the Revolution. Her great-grandfather, Brig. Gen. Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody, was the chief signal officer in Cuba from 1898 to 1901. Her father, Hal Dunwoody, is a veteran of three wars -- World War II, Korea and Vietnam. But it is the younger generation of Dunwoodys who are a living testament to the strides woman have made. Her sister Sue was the third female helicopter pilot in the Army, and her niece Jenny is an Air Force A-10 pilot who recently returned from flying combat missions in Afghanistan. ""If anyone is worried about the next generation of warriors, fear not,"" says Dunwoody. ""The bench is loaded with talented sailors, airmen, soldiers, and Marines. And while I know I may be the first woman to achieve this honor, I know with certainty I won't be the last.""","CNN's McIntyre says he got to witness something truly historic .

"Spanish National Police said Friday they have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine in an operation that they said thwarted an attempt by Mexican drug dealers allied with the Sinaloa drug cartel to establish a foothold in Europe. But an expert on the Mexican drug war, Malcolm Beith, disputed that assertion. ""They're already operating in Europe,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview, citing reports of the cartel shipping drugs to ports in England, Netherlands and Germany. Spain is the principal gateway for drugs coming to Europe, Beith said. The operation, dubbed ""Dark Waters"" and carried out in collaboration with the FBI, resulted in the arrests in Madrid of four members of the cartel, which is run by Joaquin Guzman Loera, also known as ""El Chapo,"" police said in a statement. Dark Waters was initiated in May 2009 by the FBI's office in Boston, Massachusetts, which was looking into the cartel, said the statement. In October 2010, agents from the FBI met with the National Police's Central Brigade of Organized Crime after learning of the cartel's alleged plans to expand operations in Europe, it said. The bulk of the investigation unfolded in the United States, where U.S. agents discovered that cartel members were planning to travel to Spain, a trip that occurred the following March, the statement said. Once the suspects were inside Spain, they were placed under tight surveillance by Spanish police, it said. ""Thanks to the exchange of information with the FBI, one knew that the suspects planned to initiate important shipments of cocaine by ship, hidden in containers with legal, declared cargo,"" it said. ""They adopted great measures of security to ensure the success of the operations, and sent various containers without any type of drug. Finally, they sent their first shipment in a boat from Brazil. The container, which was intercepted in late July in the Port of Algeciras, concealed 373 kilos of cocaine."" Investigators identified Jesus Gonzalo Palazuelos Soto, who moved to Madrid to oversee the operation, as a member of the group, it said. A few days later, he was joined by Jesus Gutierrez Guzman, a cousin of ""El Chapo"" and considered the leader of the group; Samuel Zazueta Valenzuela, a principal collaborator, and Rafael Humberto Celaya Valenzuela, who was overseeing the organization's ""legal"" affairs, it said. The four men, aged 37 to 52, were arrested near their hotels in Madrid, it said. They had been sought by U.S. authorities for drug trafficking, money laundering and other charges. Their hotel rooms contained $5,500, about 3,000 euros and 4,000 Mexican pesos, it said. If indeed ""Chapo"" Guzman's cousin was among the men arrested, ""that is a big deal,"" said Beith, whose books ""The Last Narco"" and ""Hasta El Ultimo Dia,"" focus on the Mexican drug war. Though he said he had never heard of the man, ""as a relative, he's clearly an envoy of sorts. He's not just some low-level conejo -- rabbit scout."" Beith said Friday's announcement was a testament to the improvement in intelligence sharing by international agencies. ""As the drug wars come under fire from many quarters, one of the big advances that has been made has been intelligence sharing between U.S. agencies and their foreign counterparts, and this is further proof of that.""","Spanish police say they thwarted an attempt by the Sinaloa cartel to establish a foothold in Europe .

"A small passenger plane crashed in the mountains of western Nepal, killing all 18 people on board, authorities said Monday. The Twin Otter aircraft left Sunday afternoon from the tourist town of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of the capital Kathmandu. It was on its way to Jumla, a remote town about 600 kilometers (373 miles) northeast of Kathmandu, when it went missing. The flight usually takes an hour. ""Police have reached the crash site and no survivors have been found,"" said Bam Bahadur Bhandari, regional police chief of Pokhara. ""The bodies are being collected."" The cause of the crash wasn't immediately known. The plane was flying in poor weather conditions as it had been raining and snowing across the country for the past few days. ""The aircraft seems to have hit a mountain"" said Bimlesh Karna, deputy director of Nepal's civil aviation authority. Among the 18 on board were three crew members and a Danish national. Of the 17 Nepalese, one was a child, Karna said. The 40-year-old Canadian-made Twin Otter aircraft belonged to state-owned Nepal Airlines. The crash has once again raised concern over Nepal's air safety record. There were two fatal air crashes each year from 2010 to 2012 in this Himalayan country.","Official: Plane appears to have hit a mountain .

"The gruesome gunning-down of 15-year-old Malala Yousufzai spotlighted the fate of children in Pakistan, one of the world's most dangerous places to go to school. But in war zones around the world, from Afghanistan to Yemen, students, teachers and schools are regularly coming under attack. These are the world's unrecognized Malalas. In southern Thailand, I visited a school that was still smoldering from an arson attack a few days earlier. Separatist insurgents had doused the classrooms with gasoline and dragged books from the library and mattresses from the kindergarten to fuel the flames. The insurgents view schools as places where the Buddhist Thai government indoctrinates the local Muslim Malay population. Gordon Brown: Millions of children face Malala's fight for an education . The school's teachers were distraught but worried that if they fled the area, the children would be left with no one to teach them. These teachers' bravery is astounding: This month, three bullets to the head felled Komsan Chomyong. He was the 152nd teacher to be assassinated since violence erupted in southern Thailand in 2004. In the past five years, armed forces and armed groups have attacked or taken over schools in at least 25 countries, endangering children's lives, education and future. Armed groups target schools and teachers as symbols of the state. They oppose what is being taught, and to whom. These attacks are not a matter of collateral damage; they are part of deliberate, despicable strategies. Opinion: Candidates, answer the Malala question . This year in eastern Yemen, I met a 14-year-old boy who explained how al Qaeda-linked extremists had replaced the teachers and curriculum at his school. Pointing to a card I brought displaying pictures of various weapons, he identified five that his new ""teachers"" had taught him and his classmates to use. I met another 14-year-old in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, who told me how frightened he had been when the principal led students into the basement to escape gunfire aimed at the militia that had established a base on the school's top floor. ""You couldn't recognize that this was a school because of the military barracks here,"" one teacher told me. In central India, I sifted through the shrapnel and splintered desks in a school that had been bombed by Maoist guerrillas. ""This school has been badly damaged,"" lamented a 16-year-old student showing me around. ""Everything is in ruins."" In India, the Maoists attack schools because the isolated pink buildings make easy targets in rural areas otherwise devoid of government structures. But in doing so, the Maoists harm the country's most marginalized and needy: the very children for whom they claim to be fighting. Safe schools offer essential protection for children in wartime. They can provide lifesaving information about things like avoiding land mines and preventing HIV. They can also shield children from trafficking and recruitment by armed groups. In the long term, a good education promotes peace and post-conflict reconstruction, and helps young people develop the skills to build lives for themselves and prosperity for their communities. Perhaps most important, access to a safe space to study and learn provides students with a sense of normality, routine and calm amid the chaos of war. Opinion: A year later, can Libya tame militias? Ending attacks on students, teachers and schools requires action at both the national and international levels. We need a shared recognition that such attacks can amount to war crimes and need global attention. Where attacks occur, the United Nations should be allowed access to negotiate with armed groups to end grave violations against children. (Thailand recently denied the U.N. access to verify the crimes being committed against children in the south.) We also need better preventive measures and a more timely response. Destroyed schools should be quickly rebuilt, not left as piles of rubble like so many in Pakistan. Militaries should commit to refraining from converting schools into military bases and barracks, to prevent turning schools into targets. In Syria right now, school buildings are being bombed as both sides target each other's bases set up inside classrooms. The cause for which Malala Yousufzai risked her life -- ensuring that children, no matter where they live, can enjoy an education in safety and security -- has received new attention since her bloody attack. Let us work to ensure that it does not take more Malalas for the world to react and give attacks on schools the attention it deserves.","Bede Sheppard: Malala shooting reminds that schools, globally, are besieged in war zones .
He says schools attacked in 25 nations in past 5 years, including Yemen, Thailand, India .

"A 26-year-old Massachusetts man with a physics degree was arrested and charged Wednesday with plotting an attack on the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol with a remote-controlled model aircraft, authorities said. Rezwan Ferdaus, a U.S. citizen from Ashland, Massachusetts, planned to use model aircraft filled with C-4 plastic explosives, authorities said. As a result of an undercover FBI investigation, Ferdaus, who has a physics degree from Northeastern University in Boston, was charged with attempting to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda for attacks on U.S. soldiers overseas, authorities said. His federal public defender couldn't be reached immediately for comment. A law enforcement official said Ferdaus posed no immediate danger to the public because undercover operatives kept in close contact with him. ""There is no information to indicate he was connected to a foreign terrorist organization.  It appears he was radicalized watching videos on the internet. He was given the opportunity to back down, but he never wavered"" from his intention to carry out the attacks, the source said. Analysis: Model planes as weapons of terror . The investigation also involved a cooperating witness, and authorities began recording conversations between that witness and Ferdaus in January, authorities said. Ferdaus began planning a violent ""jihad"" against America in early 2010, authorities said, and he began supplying the FBI undercover agents with cell phones rigged to act as electric switches for improvised explosive devices, intended to be used to kill U.S. soldiers overseas. Undercover federal agents also gave Ferdaus 25 pounds of fake C-4 explosives. Only a very small amount of it was the real thing, the source said. The FBI agents also gave Ferdaus six AK-47 assault rifles and three grenades, but they weren't functional, the source said. Between May and this month, Ferdaus also ordered and acquired a $6,500 remote-controlled aircraft, an F-86 Sabre, that he kept in a rented storage facility in Framingham, Massachusetts, that he maintained under a false name, authorities said. He also planned to use other remote-controlled models of military aircraft, authorities said. The models he planned to use are about one-tenth the size of the actual aircraft. Despite coming into possession of the plane, another law enforcement official said, ""The person was never really a threat."" Ferdaus is unmarried with no children, authorities said. A federal magistrate in Worcester, Massachusetts, on Wednesday ordered Ferdaus to be held until Monday, when a detention hearing is scheduled, authorities said.","Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, a U.S. citizen, is charged in plot to bomb Pentagon and Capitol .

"(CNN) -- The governor of New Mexico has until Friday to decide whether to pardon one of the West's most infamous outlaws in the killing of a law enforcement officer. Gov. Bill Richardson received 809 responses on a special website dedicated to answering a generations-old question: Should Billy the Kid get a pardon in the killing of a sheriff? Richardson, a Billy the Kid buff, is looking at an old promise by another governor, and not the Kid's cold-blooded reputation, in deciding whether to issue a posthumous pardon, officials said. ""I think he will take the responses into account, particularly the learned responses,"" said Richardson's deputy chief of staff, Eric Witt. Some 430 people were in favor of the pardon while 379 were against it, Witt said Wednesday. The governor must make his decision by late Friday, when his term ends. Billy the Kid, who was born Henry McCarty but was also known as William H. Bonney and Henry Antrim, died at the hands of another sheriff, Pat Garrett, when he was only 21. Some members of the Garrett family, including grandson Jarvis Patrick Garrett, oppose the pardon. Besides arguing that Billy the Kid was an incorrigible killer, they want to make sure Pat Garrett is absolved of any wrongdoing related to the killing and a Bonney jail escape. But Witt said the governor will not do anything that casts a cloud on Pat Garrett. ""We consider Pat Garrett a true hero of the West."" Some residents, including Gov.-elect Susana Martinez, said there are more pressing issues facing the state, but Witt said Wednesday that the pardon consideration ""hasn't take away from our attention to them."" Albuquerque defense attorney Randi McGinn, who volunteered to handle the case for free, filed the petition for the pardon. ""A promise is a promise and should be enforced,"" she wrote. Garrett killed Bonney on July 14, 1881, in Fort Sumner weeks after Bonney escaped from a jail. The sheriff, legend has it, was hiding in the dark and shot the Kid when he entered a room. Garrett was gunned down in 1908 at age 57. Richardson will be deciding only the matter of a promise to Bonney made by territorial Gov. Lew Wallace, Witt said. ""We're not offering a blanket pardon for everything he did."" Wallace -- who had also been a Union general in the Civil War and wrote the novel ""Ben-Hur"" -- had promised to grant Bonney amnesty for the fatal shooting of Lincoln County Sheriff William Brady and other ""misdeeds"" if he agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating another murder. Bonney cooperated, but the pardon didn't happen. According to Mark Lee Gardner and other historians, Bonney at one point wrote to Wallace, asking him to honor the deal. The Garretts argue Bonney decided to flee house arrest, making the pardon moot. He eventually was convicted in Brady's death and was sentenced to death, the petition states. But he escaped from jail on April 28, 1881, killing two deputies. ""Still, regardless of Billy's crimes, the motives of Richardson or the hollowness of posthumous justice, it all comes back to Wallace's promise. A deal is a deal, and 129 years doesn't change that. Billy is owed a pardon,"" Gardner wrote earlier this year in the Los Angeles Times. The Garretts don't buy that argument. ""If Billy the Kid was living amongst us now, would you issue a pardon for someone who made his living as a thief and, more egregiously, who killed four law enforcement officers and numerous others?"" the Garrett family wrote Richardson last fall. J.P. Garrett said there is no written proof that Wallace made the promise and noted that the charges were federal, which did not give the governor the right to make the offer. But McGinn said a written promise is not necessary and there is ample evidence and letters indicating it was made. And, she said, Bonney was convicted of state charges after federal ones were dismissed. Wallace's great-grandson, William Wallace, also opposes the pardon for some of the same reasons. Like Garrett, Wallace said a pardon would possibly dishonor his ancestor. Witt says that Richardson does not challenge Wallace's integrity. ""We are strictly concerned with the application of executive power, with any commitments made on behalf of the then-territory and now state of New Mexico, and with the equal application of the law,"" Witt told CNN. Popular history has Bonney gunning down 21 men, but many historians say the number was closer to nine. According to other legends, Bonney did not die at Garrett's hands and is not buried in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. He went to Texas and became known as ""Brushy Bill"" Roberts, they say. Poppycock, the Garretts argue. They asked Richardson to sign a petition signed by 100 people that reads, ""Whereas we the undersigned accept and agree the traditional history of Sheriff Pat F. Garrett and Billy the Kid (William Bonney), and believe that Billy the Kid died at Pat F. Garrett's hand; Therefore we oppose a postphumous (sic) pardon for Billy the Kid as Brushy Bill Roberts."" But McGinn said Bonney kept his bargain by testifying and should receive the pardon. The attorney said at least two killings attributed to Bonney were self-defense and five others could have been done by others. Evidence shows that ""it's ambiguous here who were the bad guys and who were the good guys."" ""Governor Wallace did not keep his end of the deal, which was to pardon Mr. Bonney for all outstanding charges, including the pending indictment related to the death of Sheriff William Brady,"" McGinn wrote last week. ""This injustice should be corrected."" ""Why would he (Bonney) surrender himself ... unless there was something in it for him?"" McGinn asked.","Gov. Bill Richardson is considering pardoning William Bonney in a sheriff's death .
He is debating whether a promise made by an earlier governor should be honored .
Richardson is a Billy the Kid buff ."
"A former BP engineer has been charged with destroying 200-plus text messages about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, including one concluding that the undersea gusher was far worse than reported at the time. Kurt Mix faces two counts of intentionally destroying evidence requested by authorities, federal prosecutors announced Tuesday. The charges mark the first criminal case brought in conjunction with the 2010 blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, which spewed nearly 5 million barrels of crude into the sea. Mix had been assigned to estimate the size of the spill, and one of the messages investigators recovered ""includes real-time flow-rate analysis"" during an effort to plug the damaged well. That data contradicted the company's public statements about the ongoing disaster, according to an FBI agent's affidavit outlining the charges against him. The effort, called a ""top kill,"" involved plugging the ruptured deep-sea well by pumping heavy drilling fluid into it from the surface, nearly a mile above. ""Before Top Kill commenced, Mix and other engineers had concluded internally that Top Kill was unlikely to succeed if the flow rate was greater than 15,000 barrels of oil per day,"" the Justice Department said in a statement announcing the charges. On the first day of the operation, Mix sent a message back to his supervisor that read, ""Too much flowrate -- over 15,000 and too large an orifice,"" an FBI affidavit outlining the charges states. That data indicated ""that Top Kill was not working, contrary to BP's public statements at that time,"" the affidavit states. When the operation began, the publicly announced estimate of the spill by BP and federal agencies was 5,000 barrels a day, though BP had acknowledged the amount was likely higher.  The day after Mix's message, the U.S. government raised its estimate of the spill amount to 12,000 barrels a day; two days later, BP announced that the ""Top Kill"" attempt had failed. According to the affidavit, an early estimate of the blowout Mix produced ranged from 64,000 barrels a day to 138,000; another ranged from 1,000 to 146,000 per day. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ultimately concluded that about 59,200 barrels of liquid oil a day flowed from the well before it was capped, making it the worst oil spill in U.S. history. In a statement issued Tuesday, BP said it was cooperating with Justice Department and other investigations into the spill, which lasted nearly three months. The company had no comment on the allegations against Mix but said it ""had clear policies requiring preservation of evidence in this case and has undertaken substantial and ongoing efforts to preserve evidence."" Mix, of the Houston suburb of Katy, resigned from BP in early 2012, the affidavit states. He made his first appearance before a federal judge in Houston on Tuesday afternoon on the charges, which were filed in New Orleans. Prosecutors said Mix deleted a string of more than 200 messages from his iPhone about October 4, 2010, after he had been told to collect electronic files related to the disaster and prepare to turn them over to a company working for the oil giant's attorneys. He would face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 on each count if convicted. The Gulf Restoration Network, a New Orleans-based environmental  group, said it was pleased to see criminal charges stemming from the spill. ""It is telling that the Department of Justice's charges against Kurt Mix surround efforts to cover up the fact that BP's public estimates of the oil flow rate were far lower than the actual flow rate,"" the group said in a statement on the arrest. ""Establishing accurate flow rates is an important step forward in ensuring that BP pays the highest possible price for every drop of oil that they discharged into the Gulf."" An estimated 4.9 million barrels (206 million gallons) of crude oil poured into the Gulf of Mexico after the April, 20, 2010 explosion that sank the drill rig Deepwater Horizon and killed 11 men aboard. The disaster damaged the region's fishing and tourism industries, a temporary federal ban on deepwater drilling left oilworkers idled, and scientists are still studying the long-term effects of the disaster on the Gulf ecosystem. BP announced last week that it had reached a settlement estimated at $7.8 billion with thousands of businesses and individuals who filed damage claims in the wake of the spill, and a federal criminal investigation of the disaster is ongoing. In September, a government report on the spill found that BP, rig owner Transocean and well cement contractor Halliburton shared responsibility for the explosion, but BP was ""ultimately responsible"" for operations at the site. BP and Halliburton sued each other in April 2011, each claiming the other was to blame for the deadly explosion and resulting leak. A federal judge in New Orleans ruled this year that Halliburton is not liable for the some of the compensatory damages sought by third parties, leaving BP on the hook for the majority of those claims, while a similar decision came down regarding Transocean.","Former BP engineer is accused of destroying text messages about the spill .

"A fraternity at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee is being investigated on suspicion that members put ""date rape"" drugs into drinks served at a party, according to search warrants issued by campus police. Police started investigating after three women and a man were hospitalized after consuming drinks at the September 12 party at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house, the search warrant said. The warrants sought, among other things, drugs that cause loss of memory or ""other intoxicating effects."" One student who went to the hospital told police that ""she had a weird feeling and sensation prior to blacking out which she had never felt before. [The student] stated she feels victimized by TKE and that she is sure some sort of drug or other intoxicant was given to her against her will and unbeknownst to her,"" according to the warrant. The student said the fraternity had a reputation for putting ""roofies"" into women's drinks but ""she thought it was all in the past,"" the warrant stated. Roofies, a street name for Rohypnol, is a tasteless and odorless drug. Alex Baker of the Tau Kappa Epsilon International Fraternity said: ""... These alleged actions do not align with our values of love, charity and esteem. ""We have temporarily suspended the Zeta-Zeta chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon. We are currently working with university officials and local authorities to ascertain all of the information of the incident."" Schools preach 'enthusiastic' yes in sex consent education . In the search warrants, another woman student said a male poured her a drink and then moved ""the cup under the bar out of sight; after a few moments the male pulled the cup back on top of the bar and gave her the mixed drink."" She said she blacked out 30 to 45 minutes after consuming the drink, the warrant said. The third female student who went to the hospital said the fraternity sold ""all access"" cards that provided women with unlimited drinks. The female student said, ""The cards were only for sale to females 'and you have to be hot' to get one,"" according to the warrant. When asked whether the party was a ""ladies night party,"" the student said, ""No. This is how it usually is, girls always get wasted there,"" the warrant stated. When police officers went into the fraternity house about 1:30 a.m. on Sepember 13, they found 42 people in the basement under the legal drinking age of 21, all with a red or black ""X"" marked on their hands, the warrant said. The warrants said fraternity members marked guests' hands with the X's but don't explain what the marks meant. The university suspended the fraternity while the investigation is under way, said Tom Luljak, vice chancellor of university relations and communications.

"(CNN) -- South Korea isn't yet known for its sailing prowess, but that may all be about to change. The America's Cup is widely recognized as the holy-grail of boating trophies and, for the first time in its 160-year history, a challenge has been accepted from the technologically mighty Asian country. Team Korea will be known as the ""White Tiger Challenge"" -- a reference to one of the ancient guardian gods in Korean mythology -- and will compete in San Francisco for the 2013 title alongside 14 other teams, including the staple powerhouses of France, Italy, New Zealand and the U.S. defenders. The surprise entry reflects the recent and rapid growth of the sport in a nation known more for its vast ship-building yards than its nascent sailing culture. ""Korea has all the right ingredients to become a great sailing nation,"" said Dong Young Kim, Team Korea's founder. ""We have a high-tech industry, a reputation for holding world-class events and over 2,000 kilometers of coastline."" The 31-year-old, who cut his sailing teeth as a boat builder in New Zealand after graduating from university in the early 2000s, says South Korea's sailing aspirations have seemingly come from nowhere. ""When I started sailing at university, there were literally only a couple of hundred sailors in the whole country, and only one major marina, which was built for the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games,"" he said. Now, according to Kim, there are seven marinas in South Korea -- up from just three in 2008 -- and another 30 or so in the pipeline. So what's prompted all this enthusiasm? Mark Chi arrived in Korea from the U.S. in 2003 and has since established the Busan Expat Sailing Club. He attributes the growing interest in sailing to government policy. ""Several years ago, the Korean government chose 'water leisure sports' as one of the 10 new industries it wishes to develop,"" he explained. ""Since then, many towns along the coast, as well as the capital city of Seoul, have been scrambling to develop the yachting scene in their areas."" But there is also another aspect of government policy that Kim believes has played a significant role: increased leisure time. ""Until quite recently we had a six-day week, with many people working on Saturdays,"" said Kim. ""Since the government introduced the five-day working week, more people have time to explore new hobbies."" Indeed, Kim experienced first-hand the untapped national interest in the sport when he founded the Korea Match Cup in 2008. ""We had queues literally thousands of meters long! We had had high hopes but never expected that,"" he said. According to Kim, a total of 300,000 spectators visited the brand new purpose-built Jeongok Marina during the five-day event in 2008. The tournament, which was televised around the world, boasts a grand prize of $250,000 -- sailing's single biggest prize. Although widely credited with being the true driving force behind Korea's dawning love affair with sailboats, Kim is modest about his ambitions. ""I don't think we have a strong chance to take home the America's Cup,"" he admitted. ""I'm very happy with the team, but we just don't have the same experience as the other competitors."" However, with the introduction of 45-foot fixed-wing sails (replacing the smaller, soft sails from previous competitions), Kim notes that the tournament is likely to be a learning curve for everyone involved. ""The new style of catamarans should level the playing field, but we still have to be realistic,"" he said. ""I just hope that our example and the continued popularity of the Korea Match Cup will get young people in the country interested."" Whatever Korea's chances, Chi is just happy his fellow countrymen are starting to realize what he has known for years: Korea's natural potential as a top sailing destination. ""The scenery varies greatly from area to area,"" he said. ""In Seoul and Busan, you have the backdrop of skyscrapers and tall bridges. Further south, you have many green hills and various islands to explore."" So, could the South Korean coast really be the next Cote D'Azure? Only time will tell.","South Korea has made a successful bid to participate in the 2013 America's Cup .

"The visible wounds on David Connor Castellani's head and neck are healing, but the scars remain from the night he was arrested and beaten by five Atlantic City Police officers and bitten by a police dog in an incident captured on video. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Jason Carroll, Castellani, 20, said he has total numbness on the right side of his head, and severe nerve damage. ""It's definitely the worst thing that's ever happened to me in my life,"" the Temple University junior said. Castellani and his parents have filed a lawsuit in federal court against Atlantic City and its police department. The arrest and beating was captured on surveillance video in the early morning hours of June 15, after Castellani was told to leave the Tropicana Casino and Resort because, he said, he is under 21. Graphic video released of Florida man run over by police . The video shows Castellani yelling and gesturing at the officers who are not visible on the video at that time. Several officers tackle him and start hitting him with clubs and kneeing him, according to the video. After officers wrestle with and hit Castellani for almost full minute, the video shows a K-9 van arriving.  An officer gets out and releases a police dog onto Castellani, who by then was flat on the ground surrounded by five police officers still seemingly attempting to handcuff him, the video shows. The video shows the police dog biting at Castellani's neck and dragging him to the curb, before the scene becomes obscured by the police van. Castellani told CNN that during the incident ""I was just basically rolling up in a ball -- I wasn't resisting, I told them that, and they continued to beat me. I was holding on for life when the dog bit me."" Atlantic City Police Chief Ernest Jubilee told Carroll that an internal investigation of the incident is underway, but he is ""absolutely"" standing by his officers. ""I stand by the officers. I stand by their actions. If the investigation bears something different, then we'll deal with it at that time,"" Jubilee said. The officers involved all remain on active duty. Castellani's parents told CNN they were horrified by what they saw on the video.  ""I was just numb, went home and got sick.""  Theresa Castellani said. ""You don't want to see that happen to anyone, but especially your own child...that was horrible."" David and Theresa Castellani and their son filed a civil lawsuit this week in U.S. District Court in Camden, New Jersey. They say they are hoping to change the Atlantic City department's policies and procedures, and they also are seeking monetary damages. They also ask that the police involved be prohibited from serving as law enforcement officers. Florida deputies shoot man they mistook for car thief in his own driveway . ""I think it's really the sum total of the (police) administration allowing these officers to perpetrate this kind of conduct and to continue to allow them and empower them with this abuse of authority,"" David Castellani said.  ""They're there to help you, not to hurt you. To see this kind of conduct, a beat down on my son and then the use of (a police dog) on his neck ... it was shocking beyond belief."" When CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Lou Palumbo reviewed the entire surveillance video, however, he said he believed the amount of force used by officers was appropriate. Palumbo, a former law enforcement officer, said Castellani seemed to have precipitated the confrontation with police by verbally taunting them, even after they initially were willing to let him walk away. ""This is the problem you have. If the police order you and want to place you under arrest ... you ought to comply,"" Palumbo said.  ""All they wanted to do was get this kid under control and handcuff him."" Palumbo acknowledged that the release of the dog was ""a gray area,"" noting that ""perceptively it's terrible,"" but pointing out that Castellani was still not handcuffed at the time and that ""dogs are used for compliance."" But 20-year police veteran Jon Shane, a retired police captain who now teaches police practice at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, was critical of all officers shown on the video. He said it's unclear to him how Castellani's behavior, as shown on the video before police tackle him, even rises to the level of disorderly conduct. ""I don't see any fighting, threatening or tumultuous behavior displayed toward the public,"" he said.  Once police had him on the ground, Shane said he believes the amount of force police used in trying to hold him down and handcuff him ""appears to be reasonable."" But using the dog, Shane said, did amount to excessive force in his view, and could very easily have been deadly. Normal police procedure would have been to give the dog a ""bite and hold"" command, just to hold down a suspect.  ""I don't know of any training that allows police officers to launch the dog onto somebody's neck which is right where the dog went,""  Shane said, adding that a dog bite in the neck ""could have killed him."" Atlantic City Mayor Lorenzo T. Langford released a statement Wednesday saying he found the video ""quite disturbing."" ""In an effort to ensure transparency and to maximize the level of scrutiny regarding the investigation of this matter, I am asking the State Attorney General's Office to oversee this investigative effort.  Moreover, I will be making a formal request to the United States Department of Justice to monitor the investigation regarding this case,"" Langford said. His statement specifically referred to the incident ""involving the use of a K-9 dog,"" but made no reference to any of the officers involved or their actions. The Castellanis'  attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, called the videotaped episode ""one of the most egregious examples of excessive force and police brutality"" that she has ever seen. ""I am dismayed that we still have this problem where police officers are unwilling to speak truthfully and honestly when tragedies like this happen ... Every objective person who looks at this video, says 'Oh my gosh, this is unbelievable.'  And (the police chief) will sit there and say, 'I stand by my officers.'"" Bonjean said.  ""To me, I'm not surprised, it happens all the time, but it's still shocking and it's truly disappointing."" Connor Castellani, a six-foot-four-inch-tall media studies major, was charged with resisting arrest, disorderly conduct and aggravated assault on an officer and a canine. Hospital photos show multiple wounds and dog bites on his head and neck, with more than 200 stiches needed to close his wounds, according to his family.  He also suffered a crushed spinal nerve, numbness on the right side of the skull and several bruises and abrasions, his family said. Despite his experience, Castellani says he still believes the majority of police officers are good people ""who are here to protect us.""   But he hopes that his case will help bring more attention to law enforcement abuses. ""It happens on a daily basis, police brutality, and I think it just needs to be addressed and taken care of because it's just really wrong,"" he said.

"Children as young as 10 years old increasingly face horrific abuse in war-torn Somalia as the Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab has targeted them to replenish its diminishing ranks of fighters, according to a Human Rights Watch report released Tuesday. While the recruitment of child soldiers by the Somali insurgent group is not new, the report said the scale of child abductions over the past two years is like nothing documented in the past. Shocking patterns have also emerged of children serving as human shields on the battlefields, according to Human Rights Watch. ""We're beginning to see more and more instances where children are essentially being used as cannon fodder,"" Tirana Hassan of Human Rights Watch told CNN. Al-Shabaab fighters abduct young girls and boys from their homes or schools, in some cases taking entire classes, the report said. Children can be sent out to recruit other children, according to the organization. One survivor told Human Rights Watch he was asked by a group of kids to play football at a nearby field. When he arrived, he and others were gathered up and sent to training camps, the survivor told Human Rights Watch. The camps are places where children live in fear, said Hassan, an emergencies researcher for the international human rights group. ""They see injured and dead fighters, many of them children, coming back from the battlefield,"" Hassan added. Recruits are taught to use weapons and to throw hand grenades and are subjected to a myriad of abuses including rape, assault and forced marriages, according to Hassan. Dozens of recruits, mostly ages 14 to 17, are driven by truckloads to the front line, where they are told to jump out only to be mowed down by gunfire while Al-Shabaab fighters launch rockets from behind, according to Hassan. A 15-year-old boy recruited by Al-Shabaab from his school in Mogadishu in 2010 told Human Rights Watch that ""out of all my classmates -- about 100 boys -- only two of us escaped, the rest were killed."" ""The children were cleaned off. The children all died and the bigger soldiers ran away,"" the youth told Human Rights Watch. Somalia's transitional government also was criticized by Human Rights Watch for not ending its own use of child soldiers. ""Al-Shabaab's horrific abuses do not excuse Somalia's Transitional Federal Government,"" said Zama Coursen-Neff, the group's deputy children's rights director. ""The TFG should live up to its commitments to stop recruiting and using children as soldiers, and punish those who do."" Gen. Abdulkadir Ali Diimi, the head of Somalia's National Army, said he was unable to comment on the report. The 104-page report, released two days ahead of a Somalia conference hosted by the British government, grimly details countless violations against children based on more than 160 interviews conducted over the last two years with Somali youngsters who escaped from Al-Shabaab forces, as well as parents and teachers who fled to Kenya. ""For children of Somalia, nowhere is safe,"" Coursen-Neff said. On Thursday, senior representatives from more than 40 governments will converge on London in a diplomatic push to find political solutions to restore stability in Somalia.","New report says child abductions by Al-Shabaab on the rise in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United may have 659 million ""followers"" -- according to a survey conducted two years ago -- but it's not the biggest club in the world. That's according to the Red Devils' new manager, Louis van Gaal, who was officially unveiled Thursday only days after guiding the Netherlands to third place at the World Cup in Brazil. Van Gaal's statement pulled no punches, which is in keeping with the 62-year-old's reputation as being a no-nonsense disciplinarian. His task is to reverse the fortunes of United, which last season under David Moyes went from the most dominant side in the English Premier League era to one that couldn't even qualify for the often derided Europa League. ""Last year you were seventh so then you are not the biggest club,"" van Gaal said. However, United's standing generally wasn't lost on van Gaal, whose resume boasts league titles with three European giants, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax. In case he needed a reminder of United's stature, United legend Bobby Charlton was there Thursday to greet him. ""It's the biggest club because of how well it's known around the world,"" van Gaal said. ""When I was in China or Brazil, people were talking about United when I was the coach of the Dutch team."" Van Gaal at the helm could be a boon for his compatriot, striker Robin van Persie, who failed to match his first season at Manchester United in 2012/2013, yet he still inherits a team in transition. Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic won't be around in the heart of the defense, nor will marauding left-back Patrice Evra. But unlike last season's summer transfer window, United at least managed to make two major signings early, landing the coveted 19-year-old Luke Shaw -- he'll replace Evra -- from Southampton and long-term creative midfield target Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao. Van Gaal wasn't about to forecast United's league position this season. United finished a staggering 22 points behind champion and city rival Manchester City. ""I will do my utmost best,"" said van Gaal. ""That's what I can give. I cannot give predictions because you never know. It's the biggest club of the world. ""Within two days I know already how important Manchester United is. ""I have to work, I have to prepare a team, I have to adapt to this big club. When you see my career you can see what I have won. That's all I can say. ""The future shall show if I can do that again."" His assistant coaches Albert Stuivenberg and Marcel Bout have already been working with the players in advance of his arrival after the World Cup. They took the first training session of Thursday along with club legend Ryan Giggs, who was in temporary charge after Moyes' dismissal at the back end of last season. The retention of Giggs and van Gaal's stated intention Thursday that he would find roles for other former players on the United staff like Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville shows he will not be totally breaking from the past. But Van Gaal has already suffered an injury blow, as midfielder Michael Carrick sustained an ankle injury in training and will be sidelined for up to 12 weeks.","Dutchman Louis van Gaal is officially unveiled as Manchester United manager .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court narrowly ruled Wednesday that a white cross, erected as a war memorial and sitting on national parkland in the Mojave Desert, does not violate the constitutional separation of church and state. The 5-4 conservative majority said Congress acted properly when it tried to transfer land around the Mojave Memorial Cross to veterans groups, an effort to eliminate any Establishment Clause violation. The land then would have been declared a national memorial. A federal appeals panel had blocked that land swap. ""It is reasonable to interpret the congressional designation as giving recognition to the historical meaning that the cross had attained,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote. ""The Constitution does not oblige government to avoid any public acknowledgment of religion's role in society."" But even among the conservatives who voted to allow the cross to stand, there was strong disagreement about how similar disputes should be settled, an indication of the contentious nature of church-and-state cases. At issue before the justices was whether the display violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which says that ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion."" More specifically, can one individual who protests the cross have legal standing to take his case to court and prevail? And do congressional efforts to minimize the appearance of a constitutional violation carry any weight? The 6-foot Latin cross was first erected in 1934 by a local Veterans of Foreign Wars unit in a remote part of the California desert to honor war dead. It has been rebuilt several times over the years, and Easter services take place on the site annually. The land now is part of the Mojave National Preserve, a unit of the National Park Service, encompassing 1.6 million acres, or 2,500 square miles. A former Park Service employee brought suit, saying such symbols represent government endorsement of the Christian faith. A federal appeals court ultimately agreed, and rejected a move by Congress in 2003 to transfer the tiny portion of land where the cross sits back to the VFW, as a privately held national memorial. The area in question is a prominent outcropping known as Sunrise Rock. Kennedy said the cross represents more than just a religion, echoing the views of the VFW. ""Here one Latin cross in the desert evokes far more than religion,"" he wrote. ""It evokes thousands of small crosses in foreign fields marking the graves of Americans who fell in battles, battles whose tragedies are compounded if the fallen are forgotten."" The court sent the case back to the lower federal courts to resolve, and said the man who brought the suit, Frank Buono, could continue his legal fight over how the future land transfer is handled. Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas said they would go further and end all litigation of the land transfer. The appeals court noted that the land transfer effort singled out the VFW for special treatment and that officials had rejected a proposal to erect a nearby Buddhist stupa, or shrine. Jewish and Muslim veterans groups in the U.S. say the Mojave Cross symbolizes the sacrifice of Christian veterans, excluding other faiths. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens -- who is retiring at the end of the term in June -- said the land transfer does not remedy the constitutional concerns. ""Such measures would not completely end the government endorsement of this cross,"" he wrote, ""as the land would have been transferred in a manner favoring the cross and the cross would remain designated as a national memorial."" As the only war veteran on the court, Stevens, who served in World War II as an intelligence officer, added, ""I certainly agree that the nation should memorialize the service of those who fought and died in World War I, but it cannot lawfully do so by continued endorsement of a starkly sectarian message."" The American Civil Liberties Union is representing Buono. Attorney Peter Eliasberg told the court ""the government had favored one party to come on, contrary to the government's own regulations, and erect a permanent symbol, while not allowing others."" The case is Salazar v. Buono (08-472).","Justices say war memorial doesn't violate Constitution's First Amendment .

"The government of Liberia says that sample doses of the experimental Ebola drug ZMapp will be sent there to treat doctors who have contracted the deadly virus. The White House and Food and Drug Administration approved the Liberian request for the drug to be made available to them. Liberia identified itself as the recipient of the drug after the company that makes ZMapp said earlier that its supply was exhausted after fulfilling the request of a West African country, which it did not name. The delivery of the ZMapp to Liberia follows a request made on Friday from Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to President Barack Obama. The sample doses will be brought to Liberia by a U.S. government representative this week, the Liberian government said. A World Health Organization panel convened Monday to discuss the ethics of using experimental medicine to fight Ebola in West Africa. In the current outbreak, the virus is believed to have infected 1,848 people and killed 1,013, according to WHO's latest figures. There are no proven vaccines or drugs to treat Ebola, but ZMapp was given to two American missionaries infected with the disease early last week. Both patients had to give consent to receive the drug, knowing it had never been tested in humans before. Their conditions are said to be improving. ZMapp is also being given to Miguel Pajares, a Spanish priest infected with Ebola while working in Liberia, Spain's Ministry of Heath announced Saturday. The drug was sent from Geneva, Switzerland, to Madrid, where Pajares is being treated in a special isolation unit at Hospital Carlos III. The patients' treatment has raised questions about the use of unproven and unlicensed drugs to treat Ebola and why these three have received the serum when so many others in West Africa also have the virus. Ebola outbreak Patient Zero found? Medical ethicists, scientific experts and lay people from the countries affected by the Ebola outbreak will discuss the use of unlicensed medicines to combat the virus during the WHO teleconference Monday. The panel will look at issues including whether it is ethical to use ""unregistered interventions with unknown adverse effects,"" and, if so, who should receive them. WHO last week declared the Ebola outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern."" Since an Ebola epidemic was declared in Guinea in March, the disease has spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria. On Sunday, Ivory Coast banned flights to and from those countries affected by Ebola. Emirates this month become the first major international airline to suspend flights from Guinea, followed by pan-African airline ASKY and smaller regional carrier Arik Air. British Airways stopped its flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia last Tuesday, because of the ""deteriorating public health situation."" The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever that affects multiple organ systems in the body. It can kill up to 90% of those infected. Early symptoms include weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. The most common treatment requires supporting organ functions and maintaining bodily fluids such as blood and water long enough for the body to fight off the infection.

"A 4,300-acre wildfire in California's Napa County was barely under control Thursday and is now threatening at least one vineyard in a nearby area, authorities said. ""There are some small vineyards in the general area but nothing major,"" said Cal Fire spokesman Daniel Berlant. The Langtry Estate & Vineyard in Middletown in nearby Lake County was advised to evacuate, Cal Fire spokeswoman Stacie McCambridge told CNN affiliate KGO. About 500 people have been evacuated in the Butts Fire, Berlant said Thursday. More than 1,000 firefighters were struggling Thursday to contain the wildfire in Napa and Lake counties. They had only 30% of the blaze under control, Cal Fire said. Residents described how firefighters defended homes from a spectacular wildfire. ""The firefighters are amazing. We have watched over the past two days as they have successfully defended the borders of the fire as it was approaching residences,"" said Lori Lynn Todd, who posted photos of the fire on her CNN iReport page. ""Those pilots are beyond brave, swooping down the hillsides and into the billowing smoke to suppress the advance of the fire,"" said Todd, 50, a finance executive who lives in Pope Valley, California, within a mile of where the fire started. ""The fire retardant breaks look like orange stripes across the hill sides."" Todd's home was spared from the fire, she said. Firefighter Mike Forster said the blaze ""is a reminder of just how dry things are here in California,"" which is facing a drought emergency. ""We are about six weeks ahead of where we normally are in fire season in regards to how dry the vegetation is,"" said Forster, who also posted photographs of the fire on his CNN iReport page. He noted how the fire has burned almost seven square miles with less than a third under control. ""So we still have some work to do,"" said Forster, who's from Walnut Creek, California. So far, two residences and seven outbuildings have been destroyed, fire officials said. Firefighters were defending about 180 structures Thursday and were laboring in high heat, humidity and the possibility of erratic winds in steep, rugged terrain in rural areas of the two counties, Cal Fire said. The cause of the wildfire is under investigation, authorities said. The blaze has grown 75% since it began Tuesday and spread rapidly to 2,500 acres on the same day, prompting the immediate evacuation of about 150 residences more than 20 miles outside the town of Napa, authorities said. As California faces what officials call probably the worst drought in a century, fire officials say it will exacerbate the state's wildfire season, which appears to have begun months earlier than normal. Gov. Jerry Brown has asked all Californians to reduce voluntarily their water use by 20%, and Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott is urging the public to use extreme caution with fireworks during the Fourth of July holiday weekend. ""The drought has increased the threat of wildfire in California,"" Pimlott said in a statement.

"There's been a sharp spike in radiation levels measured in the pipes and containers holding water at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in Japan. But the company in charge of cleaning it up says that only a single drop of the highly contaminated water escaped the holding tanks. Tokyo Electric Power Company  said it is confident it can provide safety for workers dealing with the problem. ""We will find out the cause of this issue and make proper counter measures immediately, and continue to make every effort to secure safety of workers,"" the company said in a statement released Sunday. TEPCO found high radiation readings at the contaminated water storage tanks and pipe Saturday. The four locations are the bottom of three tanks and a pipe connecting tanks in separate area. The highest reading as 1800 millisieverts per hour at the bottom fringe of the tank. 220 and 70 mSv were measured at the bottom of other two tanks. And TEPCO said they found a dried stain under the pipe with 230 mSv/h radiation measurement. One drop of liquid fell when a staff member pressed on insulation material around the pipe. But TEPCO said no contaminated water leak is expected as there were no change in the water level in tanks. The enormous tanks are identical to the container that was announced last week to have leaked 300 tons of highly toxic water and sparking a hike to the threat level to ""serious."" TEPCO will investigate the cause and look further if there were any leakage. But TEPCO also took issue with reporting by some news outlets that the new radiation levels were high enough to cause death after several hours of exposure. It said the highest levels measured were so-called beta radiation, which quickly dissipates over short distances and is easily shielded through the use of thin sheets of metal and foil. ""Since beta radiation is weak and can be blocked by a thin metal sheet such as aluminum, we think that we can control radiation exposure by using proper equipments and cloths,"" the company added.

"(CNN) -- ""This is not what I planned,"" Paris Hilton told Piers Morgan in reference to the infamous sex tape that the CNN host said ""catapulted"" the heiress ""into the celebrity stratosphere"" when it was released back in 2003. The heiress, socialite, TV personality, model, singer, fashion designer and one woman brand is a guest on Tuesday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""I didn't want to be known as that,"" continued Hilton. ""And now when people look at me they think that I'm something I'm not just because of one incident one night with someone who I was in love with. ""People assume 'Oh, she's a slut' because of one thing that happened to me and it's hard because I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life and explain it to my children. And it's something that's changed my life forever and I'll never be able to erase it."" Hilton told Morgan that she was in Australia when the tape was released and that she was ""in shock"" when she saw a clip of the video which had actually been filmed in 2001, two years prior. Paris called the incident ""the most embarrassing, humiliating thing that has ever happened to me in my life."" Hilton's mother, Kathy, who joined her daughter on the show, recalled that Paris did not leave the family's New York home for three months after the tape was leaked, and during that time the family underwent therapy. When Morgan asked Hilton what she thought about the people who put the tape out there -- specifically her ex-boyfriend, Rick Salomon -- Hilton said she ""just felt so betrayed. This was not some random guy. This was someone I was with for a few years."" Later in the interview, she confided that she thinks Salomon is ""a very bad person."" Hilton was 20 when the tape was made and recently turned 30. She told Morgan that she feels like she's ""really grown in the past couple of years."" She said she hopes her new show on the Oxygen network, ""The World According To Paris,"" will clear up the ""many misconceptions"" people have about her. ""This show is all real,"" she said. ""I was finally ready to show who I really was, and I'm really honest in the show, and there's a lot of things in the show I can't even believe I'm going to let air. But I want it to be as real as possible and people to get to know me."" When Morgan asked the hotel heiress about people's misconceptions, she replied, ""Just having the last name Hilton, people assume that everything was handed to me and I've never had to work a day in my life. But in reality, I've worked so hard, I've done this all on my own and I don't take anything from my family. I do everything by myself. ""Just growing up, my parents never spoiled us. They always made us want to do something on our own. I think I have a name where I have a lot to live up to and I didn't want to just be known as the Hilton granddaughter. I wanted to build my own empire and do something on my own and I think it's just something that runs in my blood, wanting to be creative and do big things."" The CNN host asked whether she said playing the fame game was worth the price. ""I've really grown a thick skin over the years and I've had so many things said about me, and it's hard,"" Hilton said. ""But I feel like what else could happen at this point. Everything bad that could happen to a person has happened to me."" Morgan asked Kathy Hilton whether she would have stopped her daughter from pursing fame if it meant avoiding the pitfalls she has been through. ""If she didn't have to go through what we had just talked about, yes, obviously,"" she said. ""I mean, I did think she was going to be a veterinarian."" Kathy Hilton told Morgan that her daughter was a tomboy as a child, and that ""she didn't even care about clothing or any of that until we moved to New York."" Paris Hilton said she doesn't think she would be the success she is today without her family's love and support. ""I am so fortunate that my parents have been together forever,"" she said. ""They're so supportive, they're there for me, they love me ... If I didn't have my parents, I don't know where I'd be today."" Aside from her new series and recording an album, Hilton told Morgan, ""I have 17 different product lines, so I do everything from fragrances, handbags, clothing, shoes, sunglasses, pet products, stationery, bedding. I do everything. I just launched my 11th fragrance."" While Hilton made it clear that she feels uncomfortable discussing money, she did disclose that her brand amasses her more than $10 million a year. ""I do very well for myself,"" said Paris. ""I'm very proud of what I've done."" Hilton said her brand personifies ""fashion, fun, excitement and amazing products."" ""I really am passionate about every single thing I do ... and I've worked really hard to achieve all this."" Hilton, who has been dating businessman and entrepreneur Cy Waits for over a year, told Morgan she has ""never been happier."" He just makes me feel so safe,"" she said of Waits. ""He's so loyal and he's my best friend. He's an incredible man. I'm honestly lucky."" While Hilton wouldn't say whether an engagement is in the immediate future, she said she couldn't imagine herself with anyone else, and that ""I'd love to have a family and children in the next couple of years, definitely.""

"A 5-year-old girl chats up classmates while waiting for the bus after school. The topic: Playing with a Hello Kitty ""bubble gun"" that, with the flick of a finger, blows bubbles everywhere. ""I'll shoot you, you shoot me, and we'll all play together,"" the kindergartner says. The next day, that remark -- which was made innocently, according to the lawyer for the girl's family, who related the story -- landed the young central Pennsylvanian child in the principal's office. Soon after, she was sent home after being issued a 10-day suspension for a ""terroristic threat,"" as indicated on the suspension form signed by Mount Carmel Area Elementary School Principal Susan Nestico. That and other documents were provided to CNN by Robin Ficker, the lawyer representing the girl and her mother. Nestico did not respond to a request Monday from CNN for comment. The superintendent's office for the Mount Carmel Area School District did issue a statement, stating that ""by law we cannot officially comment on the specifics,"" while expressing confidence that the story circulating in the media ""may not be consistent with the facts."" ""When given the opportunity in the appropriate forum, we look forward to presenting information that will portray our school district in a more positive light,"" the school district said. Surprise! Mom packed you a nice gun . While the girl and her family haven't spoken on the record -- and asked not to be identified -- their attorney, Ficker, has. He said the child has been very upset since the incident, even after the school system shortened the suspension from 10 to two days. One piece of evidence he points to is a letter from a professional counselor, an appointment requested by the school, who talked to the suspended girl and her mother two days after the incident. In it, the therapist describes the child as an apparently ""typical 5-year-old by temperament and interests"" with no history of mood swings, irritability, depression, attention deficit disorder, learning issues or other problems. Also, according to the counselor's letter, the girl had ""no play guns or play knives,"" either in the bus line or at home, where her mother prohibited them. ""It would appear that (the girl) does not have those risk factors identified for violent behavior,"" the therapist wrote. ""It would also seem that (she) had no harmful or predatory intent in the comments she made to her friends about the bubble 'gun' but did not recognize the heightened sensitivity and awareness of her friends and the response that may result from her comments."" The story began around 3:15 p.m. January 10, outside the school in Mount Carmel, a community of fewer than 6,000 people about 60 miles between both Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. That's where the girl and her friends, whom she ""loves,"" began talking about a ""princess"" bubble blower and a Hello Kitty bubble gun. The reason, she told the counselor, was that one of her friends likes princess toys and the other likes Hello Kitty. During this conversation, the kindergartner admitted she talked about shooting the bubble gun. Then she went home happy, positive and outgoing, just as she'd gone to school, her mother told the counselor. The next day, the girl was called in front of a teacher, according to Ficker. Then she sat down with a school administrator and, eventually, the principal. The subsequent suspension form, issued that day, lists another girl as a ""victim."" It doesn't elaborate on what happened, but it does mandate a 10-day out-of-school suspension or a ""medical/psychological evaluation given (the) nature of (the) offense."" On January 12, the suspended girl met with the counselor, both independently and with her mother The therapist wrote that he found no evidence or history of behavioral issues or poor parenting and determined ""it appears (the kindergartner) engages in positive peer relationships."" The counselor also noted that the child was aware of last month's deadly shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school that ended with 27 people -- including 20 children ages 6 and 7 -- dead. As to her own feelings about talking about shooting in her conversation with her classmates, the girl told the counselor, ""I didn't mean anything bad."" On January 14, the Mount Carmel Area Elementary principal issued a second suspension letter, which superseded the previous one. Noting no criminal complaint was made ""due to (the) ages of the children,"" she cut the suspension down to two days while changing the categorization of the incident from ""terroristic threat"" to ""threat to harm others."" Now that the girl has returned to school, her family has two goals, according to Ficker: to get an apology and to get the suspension expunged from her record in part so she can transfer to another school. The school system hasn't done so, though the lawyer said there is a meeting involving him, family members and school officials set up for January 30 on the matter.","A Pennsylvania school suspends a kindergarten girl for making a ""terroristic threat""

North Korea's public health agencies are ""regularly examining all people in order to rapidly confirm people suspicious of having contracted the disease and taking measures to treat them,"" KCNA reported. The report did not state explicitly that it was closing its borders to international tourists. It remains unclear if business travelers to North Korea will be affected. In recent years, North Korea has become an increasingly popular destination for international tourists, including Americans, despite a U.S. State Department warning not to travel there because of the recent detentions of its citizens. This is not the first time North Korea is restricting its borders because of disease concerns. In 2003, the country temporarily shut its borders as the SARS epidemic swept eastern Asia. Currently, there are no reported Ebola cases in Asia. Six West African countries, including Mali, have been hit by the virus, which the World Health Organization reported has killed more than 4,800 people. Most of the deaths have been in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. But fears about Ebola's spread have mounted since the infections of health care workers in the United States and Spain.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Brad Blauser lives in war-torn Baghdad, where he doesn't earn a paycheck and is thousands of miles from his family. But he has no intention of leaving anytime soon. Since 2005, Brad Blauser's Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids program has distributed nearly 650 free wheelchairs. For the past four years, the Dallas, Texas, native has been providing hope to hundreds of disabled Iraqi children and their families through the distribution of pediatric wheelchairs. ""Disabled children -- they're really the forgotten ones in this war,"" said Blauser, 43. ""They are often not seen in society."" Blauser arrived in Iraq as a civilian contractor in 2004, but quit that job last year to devote himself full time to his program, without compensation. Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year . ""There's no paycheck. It's not really safe here. But this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,"" he said. An estimated one in seven Iraqi children ages 2 to 14 lives with a disability, according to UNICEF. Illnesses such as Spina bifida, palsy and polio leave them unable to walk. Some parents carry their children every day. For these children and their families, limited access to health care has taken a toll. ""A number of families don't know what's wrong with their kid. There's not a doctor available for help [and] there's no pediatric wheelchair source in this country,"" Blauser said. Blauser first learned about this situation in 2005 through Maj. David Brown, a battalion surgeon. His friend shared heartbreaking accounts of helpless children pulling themselves along the ground, or living motionless in back rooms, too big to be moved long distances very often. ""So I asked him, 'What do you need?' "" Blauser recalled. ""And he surprised me by his answer: 'I need children's wheelchairs.' "" Blauser began researching and campaigning for help from friends and family in the United States. In 30 days, 31 pediatric and small adult wheelchairs arrived in Mosul for distribution to children in need. Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids was born. ""The experience for me in the first distribution was awesome,"" said Blauser. ""To see the smile come across their face and [to] look over at the mothers and fathers -- they've definitely been changed."" That's the case for 3-year-old Ali Khaled Ibrahim and his family. At 8 months old, Ali was struck by a mysterious fever that left him partially paralyzed. He cannot speak and experiences increasingly frequent and violent convulsions. ""Ali's handicap affected the family a lot,"" said his father. His mother said she couldn't carry out her daily chores and her ""psychological state worsened."" ""When I heard the news of the distribution of these advanced wheelchairs, I was very happy deep down,"" she said. ""I thought maybe that will ease my work as a mother in the way I deal with my son.""  Watch Ali and other children receive their wheelchairs from Blauser's group » . Today, Ali smiles at home as he sits in his new wheelchair. His siblings giggle and sprinkle his face with kisses. The toddler's parents are thankful for the relief it has brought not only to Ali, but their entire family. The boy is among hundreds of disabled Iraqi children to benefit from Blauser's generosity. Since 2005, Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids has distributed nearly 650 pediatric wheelchairs. To obtain the specialized chairs, Blauser partnered with Reach Out and Care Wheels, a nonprofit pediatric wheelchair organization in Montana. The organization provides wheelchairs designed for rough terrains in developing nations, making the devices ""perfect for this environment,"" said Blauser. Through sponsor donations, his group purchases the chairs from ROC Wheels for about $200 apiece, and USAID donates shipping. Members of the the U.S. and Iraqi armies, Iraqi police and border patrol work together to carry out the distributions. Blauser and his group help adjust the children into their wheelchairs, which fit their bodies as they grow.  Watch Blauser demonstrate the specialized wheelchair » . For Blauser, who provides part-time safety consulting in exchange for room and board, an initial plan to stay for one year has become a dream to get wheelchairs to every Iraqi child who wants one. And he's determined to see it through. ""By providing what they need, I'm hoping to start a movement to change the way people think about disabled children,"" said Blauser. ""They are not a curse, they are a blessing and they deserve to have their needs met."" Want to get involved?

"Would you rather have $1 to spend, or $1.49 billion? For winners in three states, all it took was a dollar to cash in and reap the rewards of Friday's record-setting Mega Millions jackpot. By picking the same winning numbers --  2, 4, 23, 38, 46 with a Mega Ball of 23 -- they earned an equal share of the $656 million jackpot, which amounts to about $218 million each, before taxes, under the annuity option. Lottery players dished out a cumulative $1,491,082,267 since the game's last big winner emerged in late January. Except for a few smaller payouts, all that worked out to next to nothing. ""Oh Mega Millions, why do you shun me?"" a Twitter user mused on the social networking site, echoing the angst felt by many nationwide as it dawned on them that they were among the losers. ""Dear news updates on my phone, stop rubbing it in that I didn't win the mega millions!!!"" said another. In fact, nearly as many dollars were spent on tickets Friday alone than ended up being given away. Kelly Cripe, a spokeswoman for Texas state lottery that is currently overseeing Mega Millions, said the day's sales in the 42 states plus the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, where the game is played, added up to $651,915,940. While lotteries are nothing new in the United States and beyond, the frenzy leading up to Friday night's drawing -- much like the jackpot itself, which was the largest pool potentially for any single winner -- was unprecedented. People stood in long lines at convenience stores, dreaming of what they'd buy, how they'd quit their jobs and how their lives would change with the help of Lady Luck. It ended up being a boon to many state coffers -- who reap some of the money from lottery sales -- not to mention those selling the tickets. At Manhattan Tobacco, a New York convenience store, cashier Alex Shanahe said that sales had tripled. ""Everybody wants to win the Mega Millions,"" Shanahe said before the drawing. Many came convinced that they could beat the roughly 176 million-to-one jobs and take home the prize. But only three did. They included a person who, around 7:15 p.m. Friday night, came to a 7-Eleven store in Baltimore, Maryland, and paid $1 for a ""quick pick"" of one line of numbers -- which ended up exactly matching those pulled less than four hours later. It's not know if the identity of that person will ever be known, as Maryland Lottery Director Stephen Martino noted that the state does not require its jackpot recipients to do publicity, as some other states do. Winners can also remain anonymous in Kansas, that state's lottery director Dennis Wilson said. Security officials know the precise location where the ticket was sold, but that information hadn't been released -- even to Wilson. The state lottery has only said the winning ticket came from somewhere in northeastern Kansas. And the town of Red Bud, Illinois, located about 35 miles south of St. Louis, was buzzing Saturday with news that one of its own bought a ticket at a Moto Mart. ""We're having a great time,"" the store manager, Denise Metzger, told CNN affiliate WGN. ""The people in town are having a good time trying to speculate who it is or hoping it's still them. The atmosphere has just been sensational."" While no one has yet stepped forward to claim the prize, Wilson had some advice for the winner or winners: Sign the back of the ticket. Put it someplace very safe. And talk to a lawyer before coming in for what will be a life-changing experience. While only three tickets hit the big jackpot, at least 42 matched five of six numbers -- 29 in California, 12 in Illinois and one in Kansas, according to lottery officials. California Lottery Commission spokesman Alex Traverso said the payout on those tickets will be about $125,000 to $130,000. Still, that's practically petty cash compared to the rewards reaped by the three still anonymous jackpot winners. Psychologist Scott Bea said if any one of them is a poor money manager and has been unhappy in life before winning, that's likely to continue. ""It solves one problem, but it creates a half-billion others,"" he said. ""You have about no chance at winning this, but it really gets people excited.""","Mega Millions tickets worth $651,915,940 were sold Friday, a lottery spokeswoman says .
That's more than 1/3 the $1,491,082,270 in sales since the previous winner .
The three big winners bought their tickets in Kansas, Maryland and Illinois .
That assures them an equal share of the $656 million jackpot ."
