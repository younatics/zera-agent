"(CNN) -- The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Wednesday named its latest inductees, adding talent such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 1960s singer-songwriter Donovan. The Beastie Boys, who have been blending hip-hop, punk and other genres since the 1980s, also made it onto the Hall of Fame's final list for 2012. So did Guns N' Roses, the hard rock standard bearers of the late '80s and early '90s, and Laura Nyro, the innovative pop songstress. Other artists inducted by the Hall under the performer category included the '60s British group The Small Faces -- best known for their psychedelic hit ""Itchycoo Park"" -- and their subsequent incarnation, The Faces, which featured Rod Stewart. ""It's quite a thrill and honor to make it in the Hall of Fame a second time,"" Stewart said in a statement. ""We (The Faces) were always synonymous with a good party, and with this list of fellow artists being inducted I'm looking forward to a true piss up ... and it's a hell of a good reason to reunite and celebrate with my old mates."" The Faces' Ronnie Wood added in a statement: ""Needless to say we are all very excited about this great honor. At the same time our thoughts go out to the late Steve Marriot -- who Rod and I greatly loved -- and of course to the much missed Ronnie Lane."" The Beastie Boys also expressed excitement. ""We're in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? That's ... crazy and awesome!"" the group said in an expletive-laced statement. ""While we are very proud of the music we make, we have to acknowledge the inspiration from our families, friends and musicians like the Slits, Bad Brains, X-ray Spex, the Treacherous Three and too many others to possibly name. And most of all, we give thanks to New York City and the world of musical influence it provided for us."" On his Twitter account, Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers commented: ""Those Crazy bastards at the hall of fame are putting us in this year?!! Howabout them apples! Seriously..I'm very humbled and grateful. Wow."" Slash, another inductee, also tweeted, ""Thanks for all the R&RHF mentions, Its quite an honor to be inducted. Cheers!"" The acts that made the final cut beat out competition from the likes of The Cure and Rufus with Chaka Khan, who had been among the nominees. The Hall of Fame singled out the music producer and promoter Don Kirshner for the nonperformer award. Kirshner, whose live TV rock show helped wean 1970s audiences off lip-synched programming, died in January. And it cited the guitarist Freddie King for his early influence on rock and roll. The induction ceremony will take place on April 14 in Cleveland, Ohio. CNN's Denise Quan and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Others on the final list are Donovan, Guns N' Roses, The Small Faces and Laura Nyro .

"(CNN) -- Job hopping has become routine for professionals even in this poor economy. In fact, the average American will have about nine jobs between the ages of 18 and 32 reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Employees are so focused on finding their dream job right now that they fail to realize that having multiple jobs in just a few years can actually hurt their careers. Many high-potential and ambitious employees don't stay long enough at a position to give it a chance and to gain the necessary skills and maturity required to succeed in business. It's imperative that professionals start to view companies as career incubators instead of time wasters. Spending twenty years at a single company isn't likely these days -- nor is having a secure nine-to-five job -- but leaving a company after six months can do more harm than good. How to customize your career . I learned that building a career within a company can be an asset. I had three different positions at EMC Corporation within three years. I gathered new skills, expanded my network and got a better sense of the company based on my experiences. More importantly, I learned a lot about myself in the process. If I had jumped to three different companies during that time frame, I would have had to rebuild my network, visibility and go through months of additional training for each job. It can take up to six months just to adapt to a new work environment! Employers want to see your progression at a company, whether it's up or across an organization. There's nothing wrong with making a lateral move into a different business function. If you believe in your company's mission and enjoy being around your co-workers, you will naturally stay longer. ""I've always believed in longevity in a company when you work for good people and have a job that you truly believe in,"" says Maranda Gibson, an Account Manager with AccuConference. If you don't fit in your corporate culture, you may have a negative attitude, which could be hazardous to your career. It's imperative that you do your homework during the interview process before you're hired so you don't force yourself into a bad situation. Are CEOs: Burning bright or just burning out? Professionals have numerous reasons for departing a company, including corporate downsizing, insufficient career opportunities, and a desire to either get an advanced degree or switch to another field completely. Companies can retain employees longer by supporting their value systems, giving them meaningful work, becoming a social company and understanding generational differences. They want to know that they have a long-term career path at a company. Elcio Barcelos, a Vice President of Global Staffing at HP confirms this by saying that ""companies need to be able to provide diverse career paths for individuals today."" Although companies may need to soften their stricter policies, such as blocking social networks at work, employees need to get their attitude in check! They also need to be proactive when managing their careers by asking for challenging projects and expanding their portfolio of skills and contacts. ""My advice when talking to employees is to approach your job with a good attitude and don't be afraid to take on new roles or projects,"" said Carlos Dominguez, a vice president in Cisco's Office of the Chairman & CEO. You can no longer sit back and wait for work to come to you -- you need to chase the work. Take advantage of the resources at your company so that you can have a more fulfilling experience and can leverage your skills and contacts for new roles within your company. Job hopping can look terrible on a resume because you appear disloyal. Employers will think that you didn't give your last job a chance and that you weren't able to acquire the necessary experience. If you move from job to job early in your career, it can leave a lasting impression. On the other hand, if you stick it out at a company for at least two years, management will be more willing to invest in you and you will increase your ""reputation capital,"" as Barcelos says. You always need to evolve by learning new areas of the business and by showing your management that you have leadership potential. By staying longer at your job, it can differentiate you too. ""There is always something refreshing about interviewing somebody who has been with a company five, eight or more years,"" Barcelos explains. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Schawbel.","Many employees don't stay long enough at a job to gain valuable skills, says Dan Schawbel .
Professionals should view companies as career incubators instead of time wasters .
Believing in your company's mission and corporate culture can add longevity to a job .
Sticking at a company for at least two years means it will be more willing to invest in you ."
"(CNN) -- The political party of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been granted permission to register for future elections in Myanmar, according to Suu Kyi's lawyer. Nyan Win, who is also spokesman for the National League for Democracy party, told CNN that Myanmar's electoral commission granted the permission, and the NLD party will formally submit its registration ""as early as next week."" The NLD won more than 80% of the legislative seats in 1990 -- the first free elections in the country in nearly 30 years -- but the ruling military junta refused to recognize the results. The party announced last month that it had decided to re-enter politics in Myanmar, also known as Burma, and that Suu Kyi will run in the next parliamentary elections, as yet unscheduled. Ruled by that junta since 1962, Myanmar is now under a new president, a former general elected in March of this year. The new government freed dozens of political prisoners in October following the earlier release of Nobel Peace Laureate Suu Kyi. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.","Aung San Suu Kyi's party says it will formally register as early as next week .

"(CNN) -- Syria faced additional sanctions from its Arab League neighbors Monday unless it agreed to allow international observers into the country to monitor an agreement to end a months-old crackdown on anti-government protesters. As a midnight Sunday (5 p.m. ET) deadline passed, there was no immediate indication that Syrian officials had responded to the ultimatum. Syria's state-run news agency said the country could withstand sanctions already imposed by the Arab League and by neighboring Turkey, and human rights and opposition groups said at least 22 more people were killed as the clampdown continued. Over the weekend, Arab League officials meeting in the Qatari capital Doha responded to requests by Damascus for some clarifications to the plan, but did not make any key changes, according to Qatar's foreign minister, Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani. Ministers agreed over the weekend to freeze the assets of more top Syrian officials, reduce flights in and out of the country by half and impose a complete ban on weapons shipments to Syria, a statement from the Arab League said. ""You saw yesterday human rights abuses, and this keeps building up,"" al-Thani said over the weekend. ""Our mission is that none of these abuses continue anywhere in the Arab states, including Syria."" He warned that the Syrian crisis could be ""internationalized"" unless the government of Bashar al-Assad complies with a deal to end its clampdown on opposition. Syria agreed in November to halt all violence, release all detainees, withdraw all security forces from populated areas and allow unfettered access to the nation by journalists and Arab League monitors -- but opposition groups say assaults by government troops and police have continued, and no monitors have been put in place. The Arab League responded by announcing economic sanctions in late November. But Ahmed Hamoudi, general coordinator of the Egypt-based Syrian Revolution Coordination, expressed skepticism about whether the sanctions would help end al-Assad's 11-year rule. ""The economic sanctions by the Arab League serve a good purpose of pressuring the Syrian regime and weakening it, but I don't think the Arab League will be able to fulfill the political ambitions of the Syrians -- and that is to topple the Assad regime,"" Hamoudi said. ""We want to see the Syrian file taken to the U.N. Security Council and more immediate measures on the ground, like a no-fly zone and a buffer zone at the Turkish border."" The United Nations estimates that more than 4,000 people have died since mid-March, and the death toll continues to rise. The Local Coordinating Committees of Syria, an opposition umbrella group, said 22 people had been killed Sunday. All but one of the deaths occurred in the city of Homs, the scene of much of the recent unrest, the group said. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the toll at 40, including five soldiers who had defected and taken up arms against the government. The deaths included 26 in Homs, three in the suburbs of Damascus and six in Idlib, near the Turkish border. An opposition website based in Idlib reported clashes between military defectors and Syrian troops on a highway. Two defectors and an army colonel were killed, the website said. CNN could not independently confirm the accounts, since the Syrian government has limited access to the country by international reporters. Arab League sanctions already imposed in November include cutting ties with Syria's central bank, banning high-profile Syrian officials from visiting Arab nations and freezing the assets of the Syrian government, according to a senior league official who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. In a statement issued late Sunday, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said the nation would survive the sanctions being imposed on it by its neighbors. ""Although they will affect the livelihood of Syrian citizens, Syria will overcome those sanctions by virtue of its strategic location and the diversity of its production sectors,"" the news agency said. And it said Damascus was ending a free-trade agreement with Turkey and slapping a tariff on Turkish goods imported into Syria in retaliation for sanctions Turkey has imposed. The number of deaths across Syria has reached at least 4,000 since the crackdown began in mid-March and could be much higher, Navi Pillay, U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said Thursday. The uprising against al-Assad began in February. Demonstrations have continued across the country, with protesters demanding his ouster and democratic elections. CNN's Saad Abedine, Yasmin Amer and Rima Maktabi contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Our mission is that none of these abuses continue anywhere,"" Qatar's FM says .

"(CNN) -- It wasn't until his senior year of high school in North Carolina that Monji Dolon found out about his murky immigration status. His family had emigrated from Bangladesh in 1991 when Dolon was 5 years old and since then Dolon, his mother and his brother have lived without legal residency in the United States. Uncertain of what to check under ""residency"" on his college applications, Dolon learned at the age of 18 that he was in an ongoing battle to stay in the country he had grown up in. ""I remember having a huge sense of panic at the time,"" say Dolon, now 25. The Department of Homeland Security announced reforms this year that would halt the deportations of young immigrants who pose no threat to security. It said it also would review almost 300,000 cases on an individual basis -- something it had not been done before. Individuals without a criminal record are considered low priority for forced or immediate deportation. But without permanent relief, many like Monji Dolon are still in immigration limbo. Both Dolon and his older brother, Sahid Limon, recently received a ""stay of removal."" This allows them to temporarily stay in the country but without an exact timeline or a plan of action. ""Once we heard about our stay of removal, I was happy but not really excited because I'm tired and it's not a permanent solution,"" Dolon says. He is facing a situation that many young immigrants confront if their parents come to the U.S. illegally. Many say they don't have a clear map to becoming legal residents in the country they've grown up in. The Migration Policy Institute, a nonprofit think tank, estimates that more than 2.1 million adolescents and young adults are in this category. Dolon and his brother came to the United States after their mother, Tahera Islam, felt it would be unsafe for them to stay in Bangladesh. She was an active member of an opposition party in Bangladesh and received several threats from the majority party supporters. That's when she decided to seek political asylum elsewhere. ""I wanted to go to a free country -- I was scared,"" she says. Dolon says he didn't realize the seriousness of the situation until he received a rejection letter after applying at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The letter said the university would be unable to admit him due to his immigration status. Determined to move forward, he met with university administrators, who finally agreed to admit him as an international student without any financial aid or scholarships. Under ordinary circumstances, a student with Dolon's grades would qualify for financial aid and perhaps even scholarships. But any possibility he had for such was lost due to his residency status. Since graduating from UNC in 2008, Dolon has been working as a freelance web designer and computer programmer. He says he's been unable to take on a fulltime job even though he's had several offers -- including one from a start-up in California's Silicon Valley -- because his immigration status wouldn't allow it. Frustrated, Dolon wrote a letter to the office of Sen. Dick Durbin's, D-Illinois, describing his situation. Durbin shared Dolon's story on the Senate floor earlier this year as a way to drum up support for the Dream Act -- an initiative that would legalize young immigrants who have been in the country for more than five years if they attend college or serve in the military. Durbin alluded to Dolon's achievements and talent in the technology field saying ""we could use people with Monji's talent in America."" By 2009, Dolon's family had already gone through four different lawyers to help them apply for legal status with no avail. Having spent tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, and feeling like they had exhausted all of their resources, they made plans to leave for Bangladesh because they were constantly facing deportation notices. As a final desperate attempt, Dolon's father, who had obtained residency years ago with a different visa than the rest of his family, decided to hire a lawyer in New York. The lawyer advised the family not to leave because it would complicate their chances of ever returning to the United States. With that, the family canceled their plane tickets -- losing half of the money -- and hired that lawyer. Nine months later, the family received a letter from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services telling them that while immigration officials sympathized with their situation, they would be unable to take any legal action. In July 2011, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers took Sahid Limon into detention. He had no past criminal record and was eventually released a few weeks later and given the ""stay of removal."" ""The current immigration laws in the U.S. are one of many rules but little justice,"" says Marty Rosenbluth, a pro bono immigration lawyer in North Carolina who started working on Monji Dolon's case last summer. ""It's very difficult if not impossible for many people to get legal status."" Despite recent immigration reforms, Dolon and his family members live with the fear that they could be asked to leave at any time. Dolon is currently freelancing with a start-up company in California as a web designer and programmer. He's been unable to accept an offered full-time position with the company because he hasn't been able to obtain a work visa. As of now, Dolon's and Limon's ""stay of removal"" is set to expire next summer. It's uncertain whether or not they'll be able to renew it. Though exhausted from the battle, Dolon says it would be very difficult to leave everyone he's ever known behind -- but adds that very little is in his hands. ""It's not something I can or could've fixed right now. It's something I've been trying to fight,"" he says.","Monji Dolon came to the United States from Bangladesh when he was 5 years old .

"(CNN) -- Scores of emergency personnel on Thursday helped battle a fire that burned a docked Russian nuclear submarine, state media reported. Wooden scaffolding caught fire Thursday afternoon at a repair dock in Roslyakovo, which is in the Murmansk region in northwest Russia along the Barents Sea, the official Itar-Tass and RIA-Novosti news agencies reported. The flames spread to hull of the nuclear submarine Yekaterinburg, where work had been underway. About 100 emergency personnel responded, using 40 pieces of firefighting and other equipment to spray foam and water to douse the blaze, the regional emergency ministry said according to Itar-Tass. Gov. Dmitry Dmitrienko said that the submarine's nuclear reactors were then shut down and there was no threat of radiation spreading, the news agency reported. Capt. Vadim Sega, a spokesman for Russia's northern fleet, added that the fire never penetrated the hull and got inside the ship. ""There is no possibility of fire burning through the hull, and no threat to on-board equipment,"" Sega said Thursday, according to RIA-Novosti. The emergency ministry said Thursday that there had been no injuries, reported this news agency. The nuclear sub, itself, was partially submerged to minimize damage. The fire continued into Friday despite initial reports it had been extinguished, Itar-Tass reported. By 1:40 a.m., (4:40 p.m. ET Thursday), the blaze had been ""localized,"" Russian Emergency Minister Sergei Shoigu said. One of seven Delta-IV class submarines in operation, the Yekaterinburg carries 16 ballistic missiles.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has conceded the London club's bid to win a first English Premier League title since 2004 is over following Sunday's 1-0 defeat at table-topping Manchester City. A second-half goal from Spain midfielder David Silva was enough to send City back above arch-rivals Manchester United at the summit, 12 points ahead of Arsenal in fifth position. ""Unfortunately for us it was a match that we couldn't afford to lose because it puts us too much behind City,"" the Frenchman told the Premier League's official website. ""If we had won the game we would have come back to six points, but at the moment we're too far behind. It will be very difficult to close the gap now but we will try."" Arsenal had won seven of the last eight league games prior to defeat at the Etihad Stadium, climbing back into contention for a top-four finish and a place in the European Champions League. It followed a disastrous start to the season which saw the 13-time English champions hammered 8-2 by United in addition to suffering defeats to Blackburn, Liverpool and north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur in their first seven games. ""This was a match we couldn't afford to lose and that's why it's difficult to take,"" Wenger said. ""On the other hand we will continue to fight and there are a lot of positives. ""We have made a lot of progress since August and the team can be proud of that. The way we played is encouraging, but at the moment we need encouragement and points, and we only got encouragement."" Arsenal faced a defensive injury crisis ahead of Sunday's match as injuries to the Andre Santos, Kieran Gibbs, Bacary Sagna and Carl Jenkinson left Wenger without a fit fullback. ""I must say we have four fullbacks out and the first injury we get in the game is a fullback. It's not only down to resources, you cannot buy 17 fullbacks anyway. ""That's why I think we've been a bit unlucky. But I think it was a match that could've gone both ways. It was very intense with both teams going for it and I feel we were a bit unfortunate.""

"(CNN) -- The United States and Russia were absent Wednesday as representatives from countries from around the world gathered to sign a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs. French troops examine cluster bombs collected after the Lebanon conflict of 2006. Some 111 countries were due to adopt the Convention on Cluster Munitions at an all-day signing ceremony in Oslo, Norway. But four of the biggest cluster bomb makers -- Russia, China, Israel and the United States, which claims the devices are a vital part of its defense strategy, stayed away. Cluster Munition Coalition activists behind the agreement expressed disappointment at the absence of the big four, but insisted it wouldn't undermine the treaty as it passes into international law. ""Obviously it's very disappointing that those countries aren't here, but at the same time, the strong message that this treaty sends will make it very clear to those countries that these are unacceptable weapons and inappropriate in future conflicts,"" CMC Co-Chair Richard Moyes told CNN from Oslo. ""The treaty and the stigma that it builds will make it practically and politically much more difficult for them to use these weapons again in the future,"" Moyes added about the absent countries. ""Many of their partners will no longer be allowed to use these weapons, and clearly recognize these weapons as far too costly in humanitarian terms."" Cluster munitions, which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets, are described by the International Committee of the Red Cross as a ""persistent humanitarian problem."" Most of a device's bomblets are meant to explode on impact, but many do not. Credible estimates show the weapons fail between 10 and 40 percent of the time, leaving civilians at risk of harm from unexploded ordnance, the ICRC says. In addition to calling for a total, immediate ban of the weapons, the Oslo accord calls for strong standards to protect those injured. It urges that contaminated areas be cleaned up quickly and weapons immediately destroyed, the CMC said. The agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years, said Thomas Nash, coordinator of the Cluster Munition Coalition. Earlier this year, a U.S. State Department representative called it ""an absolute moral obligation"" to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after battle, but the insists cluster munitions are an important part of its defense strategy that can be regulated post-conflict. During the 34-day war in Lebanon in 2006, the United Nations estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets, 1 million of which may not have exploded, according to the ICRC. More than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern Lebanon since the war ended. Cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in Kosovo. In more than 20 countries, according to the ICRC, cluster bombs have created lasting ""no-go"" areas, rendering them as dangerous as minefields. Laos is the most affected country. Millions of bomblets dropped during the Vietnam War continue to kill civilians more than three decades later.","United States, Russia absent from signing of cluster bomb ban treaty signing .

"(CNN) -- John Terry shrugged off his off-field problems to save Chelsea from a damaging defeat by English Premier League rivals Tottenham on Thursday. The England captain was named to lead his club a day after being charged by police for alleged racial abuse, and made a crucial goal-line clearance in time added on to secure a 1-1 draw. Defeat would have left Chelsea five points behind their third-placed London rivals, but the result kept the battle for European Champions League places finely poised as the season nears the halfway stage. The build-up to the match was dominated by confirmation of Terry's February 1 court case for remarks he allegedly made to Queens Park Rangers player Anton Ferdinand. ""Since the situation he has improved,"" said Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas, who called the result a ""moral win."" ""He has grown in terms of performance. He's a reference point for this team. It shows his character and strength and personality. His effort for the collective is extraordinary."" Racism rows damage brand of the 'beautiful game' Aware of a potential powder-keg atmosphere, home team Tottenham warned fans that ground stewards would be wearing head cams to record any inappropriate behavior. Spurs made the perfect start when Emmanuel Adebayor scored his ninth league goal this season in the eighth minute, forcing home Gareth Bale's low cross after teammate Sandro stole the ball from Daniel Sturridge near halfway. Sturridge wasted a golden chance to level soon after, but the 22-year-old striker made amends in the 23rd minute when he buried Ashley Cole's cross -- a goal that left Spurs furious as the England leftback appeared to control the ball with his hand. Sturridge's veteran forward partner Didier Drogba nearly made it 2-1 on the half hour but hit the post after chesting down a cross and firing in a fierce left-foot shot. Footballers are TV stars, and should act like it . On-loan Manchester City striker Adebayor had the ball in the net again just before the hour, but it was ruled out for offside. Villas-Boas brought on $80 million striker Fernando Torres with 13 minutes to play, but it was former Chelsea defender William Gallas -- who scored a winner against Tottenham in 2006 -- who next went closest to scoring as he volleyed a good chance wide. Midfielder Ramires wasted a free header at the other end, and it looked like Chelsea would pay for the Brazilian's miss when Bale put Adebayor clear on goal -- but Terry came to the rescue to clear the Togo international's low shot after goalkeeper Petr Cech was beaten. The draw lifted Chelsea onto 33 points, 11 behind leaders Manchester City and one above fifth-placed Arsenal. Spurs go into the December 26 Boxing Day fixtures in the club's best position this century, but still nine points behind City. In Spain, Barcelona and Valencia cruised into the last 16 of the Copa del Rey, joining holders Real Madrid in the next round. Club World Cup champions Barca thrashed fourth division L'Hospitalet 9-0, as a trio of 20-year-olds -- midfielder Thiago Alcantara and strikers Isaac Cuenca and Cristian Tello -- all scored twice. First-team regulars Pedro Rodriguez, Andre Iniesta and Xavi also netted in a win that gave the Catalan side a 10-0 aggregate scoreline. Valencia surprisingly drew the first leg at lower league Cadiz 0-0, but scored four unanswered goals on Thursday to go through as defender Victor Ruiz, strikers Jonas and Roberto Soldado were on target before midfielder Ever Banega wrapped it up.","John Terry's late goal-line clearance earns Chelsea a 1-1 draw at Tottenham .

"Washington (CNN) -- The symbolic ""Doomsday Clock"" scientists use to portray what they feel is the risk from nuclear holocaust has moved a minute closer to midnight. The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists made the adjustment in reaction to an increased risk of weapons proliferation, the failure of a nuclear power plant in Japan, and terrorist threats to use ""dirty bombs"" with stolen atomic material. The clock was moved to five minutes before midnight after a symposium where experts presented their reasoning and risk assessment. It had been at six minutes before midnight since January 2010, when scientists moved the hand back, reflecting a decreased risk of nuclear proliferation. ""Two years ago, it appeared that world leaders might address the truly global threats we face,"" said Allison Macfarlane, who chairs the group's science and security board. ""In many cases, this trend has not continued or has been reversed. For that reason, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists is moving the clock one minute closer to midnight, back to it's time in 2007."" The group, in announcing the decision Tuesday at a news conference, said in a news release that one factor was the question of nuclear weapons management ""in a world of increasing economic, political and environmental volatility."" Nuclear weapons are one of several issues that determine the setting of the Doomsday Clock. Atomic energy also contributed to the higher risk represented by moving the clock ahead one minute. But the group declined to take a position on the future viability of nuclear energy, just its existing threat to human survival, including the diversion of atomic material for weapons production. Kennette Benedict, the group's executive director, told reporters that even after more than 60 years of the scientists assessing nuclear risk, ""it remains to be seen whether the safety and the proliferation risks can be addressed in a way that really is acceptable to people."" ""Management issues, rather than technical issues, seemed to have been the problem in Fukushima,"" said Lawrence Krauss, who co-chairs an executive board with the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. He said the disaster in Japan represented a broader political lack of will to ensure safe global energy. ""The need to act is urgent,"" he said, saying action also is needed against the factors scientists believe cause global warming. ""Climate change is happening,"" Krauss said, listing it among the risk factors in the Doomsday Clock announcement. ""It's happening now, it's measurable, and it's clearly related to human activity, and the need to react becomes more urgent."" The Doomsday Clock was established in 1947 by scientists who helped develop the first atomic weapons in the Manhattan Project. The countdown to catastrophe has grown to reflect the risk to humanity and the planet not just from nuclear weapons, but also from a broad range of possible sources.","NEW: ""The need to act is urgent"" in a range of problem areas, one scientist says .

"Beijing (CNN) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner met Chinese leaders on Wednesday with discussions expected to focus on cooperation between the world's top two economies to bolster global growth as well as possible sanctions on Iranian oil exports. Geithner held talks Wednesday with Vice President Xi Jinping â€” tipped to become China's next president later this yearâ€” and Vice Premier Li Keqiang. He was scheduled to meet Prime Minister Wen Jiabao later Wednesday. Geithner met with his counterpart, Vice Premier Wang Qishan, on Tuesday night and pledged cooperation on global economic issues. China and the United States ""have a lot of issues to talk about in the areas of economy, finance, trade and investment,"" Wang said at a news briefing on Tuesday. While China has called on the United States to loosen export regulations, Washington has said that Chinese currency controls keep the yuan undervalued and give Chinese exporters an unfair advantage at a time when the global economy is suffering. In Geithner's meeting with Vice Presiden Xi on Wednesday morning, he emphasized the expansion of trade and investment with China. ""We are looking forward to exploring opportunities to expand our exports to China and to strengthen and deepen our cooperation with China on a broad range of economic and strategic issues we face around the world,"" said Geithner. ""On economic growth, financial stability around the world, on nonproliferation, we have what we view as a very strong cooperative relationship with your government and we are looking forward to building on that."" Tensions between Tehran and Western powers over possible sanctions on Iranian oil were also expected to be on the agenda in Beijing. Iran threatened in late December to block the Strait of Hormuz if sanctions were imposed on its oil exports. France, Britain and Germany have all proposed such sanctions to punish Iran for lack of cooperation on its nuclear program. The strait is a critical shipping lane, through which 17 million barrels of oil passed per day in 2011, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. China relies on imports for half of the oil it consumes, buying nearly one-third of Iran's oil exports. Beijing has said that its imports have nothing to do with Tehran's nuclear program and rejects new U.S sanctions on foreign financial institutions that conduct business with the Central Bank of Iran. China, the world's biggest energy consumer, has supported U.N. sanctions on Iran's nuclear program, but says the decisions should be multilateral. Wen is scheduled to visit the oil-rich regions of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar this coming weekend, China's foreign ministry said Tuesday. Despite the high-level meetings, experts say China is unlikely to budge on the most sensitive issues anytime soon, especially with Washington's recent military strategy report that focuses on Beijing's economic power as a potential threat to U.S. security. ""China wants to cooperate with the U.S., but one visit by Geithner is not going to make a huge difference,"" said Zhao Kejin, a professor at Tsinghua University's Institute of International Studies. ""Currency, trade and Iran are huge issues that require more in-depth dialogue before we see results."" After his meetings in China, Geithner will travel to Japan and hold talks with Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and Finance Minister Jun Azumi on Thursday.","NEW: Geithner emphasizes expanding trade and investment .

"(CNN) -- The company that owns Victoria's Secret vowed a full investigation Thursday after a report said cotton used in some of its products is grown using child labor. ""We are very concerned,"" parent company Limited Brands said in a statement, noting that the cotton in question, which comes from the West African nation of Burkina Faso, is ""used in a small portion of our Victoria's Secret panty styles."" ""If this allegation is true, it describes behavior that is contrary to our company's values and the code of labor and sourcing standards that we require all of our suppliers to meet,"" the statement said. ""These standards expressly prohibit child labor."" The company said it immediately ""began working with key stakeholders internally and externally to fully investigate this matter. Depending on the findings, we are prepared to take swift action to prevent the illegal use of child labor in the fields where we source Fairtrade-certified organic cotton in Burkina Faso."" Victoria's Secret, known for its underwear and lingerie, describes itself as ""one of the most powerful, sexy and glamorous stores in the world."" Its fashion show recently aired in more than 90 countries. The statement from Ohio-based Limited Brands on Thursday followed an extensive report from Bloomberg that describes the life of a 13-year-old-girl who is beaten by the farmer she works for on a cotton field in Burkina Faso. The cotton picked by the girl went to factories in other countries, ""where it was fashioned into Victoria's Secret underwear,"" the report said. While forced labor and child labor are not new to African farms, Bloomberg noted, the girl works on a farm certified as organic and fair trade. Such farms ""should be free of such practices,"" the report said. ""Perversely,"" the article said, the lucrative premiums paid for organic and fair-trade cotton have ""created fresh incentives for exploitation. The program has attracted subsistence farmers who say they don't have the resources to grow fair-trade cotton without violating a central principle of the movement: forcing other people's children into their fields. "" The report cited the leader of Burkina Faso's organic and fair-trade program and the head of fair-trade organization Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation as saying that Victoria's Secret purchased all of Burkina Faso's organic crop from last season. A report earlier this year from the U.S. Labor Department found that child labor is used in cotton production in more than a dozen countries, including Burkina Faso. A press attache for the Burkina Faso Embassy in the United States had no immediate comment Thursday. In its statement Thursday, Limited Brands said that in 2007, it ""established a pilot program to purchase Fairtrade-certified organic cotton from primarily women farmers in Burkina Faso, a landlocked country in West Africa that struggles with endemic poverty. We were committed to this initiative because of its potential to generate life-changing opportunities for some of the world's poorest women."" The ""Charter of Fair Trade Principles,"" published in 2009 by the World Fair Trade Organization and Fairtrade International, states that the rights of children are to be respected. ""The importance of children's involvement in the work of family-based production units, and the learning of skills required for their working life is recognized, but any involvement must be disclosed and monitored and must not adversely affect the child's well-being, security, educational opportunities and need for play,"" it says.","A Bloomberg report says fair-trade cotton has brought ""fresh incentives for exploitation""

"London (CNN) -- You watched the royal wedding. You admired Catherine's dress. Now, you have a chance to get close to it. The Duchess of Cambridge's widely acclaimed ivory and white satin-gazar dress, designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, goes on display at Buckingham Palace next month, according to the Royal Collection press office. Tourists will be able to view the dress, as well as the royal wedding cake, during the annual Summer Opening, which runs from July 23 through October 3. The 1977 Rolls-Royce Phantom VI in which the Duchess of Cambridge traveled to Westminster Abbey, and the 1902 State Landau carriage used by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to travel along the processional route to Buckingham Palace, are already on public display at the palace, the Royal Collection says. Prince William and Duchess Catherine will set up their own temporary London home this summer as well, just a few miles away, at Kensington Palace, according to Clarence House, the office of Prince Charles and his family. William and Catherine will move to Kensington at some point in June or July, royal sources tell CNN. The sources won't say which home on the palace grounds the couple is moving into, but it is not William's childhood home there. The couple is considering alternatives for a more permanent home for when they visit London, Clarence House said. The couple will retain their main home on the Welsh island of Anglesey, and their offices at St. James Palace, Clarence House said.

"(CNN) -- Four-time NBA All-Star Chris Paul has been traded from the New Orleans Hornets to join the Los Angeles Clippers in a deal that sends Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu and Chris Kaman in the opposite direction. As part of the deal for the point guard, the Clippers have also given the Hornets a first-round pick in the 2012 draft. The Hornets were eager to trade Paul, with the 26-year-old's contract due to expire at the end of the forthcoming season. NBA commissioner David Stern was required to approve the deal due to the fact that the Hornets are owned by the league. New Orleans general manager Dell Demps was on the verge of sealing a trade last week which would have seen Paul head to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the NBA vetoed a three-team deal claiming the Hornets could do better. ""We wanted to make sure that we got the best possible deal for a player of Chris' caliber, and we feel great about the outcome,"" Jac Sperling, appointed by Stern as governor of the Hornets after the league acquired the team in December 2010, told the NBA's official website. The Clippers' franchise has been largely a losing one over the years and has been in the shadow of the long-successful Lakers, who have been champions 17 times to their local rivals' none. Paul's presence is expected to invigorate the team. He has been in the NBA for six years, leading the league in steals on four occasions, and will be paired with Blake Griffin, last year's NBA Rookie of the Year. The North Carolina-born star averaged 18.1 points and 2.7 rebounds in three years with the Hornets. Last season, Paul played in 80 games averaging 15.9 points, 9.8 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 2.4 steals. Shooting guard Gordon heads to New Orleans after three years in Los Angeles, while 21-year-old Aminu played his rookie year with the Clippers last season. Center Kaman was an All-Star in 2010 and spent eight years at the Staples Center.","Point guard Chris Paul has left the New Orleans Hornets to join the LA Clippers .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City moved three points clear at the top of the English Premier League with a convincing 3-0 home win over sixth-placed Liverpool on Tuesday. Goals from Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and a James Milner penalty put City ahead of second-placed local rivals Manchester United, who visit Newcastle on Wednesday. Roberto Mancini's men survived the second-half dismissal of Gareth Barry in the 73rd minute, and even added to their tally as Martin Skrtel pulled down Toure and Milner converted from the spot. It completed a miserable evening for Liverpool, who were missing striker Luis Suarez after club officials confirmed before the match they would not appeal his eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra. Liverpool decide against Suarez appeal . City suffered a shock 1-0 defeat at Sunderland on Sunday, but went ahead after just 10 minutes as Argentina star Aguero beat Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina with a dipping shot he might have saved. Liverpool pressed hard for an equalizer, but fell further behind on 33 minutes as the excellent Toure headed home David Silva's corner at the near post. Reds manager Kenny Dalglish introduced Steven Gerrard and Craig Bellamy from the bench in the second half, but it was to no avail as City continued to control the match even when a man light. City captain Vincent Kompany said his team had shown great character after the Sunderland defeat. ""It was massive for us, we didn't deserve to lose against Sunderland but we were incredibly efficient today,"" Kompany told Sky Sports. In Tuesday's other games, third-placed Tottenham Hotspur beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 while Sunderland continued to impress under new manager Martin O'Neill with a 4-1 win at struggling Wigan. Tottenham moved to within three points of United after striker Jermain Defoe scored the only goal on 63 minutes at White Hart Lane.

"(CNN) -- The World Health Organization on Friday reported 2,500 confirmed cases of swine flu in 25 countries, with 44 deaths from the disease. A researcher investigates swine flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. In the United States, the total number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus, as swine flu is officially called, nearly doubled to 1,639 from the day before, with reports coming from 43 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The U.S. Navy said Friday that 12 crew members aboard the USS Dubuque have been diagnosed with swine flu. The amphibious transport dock ship had been due to deploy on June 1 to the South Pacific on a humanitarian mission, Cmdr. Joseph Surette, a Navy spokesman, said Tuesday. The ship was being scrubbed and disinfected, and its remaining 370 crew members were given Tamiflu as a precaution, Surette said. Navy officials said the ship could still be deployed in an emergency, but would remain in port in San Diego, California, until commanders determine the crew is suitable to deploy. Dr. Sylvie Briand, acting director of the Global Influenza Program for the World Health Organization, said the agency will remain at pandemic alert level 5 -- one step away from its highest level -- because while there are an increasing number of cases, there is no evidence of the community transmission outside North America that would push the alert to level 6. Of the 44 deaths reported, two were in the United States and 42 in Mexico, which has the highest concentration of swine flu cases, with more than 1,100. President Obama, speaking on the H1N1 virus during a town hall meeting for Latinos, said Americans should continue to take basic precautions such as frequently washing their hands. He also said the country should prepare for a particularly tough flu season this fall. ""The virus may not have been as virulent as we once feared, but we're not out of the woods yet,"" Obama said. Briand of WHO said many of the new cases being reported are imported -- returning travelers bringing them into their countries -- and cases resulting from close contact with those already infected, such as family members. Meanwhile, Britain's health secretary announced Friday that his country's Health Protection Agency has sequenced the full genetic code of the H1N1 virus, the first step in producing a European prototype of a swine flu vaccine. ""This is critical in understanding how the virus operates and identifying the crucial parts of the virus that can be used in vaccine manufacture,"" said a statement from the agency. ""Researchers hope that European manufacturers will be able to take delivery of candidate vaccine prototypes in the coming months so preliminary steps to mass vaccine production can begin,"" the statement said.","World Health Organization reports 44 deaths in Mexico and the United States .

"Washington (CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden has ""condemned."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton scolded -- and then leaked the scolding. On background, U.S. aides fret that the Israeli announcement of new settlement construction may thwart resumption of the peace process. Let me advance an unorthodox opinion: The most dangerous cause of instability in the Middle East is the so-called peace process itself. I know this is an unusual point of view. Please hear me out. By my count, there have been at least 10 major outbursts of violence between Jews and Arabs in the Middle East since 1936. Every one of these conflicts ended in a similar way. Either outside powers imposed a ceasefire -- or else Israel halted military operations just before a ceasefire could be imposed. Every one of these conflicts began in a similar way, too: with a renewed attack by the Arab side, or else (as in 1956 or 1967) by Arab violations of the terms of the previous armistice or ceasefire. Think for a minute how unusual this is. Wars usually end when one side or the other decides it cannot continue fighting. The losing side accepts terms it had formerly deemed unacceptable because the alternative -- continued fighting -- seems even worse. I doubt many Hungarians are delighted to have lost more than half their territory to neighbors in Romania and the former Yugoslavia. Bolivians still remember the loss of their Pacific coast to Chile in 1884. Some in Indonesia continue to regard East Timor as rightfully theirs. Yet for the most part, these nations have reconciled themselves to these unwelcome outcomes. Exactly the opposite has occurred in the Arab-Israeli dispute. Egypt lost the Sinai Peninsula in 1956, but got it back. It lost the Sinai again in 1967, and again recovered it (although this time the right way, after signing a formal peace). Syria lost the Golan in 1967, attacked Israel in 1973, lost again -- and still demands the return of the territory. Palestinians rejected the 1947 partition, resorted to war, lost, and to this day demand compensation for their losses. It's like a game of roulette where the management stops the game whenever you begin losing too badly, with promises to refund your money as soon as it conveniently can. What gambler could resist returning to the tables? I understand why Western governments have acted as they have. They have feared that unless they somehow smooth the situation, the world oil market will be upset and radical ideologies will spread through the Islamic world. What they don't see is that their efforts to contain the problem have in fact aggravated it. Imagine this alternative history: . Suppose that the Western world had not intervened in 1949. Suppose the Israeli war of independence had been fought to the bitter end: Arab armies breaking apart and fleeing, commanders laying down their arms, columns of refugees crossing the Jordan River. The 1949 war would have ended not with an armistice, but with a surrender. Palestinian refugees would have had to settle in new homes, just as the hundreds of thousands of Jews expelled from their former homes in the Arab lands resettled in Israel. The outcome would have squelched any hope that more fighting would have yielded a different result -- and the more decisive result might have dissuaded Arab governments from any further attempts to resort to force. Now imagine another scenario. In the 1990s, the former Yugoslavia erupted into war. New states with new borders were carved out of the old country. Thousands of people were displaced. Horrific atrocities were committed. Happily, the conflict did end. The displaced adjusted to life in their new homes. Former enemies may still mistrust each other, but violence has faded and seems unlikely to return. Suppose instead the world had agreed that one of the combatant ethnic groups -- the Serbs, say, but it really does not matter -- retained a permanent inextinguishable right to reclaim its former homes. Suppose the world agreed to pay displaced persons from that group billions in foreign aid on condition that they never permanently resettled in the territory to which the ethnic group had moved. Suppose the world tolerated Serbian terrorist attacks on Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo as understandable reactions to injustice. Would there be peace in the former Yugoslavia today? The Middle East peacemakers for the most part act with the highest of intentions and the most exquisite patience. But instead of extinguishing the conflict, they have prolonged it. A peace process intended to insulate the Arab world from the pain of defeat has condemned the Arab world -- and the Palestinian people above all -- to unending war. Every war must end -- and end badly for at least one of the belligerents. It's time for this war to end too, and at last. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum says the Middle East peace process unintentionally prolongs conflict .
He says other wars have ended with the parties adjusting to new reality .
In Palestinians' case, he says, much of the world feeds the dispute rather than resolving it ."
"(CNN) -- Iran's vice president has warned that the country could block the Strait of Hormuz if sanctions are imposed on its exports of crude oil. What does the threat mean and what is likely to happen next? What is the Strait of Hormuz used for? It is one of the most important strategic chokepoints in the world, a narrow (34 miles wide) strip of water through which more than 15 million barrels of oil a day passed (through the Strait) in 2009, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. That's about a third of all oil shipped by sea worldwide. Shutting off the Strait would be disastrous for the world economy, causing oil prices to skyrocket. Have there been previous incidents of heightened tension? Iran has threatened several times previously to close the Strait but it has never carried through with it. Doing that would be shooting itself in the foot as almost 80% of its revenues come from the oil industry. Iran is the world's fourth-largest oil producer. Much of the oil that is shipped through the Strait of Hormuz goes to China, a crucial customer for Iran. Why Strait of Hormuz matters . Iran attacked ships in the Gulf during the 1980s in an attempt to cut off Iraq's oil exports when those two countries were at war. The impact on prices was minimal however after foreign navies began escorting oil tankers through the Strait. Is the latest escalation serious? Or is it saber-rattling? Is it related to the dispute between the West and Iran over the nuclear issue? The latest threat to close the Strait, according to experts and U.S. administration officials, appears to be an attempt by Iran to intimidate the U.S., and specifically President Barack Obama, not to proceed with tough new sanctions that could target Iran's oil industry and its oil exports as well as companies that do business with Iran's Central Bank. Those sanctions are aimed at forcing Iran to curtail its nuclear program, over which Iran and the West have been sparring for many years. Iran says its uranium enriching activities are for peaceful purposes, but many Western governments suspect they are intended to produce a weapon. How could Iran disrupt shipping if it wanted to? Does it have the naval capability or would it use other means? Matthew Kroenig at the Council on Foreign Relations, formerly an Iran expert at the Pentagon, tells CNN ""(Iran) could try to close the Strait of Hormuz. What that would mean, though, is physically closing the strait militarily. That would be their only option. So it means laying mines and physically attacking ships coming through the Strait. I think any U.S. president would be forced to respond to that and to open the Strait; that would also mean military action against Iran so an Iranian attempt to close the straits could mean war."" How would the international community react if they did carry out the threat? The international community will not allow the Strait to be closed. It is too important. Many experts say Iran would only have limited success in blocking the Strait for an extended period of time as many governments maintain a naval presence in the region, notably the United States. Dangerous mix: Iranian oil and U.S. sanctions . A senior U.S. administration official, speaking on background because of the sensitivity of the issue, told CNN: ""We've been committed to Gulf security for decades and it should come as no surprise to anyone that we'll do what we must to ensure the Strait remains open."" What effect is the tension having on oil supply and price? Prices initially spiked, then dropped back. But the prospect of conflict continues to make markets nervous. ""We are in a situation where there is essentially no communication between the Iranian government and the U.S. government,"" Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, told CNN Monday after reports said Iranian military forces confronted a Western helicopter near the Strait. ""It is very worrisome."" Investment bank Merrill Lynch predicts a $40 rise in oil prices if the country's 2.2 million barrels day of crude are shut off completely. What is likely to happen next? The most likely outcome is more saber-rattling. But experts say there is a danger of miscalculation by Iran, which has been increasingly provocative and unpredictable. Witness the alleged plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador in the U.S., a claim that Iran denies.","Iran warns it could block Strait of Hormuz if sanctions are imposed on crude oil exports .

"(CNN) -- Hungry air travelers know that all those onboard snacks and spirits reserved for premium-class passengers or available only for a fee look mighty tempting, but airport workers apparently give them a second look as well. Milwaukee County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to General Mitchell International Airport last week after an AirTran Airways manager complained that he saw a maintenance worker take wine bottles from a plane and put them in his jacket pocket. The worker was identified as Jesse Repetti, 28, an employee with PrimeFlight Aviation Services who was responsible for cleaning the plane, according to a complaint filed in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court. When they arrived, the deputies found Repetti in a jetway, eating a bag of chips, ""which belonged to AirTran,"" the court papers say. They asked the suspect whether he had wine bottles in his pocket, and he replied ""yes,"" according to the complaint. When the deputies searched Repetti, they found a small bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, a small bottle of Chardonnay, three small bottles of whiskey, three small bottles of rum, a can of beer, two bags of chips and two bags of pretzels. Officials estimate that the items were worth about $70. Repetti has been charged with theft, a misdemeanor punishable with a fine of up to $10,000 and/or nine months in prison. A pretrial conference in the case has been scheduled for next week. Court documents do not say whether Repetti has retained an attorney.","The incident happened at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee .

"(CNN) -- The end of August saw the kickoff of the Venice International Film Festival, which overlaps both Telluride and Toronto. The three kick off the annual film industry frenzy known as awards season. See? Los Angeles does have seasons. Like many of my colleagues, I have seen only some of this year's ""Oscar-worthy"" films, so the opinions expressed here are based on a mixture of those I have seen with some early buzz and educated guesses. It's early in the process, and things will inevitably shake out over the next few months as more films are screened, so there's no doubt that some of the predictions will change. Not only that, but some actors are submitted to the Academy for supporting roles when the role appears to be a lead and vice versa, so some might switch categories. You'll also notice that the headings for various sections within the categories aren't uniform, and that's because each category has its own sets of rules with accompanying probabilities and politics. Complicating things this year are the reworked Academy rules on voting for best picture, which, while far too convoluted to repeat here, mean there will be anywhere from five to 10 best picture nominees. Not to mention the expense of running campaigns. The cost of holding screenings, making screeners and placing ads in the trades makes it harder for the smaller companies to compete with the big boys. In other words, this is not an exact science. Films I have seen are in listed in bold. All names and titles are in alphabetical order within categories. Best Picture . ""The Artist"" Harvey Weinstein is about as genius of an Academy Awards marketer as there is. Whatever you might say about him (and some have said plenty), the man knows how to get Oscars. If anyone can take a black and white, mostly silent film and turn it into a multiple nominee, it's Harvey. ""The Artist"" is absolutely stunning, a beautiful and magnificent creation on every level. If voters see it, they'll love it. ""The Descendants"" Alexander Payne (""Election,"" ""Sideways"") has created (along with co-screenwriters Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) an almost flawless film that showcases both Hawaii and George Clooney (see below) as you've never seen them before. From what I have seen (and it's very early days yet) this is the one to beat. Serious contenders include: . ""The Help,"" which sort of came out of nowhere and now looks to be a serious candidate, even though it has its detractors, and ""The Ides of March,"" a very well-acted political thriller that is getting good reviews. It could provide Clooney's second, third and fourth nominations (director, supporting actor and screenwriter with Grant Heslov). Also on that list are ""Midnight in Paris,"" ""Moneyball"" and ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" (advance word is that this is a fantastic adaptation of a classic spy novel). There are also a few high-profile films that haven't been screened for anyone, including ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" which has Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock and 9/11, so don't bet against it; Scorsese's 3-D ""Hugo""; ""J. Edgar"" starring Leo DiCaprio; ""War Horse"" from Steven Spielberg; ""We Bought a Zoo"" starring Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson; and ""Young Adult,"" in which Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody team up again (""Juno"") with some buzz on Charlize Theron for best actress. Best Actor . Some mortal locks for this category probably include: . George Clooney, ""The Descendants"": the best he's ever been. Brad Pitt, ""Moneyball"": ditto, although he was magnificent in ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,"" as well. Jean Dujardin, ""The Artist"": a forgotten craft showcased by an excellent performance. Leonard DiCaprio in ""J. Edgar"": likely, but I haven't seen it. Thomas Horn, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"": could be the ""out of the blue"" nominee. In the ""they could be contenders"" category, we have Matt Damon with ""We Bought a Zoo""; Michael Fassbender with ""Shame"" and ""A Dangerous Method""; Joseph Gordon-Levitt in ""50/50""; Ryan Gosling in ""The Ides of March""; Gary Oldman in ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy""; and Anton Yelchin in ""Like Crazy."" Best Actress . In the ""strong possibility"" category, we have: . Kirsten Dunst, ""Melancholia"": one of the most amazing performances I have ever seen. Read my writeup from Toronto here. A lot will depend on how much Magnolia is willing to spend on its campaign for her and how much director Lars von Trier's comments in Cannes hurt the film. Viola Davis, ""The Help"" Elizabeth Olsen, ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"": Wow. Just wow. Michelle WIlliams, ""My Week with Marilyn"" Glenn Close, ""Albert Nobbs"" A list of ""Mmmmm, could be"" potential nominees includes Keira Knightley in ""A Dangerous Method,"" Charlize Theron in ""Young Adult"" and Felicity Jones in ""Like Crazy."" In the ""no one's seen it, but ...duh"" category, we must place Meryl Streep for her performance as former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in ""The Iron Lady."" Best Director . Those leading the pack include: . Woody Allen, ""Midnight in Paris"" Michel Hazanavicius, ""The Artist"" Bennett Miller, ""Moneyball"" Alexander Payne, ""The Descendants"" Stephen Daldry, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" ""Coming up strong on the outside"" is a group that includes Tomas Alfredson for ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy""; George Clooney for ""The Ides of March""; Terrence Malick for ""The Tree of Life""; and Jason Reitman for ""Young Adult."" The ones I would term ""masters with unseen films"" include Clint Eastwood's ""J. Edgar""; David Fincher and ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""; Martin Scorsese with ""Hugo""; and Spielberg with ""War Horse."" Best Supporting Actor . These next two are really tough to predict right now, with almost everyone holding front-runner status. Also, I haven't seen many of the films in the supporting categories, so my guesses are likely to be less educated than usual! Likeliest based on current buzz/past nods: . Albert Brooks, ""Drive"" Kenneth Branagh, ""My Week with Marilyn"" Jim Broadbent, ""The Iron Lady"" Christopher Plummer, ""Beginners"" Max Von Sydow, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" The rest of this excellent pack: . George Clooney, ""The Ides of March"" Tom Hanks, ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close"" Tom Hardy, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" Philip Seymour Hoffman, ""The Ides of March"" Viggo Mortensen, ""A Dangerous Method"" Patton Oswalt, ""Young Adult"" Best Supporting Actress . Advance buzz favors this quartet: . Jessica Chastain, ""The Help"" (also in ""The Tree of Life"" and ""Take Shelter"") Vanessa Redgrave, ""Coriolanus"" Octavia Spencer, ""The Help"" Shailene Woodley, ""The Descendants"" Other contenders include Sandra Bullock in ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"" Carey Mulligan in ""Shame"" and Kate Winslet in ""Carnage."" Best Original Screenplay . There's only one that I would place in my ""pretty much a guarantee"" slot, and that would be Woody Allen for ""Midnight in Paris."" Serious contenders include: . Terrence Malick, ""The Tree of Life"" Dustin Lance Black, ""J. Edgar"" James Ellroy and Oren Moverman, ""Rampart"" Best Adapted Screenplay . I'd bet my lunch on nominations for: . Alexander Payne and Nat Faxon & Jim Rash, ""The Descendants"" Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian, ""Moneyball"" Bridget O'Connor and Peter Straughan, ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" Other front-runners include George Clooney, Grant Heslov and Beau Willimon for ""The Ides of March,"" Christopher Hampton for ""A Dangerous Method"" and Eric Roth for ""Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close."" I know, I didn't touch on the categories of animation, documentaries, cinematography and many other categories. There's plenty of time between now and the awards on February 26, not to mention the Golden Globes, Independent Spirit Awards, SAG Awards, DGA Awards, etc., etc.","Various film festivals have helped stir Oscar buzz .

"(CNN) -- Zachary Tomaselli, the third man to publicly allege that former Syracuse University coach Bernie Fine molested him, pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges that he sexually abused a teenage boy. Under the terms of the deal, Tomaselli faces a maximum of three years and three months in prison, said defense attorney Justin Leary. Tomaselli originally faced 11 charges, including gross sexual assault, in Maine involving alleged assaults against a then 13- and 14-year-old in 2009 and 2010. The two had grown close when Tomaselli was the teen's summer camp counselor. Seven of those charges were dropped, Leary said, and Tomaselli pleaded guilty to gross sexual assault, unlawful sexual contact and two counts of visual sexual aggression towards a minor. Tomaselli, 23, had told CNN earlier this month that he planned to plead guilty. ""I take complete responsibility for what I did,"" he said by phone from Lewiston, Maine. Tomaselli, who is currently out on bail, is the third man to say publicly that Fine molested him. Mike Lang and his stepbrother, Bobby Davis, have also stepped forward to accuse the former men's assistant basketball coach of molesting them over several years. Tomaselli said he and Fine watched pornography together before Fine fondled him in a hotel room in Pittsburgh, where he'd gone to watch a Syracuse game in 2002. He was 13 years old when the alleged abuse occurred. Police in Syracuse and Pittsburgh are investigating the allegations and looking for other potential victims, authorities have said. When the allegations first surfaced, Fine -- married with a son and two daughters -- called them ""patently false."" He has not commented since. CNN's Kristen Hamill and Ronni Berke contributed to this report.","Zachary Tomaselli faces a maximum of three years, three months in prison .

"(CNN) -- According to the ""Guinness Book of World Records,"" Sherlock Holmes is the most popular role in the movies. So if Robert Downey Jr. hardly seems like the iconic Sherlock (he's too short and muscular, and strains to suggest the intellectual arrogance that comes so easily to the English), he can take his place alongside such oddball castings as Buster Keaton, Charlton Heston and George C. Scott. And he's ideally suited to director Guy Ritchie's purpose, which is not to dust off your grandfather's Conan Doyle, but to juice today's kids with a quirky 19th century super sleuth. What's fun about these movies is that the equation works both ways. Yes, this Holmes is more likely to get physical than his predecessors, he's even a bit of a boor, but he's still a more cerebral action hero than we find in most blockbusters, and the period trappings (a seamless blend of CGI and location work) help this franchise stand out from the crowd of comic book adaptations. Ritchie and husband-and-wife screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney (""Paper Man"") map out a fast-moving -- if ridiculously digressive -- Victorian adventure that crisscrosses Europe by horseless carriage, train, boat, and, in Sherlock's case, pony. Just down the road from 221 Baker Street they're digging a tunnel for what will become the London Underground. The Industrial Age is beginning to stretch its muscles, while a series of terrorist atrocities are gnawing at the fragile understanding between the great European powers. Holmes detects something other than social unrest behind the bombings: an evil master plan leading inexorably to his nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). There are big themes there, but the movie doesn't take itself remotely seriously. This is a rambunctious romp, even brazenly camp when it's poking fun at the always-intriguing Holmes-Watson relationship. Sometimes it seems like the real motivation behind Moriarty's scheme is not to plunge Europe into war so much as to prevent the doctor from consummating his marriage and reunite him with his former roommate, which is where he rightfully belongs. Nothing if not versatile, Downey dons myriad disguises through the course of the movie (he even impersonates a bookcase), and he does a long, very funny turn in drag. Jude Law is Hardy to his Laurel, always piqued, but somehow affectionate in his aggravation. And Ritchie has the good instincts to let their byplay run the show. They make such a splendid comic double-act, there's not much more than a look-in for the fairer sex. Sherlock's main squeeze, Rachel McAdams' Irene Adler, scarcely makes it to the opening titles. Watson's intended, Kelly Reilly, fares a little better, but her most memorable scene comes when the great detective rudely shoves her out of a moving train. As for Noomi Rapace, the original ""Girl with a Dragon Tattoo,"" at least she comes along for the ride as a gypsy soothsayer with anarchist tendencies, but the screenwriters' appear to forget about her existence whenever things start to get exciting. No matter. The movie has more than its share of good gags, and if Ritchie's tic-y histrionics with the camera are starting to flag (I think we've seen the pre-rehearsed fisticuffs more than enough now, thanks), he's a dab hand in the editing suite. Playful and polished, ""Game of Shadows"" is at least as much fun as its predecessor. ""Who taught you to dance?"" asks Sherlock, as he waltzes the good doctor through another deadly scrape. ""You did,"" comes the inevitable reply. They make a lovely couple.","This Holmes is more likely to get physical than his predecessors .

"(CNN) -- Many tall fliers know: Those precious exit row or bulkhead seats now often come with a price as airlines charge for the extra bit of legroom. That's not sitting well with Malcolm Johnson, a 6-foot-7-inch architect from Edmonton, Alberta, who says they should be available to tall travelers without the added cost. Johnson is on a mission to get Air Canada -- the airline he flies most -- to stop charging the fee. He filed a complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency last year, but it was rejected in December on the grounds that he didn't fully qualify as a disabled person with a special condition, he said. Johnson is vowing to appeal the decision. ""It's a penalty for tall people ... to pay for those seats -- they're the only seats on the craft that we can fit into,"" he said. Air Canada has not responded to a request for comment. Johnson flies on the airline from Edmonton to France twice a year, but since there are no direct flights available, the journey usually requires four legs for a round-trip. He was always able to get a fairly comfortable seat at no charge, but that changed when the carrier implemented the fee about two years ago. Air Canada charges up to $50 for a coach seat with extra legroom on each flight, so Johnson ends up paying $200 extra, he said. If his wife comes along and wants to sit next to him, the couple ends up paying $400 extra. Johnson says it's not fair that some obese passengers who can't fit into one seat are entitled to a free extra seat according to Canadian law, but tall fliers aren't taken into consideration. ""People have said to me, why don't you fly first class? Well, it's 10 times the price to fly first class,"" Johnson said. ""Other people have said, well, why don't you just suck it up and sit down and shut up? And I say, that's fine for you because you're 5 foot 2 and it's all right. For tall people, it's a little different."" Flying can be 'hell' for tall passengers . Johnson worries about deep vein thrombosis, a potentially deadly condition that can develop when people sit still for a long time. When forced to sit in a regular coach seat, his knee is jammed against the person in front, he said, so he always ends up paying the fee for preferred seats. Johnson says passengers who have a doctor's letter that verifies their height and their need for more room should not have to pay extra. Since Johnson started his campaign, many other tall fliers have contacted him with messages of support. E-mail is ""coming in every hour,"" he said.","Malcolm Johnson, who's 6-foot-7, says it's not fair that tall fliers have to pay for extra legroom .

"(EW.com) -- You've seen it a hundred times, in any thriller that finds the hero perched on a ledge or on the edge of a building's rooftop. The camera moves up and tilts downward, in a smooth unbroken shot, so that we can all know that the actor is really standing there. By now we're more than ready for that shot (it's become fairly ho-hum). But there's no way that I was ready for the extraordinary, dread-inducing Look Ma, no safety net! sequence in ""Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" where Tom Cruise makes his way across the surface of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai -- the world's tallest skyscraper -- while clinging to the building's glass panels with a pair of electrified adhesive gloves. Cruise, as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, is trying to break into the suite that houses the skyscraper's -computer servers, and this is the only way he can do it without being detected from within. Brad Bird, the director of Ghost Protocol, knows all too well that the audience will be on the lookout for any tell-tale cut, any obvious digital image, anything at all that reveals that Tom Cruise isn't really on the side of that skyscraper. And damned if we can find one! This is a sequence so ingeniously conceived and shot that even the audience doesn't want to look down -- a sequence so death-defying that it gets you laughing at your own susceptibility (especially if, like me, you happen to have a fear of heights). Shimmying up and down and around the building's surface, with the ground looking as if it must be a mile below, Cruise becomes a fearless human bug (think Spider-Man without the superpowers). Then, just as we're sure that our hearts couldn't dig any deeper into our throats, one of his gloves begins to short out and lose adhesive power. Don't you hate when that happens? 'American Horror Story': Ryan Murphy talks the game-changing season finale . ""Ghost Protocol"" brims with scenes that are exciting and amazing at the same time; they're brought off with such casual aplomb that they're funny, too. Early on, Hunt and a fellow agent, the nattering tech nerd Benji (Simon Pegg), have to penetrate the archive room of the Kremlin, and they do it in captivating silence by hiding behind a scrim that projects, to the security guard, an exact image of the hallway they're in (minus the two of them). It's the spy equivalent of a magic trick, and that's the spirit of the whole movie. ""Ghost Protocol"" is fast and explosive, but it's also a supremely clever sleight-of-hand thriller. Brad Bird, the animation wizard (""The Incredibles,"" ""The Iron Giant""), makes the leap to live action with the kind of skill Paul Greengrass brought to the ""Bourne"" films, only Bird, showing an animator's miraculously precise use of visual space, has a playful, screw-tightening ingenuity all his own. 'The X Factor' recap: You Oughta Show . After an epic explosion rocks the Kremlin, the entire IMF gets ''disavowed,'' and Hunt and his team find themselves cut off, without backup. Suddenly they're rogue agents, like an espionage version of the Ocean's gang, only with far more important priorities. Their mission is to stop Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist, dour costar of the Swedish Girl With the ""Dragon Tattoo"" films), a lone terrorist who has stolen the Russian nuclear codes, from launching a missile and kicking off a nuclear war. All because he's a nihilist nut who really wants to. Hunt's team, aside from Benji (played by Pegg with impish timing), includes the terrific Paula Patton as the dangerously beautiful and ruthless Jane, and Jeremy Renner, all moody reticence, as a desk jockey named Brandt with a backstory that makes it look, for a time, like he's Ethan's ambiguous adversary. Together, these four execute fake seductions and underworld meetings, take parking-garage fight scenes to new heights of layer-cake suspense, and race against the clock of a nuclear countdown that's just jittery enough to make the unthinkable credible. Kathy Griffin kalls out Kim Kardashian in latest stand-up special . It's become easy to take Tom Cruise's skill for granted (even his fans do), but in ""Ghost Protocol"" he has a pulsating presence, a dynamic mind-body fusion. From the moment he gets broken out of a Russian prison cell, only to argue with Benji via video feed as chaotic violence swirls all around him, Cruise energizes the film with his no-sweat bravura. He kicks a** like an Ultimate-Fighting bruiser, he races vehicles like a demon -- but more than any of that, he invests every line, every situation, with the cleanly intense, fired-up concentration of an actor who means it. Powered by Cruise's moxie, ""Mission: Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" proves that in a Hollywood action-ride, culture drenched in fake adrenaline, it's cathartic to encounter the real thing. A .

"(CNN) -- David Cronenberg's follow-up to 2007's ""Eastern Promises"" is an engrossing and brilliantly acted adaptation of Christopher Hampton's play ""The Talking Cure"" (itself based on John Kerr's book ""A Most Dangerous Method""). It's centered around the real-life trio of psychiatrists Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen), Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) and Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley), a woman who is at first a patient and later a pioneer in psychoanalysis, herself. Lacking any of the dark or macabre trappings of many of Cronenberg's previous films (""Crash,"" ""Dead Ringers""), ""Method"" is instead a romantic, bittersweet and ultimately tragic character-driven film, focusing on the deep friendship between Freud and Jung, as well as both men's relationship with Spielrein. Our first sight of Spielrein is her being dragged, literally kicking and screaming, out of a carriage and into the Burgholzli mental hospital in Zurich in 1904. She was what used to be called a hysteric. A non-specific condition attributed almost exclusively to women and based at least in part on the Greek word for womb (hystera), it is a diagnosis no longer made, due in part to the work that Freud and Jung did with Spielrein. Around this time, Jung was experimenting with a radical new method of treatment for mental illness that Freud had developed, the ""talking cure,"" which we now refer to as psychoanalysis. A young, educated and extremely intelligent woman, Spielrein was the ideal patient for Jung to work with and he was soon getting results. With a goal towards becoming a doctor, Spielrein is amazed at and relieved by the effect Jung's treatment has on her behavior and is intrigued by his methods, even going so far as to basically assist with her own treatment. Spielrein is clearly a hyper-intelligent young woman, and watching Knightley cycle through shame, anger, revelation, arousal and, ultimately, relief is a pleasure. Spielrein's collection of tics, shrieks, shudders and fears slowly gives way to a modicum of calm as her treatment progresses and we see the brilliant and curious woman beneath. Most of those who have used phrases like ""over the top"" to describe Knightley's performance have clearly misunderstood the meaning of the word ""hysterical."" It is actually one of the most controlled performances I've seen this year. Spielrein had endured a childhood rife with corporal punishment and humiliation at the hands of her father, and when Jung discovers a sexual element to her condition (she actually liked the spankings she received but was overcome by shame), it was clear to him that he had a case that confirmed Freud's theory of an underlying sexual connection to emotional disorders. Thus begins a correspondence and eventually a strong friendship between the two psychiatrists. Fassbender, an actor who is undoubtedly on the cusp of superstardom, delivers a performance as equally brilliant as Knightley, but his is almost entirely internal. Jung hides his thoughts behind a psychiatrist's generally impassive veneer, and thus Fassbender's eventually heartbreaking work on screen is largely one of subtlety. When his relationship with Spielrein veers from the professional to the personal, however, his calm exterior begins to crack. Jung's psychiatric discoveries are framed by the growing relationship between himself and Freud as the two men correspond about Sabina's treatments and other theories. Mortensen's Freud is the elder statesman, arrogant at times but clearly happy to have an acolyte of such high intellectual ability, and Jung is grateful for the attention of the eminent doctor Freud. Complicating things is Jung's wealthy wife, and the disparity of economic means between the two men is occasionally a bone of contention including the instance of a trip to the United States where Jung's wife books him a first class stateroom while Freud and his assistant are in lowlier accommodations. A bit of an ego blow to the man who invented the concept and their relationship continues to suffer. The methods and theories that Freud had been advancing were strange and uncomfortable to the psychiatric community, not to mention the general public and having Jung as a comrade in arms gave Freud intellectual protection when the two functioned as a united front. However, once Jung began to feel more assured in his own theories and ideas (including some that could be considered verging on the paranormal) Freud started to resent the younger man's advances in the field, not to mention having no respect for Jung's more esoteric research. The other key to the collapse of their professional and personal relationship is Jung's sexual relationship with Spielrein. It is a serious breach of ethics, a betrayal of his wife and, when Jung denies it in a letter to Freud, a stain on his integrity. ""A Dangerous Method"" is another example of how many true-life stories are out there that can be made into compelling and moving cinema. It is a historical drama, a bittersweet romance and the story of a professional friendship-cum-rivalry that gave birth to arguably the greatest advance in the history of mental health. Cronenberg is a master director at the top of his game, and ""A Dangerous Method"" is a film where the beauty is in the performances, language and ideas. Reviewed at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, ""A Dangerous Method"" is rated R and contains some less-than-vanilla sexual imagery and situations.","Watching Keira Knightley cycle through shame, anger, arousal and relief is a pleasure .

"(CNN) -- I'm a fan of Antonio Banderas' Puss in Boots, a Latin-lover Zorro so romantic and vain that he's preposterously unaware he's...well, a kitty cat. That said, building an entire animated feature around him turns out to be a bit like making a Marx Brothers movie with just Chico. In the ""Shrek"" films, the joke of Puss in Boots, with his trilled consonants and penchant for chest-puffing sword duels, is that no one this cuddly should try to be this dashing. But in ""Puss in Boots,"" that joke wears out its welcome in 15 minutes. We're left with the feeling that Puss in Boots, as a character, has exactly one dimension: self-deluded Spanish-macho vainglory. He's like a lost mascot from a taco commercial. The movie gives Puss a sidekick, the cracked-fairy-tale figure of Humpty Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis), who was once his comrade and then betrayed him. When the movie plunges into the convoluted backstory of these two, only to emerge from the flashback about 20 minutes later, we begin to realize: The more stuff that happens in ""Puss in Boots,"" the less stake we have in it. The movie throws in Jack and Jill (who are corpulent grown-up grouches), magic beans and a beanstalk, a girl kitty (Salma Hayek) dressed, for some reason, as Catwoman, and a whole lot more. ""Puss in Boots"" is beautifully animated (with 3-D that adds nothing), but the film is so mindlessly busy that it seems to be trying to distract you from the likable, one-note feline swashbuckler at its center.

"(CNN) -- Sometimes an actor takes on the role of an iconic figure and they do a good job. Sometimes they do a lousy job. But sometimes, very rarely, they disappear into their role so perfectly that all you have left is the person they're playing. Such is the case with Michelle Williams in Simon Curtis' moving and thoroughly enjoyable ""My Week With Marilyn."" About 15 minutes into the film, the first she's been called on to completely carry, Williams vanishes. All that remains is Marilyn. It's a magnificent performance and one of the most heartbreaking celebrity stories there is. In the summer of 1956, Marilyn Monroe, newly married to writer Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott), traveled to England to shoot ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" with co-star/director Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh). The third assistant director, aka gofer, on that production was Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a 24- year-old aspiring filmmaker on whose memoir the film is based. He rapidly became Monroe's confidant and ally, the only person on the crew on whom she could rely. Needless to say, he fell hopelessly in love with her, but really, what choice did he have? Marilyn Monroe was like a lottery ticket. You know you're not going to win, but when those numbers come up, damned if you're not sure you're going to pocket millions. Of course Colin wouldn't actually have won had he ended up with Monroe, but she was someone who men desperately wanted to take care of. After all, she was Marilyn Monroe. That's a roll of the dice very few would be able to pass up. As Monroe, Williams is nothing short of dazzling. She's managed to inhabit perhaps the most iconic woman in American history and not only her public persona, at that. To do a decent job of mimicking a well-known figure, all one has to do is capture their mannerisms and voice and let the makeup department handle the rest. However to truly capture the essence of someone, the actor has to convince us that we're watching them, not an actor playing them. We have to believe that if, for example, no record of that person in casual situations exists, the actor has captured what they would actually be like. We have all seen images of Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, perhaps the three most-famous pre-Michael Jackson entertainers in history, in public, on stage or in films. But there's very little recorded of them in private times. What Williams does is create a fully realized portrait of Monroe. It doesn't matter if her portrayal is 100% accurate. It feels 100% accurate. As for the production within the film, Monroe's reputation of difficulty on the set follows her to England, and what's more, she brings acting coach Paula Strasberg (wife of famed acting teacher Lee, played by ZoÃ« Wanamaker) with her. Whenever things get rough for her, which was often, Marilyn retreats to her dressing room or cottage with Paula, leaving Olivier to stew and the production be damned. As the director and star, Olivier is used to getting his way and is not a method actor. He doesn't understand Monroe's need to believe in her character and finds her questions about motivation frustrating. One can't help but be reminded of the (likely at least partially apocryphal) story about Olivier on the set of ""Marathon Man"" when, after Dustin Hoffman has stayed up all night supposedly to accurately portray his character's state of mind, Olivier retorted with something along the lines of: ""Why don't you try acting, dear boy. It's so much easier."" It's a case of when styles collide and at one point Branagh explodes on set that ""teaching Marilyn how to act is like trying to teach Urdu to a badger!"" It's a great line, and Branagh is excellent as Olivier. It serves to underscore the differences in their styles and how frustrating Monroe's behavior was for Olivier. For her part, Olivier's bluster turned Monroe's already present insecurities into full-blown panic attacks. When you're watching Williams go through Monroe's struggle with self-doubt and an increasingly serious pill problem, there's no doubt in your mind that it's Marilyn Monroe. You feel her pain, her fears and, on a rare occasion, her joy. Williams perfectly captures Monroe's legendary vulnerabilities and in the culmination of a series of scenes, the duality of Norma Jeane Baker, the person she was, and Marilyn Monroe, the woman she became. After an afternoon spent secretly touring Windsor Castle, courtesy of Sir Owen Morshead (Colin's godfather and the castle librarian, played by Derek Jacobi), Colin and Monroe are spotted by castle staff. Leaning into Colin, Monroe whispers ""Shall I be her?"" and instantly, Norma Jeane disappears and Marilyn is there, shimmying, posing and doing exactly what's expected of her. It seems like she gets a kick out of it but at the same time, there's a sadness in her leaving Norma Jeane behind, once again. At once lightweight and melancholy, ""My Week With Marilyn"" doesn't purport to reveal any deep, dark secrets or illuminate any truths that we already don't know. In fact, we don't know for certain that any of this actually happened at all. I'd like to think that it did, though. ""My Week With Marilyn"" is rated R and contains some foul language, pill-popping and some discrete female nudity.","As Marilyn Monroe, Michelle Williams is nothing short of dazzling .

"New York (CNN) -- A 47-year-old man was arrested Sunday in the death of a 73-year-old woman who was set on fire in the elevator of her Brooklyn apartment building, telling police the woman owed him $2,000, New York police said. Jerome Isaac faces charges of first-degree and second-degree murder, along with arson, police said in a statement. The victim was identified as Deloris Gillespie. Isaac also lives in Brooklyn, but does not live at the address where the incident took place, police said in a statement. Isaac told police Gillespie owed him $2,000 for work he claims he did for her, said NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. He turned himself in to police overnight or early Sunday morning, he said. Neighbors said the woman was returning home to her fifth-floor apartment in Prospect Heights after a grocery store trip Saturday. A preliminary investigation showed the man was standing outside the elevator on the fifth floor and attacked the woman as she was attempting to exit, authorities said. The incident was caught on surveillance cameras inside and outside the elevator, and police have the videotapes, Browne said. Authorities believe Isaac initially sprayed the woman with a flammable liquid, presumably gasoline, and continued to spray her as he followed her back into the elevator, Browne said. The woman was first sprayed in the face, he said. Then, using ""one of those long lighters that you would use for a grill, he lit a Molotov cocktail and used the burning leg on top of that to ignite her body,"" Browne said. The suspect stepped out of the elevator, threw the Molotov cocktail inside, then returned again to spray more liquid on the woman as she burned, he said. ""This is as bad as it gets,"" Browne told CNN's Don Lemon. Authorities responding to a 911 call of a fire found the woman's body inside the elevator. She was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the police statement. Residents told CNN affiliate WCBS they heard screams and saw smoke -- and realized a woman was on fire inside the elevator. ""Myself and someone from the sixth floor went down knocking to get people out. Knocking on doors telling people 'There's a fire, get out, get out,"" a resident named John told the station. He did not want to give his last name. Neighbor Carmen Martinez told the station the victim had lived in the building since the 1980s. ""She used to give toys and gifts to kids all the time,"" Martinez told the station. ""From everything we hear ... she was just this sweet 73-year-old woman,"" Browne said. Photos that police released of the attacker show a man dressed in dark blue clothes, white gloves, with a dust mask on his head and carrying a container on his back. The photos were released during the search for a suspect, Browne said. Isaac lived about 10 minutes away from Gillespie's apartment building, Brown said. After the incident, he apparently returned home and ignited the door to his own apartment, he said. He was concerned he had burned himself in the second incident, although no one else was injured, Browne said. He then hid out on a rooftop for a while and fell asleep, later going into a police station ""reeking of gasoline"" and telling officers he was responsible for a fire. During questioning, Browne said, he implicated himself in Gillespie's death. It was not clear whether Isaac had retained an attorney. CNN's Maria P. White and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: ""This is as bad as it gets,"" police official says .

Troops arrested Felipe Cabrera Sarabia on Friday in ""a surgical operation in Cuiliacan"" in the northwestern state of Sinaloa, said Ricardo Trevilla Trejo, a Defense Ministry spokesman. Cabrera, who was responsible for the activities of the Pacific Cartel in Durango and the southern part of the state of Chihuahua, was detained after fleeing from Durango, Trevilla told reporters. ""The analysis of his behavior permitted (us) to find the building where he was hiding"" and Cabrera was taken into custody without violence, Trevilla said. Firearms, computer equipment and other documentation were seized, too, he said. Cabrera, who appeared Monday in the office of a prosecutor who specializes in organized crime, was responsible for Guzman's security in Durango, the state-run Notimex news agency said. He is charged with possessing firearms reserved for use by the army and falsification of a public document, a spokeswoman for the attorney general said. Trevilla said Cabrera was involved in kidnappings, extortion and arson. ""The violence caused him to rise within the organization,"" said Trevilla, who predicted that the arrest will affect the cartel's leadership and abilities. Guzman, who is under indictment by U.S. authorities in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, is described by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration as one of ""the most powerful drug traffickers in Mexico."" In 2004, the U.S. government announced a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. He is accused of running a major network that distributes cocaine and heroin. He is worth about $1 billion, according to Forbes Magazine, which began listing him on its billionaires list in 2009. The magazine lists him as No. 55 on its Most Powerful People list and as the only crime lord on its list of Mexico's billionaires.","Alleged drug kingpin's lieutenant handled his security in Durango, Defense Ministry says .

"(CNN) -- The Arab League is a step closer to asking the U.N. Security Council to consider a plan designed to forge peace in restive Syria, a senior Arab League official told CNN Saturday. Five Arab League ministers meeting in Doha, Qatar, drafted a resolution calling for the end of violence and approving an observatory mission in Syria, engulfed by a brutal anti-government crackdown for nine months that has left 5,000 people dead. The plan will be considered Wednesday by league foreign ministers. If they approve it, it could be sent to the U.N. Security Council. The official, who wanted to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak on the issue, said the resolution does not include any mention of military intervention. This comes as 41 people were slain on Saturday by government security forces cracking down on anti-regime elements, an activist group said. Eight of the dead were members of the Free Syrian Army, the rebel force comprised of military defectors. World powers have deplored the government's activity, and they are looking for ways to rein in violence and urgently contain the threat of civil war, reflected from the emergence of the armed defector force. The Arab League has devised and promoted a plan to send an observatory team to Syria weeks ago. It tried to get Syria's approval to go along with it. But the regime has raised objections and called for caveats to the resolution, and the league says the Bashar al-Assad regime has procrastinated in dealing with the proposal. The Syrian government's repression of unrest has triggered criticism as well as from the Arab League, which expelled Syria last month and has been pushing to send monitors into Syria. Sanctions against Syria have been initiated by the United States, the European Union, Turkey and the league. The passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution would require an approval by two permanent council members -- Russia, a longtime ally of Syria, and China, both of whom have rejected tough action at the U.N. toward Syria. Russia has taken a stab at resolving the issue at the United Nations this week. Moscow introduced a draft resolution this week that, it says, ""considerably strengthens"" previous drafts ""with regard to the interest in violence, with regard to the need to uphold human rights, with regard to expediting reforms."" The resolution ""strongly condemns"" violence ""coming from all parties, including disproportionate use of force by Syrian authorities."" It also would ""give a strong message to the Arab League that we encourage them to continue their efforts, and working together with the government of Syria, and to carry out its plans to deploy the monitoring mission in Syria,"" Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Thursday at the United Nations. Itar -Tass, the Russian state news agency, reported that Syria's Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa was to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday to discuss ways to forge peace. But Interfax, a Russian news agency, later said Lavrov denied reports about the talks and quoted a Syrian official in Moscow as saying he knows nothing about the possible time of the visit. Iraq has sent a delegation to Damascus with a peace proposal, Iraqi state media reported Saturday. Activists say fighting has raged virtually every day and unrest also rippled across the country on Saturday. Among the 41 deaths Saturday were three children and a woman. The group said military and security forces also stormed towns in Hama and Aleppo provinces. The military defectors died in the Damascus province town of Zabadani, where civilians protesting the al-Assad regime have conducted a general strike, the LCC said. Security forces, including snipers, have been opening fire on houses and private vehicles in the town, said the LCC. The two defectors were members of the Free Syrian Army, the rebel force of army defectors who are taking up arms against the government. The LCC identified one of the soldiers as Lt. Col. Alaa Yahya. The Free Syrian Army struck government forces this week and killed 27 of them Thursday in a southern province, anti-government sources said. Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 41 people died Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's hopes of retaining the Premier League title suffered a setback on Wednesday as the English champions slumped to a 3-0 defeat at Newcastle. Superb strikes from Demba Ba and Yohan Cabaye plus a late Phil Jones own goal earned the home side a deserved victory and condemned United to a second successive loss following Saturday's shock 3-2 home defeat by bottom club Blackburn. The result, United's first away reverse this season, left Alex Ferguson's second-placed team three points behind rivals Manchester City, with Tottenham in third another three points behind with a game in hand. Early season pace-setters Newcastle came into the match on the back of a poor recent run of just one win in eight matches, a sequence which had seen Alan Pardew's side slump to seventh in the table. Who are the top January transfer targets? But they were always the dominant side against a disjointed United, and it was no surprise when the hosts took a 33rd-minute lead when top scorer Ba superbly swiveled on the edge of the area before smashing home his 15th goal of the season. Newcastle doubled the lead early in the second half with another spectacular goal, as Cabaye curled home a delightful long-range free-kick that hit the underside of the crossbar before bouncing over the goal-line of keeper Anders Lindegaard -- who was recalled in place of David De Gea. United's miserable night was complete in the final minute when a long ball from Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul was turned into his own net by England defender Jones. Newcastle remained in seventh place, though now just a point behind Liverpool. In Wednesday's other English Premier League match, Bolton moved off the bottom after recovering from a goal behind to win 2-1 at Everton. The home side took a 63rd-minute lead in freak circumstances when Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard's long clearance flew over his opposite number Adam Bogdan and into the net. However, former Liverpool striker David Ngog leveled for the visitors just four minutes later before captain Gary Cahill -- who has been linked with a move to Chelsea during the transfer window -- smashed home the winner with 12 minutes remaining. In Spain, Barcelona put one foot into the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey with a 4-0 victory at home to Osasuna in the first leg of their last-16 tie. Cesc Fabregas netted twice in the first half and Lionel Messi came off the substitutes' bench to add another couple after the break to give Pep Guardiola's side a healthy advantage ahead of next week's return match.","Premier League champions Manchester United are thrashed 3-0 at Newcastle .

"(CNN) -- The social media universe has been aghast this week after the revelation that Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia has invested $300 million in Twitter. The shock and awe seems to center around the notion that Twitter has been at least partly responsible for the Arab Spring uprisings that directly threaten the Saudi royal family's grip on power. On the surface, anyway, this seems like a contradiction. Why would the king's nephew be investing in the medium of his family's enemy? Will he attempt to influence the development of the network or try to make it more susceptible to censorship in a regime-threatening emergency? And what of Twitter? Will the participation of a major investor widely considered to be the beneficiary of one of the world's most exploitative dynasties tarnish the company's otherwise net-friendly brand image? Why would Twitter accept such an investor, and why would he court them in the first place? The answer, most simply, is for the money. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is no doubt aware of Twitter and Facebook's tremendous influence in his own and neighboring countries, and may even be personally concerned about what a revolution might do to his own and his family's sovereign rule. But why should that stop him from positioning himself to become the wealthiest deposed royal he can be? It's a win-win. For its part, Twitter, which isn't even a public company, is not actually selling shares to a Saudi Arabian prince. It's Twitter's early investors who are selling $300 million of their own shares to the Prince's investing group, ""Kingdom Holding Company."" Of course, Twitter benefited by selling those shares initially, and now benefits indirectly as the resale of these shares puts the company's total valuation up to $8.4 billion. The dismay and disillusionment associated with this transaction seems overblown to me, or at least misplaced. In short, we are looking at the wrong medium. We are not witnessing Twitter operate against its central, democratizing premise. We are witnessing money operate in perfect accordance with its own, highly abstracting premise. Money, by its very nature, launders. This is exactly what money and the corporation were invented 700 years ago to do: provide kings and other members of the aristocracy with a way to invest at arm's length in projects they may or may not want to be associated with. The corporation gives people a way to invest passively in companies whose operations they might not want to know about, much less be known for. Likewise, generic, central currencies give people who have done Lord-knows-what the very same access to markets as those who have earned their money through sweat or innovation. Once it's money, it is as clean as anyone else's money. Similarly, once you sell your business to shareholders, they can do what they like with the shares. That's what is meant by shareholding. In the simplest language possible, when you sell your business, you have sold your business. (Maybe that's why so many top people have been leaving Twitter lately. Their shares have vested and they are less restricted about what they can do with them once they quit.) This is the beauty and horror of investment capital. Just as a Saudi prince can invest in our revolution-inspiring Internet darlings, each of us is free to invest our own retirement savings in the likes of cigarette and liquor companies, weapons manufacturers, polluters, outsourcers and sweatshop exploiters. We can put our kids through college by investing in the very oil companies through which the Saudi royals made their money in the first place. Then, hopefully, our kids can go on to become peace workers, revolutionaries or even Twitter employees. Or not. If we're truly concerned about the long arm of international investing, we might best reconsider how we invest ourselves. Instead of relying on the anonymity of outsourced investing to the stock market, why not look around for who or what needs money in our towns and communities? The Obama administration is already in the process of curtailing the regulations that prevent nonmillionaire investors from putting money into one anothers' businesses. This means we can begin to depend on local money to start-up our own ventures, and on local ventures to build our own savings. And at that point, if we don't feel like having a Saudi Arabian prince participate, we can just say no. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal invests $300 million in Twitter shares .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese police have busted two child-trafficking rings after a six-month nationwide investigation, rescuing 178 children and arresting 608 suspects, the country's Ministry of Public Security announced this week. Calling it ""the biggest achievement since the launch of a national campaign against human trafficking,"" the ministry described in detail the joint effort of police forces in ten provinces in statement posted on its official website. A traffic accident in May in southwestern Sichuan Province unexpectedly led the authorities to a network of child-traffickers headed by man named Cai Lianchao, the ministry said. In August, police in southeastern Fujian Province uncovered another human trafficking ring led by a woman named Chen Xiumei, according to the statement. After gathering initial evidence on the two rings that kidnapped and sold children across China, the ministry said 5,000 police officers conducted a highly coordinated nationwide investigation for several more months before finally arresting the suspects last week. Officials placed rescued children in local orphanages while they tried to reunite them with their families, the ministry said. It added that female police officers were dispatched to take care of the children, some of whom were being treated for illnesses. ""We will strictly adhere to our policy of 'zero tolerance' on child-trafficking,"" the ministry emphasized in its statement. ""This policy is aimed at cracking down on the buyers' market,"" said Chen Shiqu, Director of the anti-human trafficking department at the Ministry of Public Security. ""We will ensure the buyers lose both their money and the purchased children, so that we can address the problem from the source by reducing the demand for kidnapped and trafficked children."" Since the government launched a national campaign against human trafficking in April 2009, police have arrested almost 50,000 suspects, rescuing more than 18,000 children as well as some 35,000 women, the ministry said. Human trafficking is a major problem in China, with children and women being the primary victims. Premier Wen Jiabao pledged last week that the government would continue to crack down on the crime to protect women and children.","Chinese authorities rescue 178 children and arrest 608 suspects in a smuggling crackdown .

"(CNN) -- Movies are an especially fluid form of art. A person's feelings about a particular film are based on many factors, including his or her mood when watching. On a more cynical day, I might not have enjoyed Cameron Crowe's ""We Bought a Zoo"" as much as I did. Letting a film sink in over time can change things, too. For example, in a relatively short period, ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" moved from No. 10 to No. 6 on my own personal list of the year's best films. However, I'm not going to rank this list in a strict one through 10 fashion. It's not fair to the films. This has been a truly excellent year in the cinema. I could easily include 25 ""top"" films on my list, not to mention the films I haven't had a chance to see that are appearing on ""Best of"" lists around the Web. Still, my favorite film of the year has remained the same since the moment I saw it at the Toronto International Film Festival. I won't say that Alexander Payne's ""The Descendants"" is a better film than any other released this year, but I will say it's my favorite. It's as honest a film as I have seen in many years. And, without getting into specifics, I can relate to some of the issues and emotions that make up the core of this film. Sometimes when a loved one is dying, you have to laugh because there's no more crying to be done. Sometimes you do get angry at them. Angry for doing something foolish that made them sick in the first place (drinking, smoking, etc.) or even angry at them for doing something as ""selfish"" as leaving you. George Clooney's performance is also my favorite by a male actor this year. Over the years, Clooney has worked to overcome his heartthrob image and expand his range. As the cuckolded husband dealing with his dying wife, he suddenly becomes the only parent to two girls. He's also dealing with a major business deal that affects the entire state of Hawaii. Clooney works with all these emotions and more. I'm not sure he could have played this role as convincingly 10 years ago, but he has matured and grown as an actor to the point where he's got about as much range as anyone out there. Which brings me to my favorite supporting role of the year: Shailene Woodley in ""The Descendants."" She plays the rebellious elder daughter forced by life to grow up exactly when she needs to. She's dealing with many of the same emotions as her father, but, at 17, hasn't learned to control them as well. She wears them on her sleeve and has to try and put them in check while serving as a co-parent for 10-year-old little sis Scottie (Amara Miller). It's hard enough being a teenager, but dealing with such a dramatic upheaval at the same time is a double whammy. Her progress from drunk, night-golfing truant to responsible older sister is not without bumps, but Woodley is natural and a joy to watch. Another reason I'm touting the strength of the cinema this year is the acting, especially by women. Michelle Williams (""My Week With Marilyn""), Kirsten Dunst (""Melancholia""), Carey Mulligan (""Shame""), Rooney Mara (""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""), Leila Hatami (""A Separation""), Charlize Theron (""Young Adult""), Elizabeth Olsen (""Martha Marcy May Marlene""), Felicity Jones (""Like Crazy"") and Keira Knightley (""A Dangerous Method"") are collectively an astonishingly good group of performances. That doesn't even include Glenn Close in ""Albert Nobbs"" or anyone in ""The Help,"" as I haven't seen them yet. Jessica Chastain deserves special praise, however. She was in seven (yes, SEVEN!) films in 2011: ""The Debt,"" ""Tree of Life,"" ""Coriolanus,"" ""The Help,"" ""Wilde Salome,"" ""Texas Killing Fields"" and ""Take Shelter."" I'm still making my way through all seven, but this gives me an opportunity to mention a film that just missed my top 10: Jeff Nichols' ""Take Shelter."" Wow. This one pretty much blew me away and nothing would make me happier than if Chastain and co-star Michael Shannon (""Boardwalk Empire"") were to receive Oscar nominations. Shannon gives a magnificent performance as husband and father Curtis, who may just be going out of his mind and who is deeply aware of that possibility. (His mother was institutionalized for paranoid schizophrenia when he was a child). We've all seen actors portray someone going mad, but watching Shannon walk the tightrope between having delusions and recognizing them as such -- while being powerless against believing them as the truth -- is truly harrowing.

"London (CNN) -- An artwork by Barbara Hepworth, one of the most highly regarded sculptors of the 20th century, has been stolen from a park in London, amid what art experts fear is a metal theft ""epidemic."" The bronze sculpture called ""Two Forms (Divided Circle)"" stood in Dulwich Park for more than 40 years until it was removed on Monday night. The artwork was insured for Â£500,000 ($785,000) but one art expert said it was likely to be sold for scrap for just a few hundred pounds. Two years ago police said they believed that a Henry Moore bronze sculpture ""Reclining Figure,"" valued at Â£3 million, stolen from the late artist's estate north of London was probably sold for just Â£1,500. The crime comes as surging demand for copper, lead and bronze has led to thefts from railway lines, phone lines and even war memorials in Britain. This has led to delays on the rail network, while the theft of cables at a Welsh hospital last week led to the cancellation of 100 operations, including some for cancer treatment. Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register, which tracks stolen works, said the chance of the Hepworth sculpture being recovered was low. ""The police are putting much effort into this theft, but due to the metal theft epidemic it was probably stolen for its scrap value."" The artwork was unlikely to have been stolen by a collector, Radcliffe said. ""Of 2,000 stolen items recovered in recent years, all but two were taken for financial gain. Any collector would want to publicize that they had an artwork so the idea of someone sitting in a cave surrounded by art is just a figment of novelists' imagination."" Art lovers were distraught over the theft of the work by Hepworth, who died in a fire at her studio in St. Ives, Cornwall, in 1975. Simon Wallis, director of the Hepworth Wakefield gallery in northern England, said: ""Barbara Hepworth is one of the greatest artists of the 20th century and appreciation of her work has never been greater. ""Her work is a major part of this country's cultural heritage and we very much hope the work will be recovered, so that the public can once again enjoy Two Forms (Divided Circle) in its original setting."" UK politicians are facing calls to increase controls on scrap metal dealers to counter thefts during the economic downturn. The price of copper has risen exponentially due to increased demand for raw materials from countries such as China, and now trades at more $8,500 per ton. Gold, brass and lead values have also increased by almost 20% in 2011.","Bronze artwork by sculptor Barbara Hepworth stolen from park in London .

"(CNN) -- The company that inspected a Colorado cantaloupe farm at the center of a deadly listeriosis outbreak ignored federal regulators' ""best and most timely"" advice on processing produce, a congressional committee has found. The FDA cited ""serious design flaws"" and a ""lack of awareness"" of safety standards at Jensen Farms as the likely sources of the bacterial contamination behind the deaths. But in a report issued this week, congressional investigators found the company that conducted a July safety audit at the farm, Bio Food Safety, gave it near-perfect marks despite finding three ""major deficiencies."" In particular, it noted that the company washed its cantaloupe in water that was not treated with chlorine or any other anti-bacterial additive -- a process the FDA said was inconsistent with its recommendations and ""a probable cause of the contamination."" The inspector did not take points off for the finding, the report states. ""The guidance which Bio Food Safety did not consider in its audit represents the agency's best and most timely advice on how processing should be handled,"" the House Energy and Commerce Committee concluded in its bipartisan report. The September outbreak killed 30 people, triggered a miscarriage in one woman and sickened more than 115 others -- the deadliest outbreak of foodborne illness in more than a quarter-century, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What is listeria monocytogenes? Bio Food Safety President Jerry Walzel declined comment on the report Wednesday, citing a pending lawsuit. But he told committee investigators that his company followed FDA regulations, and the agency's guidelines are ""opinions."" ""We are not supposed to be opinionated on this,"" the report quotes Walzel. ""We are supposed to go by FDA's regulations ... FDA should have mandated that you cannot sell cantaloupes that have not been sanitized."" The report states that in 2010, Walzel recommended Jensen Farms replace a water cooler used to chill the fruit before packaging, citing it as a potential safety ""hot spot."" The owners replaced the device in 2011, buying equipment that had been used in a potato plant and refitting it. In October, the FDA found that equipment ""did not lend itself to be easily or routinely cleaned and sanitized,"" allowing dirt to build up. It also criticized Jensen Farms for allowing water to pool on the floor of the packing facility: samples of that water tested positive for the bacteria behind the outbreak. Jensen Farms had not returned a phone call seeking comment Wednesday afternoon. The FDA does not regulate private auditors such as Bio Food Safety, a subcontractor for the company Jensen Farms hired to conduct inspections. Under a law passed in 2011, the agency is required to set up an accreditation system and set standards for those firms.","The September listeria outbreak killed 30 people .

According to his enemies -- and there are still as many of those as there have ever been -- this is Rupert at his cynical, death-defying, manipulative worst, seeking to convince the world that his Augean Stables have been swept clean and that his commitment to tabloid newsprint remains undimmed, even as rumors abound of more imminent arrests of Sun journalists for bribing police and other public officials. So is the Sun on Sunday a last hurrah or a phoenix from the ashes? Probably a bit of both. There is no question that the announcement of its launch, coupled with reinstatement of those journalists who had been suspended following their arrests (unless and until charged), has raised morale at Murdoch's Wapping base in London. Proof, they say, that he still has newspaper ink running through his veins and -- while still committed to rooting out past criminal activity -- is intent on demonstrating that there is still a market for good, old-fashioned, raucous, tub-thumping Sunday tabloid journalism. For anyone who cares about journalism -- and jobs for journalists -- that must be good news. But even the less cynical must be asking themselves a difficult question about the new creation: Since it won't be paying private investigators for confidential information, or putting celebrities under surveillance, or hacking phones for gossip, or covertly paying police officers for scoops, what sort of newspaper will emerge from Wapping? And in a market of declining circulations, where the Sun brand is in danger of becoming almost as tainted as its now deceased News of the World sister, will it really make its owner any money? Perhaps Rupert really doesn't care that much, and really does want to indulge his favorite child while demonstrating that even at the age of 80 he can still run a successful newspaper. And perhaps he still sees his newspapers as the route to that political clout that he had become accustomed to wielding so effortlessly in Britain and which -- conceivably -- may not be quite as enervated as some commentators assume and most detractors hope. Either way, realistically the ultimate strategic decision will lie in New York rather than London, within the boardrooms of News Corp. and its institutional shareholders. Much as it might pain Rupert himself, the UK newspaper operation that once provided the fuel for his burgeoning empire is now little more than a flea. More worryingly, the flea is increasingly becoming an irritant and has the potential for infecting the whole operation should evidence of serious and endemic corporate corruption come to light. News Corp's. Management and Standards Committee is still, as far as we know, rooting through over 3 million potentially toxic e-mails and is committed to exposing any wrongdoing in all News International titles. There is still plenty of scope for further scandal, further arrests, further ignominy for the British operation. It is quite plausible that sometime soon, New York will issue the death warrant for a very short-lived operation. Assuming, however, that the death sentence is commuted and that Rupert can deliver a Sunday newspaper with all the verve, scoops and investigative flair -- but without the egregious excesses that have come to typify much of the British tabloid culture -- what next? The Sun is currently selling around 2.7 million copies a day, slightly less than the 2.8 million circulation of the News of the World when it closed. Like all British newspapers -- and especially the tabloids -- it is on a steep downward curve: Ten years ago, the Sun was selling 3.5 million and the News of the World over 4 million. Traditionally Britain, along with Japan, has been home to one of the most vibrant and profitable national newspaper markets in the world, but those days are ebbing away. As advertisers and readers desert to online (and free), the business model for tabloid newspapers is becoming increasingly precarious. That's why it is very hard to be bullish about the Sun on Sunday, even if we attribute to Rupert the most benign of motives: If New York doesn't pull the rug from under his new baby, the inexorable logic of the market almost certainly will.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A 24-year-old man was charged Monday with arson in connection with a rash of car and building fires across the Los Angeles area, authorities said. Harry Burkhart was charged with one count of arson of an inhabited dwelling and will likely face additional charges as the investigation moves forward, said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. Arson investigators counted 52 fires, most starting in parked cars, since Friday morning, but none since the man was was detained at 3 a.m. Monday, according to officials. Burkhart is currently being held without bail. ""These were serious and potentially deadly crimes that needlessly endangered thousands of innocent lives,"" Villaraigosa told reporters. ""These crimes will not be tolerated."" Burkhart is believed to a foreign national from Germany, according to Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck. Authorities hope, and believe one arsonist acted alone, but will behave as though he did not until they know for sure, Beck said. Burkhart's arrest came when a sheriff's deputy stopped a van near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Hollywood early Monday, said Los Angeles Fire Capt. Jaime Moore. The van matched the description of a vehicle believed related to some of the suspicious fires and the driver resembled a man seen in a surveillance video near the scene of one fire, he said. The video showed a man who appears to be in his late 20s to mid-30s, with a ponytail, dark hair and a receding hairline. No one was killed or seriously injured in the fires, though one firefighter and one civilian sustained minor injuries, said Los Angeles City Fire Chief Brian Cummings. Both he and the mayor estimated the fires caused some $3 million in damages. Among the homes damaged was one that was once occupied by the Doors frontman Jim Morrison. Eleven of the fires took place overnight, in the very early hours of Monday: nine within the city of Los Angeles and two in West Hollywood, fire department spokesman Cecco Secci said. Cars were set on fire in Hollywood and Van Nuys, Moore said. Los Angeles has not seen such a rash of fires since the city's riots in 1992.

"(CNN) -- Police on the Caribbean island of Nevis said Monday a local man has been arrested and charged in the recent armed robbery of vacationing Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. The suspect, 28-year-old Vedel Browne, turned himself in Sunday after officials declared him ""a person of interest,"" and released his photo to the media, according to Sgt. Cledwyn Jeffers of the Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force. Browne was formally charged with robbery Monday afternoon, said Sgt. Stephen Hector of the police force. Hector said the offense is a felony and carries a maximum sentence of 20 years upon conviction. Breyer, his wife, her sister, and another guest were in the justice's vacation home February 9 when an intruder armed with a machete broke in and robbed the occupants of about $1,000. Officials said no one was hurt in the incident. The male assailant fled the scene, according to court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg. The robbery was reported to local authorities shortly after it happened. Breyer and his family have since returned home. The justice attended a dinner last week in Washington with Vice President Joe Biden and the visiting Chinese vice president. Police officials in a news release said Browne has worked as a gardener, and Jeffers described him as a ""Rastafarian."" Law enforcement learned of his identity from informants, but it is unclear why Browne was suspected for investigation. A local law enforcement official had said the evidence indicated the incident was ""a crime of opportunity,"" and that police have seen nothing so far to indicate Breyer was targeted for robbery. There was no immediate reaction to the arrest from Breyer's office or U.S. federal law enforcement. The U.S. Marshals Service provides protection for members of the high court when they are traveling domestically, and agency spokesman Jeff Carter said last week the agency was ""aware of the incident involving Justice Breyer on the Caribbean island of Nevis and is assisting the Supreme Court Police and local law enforcement authorities with the investigation as needed."" He did not elaborate. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said after the robbery, ""We are assisting the local police with their investigation."" Commissioner C.G. Walwyn of the Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force had said, ""Our American-trained crime scene investigators and the members of our Criminal Investigators (unit) are working closely with the FBI on this case."" Breyer has had no comment on the matter. The high court resumes public sessions Tuesday, after a month-long recess. Nevis is part of the West Indies chain known as the Leeward Islands, located about 350 miles southeast of Puerto Rico. The court does not talk publicly about specific security arrangements for the justices, either when they are at home or on their frequent travels. During the court's break, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg traveled to Egypt and Tunisia last month as part of an outreach program sponsored by the State Department, which provided her security in the volatile region. Justice Sonia Sotomayor traveled to Guam and Hawaii, and Justice Antonin Scalia gave a speech in Chicago. Attacks on members of the federal judiciary are rare, but not new. Then-Justice David Souter was assaulted by a group of young males in 2004 while jogging alone in the evening near his Washington home. Souter suffered some minor bruises and was briefly treated then released from a local hospital. Justice Byron White was attacked in July 1982 while giving a speech in Utah. That incident led to regular protection by U.S. marshals for members of the court when they travel. The 73-year-old Breyer was nominated to the high court in 1994, and is known as one of the most active and engaging members of the court. His wife is Dr. Joanna Breyer, a renowned pediatric psychologist. CNN's Nick Valencia, Nigel Walwyn and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","NEW: Police on the island of Nevis say a man is charged with robbery in the case .

"(CNN) -- The National Collegiate Athletic Association on Tuesday imposed a postseason ban on The Ohio State University's football program, effective next year, citing the school for ""failure to monitor, preferential treatment and extra benefit violations."" Ohio State had previously said it was vacating all 12 of its victories from the 2010 football season and placing itself on two years' probation after a scandal that cost coach Jim Tressel his job. Tressel resigned after being fined $250,000 and suspended for lying to NCAA officials investigating allegations that his players had received special benefits from local businesses. Several players, including star quarterback Terrelle Pryor, allegedly swapped team and personal memorabilia and equipment for tattoos and other benefits. Tressel became aware of the transactions, which violate NCAA rules, but did not report them on a form that all coaches are required to submit. ""Of great concern to the committee was the fact that the former head coach became aware of these violations and decided not to report the violations to institutional officials, the Big Ten Conference or the NCAA,"" the NCAA Division 1 Committee on Infractions said in its report. Tressel received a five-year show-cause order that limits his athletic-related duties and applies to any NCAA school that may want to hire him. In addition to the postseason ban, the NCAA imposed penalties of additional scholarship reductions, three years' probation, and the forfeiture of almost $340,000 and all of Ohio State's victories for the 2010 season. ""We are surprised and disappointed with the NCAA's decision,"" Gene Smith, Ohio State's athletics director and associate vice president, said in a statement. ""However, we have decided not to appeal the decision because we need to move forward as an institution."" ""My primary concern, as always, is for our students, and this decision punishes future students for the actions of others in the past,"" Smith said. ""Knowing our student-athletes, however, I have no doubt in their capacity to turn this into something positive -- for themselves and for the institution.""","NEW: The NCAA imposes penalties beyond those self-imposed by the university .

"(CNN) -- Charlize Theron won an Oscar for covering up her beauty and finding grains of sympathy, as well as revulsion, for the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster."" She deserves to win a second nomination for playing the sexy, unmoored, utterly reprehensible Mavis Gary in ""Young Adult."" Mavis is one of those people blessed with good looks, talent and brains, but whose sense of entitlement far outstrips any civilized social boundaries. She's a pure narcissist, oblivious to other people's feelings and contemptuous of any experience that doesn't feed her own ego. In other words, Mavis is another monster, but a monster who can pass for beautiful with only a couple of hours in the salon. As we know (you see it spread all over the supermarket tabloids every week), there's a perverse thrill in watching one of the beautiful people fall apart. And there's some of that same schadenfreude in play while watching the new black comedy from the ""Juno"" combo, writer Diablo Cody and director Jason Reitman. Mavis is a ghostwriter for a successful young adult book series, and even that minor claim to fame is soon to be extinguished: The series is played out and the novel she is working on will be the last of them. Perhaps that's why she feels compelled to head back home when she receives an e-mail from an ex-boyfriend, Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson), announcing the birth of his first child. Figuring, very, very, wrongly, that this message must be some kind of coded cry for help, Mavis hops into her Mini and heads straight to Mercury, Minnesota, where she grew up, and where she means to reconnect with Buddy and free him from his domesticated servitude. As plans go, this one has ""recipe for disaster"" written all over it. But Mavis sees things differently: It's all for love, a romantic quest, the oldest story in the book. First, though, she bumps into Matt (Patton Oswalt), a broken-down part-time waiter with a bum leg, who claims to have had the locker next to hers all through high school. The cane is a giveaway - ""You're the Hate Crime Guy!"" -- the hetero victim of a gay-bashing in senior year that left him crippled and understandably bitter. Reitman punctuates the movie with shots of Mavis putting on her camouflage: nail treatments, wardrobe choices. She has style and beauty at her fingertips. But the first time we see her we get a keener sense of this woman on a precipice: sprawled face down in bed, half undressed, hungover. It's the difference between Mavis as she wants to be seen and as she really is, if she could only admit it. Matt is the only one she allows into her trust, either because she badly needs a drinking buddy and he has a distillery in his garage, or because she's so far above him in any social criteria that she understands he poses no discernible threat. But she's wrong about this, too (just as she's wrong about everything). Hovering somewhere between Jiminy Cricket and partner-in-crime, Matt is the movie's comic safety valve. Oswalt steers a path for us, transfixed, attracted and appalled by this woman's reckless, tunnel-vision trajectory. Oswald is also the beneficiary of Cody's most sardonic one-liners, and could wind up with an Oscar nomination of his own. Once or twice Mavis is permitted a shred of insight. Reluctantly reunited with her parents, she softly confesses that she thinks she might be an alcoholic. They foolishly laugh off the revelation, which if nothing else suggests where she may have come by her capacity for denial. Then toward the end, when denial just won't wash any longer, she talks about the necessity for change. But again, she chooses the wrong confessor, and promptly reverts to type. It's a brave movie that crushes our hopes of redemption so conclusively, and a promising indication that Reitman and Cody are growing up. It's not hard to spot familiar feminist, or postfeminist themes from Cody's ""Juno"" and ""Jennifer's Body"" here, reworked with greater complexity and depth. Partly that's a tribute to Theron's performance, of course, which never once succumbs to the ""psychotic prom queen b****"" caricature that one character thinks she sees. Even when she's at her worst (almost all the time), there's always an undertow of panic and disturbance in Mavis, the barely suppressed horror that time is running out and she's thrown her eggs in the wrong basket. We may find it impossible to like her, but it's easy to feel sorry for her.","Charlize Theron plays the sexy, unmoored, utterly reprehensible Mavis Gary in ""Young Adult""

"(CNN) -- Economists pore over central bank interest rate decisions, key retail numbers and consumer confidence figures for signs of economic health -- but could road toll collections also carry clues for the future? Academics at Germany's Institute for the Study of Labor, based in Bonn, believe they can. They have developed a system, called the Toll Index, to tap road toll data for indications of industrial production in Europe's biggest economy. ""Toll collectors use it to bill people, to finance our roads. We use it usefully to solve early forecasting problems,"" Klaus Zimmermann, one of the institute's directors, told CNN. Most heavy vehicles in Germany carry GPS technology which links to a satellite system for collecting road tolls. The data -- which calculates the number of trips made across borders -- is then used by Zimmerman's team for economic forecasting. DSV head Jens Bjorn Andersen, one of Europe's biggest transport companies, points out the industry is one of the first to feel the brunt of an economic downturn. The industry suffers if consumers cut back on spending, because there is less need to transport goods. Transportation was hit by a rapid drop in volumes after the third quarter of 2008, as the global slump kicked in, Andersen said. ""The downturn in the whole world economy was probably seen first in transport companies,"" he added. Driving a truck through Europe's debt crisis . According to Zimmermann, the transportation industry is able to give analysts a quick status check on the economy, rather than having to wait weeks or months for official data to be released. ""[It's] the first forecast of the economy which is actually better than existing economic indicators,"" he said. Nikolaus Askitas, the institute's chief technology officer, said they considered exploring river and rail transport for economic indicators but the trucking industry provided the best data. ""[How do you] bring the product from the production site to the harbor or to the railway station? By trucks,"" said Askitas. The Toll Index still has some kinks, such as inability to differentiate between trucks which are carrying goods for export and those which are not. But its developers argue the speed of its data analysis delivers an insight into market movements as they are happening. CNN's Emily Smith contributed to this story .","Academics have developed a system to examine industrial production by analyzing the number of trucks on the road .

"(CNN) -- The last time you went to the doctor's office, you probably got some numbers representing your pulse, blood pressure, maybe even cholesterol and weight. But what does that really mean for you? Alexander Tsiaras, founder of theVisualMD, wants you to be able to see the processes that are making you as healthy or as sick as you are and act on that knowledge. TheVisualMD has detailed, colorful libraries that visualize aspects of sickness and health based on real medical data, and it is now presenting a new tool for breaking bad habits in 2012. The new program, which launched this week, is called ""The 9 Visual Rules of Wellness."" Each rule is accompanied by a slew of videos, visualizations and interactive graphics. More components of wellness rules will be rolled out every Monday over the next several months until April 9. ""If I could see inside myself the healing, and I could see the progress of it, that is inspiring, and that would keep you on the path of following your pathway back to health,"" Tsiaras said. ""That's where I think the power of visualization stands."" Tsiaras developed the wellness rules program in collaboration with mind-body healing guru Dr. Deepak Chopra. ""When you add a story to data , you give it soul,"" Chopra said in an e-mail to CNN. ""[We] worked together to see how we can inspire people to take charge of their well being and feel emotionally committed to it. This is the future of well being."" TheVisualMD aims to have companies sponsor all of the rules. The rule's sponsor is Quest Diagnostics. The first rule is called Baseline Your Health. That means knowing where you are in terms of measures like blood pressure, pulse, weight, blood counts and cholesterol levels. When these indicators are out of whack, they can lead to poor health. To understand what these tests at the doctor's office measure, you can look through the Biomarker Library, which shows you visually what these measurements mean to your body. The library explains what value ranges mean and what problems may stem from abnormal values. Besides detailed graphics and videos, the site features chapters on things like how to keep your blood pressure healthy -- manage your stress, lose weight, get enough sleep and don't smoke. Subsequent wellness rules are meant to help define your wellness mission, develop and maintain nutritional balance, get aerobic and anaerobic exercise, avoid smoking, take a moderate approach, make sleep a priority, manage your stress and embrace joy. The website also will launch a personal health record feature, where you can keep track of your own health indicators and create a sort of health narrative of your life, Tsiaras said. There are generally four types of people who will use the 9 Rules of Wellness, Tsiaras said: There's the great athlete who wants to get in even better shape. There's the person who's well and wants to stay that way. There's the person who already has high cholesterol, or needs a stent or has to take control of health in order to not get worse. And then there's the person who has had chemotherapy or a severe surgery and needs to get on a wellness program in a specific way. Breaking bad habits is one fundamental goal of the program. Tsiaras remembers he used to go home and run every evening, but after starting a family and a company, the pressures of being a good husband, father, pet owner and boss turned that run into a glass of wine. Then a second glass of wine, and a third. It turned into 10 pounds within a couple of years. His brain became accustomed to having that wine, to the point where the day was not complete without it. ""One of the problems is that we have now demanded too much of wellness,"" Tsiaras said. ""It's almost impossible to be well and to be accomplished in the Western world."" The key to kicking a habit like this is taking small steps, Tsiaras said. Replace the behavior -- such as the wine -- with a run or a stretch. And he's not saying you can't indulge every now and then. For instance, if you're exercising and controlling stress and love chocolate, it's fine to have a piece of chocolate. ""It's when you have the bar of chocolate, and you're becoming sluggish, you're feeling tight, and you feel like you're aging, then you sort of have to go back and look at the size of the piece of chocolate,"" he said. Like the biological systems he studies, Tsiaras' personal story is intricate and complex. Despite attending schools such as the prestigious Amherst College, he did not graduate from college. At 19, he went to his parents' village in Greece and spent a year herding goats on the Macedonian-Albanian border. He wrote a book on ancient funeral and exhumation ceremonies called ""Death Rituals of Rural Greece."" ""When I came back I wanted to find for my artwork that kind of drama,"" he said. ""I found it in the X-ray files of teaching hospitals."" Tsiaras became inspired by seemingly mundane black-and-white medical scans from the lab of his brother, an ophthalmologist. His photography of medical procedures became featured in LIFE magazine. To take his ideas to the next level, Tsiaras needed to be able to communicate with people in a wide range of disciplines and then bring those ideas together. He taught himself advanced mathematics and physics and, later, computer languages. He designed a lens for a microscope responsible for photographing the first images of human eggs in an in vitro fertilization program. A photograph of a fetus from outside the amniotic sac came about because of a lens he designed. And he started the company Anatomical Travelogue, the umbrella of theVisualMD. Despite not having a formal medical education, Tsiaras has been able to showcase biological systems as never before. What he calls ""visualizations"" are not photos or animations, but rather the result of a collaboration between illustrators, biologists, programmers and researchers working with raw data. Through their expertise, numbers and static black-and-white scans come to life. Tsiaras and Chopra met at the TEDMED conference in 2009, right after Tsiaras showed a film about fetal development. ""As soon as I hit the bottom stairs, there was Deepak Chopra there saying, 'Only you can visualize consciousness,'"" Tsiaras remembers. ""I had no idea what he was talking about."" But the two got to talking about mind-body connections, and the value of CT and MRI scans in visualizing them. They got to thinking about what happens in the brain not only when you're stressed out, but also when you're feeling joy. What happens if you're a good parent and nurture your child? We hear so much about things going wrong in your body -- what happens when you do something right? These are some questions that they were interested in tackling together. And the last rule of wellness is, of course, ""embrace Joy."" Tsiaras is often amazed as he sees how data can be transformed into meaningful visualizations that showcase processes in the body. At a certain point, he says, it becomes personal. For instance, while studying the effects of some experimental Alzheimer's drugs on beta-amyloid plaques associated with the disease, he found out his mother has the disease. ""The only thing you can do is get up in the morning and say, I've got this very powerful data that if I can illuminate it to the point and interpret it to the point where I can help a researcher come to an epiphany because of the clarity of the information about what we're actually seeing, then I've done something good for my mother,"" he said.","TheVisualMD has launched '9 Rules of Wellness'
The first rule: Know where you're starting from .
Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress and joy are other topics .
The website makes use of visualizations, which bring medical data to life ."
"Seoul (CNN) -- South Korea's actions toward Pyongyang after the death of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il were intended to show that Seoul does not have animosity toward the North, President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea said in a meeting with political leaders Thursday. Lee told members of the governing and opposition parties that he believed North Korea had probably not expected South Korea to take such measures toward the North. Seoul expressed its sympathy to the North Korean people through a statement on Tuesday, a day after North Korea's state-run media announced the death of Kim. South Korea also said that while it would not send an official delegation to the North, it would allow a limited number of private groups to send delegations to the North if desired. It also announced that it would let civilian groups send messages of condolence to the North upon approval of the Unification Ministry in Seoul. Pyongyang said Thursday that it would welcome a private delegation from Hyundai Asan, a South Korean company with heavy investments in the North, to pay respects to Kim. North Korea delivered the message -- addressed to the chairwoman of Hyundai Group, Hyun Jeong-eun -- through the company's office in the North's Kaesong Industrial Park some 45 kilometers (27 miles) north of Seoul, said Roh Jee-hwan, a Hyundai spokesman. Hyundai Asan has held a working level meeting with the government to discuss the details of the trip, according to the Unification Ministry. The recent moves have been considered a break from the hardline approach to the North that Lee's administration had taken since coming into office in 2008. It contrasted with Seoul's reaction to the death of North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung, in 1994 when the conservative South Korean government at the time did not offer its condolences. ""The swift stabilization of North Korea's leadership is in the interest of all neighboring countries,"" Lee said Thursday. Many observers see the recent moves as efforts by Lee to improve the soured relationship with Pyongyang after tensions flared last year because of the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel and the shelling of an island near Seoul. Seoul demanded an apology for the sinking of the ship, which killed 46 seamen, but Pyongyang denied involvement. And North Korea said the South had provoked the bombing of the island, which led to four deaths. ""The death of Kim Jong Il can be seen both as a crisis and an opportunity,"" said Kwon Young-se, the chairman of the South Korean Parliament's Intelligence Committee and a member of Mr Lee's governing party. ""The decision that the Lee Myung-bak administration made to express its condolences, I think, reflects a choice to consider what has happened in the past but also think about the future."" Kwon said he believes that by extending sympathy to the people of North Korea, as opposed to North Korea as a country, the Lee administration has found its own compromise. Lee's efforts with the North are much less advanced than those of the two previous governments, under which the leaders of the two Koreas held summit talks in Pyongyang, Kwon said, but noted that Lee has made the first step toward improving what had become a tense, cold relationship between the two capitals. Public opinion in the South is divided on whether it is appropriate to pay respects to Kim. Critics have called for a more proactive approach by Lee, suggesting that sending condolences to the North Korean people was too indirect. Some South Koreans argue that now is the time for Seoul to seize an opportunity to make a breakthrough in North and South relations, while others say the idea of paying respects to the dictator is out of the question. ""We don't pay respects in the South to someone who has committed atrocities, why are we even discussing this issue?"" an internet user posted on an online message board under the username hwachon11_1. ""I know there's a lot of debate about the issue, but I think we need to see the North as a nation that we want to reunify with"" a person using the name brit4men posted on the same message board. ""I think it's only appropriate we send a delegation.""","Seoul has expressed sympathy to the North Korean people after Kim Jong Il's death .

"(CNN) -- For the residents of Christchurch, New Zealand, time stopped at 12.51pm on February 22, 2011, when a massive earthquake ripped through the city, destroying homes, lives and businesses. One year on, reminders are never too far away, from the broken buildings to frequent aftershocks that rattle the city every day. Some are too minor to feel; others cause a sharp intake of breath. ""February, 22, 2011... is a date permanently etched into all of our minds, a date that will go down in the history of New Zealand as one of our darkest days,"" Prime Minister John Key told crowds gathered for a civic memorial service in the city Wednesday. The magnitude 6.3 quake shook the city for a matter of seconds, but it was long enough to kill 185 people from 14 countries. Many more were injured. The tremor brought down buildings in the city center in the middle of the working day, trapping workers and triggering a national state of emergency as rescuers scrambled to save lives. Most of the victims -- 115 -- were buried in the rubble of the Canterbury Television (CTV) building, which was later found by a government report to have been poorly constructed. One survivor, Anne Vos, spoke to the media by cellphone as she lay trapped under her desk in the rubble of the five-story Pyne Gould Corporation building. After being pulled out, 24 hours later, she told CNN, ""I was finding it hard to breathe, and I really thought that was it for me. I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here.'"" Anne Vos: A survivor's story . One year later, Christchurch remains locked in recovery mode, a city carved into zones labeled by color to indicate the severity of the earthquake damage to homes and land. For residents in the red zone, there is no future there. Around 6,800 homes, many clustered along the Avon River, have been designated for destruction. The government says around 46% of residents in the red zone have accepted its offer to buy their land. Some have cut their ties with the area; others are still wading through insurance claims on homes waiting to be destroyed. Before the quake, 22-year-old desktop publisher Sarah Boyd lived with her partner in Avonside, a small suburb that has now been condemned. ""It was a tiny wee suburb and nearly every house there has gone,"" she said. ""They said that our house was sinking towards the river. They reckon all land would travel towards the river."" They moved out of the red zone in November, but Boyd said their new home suffered damage during the February quake and subsequent aftershocks, and may also need to be demolished. Boyd works at the office at the Catholic Diocese of Christchurch, which suffered a blow during the quake with the near collapse of the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament. It is currently being propped up with shipping containers while work continues to determine exactly how much of the building can be saved. The brightly-colored containers can been seen dotted through the city, at the makeshift ""Re:Start"" mall in the city center and along roads below unstable cliffs considered to be at risk of landslide. ""It's a city of two parts really,"" said Matt O'Connell, the earthquake recovery coordinator for the Catholic Diocese, who works in the same office as Boyd. Last week he took part in an Ecumenical door-knocking team made up of representatives from varying faiths in the city. ""Even just on one street we met a family there who are struggling for food who had eight to ten people living in a two-bedroom house,"" he said. ""A lot of people are tired, stressed and frustrated. The rebuild seems to be going relatively slowly. There are lots of issues."" Recovery efforts are being hampered by frequent aftershocks. The February 22 quake was one itself, after a larger, magnitude 7.1 quake the previous September. That one ran deeper so caused less damage. The government said there have been 10,000 quakes since last September, including 39 of a magnitude of five or greater. ""We had a really good run from June until December the 23rd, then we got hit with a magnitude six quake, two days before Christmas. It really, really set people back. There was further damage, no one was injured, but it was a psychological blow for many people,"" O'Connell said. While people struggle to recover, work continues to rebuild shattered buildings and infrastructure. Prime Minister Key has said the recovery plan is making ""good progress."" Construction has started on 26 ""significant"" commercial buildings in the city center. Work on 80% of the 1,406 buildings marked for partial or full demolition has been completed. And 200 infrastructure repair projects are now underway, he said. ""Long term Christchurch will look much different but it will be vibrant, new and a great place to live,"" Key added. Thousands have not stayed around to find out. Population figures released in October, the first numbers made public since the quake, showed more than 10,000 people had left the city in the year to June 2011. On the eve of the anniversary, the city buried the unidentified remains of four people who were killed in the quake in a new cemetery. It will be one of the more somber reminders of that day. The city came to a halt for two minutes at 12.51 local time, as residents paid their respects to those who were killed. Tomorrow they'll get back to the long, drawn-out task of rebuilding their lives and moving forward.","Magnitude 6.3 quake shook city on February 22, 2011 .

"(CNN) -- ""The Nutcracker"" ballet, as most North Americans know it, is about magic. A wooden toy transforms into a prince, mice and toy soldiers engage in battle, a little girl journeys to a sugar-coated paradise where she is treated to a series of decadent dances. But does it need more magic, Carolina Ballet director Robert Weiss wondered, prompting a search for ways to make his company's version of the classic George Balanchine staging of the ballet more ""magical."" ""I've always felt the magic in 'Nutcracker' was rather bland, and that if we could get a real first-class magician to come in and help us figure out how we could enhance the show, it would really take the whole ballet and kick it up a notch,"" said Weiss. ""The whole thing is about magic, it's Clara's dream, so the more magical we make it, the better,"" he said, watching a dancer attached to cables float across the stage of Chapel Hill's Memorial Hall during final rehearsals last month. From Russia to Raleigh with love: Teaching 'Nutcracker' in the South . It was no small feat, but after months of planning and rehearsing with Las Vegas illusionist Rick Thomas, the show opened earlier this month featuring a levitating ballerina, flying Drosselmeyers and a few other surprises. The company also invested in glittering new sets for the first time since its inaugural ""Nutcracker"" production in 2001. In a career spanning nearly five decades as a dancer, teacher and company director, Weiss has played all the male Nutcracker roles except Drosselmeyer. Therefore, he was sensitive to concerns that introducing special effects would turn the show into Las Vegas-style fare. Those concerns were put to rest as soon as rehearsals began, the dancers said. ""They're not flashy tricks or people doing gymnastics. They're illusions that add to the story at just the right moments,"" principal dancer Melissa Podcasy said. ""The story is intact, the choreography is the same, it just adds that element of visual wonder."" As the cash cow that allows many ballet companies to pursue projects with less mainstream appeal the rest of the year, ""Nutcracker"" productions are constantly being refreshed and marketed in different ways to bring in larger crowds. Carolina Ballet's use of illusions might represent this season's most substantial modification of an existing production, but each company has its own means of reaching bigger audiences. National Ballet Canada continued its tradition of guest walk-ons during its Saturday performance with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who dressed as a Russian Petrouchka doll and shot a cannon into the audience to begin the battle scene in Act I. The New York City Ballet's Nutcracker was broadcast Tuesday in movie theaters nationwide. Morning talk show personality Kelly Ripa hosted the live broadcast, which included backstage interviews and a visit to the School of American Ballet, the official school of the New York City Ballet and home to the young ballet students who perform in the production. A nationally televised broadcast followed on Wednesday evening on PBS' ""Live from Lincoln Center."" Other companies organize extra events and activities to enhance their ""Nutcracker"" experience. Attendees of the Pacific Northwest Ballet's production, a collaboration between choreographer Kent Stowell and illustrator Maurice Sendak, can also enjoy a family brunch or a ""date night,"" take their pictures with characters from the show or meet the Seafair Pirates. Not everyone in the arts world regards ""The Nutcracker"" as a tradition worth embracing. In a 2009 Washington Post column, Sarah Kaufman wrote that ""to those of us who despair of its pervading tweeness and wish ballet had something better to do at this time of year than endlessly reminisce like a sweet, whiskery auntie, it bears some bad news, too. 'The Nutcracker's' stranglehold is all but squeezing ballet dry."" Regardless, companies in small cities like Raleigh rely on their adaptations of E.T.A. Hoffmann's book ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" to introduce ballet to audiences that wouldn't attend otherwise. Amid the country's economic slump, ""Nutcracker"" ticket sales have gone down each year, making each investment all the more crucial, Weiss said. ""Ballet's still an esoteric form to many, and for many, they don't go to see Carolina Ballet, they go to see 'Nutcracker,' "" he said. ""Because we don't have money, every decision we make is that much harder. We have to take a hard look at what we gain,"" he said. ""Do we spend an extra $5,000 to $10,000 on lighting to get it at its highest level, or should we get a new snow machine because it's not putting out as much as I'd like?"" Weiss brought the idea of adding special effects to his board and convinced them that a little bit of magic was what they needed to get ticket sales back to pre-recession levels. He enlisted the aid of Thomas, a Las Vegas headliner known for incorporating tigers, birds and dancing into his long-running act. Weiss sent a video of the ballet with thoughts on where illusions could possibly fit in. From the start, he was firm that Thomas' stunts could not alter the choreography or the music. They ended up with a dancing doll who floats a few feet above a table and dancers who suddenly pop out of empty boxes. The key was to create illusions that were convincing but easy for someone who's not a ""true magician"" to pull off, he said. From there, the dancers had to learn to interact with the stunts and engage the audience. ""I'm overwhelmed to see how great the show turned out and how far the dancers have come,"" he said. ""People think you have to go to Las Vegas to see great talent but it's right here in North Carolina.""","Carolina Ballet introduces levitating ballerinas, disappearing dancers into show .

"(CNN) -- Pueblo, Colorado bills itself at the ""Home of Heroes,"" the only city with four living recipients of the Medal of Honor, the highest award for combat bravery and sacrifice. Former local resident Pam Sterner and her husband, Doug, were behind the grassroots effort to get community leaders to formally recognize these military heroes. It was only the start of the 53-year-old woman's journey to protect their heritage of service that has taken Pam Sterner to the U.S. Supreme Court, where the justices will debate a federal law she helped create, draft, and sell to often skeptical congressional lawmakers. The law is the Stolen Valor Act, which makes it a crime to falsely make a verbal, written, or physical claim to a military award or decoration. The court will hear arguments Wednesday in this free speech dispute, involving a California lawmaker who lied in office about earning the Medal of Honor. ""It was much tougher than I had expected, I thought this law was bipartisan, and would be a shoo-in,"" Sterner told CNN of her years-long efforts. ""Despite all that I still would have taken this on, I was just a little naive at the start."" Sterner is not lawyer, and never served in the military, but her husband did two tours in Vietnam and now advocates for veteran rights on his website www.homeofheroes.com. The couple has also been long involved in helping ferret out military medal frauds, working out of their home, often with their own money. That was the inspiration for the Stolen Valor Act, which began almost by accident. Pam Sterner works at a Washington non-profit, and also performs as a ventriloquist with her partner Otis. She had returned to college at middle age at Colorado State University as a political science major. While pondering a class assignment in 2004, she happened to overhear her husband talking to an FBI agent about a man profiled in a newspaper, falsely claiming to have won the Medal of Honor. ""Doug was exasperated and said there's nothing we do about these fakes, based on existing policy, which is Title 18 of the U.S. Code"" of criminal procedure, recalled Sterner. ""I said it was about time someone did something about this. And I decided right there I would."" She told her professor she would write her paper about these impostors and then go further: transform it into law. ""These fakes had slipped through the cracks of the law, and (that) was not the intent of the original law. I felt everyone who lied about this should be punished, not those that just committed monetary fraud or similar crimes. My professor said good intentions were not enough. I had to sell it and explain why people should care."" Step one was a meeting with a local congressman, which did not go well. Pam Sterner then called on newly-elected Rep. John Salazar (D-Colorado). The military veteran was instantly sold on the idea. His staff work for months with Sterner and others to draft the legislation and make sure it met legal scrutiny. That was when frustration set in. Pam Sterner is a lifelong Republican but her congressional sponsor is a Democrat, who after three terms in Congress is now Colorado's Agriculture Commissioner. Sterner says Republicans who controlled Congress were not too eager to let a freshman Democrat in a key political swing district like the Colorado Third get political mileage out of a supposedly bipartisan bill. The Stolen Valor legislation hung up in committee for months. ""It took awhile, but we had great support eventually,"" said Salazar, speaking by phone from his Colorado ranch. ""Pam and Doug went beyond the call of duty to make it happen, they were instrumental."" Pam Sterner earned a special school fellowship to visit Washington for her project and also helped raise funds to personally march the halls of Congress. Using one-on-one time with representatives, it was a strategy that worked surprisingly well. ""Pam is not some slick lobbyist, she's a straight shooter from Pueblo who just talked common sense,"" said her husband. ""She always believed one person can do almost anything. And once the congressmen heard from her personally, they supported her. On this she succeeded beyond her dreams."" Pam Sterner's persistence finally paid off in 2006 when she was on hand to watch Congress easily pass S. 1998, the Stolen Valor Act. It was only after the Justice Department began prosecuting fake heroes that the legal challenges began, on free speech grounds. ""This is a narrow bill, it deals with something Congress specifically decided needed to be addressed,"" she said. ""To me it's not a free speech issue, it's a fraud issue. When someone devalues the bravery of other rightful heroes, it devalues everyone."" She cites as her inspiration a quote from President George Washington, who created the Purple Heart for those military members who have ""given of his blood in the defense of his homeland."" ""Should any who are not entitled to these honors have the insolence to assume the badges of them, they shall be severely punished,"" said Washington. Pam Sterner worries if the Supreme Court overturns the law, it would only make it easier for military frauds to ride on the backs of others' bravery. ""I'd be heartbroken if we lost. The problem would escalate, I'm sure of that."" The Sterners next mission: to secure a government-funded national database of all medal citations, making it easy for the public -- employers, voters, family, almost anyone -- to easily check who has received what. Privacy concerns have blocked previous efforts. Doug Sterner's own comprehensive database has been his obsession in recent years. Working on his own time and with his own money, his lists are routinely used by the FBI. The database was recently bought by the Military Times, and he now devotes his efforts to keeping it up to date and comprehensive. Both he and his wife remain modest over their efforts. ""I was glad I could play a small part in preserving the honor of our military heroes,"" she said, ""so that those who would try to lie about it or benefit from it are exposed for what they are.""","Pam Sterner made the law a mission .

"(CNN) -- The family of South Carolina lobbyist Tom Sponseller asked for the public's help Tuesday in locating the missing man. Sponseller, 61, is head of the South Carolina Hospitality Association. He was last reported seen in his Columbia office around noon on Saturday. ""Anybody that has any information we'd love for them to come forward,"" daughter-in-law Lauren Sponseller told HLN's Ryan Smith. ""We need some information from someone and we know someone has to have some type of information on this. So anything that can be helpful, please, we ask you for that,"" she said. According to a Facebook page set up by Sponseller's family, investigators found his car in the garage next to his office. There were no signs of a struggle or ""anything else that would cause alarm,"" it said. Police have not yet ruled out the possibility of foul play, said Columbia police spokeswoman Jennifer Timmons. ""We don't know what happened to him ... we can't assume right now,"" she said. Sponseller is slightly more than six feet tall, weighs 160 pounds and is balding, with gray or white hair. He typically wears glasses. According to a police report, Sponseller was involved in a car accident about a year ago, in which he blacked out prior to the crash and possibly had a seizure. His family made various attempts to reach Sponseller on his cell phone Saturday, but was not successful. He has no history of ""this type of behavior,"" the police report read. ""Tom was supposed to meet us to see my son's Pinewood Derby for Scouts that (Saturday) afternoon at 2 and he did not show up to the event.

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is on course to win a record sixth end-of-season tennis championship after beating David Ferrer in London on Saturday to reach his 100th career final and return to third in the world rankings. The defending champion triumphed 7-5 6-3 in one hour and 25 minutes to set up a ATP World Tour Finals showdown with sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Sunday. He extended his winning record against the fifth-seeded Spaniard to 12-0 in career meetings, and is now unbeaten in 16 matches after winning titles in his hometown Basel and Paris in the past month. The 30-year-old now has the chance to surpass Ivan Lendl and Pete Sampras, who won the tournament five times in the 1980s and '90s respectively. Djokovic exits as Berdych beats Ferrer at ATP Tour Finals . ""It's obviously a special occasion for me tomorrow playing my 100th final, possibly winning my 70th title and winning my sixth at the World Tour Finals,"" Federer said. ""It was a tough match. I could clearly see why David beat Murray and Djokovic here -- he takes the ball really early, is able to generate great angles off his plays and is super consistent. ""It was a key 5-4 game for me to hold and then break the next game. Then, actually, break again early on in the second set. That was a crucial sort of 15-20 minutes for me. I'm happy I was able to decide the match right there."" Ferrer will now turn his attentions to the Davis Cup final, as Spain take on Argentina in Seville on his more favored clay surface next weekend. He started the week with a bang, beating Andy Murray in straight sets before the third-seeded Briton pulled out with a groin injury. Ferrer then thrashed world No. 1 Novak Djokovic, but suffered a surprise defeat to Berdych on Friday that meant the Czech went through as Group A winner and avoided Ferrer in the semis. Federer, who beat Rafael Nadal in last year's final, has reached the title match for the seventh time after winning all four matches this week at the indoor hard-court event. Tsonga continued his strong end to the season with a 6-3 7-5 win over seventh seed Berdych in Saturday's second semi. The Frenchman will seek to avenge his Paris Masters final defeat by Federer, also losing to the 16-time grand slam champion in their Group B encounter in London. However, the 26-year-old has won two of their seven clashes this year -- most notably at the Wimbledon quarterfinals as Federer suffered his first defeat when leading by two sets in a grand slam.","Roger Federer beats David Ferrer 7-5 6-3 in semis at ATP World Tour Finals .

"(CNN) -- Brooke Mueller, the ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen, was arrested early Saturday in Colorado and charged with assault and cocaine possession, police said. Shortly before midnight Friday, police encountered a woman at the Belly Up -- a bar and performance venue in Aspen -- who said Mueller had been ""the aggressor"" in an assault, the Colorado city's police department said in a news release. Mueller was found and arrested after midnight at another bar, Escobar, according to Aspen police. She was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, which is a felony, and third-degree assault, which is a misdemeanor. She was released after posting an $11,000 bond, said Aspen police. A court date is scheduled for December 19. Mueller has appeared as an actress in several movies, including 2004's ""A Love Song for Bobby Long,"" according to IMDb. But she is more widely known as the ex-wife of Sheen, with whom she has twin sons. The boys and Mueller were part of Sheen's volatile public fall-out with CBS earlier this year as he left his starring role on the network's ""Two and Half Men."" She claimed in March that he'd threatened to kill her, saying, ""I will cut your head off, put it in a box and send it to your mom,"" according to a declaration made in a restraining order against Sheen. The revelations led to a court order removing the 2-year-old boys from Sheen's home. The actor called the allegation ""colorful"" and described the quote attributed to him as fabricated in an interview with NBC's ""Today Show."" Mueller has sought out help for substance abuse and ""stress"" related issues in the past. Last December, her attorney Yale Galanter said that she entered a sober living facility. Nine months earlier, in April 2010, Mueller checked into a treatment facility for help with stress management to prevent a ""return to old problems,"" her representative said. She was in substance abuse rehab earlier in 2010 ""to get her health in order,"" Galanter said at the time.

"Fort Meade, Maryland (CNN) -- After four days of testimony and 20 prosecution witnesses, Pfc. Bradley Manning's defense attorney spent only 35 minutes Wednesday questioning just two witnesses before resting their case. Manning is accused of committing the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. history. His Article 32 hearing is part of the military's process of determining whether he should face court martial. The first defense witness called was Sgt. Daniel Padgett who served with Manning in Iraq and witnessed one of several angry outbursts witnesses have described. Padgett was the senior enlisted man on the night shift in the intelligence office where Manning worked. He testified that in December 2009, Manning was late for duty and they sat down in a conference room so Padgett could counsel him. Padgett said when they began talking, Manning was calm, but that he began to change. At some point, said Padgett, Manning grabbed the conference room table and turned the table over, knocking a computer and radio to the floor. Because there was a rifle in the room, Padgett testified that he didn't want Manning to get his hands on it, so ""I coaxed him away from that, put my hands on his shoulder and coaxed him away."" At that point another soldier came in the room, subdued Manning, sat him down and Padgett continued counseling him, Padgett testified. When asked by Manning's attorney David Coombs if Padgett remembered Master Sgt. Paul Adkins, the senior enlisted man in the unit, talking with him about the incident, Padgett said ""vaguely."" Padgett testified said he did not discuss the outburst with the major who oversaw the intelligence analysis officers, the company's first sergeant nor the company commander. Manning was not moved out of the intelligence office after the outburst and did not lose his security clearance as a result of the outburst. Coombs has argued that the Army should have known about Manning's emotional issues and kept him away from classified materials. Manning is accused of stealing and leaking nearly three-quarters of a million classified documents from the State Department and the Defense Department to the WikiLeaks website, which published many of them. The leaks occurred while Manning was serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010. Prosecution witnesses testified that Manning downloaded and leaked 400,000 DoD field reports from Iraq and 90,0000 similar documents from Afghanistan. There was also evidence presented that he downloaded and leaked more than 250,000 State Department cables. Coomb's second witness, Capt. Barclay Keay, testified by phone about his time with Manning's unit. For a short time in December 2009, he was an officer in the intelligence analysis office where Manning worked. Keay said he often saw soldiers listening to music in the office where classified materials were analyzed. At first he thought it was not proper, but he was told it was ""an accepted practice"" that was ""tolerated because it helped soldiers be more productive."" In news reports before the hearing, Manning is said to have bragged in a chat room that he was able to download materials onto a CD while pretending to listen to Lady Gaga. Keay told the hearing, ""I do feel like he wanted to be a good soldier. He did good analytical work."" Even though he called only two, Coombs had requested 48 witnesses, ten of whom were already on the prosecution witness list. The investigating officer overseeing the case granted those ten and two other defense witnesses who were not on the prosecution list. He rejected other requested defense witnesses, including President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Mark Zaid, a national security attorney, said the fact the defense called only two witnesses is not surprising. ""For one thing, an Article 32 (hearing) serves as an opportunity for the defense to obtain pre-trial discovery, and particularly information they do not know. Additionally, the likelihood of stopping charges from going forward is non-existent in this case so there is little value in telegraphing to the prosecution information the defense may possess but might not yet have revealed,"" said Zaid. Closing arguments from both sides are scheduled to start Thursday morning. After that the Investigating Officer, Lt. Col. Paul Almanza, who oversaw the hearing, will consider the testimony and evidence and make a recommendation as to whether Manning should face court martial and if so, on which charges. The burden of proof at this level of the military justice system is ""whether reasonable grounds exist to believe that the accused committed the offenses alleged."" The Special Court Martial Convening Authority, Col. Carl Coffman, has given Almanza until Jan. 16, 2012 to submit his recommendation. But, if needed, Almanza can request more time. Witnesses for the prosecution have characterized Manning as being troubled by Army discipline and testified that he allegedly bragged on the Internet about the leak of classified documents. Army investigators also testified that they found evidence linking Manning to the leaked documents on computers he used. Prosecutors have leveled 22 charges against the Army private, including aiding the enemy. If convicted on all counts, he could face the death penalty. However, Army prosecutors have signaled they will not recommend death in the event of a conviction, and it is unlikely they would be overruled by a senior officer. On Tuesday, a convicted computer hacker from California who became a confidential informant for the Army testified about six days of online chats that he had with someone he believes was Manning. Adrian Lamo said he traded instant messages in a chat format with someone self-identified as Bradass87. Lamo testified that based on an e-mail he received from Manning, as well as an examination of Manning's Facebook page, that Bradass87 was Manning. Army Criminal Investigation Command Special Agent David Shaver later testified that the chat logs that Lamo provided to the Army largely matched chat logs found on Manning's computer in Iraq.","NEW: Manning's defense calls only two witnesses .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If you had to describe one Hollywood actress as ""heavyweight"" Meryl Streep would be a pretty strong contender for the title. Pulling no punches: Streep as fiercely caustic nun, Sister Aloysius in John Patrick Shanley's 1960s morality drama ""Doubt."" Over 30 years in the movie business the actress has pulled no punches, receiving an incredible 15 Oscar nominations, and winning twice, for ""Sophie's Choice"" in 1982 and ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" in 1979. Even so, ""Doubt"" director John Patrick Shanley says was knocked sideways by Streep's ""tooth and nail"" performance in his Oscar-nominated drama, ""Doubt,"" describing himself as ""quite astonished."" Streep, who has been nominated for a Best Actress award at this year's Academy Awards for her role, stars as fiercely caustic nun, Sister Aloysius, the iron-gloved principal of a religious school in a working class New York neighborhood in the 1960s. ""Meryl really wanted to do the role because, I think, she thought it was really right for her,"" Shanley told CNN in a recent interview, adding, ""I have to say I was quite astonished at her amazing facility."" But it was the rapport between Streep and Oscar-winner Philip Seymour Hoffman who plays Father Flynn that was central to getting the story across. Shanley says their relationship was electric. All he had to do was put them on set and wait for the sparks to fly. ""The set became like the ring that prizefighters go into,"" recalls Shanley. ""They would just sit in their respective corners when they weren't shooting, with their heads hanging down, in some private universe of some very, very tormented place, and get ready to do that scene. ""And then when they were called to do it, they would get in there and the walls would shake."" Shanley approached Streep first when he was casting the film, but knew he would need to find a formidable actor to play the Father Flynn, which is why he chose Hoffman -- ""the smartest guy that chose to become an actor that I've ever met."" ""I knew that when I closed my eyes, I didn't know what he would do with the role,"" Shanley told CNN, ""I knew that if I didn't know then Meryl wouldn't know and that would keep her on her toes."" Hoffman's portrayal of Flynn, the modern-thinking humanist whose progressive sermons and personal habits -- like an enjoyment of three sugars in his tea --rankle austere Aloysius, has won him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The story is set in the Bronx, New York in 1964 just after the Kennedy assassination and on the cusp of the civil rights movement -- a time of social flux. It centers on a moral crusade Sister Aloysius launches against Flynn who she suspects of taking an unhealthy interest in Donald Miller, his altar boy and the school's only black student. The film begins with a simple question: did he or didn't he? The ensuing battle between Aloysius and Flynn is old against new with religious, ethical, political, gender and racial elements all thrown into the mix. The power of the drama is all in the dialogue, especially the confrontations between Aloysius and Flynn. The beauty of the story is that it does not answer any of the questions. iReport.com: iReporter thinks Streep will win . Shanley's mantra during filming was to never lead the audience to any one conclusion, allowing people to view the tale through the reflection of their own biases. It was hard to get this delicate balance in emotionally intense scenes but, says Shanley, with actors of Streep and Hoffman's caliber his approach was to use a very light touch. ""It's often just nuance,"" he told CNN, explaining how he and Streep worked together while filming one of the film's confrontations. ""We were in the middle of it and Meryl was going with Phil tooth and nail and she got very sarcastic with him. ""And I said 'Cut' and said 'Ok, we have that. Now let's do it again and this time take the high road.'"" ""And she did every single thing differently and yet within character and she took the high road at every turn."" He says Hoffman takes direction in a completely different way. ""With Phil, you give him information and it goes through a pipeline about a quarter mile long and then it shows up, and how it shows up, I don't know. ""I don't know what that process is exactly. He's a very internalized actor but he hears everything you say and he makes his adjustments accordingly."" ""Doubt"" is based on a Tony award-winning and Pulitzer prize-winning play also written by Shanley, which the director adapted for the big screen. Shanley, who won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 1988 for ""Moonstruck,"" has been nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. As well as Streep and Hoffman's, there are Best Supporting Actress nominations for Amy Adams who plays a mouse-like, innocent nun who teaches at the school, Sister James, and stage actress Viola Davis who plays Donald Miller's mother.","Director John Patrick Shanley was ""quite astonished"" by Streep's acting in ""Doubt""

"(Financial Times) -- Eurozone governments are looking to the European Central Bank and national central banks to help pare back the cost of a second rescue package for Greece which would otherwise amount to €170bn. Figures seen by the Financial Times reveal Greece needs €136bn in fresh bail-out funding from the European Union and International Monetary Fund -- in addition to the €34bn left over from Greece's first bail-out. This is €6bn more than EU leaders agreed in October. Germany, the Netherlands and Finland have insisted on paying no more than €130bn. Eurozone finance ministers, who meet in Brussels on Monday to hammer out a deal to save Greece from default, hope the ECB can contribute by forgoing some of the future profits it would earn on its Greek bondholdings, which it has said it is willing to do. Senior officials said they would also discuss a possible contribution from eurozone national central banks whose bondholdings could be included in a €200bn debt restructuring to be launched alongside the bail-out. Q&A: Is Greece facing a disorderly default? A central bank contribution would help the eurozone and IMF to keep their contribution to €130bn. It would also reduce Greece's ratio of public debt to gross domestic product in 2020 closer to the 120 per cent the IMF deems sustainable, permitting it to take part in a second rescue. In a conference call on Sunday evening, eurozone finance ministry officials were still debating the terms of debt restructuring -- including whether to force more losses on private bondholders -- and how to bring down the size of the total bail-out. But senior officials said they believed a deal would be reached at a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Monday in Brussels. ""I don't think there is a majority to go a different way because a different way is enormously arduous and costs lots and lots of money,"" Maria Fekter, the Austrian finance minister, told local television. Pressure from the US and emerging market countries to restrict the IMF's exposure led to the lower contribution, according to officials familiar with the negotiations. Greece has already borrowed far more relative to its own financial contribution to the IMF than any other crisis loan recipient in the IMF's history. The IMF portion of the new package, which will be added to the remaining €10bn in IMF commitments from the first Greek bail-out, will be converted into a lending programme with a repayment period of up to 10 years rather than the five years under the current loan. The €170.5bn rescue package does not include €35bn that will be set aside temporarily to ensure Greek banks can fund themselves when Athens is ruled in ""selective default"" after the restructuring. The new bail-out includes €35.5bn for private bondholders as part of the debt restructuring. Of that, €30bn is expected to come in a direct payment to bondholders in cash or bonds issued by the eurozone's rescue fund in exchange for writing off €100bn in Greek debt. The remaining €5.5bn is interest payments still owed on existing bonds, though officials are considering cutting that amount. Opinion polls in Greece show the two big mainstream parties -- centre-left Pasok and centre-right New Democracy -- continued to suffer ahead of April elections because of their support of tough austerity measures accompanying the bail-out. Support for New Democracy dropped to 24 per cent or lower in three new polls, with Pasok showing only at best 14 per cent -- meaning the two parties, the only to explicitly support the bail-out's terms, would not have a majority in a new parliament. François Baroin, French finance minister, said on Monday morning that all the elements for an agreement were in place. ""All the elements are in place . . . both with the bankers, private sector creditors, and public sector creditors, the states and central banks,"" he told Europe 1 radio. Though senior European officials said figures were still being negotiated, the IMF contribution to the new rescue will be far lower than originally anticipated. The figures show the IMF will only contribute €13bn to the second bail-out, far less than the one-third lent in the Irish, Portuguese and first Greek bail-outs. ""The IMF is expected to be stingy,"" said one senior European official.

"(CNN) -- The grandmother and stepmother of a 9-year-old Alabama girl who died Monday after allegedly being ordered to run around her family's house -- for hours -- as punishment for lying about taking a candy bar have been charged with murder, police said Wednesday. ""Joyce Hardin Garrard, 46, and Jessica Mae Hardin, 27, were both arrested and charged with murder in connection to the death of Savannah Hardin,"" Capt. Jeremy Walker said in a news release issued by the Etowah County Sheriff's Office. Garrard is the child's grandmother and Jessica Hardin is her stepmother. At about 6:45 p.m., the stepmother called 911 and said that Savannah, who had run for about three hours, had suffered a seizure and was unresponsive, the release said. ""A very unnecessary act,"" said Etowah County District Attorney Jimmie Harp in a telephone interview about the incident, which occurred Friday. ""(The) taking of a candy bar turned into (an) all-day marathon ... until the point of time she just collapsed."" Savannah Hardin died Monday at Children's Hospital in Birmingham; a state pathologist in Huntsville ruled her death a homicide. ""Preliminary reports show Savannah was extremely dehydrated and had a very low sodium level,"" the release says. ""It's sad when a family is grieving over the death of a daughter and granddaughter and so soon to find out that the death could have been prevented,"" said Sheriff Todd Entrekin, whose office became involved after witnesses called investigators to express concerns. ""We have always said that we will protect the rights of those who cannot defend themselves,"" he continued. Savannah was a third-grade student at Carlisle Elementary School. Garrard and Hardin were being held in the Etowah County Detention Center in lieu of a $500,000 cash bond.","Stepmother and grandmother of 9-year-old girl are charged with murder .

"(CNN) -- One of the main opposition videographers in Homs was killed on Tuesday as the Syrian city experienced its heaviest day of bombardment, residents and activists told CNN. ""Rami al-Sayed was crucial in getting the truth out through his videos posted on the Internet,"" said Omar Shaker, a friend and a volunteer at Homs Media Center, a media group set up by activists to share information and videos about the city's Baba Amr neighborhood. ""We will really miss him, especially the medical team who relied on him to document all the civilian injuries and deaths on video,"" he added. Doctors struggle to save wounded children . Al-Sayed's own fatal injuries were also apparently recorded on Tuesday as his brother and a physician mourned his death at a mosque's basement. The video was later uploaded to Al-Sayed's YouTube channel. See Al-Sayed's YouTube channel . In the video, Dr. Mohammed al-Mohammed stands by al-Sayed's dead body and says, ""I want to bring you the latest news, the martyrdom of one of the most important cameramen and one of our most important journalists in Baba Amr."" ""He kept bleeding here in the field hospital for more than three hours; we tried to evacuate him outside the neighborhood but to no avail,"" al-Mohammed added. Health workers set up underground network . The 27-year-old was hit by rocket shrapnel as he tried to help a family flee bombardment, residents told CNN. ""Rami was killed because he was documenting and sending real-life stories from Baba Amr. Rami was killed because he was filming the facts; but we will have 1,000 Ramis. ... Our revolution will prevail,"" the doctor said as the camera zoomed in on shrapnel wounds on al-Sayed's chest, abdomen and legs. The video-sharing site Bambuser released a statement Tuesday mourning al-Sayed's death, also referring to him as ""Syrian pioneer,"" his nickname on various social media outlets. ""Rami Ahmad al-Sayed has been one of the bravest and forefront fighters in getting the world's attention on what's going on in Homs, Syria. This afternoon, cameraman and journalist Rami Ahmad al-Sayed did his last broadcast -- he and his three friends were soon after this killed by the Assad armed forces,"" the statement said. U.S. calls for international action on Syria . CNN was unable to independently verify the circumstances of al-Sayed's death. His last message to followers on Twitter was: ""Baba Amr is facing genocide right now. I do not want people to simply say our hearts are with you! We need actions. We need campaigns everywhere inside Syria and outside Syria. We need all people in front of all embassies all over the world. In a few hours there will be no place called Baba Amr and I expect this to be my last message. No one will forgive you for just talking without any action!"" Al-Sayed, who had lost a cousin and a fellow videographer in December, is survived by his wife and an 18-month-old daughter.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- While Google waits for regulatory approval on its bid to acquire Motorola Mobility, company executives have repeatedly worked to assuage partners' fears that the Android software developer is preparing to compete with them. Partners in Google's mobile-phone venture were understandably skeptical when the Android maker said this summer that it planned to acquire one of their rivals, creating a potential reason to roll out improvements to its popular smartphone operating system on Motorola phones before offering them to others. Google has offered free and open-source versions of Android to anyone ambitious enough to download it and tinker with the code. Dozens of smartphone and tablet makers have taken Google up on this, and have come to rely on it for their businesses. Google, which assured them it is focused on software, not hardware, seemed like a logical partner. Then, when the company's intentions to buy Motorola surfaced, Google execs said they were mainly doing so in order to protect themselves and their partners against patent litigation. (Motorola has about 24,000 patents either approved or pending). The $12.5 billion acquisition still has not cleared federal oversight, and so Google has not been talking publicly much about its plans. A spokesman declined to comment on the matter last week. Since CNN's inquiries, Google Chairman Eric Schmidt has been discussing some plans for Motorola on a three-city tour of Asia this week. He told an audience in South Korea on Tuesday that the acquisition will ""not change in any material way the way we operate,"" and then told a group in Taipei, Taiwan, on Wednesday that Google plans to continue providing legal defenses to Android partners, according to Reuters. Sony Ericsson CTO Jan Uddenfeldt said at a conference last week that Google still maintains it is buying Motorola primarily for the patent portfolio of one of the world's oldest mobile-phone companies. ""The last thing they would like to happen is to create a vertical, because that would destroy the market share for Android,"" he said onstage at the Open Mobile Summit here on Thursday. Google led the market in the most recent quarter, thanks in part to wide adoption by many companies, with 43% of smartphone owners using Android phones, according to research firm Nielsen. Apple and BlackBerry-maker Research in Motion operate vertical businesses in which they maintain and control their own hardware and software. In the nearly three months since announcing a bid for Motorola, the strategy to remain a neutral player ""has been clearly communicated to us by Google, and it makes sense,"" Uddenfeldt said in an interview. ""We are an all-Android company now,"" Uddenfeldt said. ""We do not hesitate to be an Android company."" Even with Motorola's help, Google could struggle to transition from a software developer to bringing hardware products to market, Uddenfeldt said. ""Google is a great software company, but they are not a consumer brand,"" he said. Google has suggested that it plans to leverage Motorola's hardware expertise in order to understand how to integrate software more closely with hardware, Kevin Packingham, the senior vice president for Samsung Electronics products, said in an interview. Patents are perhaps secondary in terms of how the acquisition will benefit partners, he said. ""I wouldn't say that it's black and white about wanting to be vertical,"" Packingham said. ""Google needs the capability to understand how to deeply integrate with the hardware."" That could turn Motorola, a storied mobile innovator, into a glorified research-and-development arm. In the meantime, Motorola is laying off 800 of its 19,000 workers, and the company is preparing to launch the Droid Razr, the spiritual successor to one of the most popular phones of the last decade. Not surprisingly, the new version runs on Android. Even more so than Motorola, Samsung has been very close with Google over the last two years. The pair has twice partnered for what's called the ""lead device program,"" in which Google and a hardware maker collaborate on the first product that will run a major new version of Android. Together, they developed the Nexus S and the upcoming Galaxy Nexus. Google has also worked with HTC for the Nexus One and Motorola for the Xoom tablet. Being chosen as the lead-device partner is a competitive advantage, Packingham said, because the company gets direct access to Google engineers and to Android code before rivals. Samsung expects to continue to work with Google on some lead devices in the future, he said. Andy Rubin, Google's head of mobile, said during a Google conference call in August announcing the Motorola acquisition that the new unit will be run as an independent business. As for preferential treatment regarding lead devices, Rubin said Motorola ""will be part of that bidding process."" According to Packingham, Samsung was chosen for two of the three Nexus phones because of its hardware expertise and access to components, and there is no bidding involved in the lead-device program. The Google spokesman declined to comment on how exactly the process works.","Google's mobile partners say the Android maker won't be like Apple .
They say Google has no plans to become a ""vertical"" phone maker .

"Colonia Juarez, Mexico (CNN) -- In the rolling hills of northern Mexico, about 180 miles south of the U.S. border, lies a community that stands out for its religious roots. The houses in this community surrounded by peach and apple orchards look more like homes you would find in the American Southwest than in Mexico. On top of a hill stands a gleaming white Mormon temple, a rarity in this largely Catholic country. Miles Anthony Romney is a resident in this community called Colonia Juarez and a practicing Mormon. The 50-year-old owner of orchards and a fruit packing plant says his family descends from Mormons who settled in this area more than 125 years ago. ""They established the apple orchards, the peach orchards, farms, ranches, and that's basically what we do today,"" Romney said. ""We come from a hardworking family. We come from honest people."" Romney tied with Obama in latest poll . Miles A. Romney's great-grandfather led the first group of Mormons to the state of Chihuahua, the same Mormons to whom the family of U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney traces its heritage. In fact, Mitt Romney's father, George -- who also ran for president in the United States -- was born in this area himself in a town called Colonia Dublan. And Miles Anthony Romney is Mitt Romney's second cousin. Miles Romney is so proud of Mitt Romney's political career that he managed to get a Romney bumper sticker sent to Mexico which he proudly displays on his pickup truck. He also has a Romney campaign sign on his window. And he says he can't understand why Mitt Romney's religion is an issue for some people. ""I think it's a misunderstanding on their part. I know people try to use that against Mitt, but they just can't find anything on him to dig up about him,"" Romney says. The first Romneys arrived in this part of Mexico around 1885. They came from Utah, said Kelly Wayne Romney, where as Mormons, they felt they had to deal with religious persecution and the controversy over polygamy. There are still about 40 members of the Romney family here in Colonia Juarez who trace their roots back to those first settlers. Kelly Romney is also a resident of Colonia Juarez. The 69-year-old is Mitt Romney's second cousin as well. He says that, among the first settlers, ""it was actually a very small percentage of the church that practiced polygamy."" The community hasn't practiced polygamy since the church banned it in the late 1800s. His peach and apple orchards, together with those owned by other members of the Romney family, are a crucial source of employment in this part of Mexico. A fruit packing cooperative owned by several of the Romneys is also an important economic engine in the community. The Romney family and other Mormon settlers built a bilingual school in 1904 that is attended by the children of all the members of the Mormon community. Kelly Romney says Mitt Romney himself has never been here, but the fruit grower says he saw him once in the States. ""I was on a plane one time from Salt Lake City to New York and he was on it. My wife kept trying to get me to go meet him, but I guess I was a little timid and thought, 'Well when we get off in New York I'll meet him,' but we got off and he went on to Boston,"" Kelly Romney said. As much as he admires his second cousin, Kelly Romney says he disagrees with his position on immigration. ""There should be guest worker programs for these [Mexican] people that are practically starving to death to be able to go over there and do work that the American people would not do,"" Romney said. More than anything, this branch of the Romney family defines itself by the teachings of its church, and feels allegiance to both Mexico and the United States. Kelly Romney says he knows the national sports of both countries equally well. But when asked what country he would root for in a soccer match between the United States and Mexico, he replies ""Mexico!"" with a quick smile. ""We have a loyalty to this country. We were born here,"" Romney says.","Republican Mitt Romney has cousins in Mexico .
They came from Utah to settle in Mexico in the late 1800s .

"(CNN) -- A bullet thought to have been from a shootout between carjackers and municipal police in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, struck a woman walking in neighboring El Paso, Texas, Tuesday morning, El Paso's mayor told CNN. The still unidentified woman, 48, was shot in the lower leg; her injuries were not considered life-threatening. El Paso Mayor John Cook said local police investigating the incident had not officially confirmed that the bullet came from Juarez, but they were ""treating it as if it did,"" he said. ""It's still matter of speculation,"" he added. ""Early on, it became evident this may have been a stray bullet rather than a targeted shooting in downtown,"" local police said in a press release. ""The El Paso Police Department continues its investigation and is working closely with its counterparts in Mexico."" If the bullet did in fact come from Mexico, this is ""the first time a person has been hit"" in the 3Â½ year since drug-fueled violence escalated in neighboring Juarez, Cook added. In Juarez, a shootout between suspected carjackers and the municipal police happened around 11 a.m. (1 p.m. ET), about the same time the woman was shot, according to municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez. He was unaware of any connection between that shooting and the incident in El Paso. ""We have an office that works with the U.S. and so far we have not received a report from them saying the two incidents were connected,"" he added. El Paso police said that while they were responding to the shooting, the El Paso 911 center ""received numerous calls advising of shots fired near the border in Juarez, Mexico."" Just about a mile separates downtown El Paso from Juarez. ""Under the right circumstances there is a possibility that a round fired from an AK-type weapon could travel that far, conceivably,"" Mike Brooks, HLN Law Enforcement analyst told CNN. ""It depends on what kind of round it is and how heavy the round is."" ""We're advising the citizens of El Paso that this is an isolated incident. We don't want people to start panicking,"" he said. At least four schools in El Paso went on lockdown shortly after the woman was reported being shot. ""We were alerted by local police about concerns in the area,"" Estela Reyes, the press officer for the La Fe Preparatory School, told CNN. ""We were in lockdown by 11:30 a.m. and lifted it about 30 minutes later. The kids were never in any imminent danger,"" she said. Reyes said her school is about ""seven or eight blocks"" from downtown El Paso and she never heard gunfire from Juarez. In June 2010, the El Paso City Hall was struck by several rounds, which local police believe the shots may have come from a shooting in Juarez. About two months later, a similar incident occurred when a building at the University of Texas at El Paso was struck by a bullet. School officials believe that round also came from a shooting in Juarez.","A woman in downtown El Paso was struck in the leg by a bullet Tuesday .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's largest unions carried out mass protests across the country Sunday in response to labor-market changes announced by the government. Protesters packed the streets of Madrid, marching against measures they said will make it cheaper and easier to fire workers. Sunday's demonstrations were the first major union protests against Spain's new conservative government, which took office two months ago. Spain's unemployment rate is nearly 23%, and its youth unemployment rate is nearly 50%. About 5.2 million people in the country are jobless. Last week Spain's parliament approved the labor reforms, which the nation's Cabinet approved earlier this month. Government officials have argued that the new labor reforms will reduce unemployment and give workers more rights, such as an annual 20-hour paid leave for training. ""We don't think that. We think unemployment will increase because these reforms directly attack workers,"" said Ismael Cabrera, a protester. Demonstrators said the reforms -- which also reduce the amount of severance employers must pay -- will further cripple the country. Pedro Munoz, a welder, said he was marching Sunday because he was worried about his grandchildren's future. Business administration student Raquel Tapia Solascasas carried a large pair of cardboard scissors, protesting cutbacks in education. ""They offer you internships for a year and they fire you without severance pay. There's no future for young people here,"" she said.","NEW: ""There's no future for young people here,"" says a protester .

"New York (CNN) -- The mayor of Newark has called for an investigation into a far-reaching New York Police Department surveillance program that was allegedly conducted in the New Jersey city's Muslim's neighborhoods. ""The Newark Police Department was not involved in joint operations with the New York Police Department as was described in the disclosed NYPD report,"" Mayor Cory Booker said Wednesday, referring to a leaked internal New York police document that allegedly detailed police surveillance of Muslim-owned business and mosques across the city. ""I strongly believe that we must be vigilant in protecting our citizens from crime and terrorism but to put large segments of a religious community under surveillance with no legitimate cause or provocation clearly crosses a line,"" he said. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also called the development ""disturbing"" and has asked the state's attorney general to investigate. The 60-page report, first obtained by The Associated Press, showed maps of Newark and photographs of Muslim residences and mosques. There was no statement in the document regarding terrorism or criminal activity. The New Jersey mayor's statement comes a day after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg defended the extent of police surveillance against critics who have suggested authorities went too far. ""We have to keep this country safe,"" the mayor told reporters, addressing questions about a separate report, also leaked to AP, that indicated the New York police were closely monitoring Muslim student associations in schools across the Northeast. ""If people put things on websites and make them available to everybody, of course the NYPD is going to look at anything that's publicly available in the public domain,"" Bloomberg said. ""And given we've had a dozen people arrested or convicted of terrorist acts who've come from similar organizations, we have an obligation to do so."" That report said police have tracked websites, and on one occasion sent an undercover officer with students from the City College of New York on a whitewater rafting trip. ""The police department goes where there are allegations,"" Bloomberg said. But Yale University President Richard Levin described New York's surveillance program as ""antithetical to the values"" of the New Haven, Connecticut, university and those of the nation. When a reporter asked if police had gone too far by sending the agent on the rafting trip, Bloomberg responded, ""No."" Police spokesman Paul Browne told CNN that his agency does not monitor students directly but confirmed it monitors websites they use. ""In any case where you see an NYPD officer present, it's an indication that we were looking at an individual,"" he said. The Columbia University Muslim Students Association condemned the police practice in a statement this week. ""We are concerned that news reports about NYPD's presence on our campus have a chilling effect on the intellectual freedom necessary for a vibrant academic community,"" it read. In December, a prominent group of Muslim leaders boycotted Bloomberg's annual interfaith breakfast in protest of the controversial program. The move stemmed from a series of earlier news reports that raised questions about the nature of a CIA partnership with the New York police that allegedly helped to build city intelligence programs to spy on Muslims. The boycott stood in a stark contrast to the goodwill the mayor earned among Muslim leaders when he defended plans for a controversial Islamic community center near the former site of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan. The CIA later announced its internal watchdog found no issue or evidence of wrongdoing in the spy agency's partnership with New York police.","Newark's mayor calls for investigation into New York Police Department surveillance .

"OTTAWA (CNN) -- Canadian officials say they have arrested a man convicted in 2002 of child molestation in Arizona. Steven Dyer was arrested Tuesday night at a Montreal airport as he returned to Canada from a trip, Canadian authorities said. Dyer was convicted in Arizona in 2002 of 12 counts of sexual conduct with a minor and one count of public sexual indecency with a minor present, according to authorities. He had been released on bail in late 2001 and failed to show up for court proceedings. He was convicted in absentia and faces a minimum prison sentence of 169 years in Arizona. Canada Border Services officials say they had information that Dyer had been living in Vancouver under an assumed name, and they were following up on a tip when he was arrested in Montreal. Dyer was in custody in Montreal Wednesday, and Canadian authorities say he will now face charges in Canada. Dyer was featured on the program ""America's Most Wanted."" According to the program's website entry on Dyer, the charges against him in Arizona involved incidents with two youths.","Canadian officials say they were following up on a tip when they made the arrest .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Speculation and messages of support surged in Venezuela Wednesday, a day after President Hugo Chavez announced he would travel to Cuba for surgery. Doctors there will remove a lesion in the coming days from the same area of his body where doctors removed a cancerous tumor last year, Chavez said. The 57-year-old Venezuelan leader told state media in a phone interview late Tuesday that there was a high likelihood that the lesion was cancerous, due to its location, which he did not disclose. ""If it turns out to be malignant there will surely need to be another phase of radiation therapy, and this would slow me down, of course,"" he said. In June, Chavez said doctors in Cuba had removed a cancerous tumor but did not specify what type of cancer it was. He announced in October that treatment had cured him of cancer. Word of the new operation, which Chavez first announced on state television Tuesday afternoon, comes at a critical time, about seven months ahead of a presidential election. ""To my competitor, a son of God as I am, I wish him a successful operation, a quick recovery and a long life,"" opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski said Wednesday in a Twitter post. The president's allies sent strong messages of support. ""The president will have his treatment. The president will be with us in the campaign, he will be our candidate and he is our candidate for October 7. ... The revolution will continue with Chavez in front,"" said Diosdado Cabello, president of Venezuela's National Assembly. But some Venezuelans said they were skeptical. ""What surprises me is that the president had said before that his cancer was completely cured, so it took all of us by surprise,"" attorney Lourdes Rivas said. ""There is great anguish and uncertainty about whether he will be a candidate with such poor health."" Store owner Carlos Picardo said he was confident the Venezuelan president would pull through. ""Of course it's quite sensitive, but he is going to come out of this like he has come out of everything else. He will survive this. And if he does not, well, he is mortal like all of us,"" he said. In his interview with state television late Tuesday, Chavez said he was confident he would leave a legacy in Venezuela, no matter what doctors discover. ""Truly at this stage of life...I am no longer myself. Truly I am the people, and I say this with much humility, but that's how I feel. Independently of the days, years, et cetera that may be left in my physical life, I know that when I truly leave...I will remain alive for many years...I live in the people and the country,"" he said.

"(EW.com) -- Holy moly, America. For the first time since Christmas weekend in 2008, four movies debuted to more than $20 million each this weekend: ""The Vow,"" ""Safe House,"" ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,"" and ""Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace 3D."" The first three of those four films far exceeded industry expectations, helping to make this the biggest non-holiday February weekend ever. The box office was also up around 30 percent compared to the same weekend last year. ""The Vow,"" starring Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum, led the way with a hearty $41.7 million -- the strongest opening so far this year. That also marks the best debut ever for the Sony-owned label Screen Gems (beating ""Dear John's"" $30.5 million), which produced the film with Spyglass Entertainment. With Valentine's Day around the corner, audiences were clearly in the mood for love, especially considering that ""The Vow"" was the first major romantic drama to hit theaters since November's ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn -- Part 1."" According to Sony, 72 percent of ""The Vow's"" audience was female. The PG-13 movie, which cost $30 million to produce, received an okay ""B"" rating from CinemaScore graders. Not too far behind was the Denzel Washington thriller ""Safe House,"" which took in $39.3 million. That represents the second-best opening ever for Washington, after 2007â€²s ""American Gangster."" According to CinemaScore, 72 percent of moviegoers said the actor was their reason for buying a ticket, confirming Washington's status as one of the few performers who can guarantee a solid turnout. The R-rated movie, which cost $85 million and also stars Ryan Reynolds and Vera Farmiga, attracted a diverse crowd. African Americans made up 38 percent of the audience, followed by Caucasians (31 percent) and Hispanics (23 percent). The film's audience was evenly split fifty-fifty between men and women, and CinemaScore participants gave it an ""A-"" rating. ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,"" which saw Dwayne Johnson take over leading-man duties from Brendan Fraser, surprised the industry with $27.6 million. By comparison, its 2008 predecessor ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" opened to $21 million. Of particular note, the PG-rated sequel rose a massive 94 percent from Friday to Saturday, indicating that it was the movie of choice for family audiences. ""Journey 2"" also performed particularly well in 3-D, with three-dimensional showings accounting for 74 percent of its gross. The $79 million film received an ""A-"" grade from CinemaScore moviegoers. The only new movie that didn't overperform this weekend was the 3-D re-release of ""Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,"" which collected $23 million. The film was front-loaded, dropping 1 percent from Friday to Saturday as ""Star Wars"" enthusiasts rushed out to see it opening day. But family audiences clearly opted for ""Journey 2"" over Jar Jar and company. Still, $23 million is nothing to get upset about, Anakin, especially for a re-release. The figure tops last month's 3-D re-release of ""Beauty and the Beast"", which debuted to $17.8 million. And ""The Phantom Menace"" jumped past ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"" and Shrek 2 on the all-time domestic list. With a total of $454.1 million, the movie is now the fifth-highest grossing domestic release ever (not adjusted for inflation, of course), and it will soon pass ""Star Wars"" ($461 million) to settle into the No. 4 spot. Among holdovers, ""Chronicle"" dropped only 44 percent for $12.3 million. That's an impressive hold for a ""found-footage"" film; by comparison, ""The Devil Inside"" plummeted 76 percent and ""Paranormal Activity 3"" slid 66 percent.

"(CNN) -- Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy is $2 million richer on Sunday after holding his nerve to beat American Anthony Kim in a play-off at the Shanghai Masters at Lake Malaren. With both players sending their approach shots into the same greenside bunker, Kim missed his resulting three-foot putt, allowing world number three McIlroy to tap home from two feet to collect the richest current first prize in golf. ""It was a very important win. I'll be the first to say I have not won enough in the last four years as professional and could have done a lot more,"" McIlroy told reporters. ""I was under pressure on the back nine and was one shot behind, so to be able to come back and win gives me a lot of satisfaction,"" added the 22-year-old. U.S. Open champion McIlroy had led the 30-strong field from the opening day, but a wayward final round saw him having to dig deep to card a level par 72 to finish on a 72-hole total of 288 (-18). That score tied with Kim's four-round effort, although a final round three-under par 69 ensured he was the only player to card four sub 70 rounds. Kim collected $750,00 for second place, with American Hunter Mahan and Korean youngster Noh Seung-Yul tied for third place five strokes behind the leading two. The tournament was unsanctioned by any major tour and was bankrolled by billionaire property tycoon Shi Jian. It is the joint largest single first prize ever awarded in golf, equaling the fund offered in the Nedbank Golf Challenge in South Africa. That tournament is also unsanctioned, although since that event first offered $2m to the winner in 2000, the $4.8m prize fund is now spread more evenly among the 12 players competing.","Rory McIlroy holds his nerve to win the Shanghai Masters in a play-off .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Smithsonian Institution officially began construction Wednesday on a new museum dedicated to African-American culture and heritage -- a complex committed to the celebration and study of one of the central components of the American story. Construction of the Smithsonian's 19th museum, the National Museum of African American History and Culture -- to be located on the National Mall -- is expected to last three years. The museum is slated to open in 2015. The nation's first black commander in chief, President Barack Obama, delivered remarks highlighting the importance of the museum's location. National Museum of African American History and Culture. ""It was on this ground long ago that lives were once traded, where hundreds of thousands once marched for jobs and for freedom. It was here that the pillars of our democracy were built, often by black hands,"" the president said. ""And it is on this spot --- alongside the monuments to those who gave birth to this nation, and those who worked so hard to perfect it --- that generations will remember the sometimes difficult, often inspirational, but always central role that African-Americans have played in the life of our country."" The museum ""will be a place where all Americans can learn about the richness and diversity of the African American experience, what it means to their lives and how it helped us shape this nation. A place that transcends the boundaries of race and culture that divide us and becomes a lens into a story that unites us all,"" according to the Smithsonian website. ""This was true bipartisan effort, echoing the museum's message of unity. What a magnificent location, in view of powerful symbolism. It is a fitting home for this museum, invoking the indelible threads that connect African American stories to the American tapestry,"" said Wayne Clough, secretary of the Smithsonian. Former first lady Laura Bush and Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis -- an icon of the civil rights era -- were among the other speakers celebrating the start of the museum's construction. ""I look forward to the day when I can amble through the exhibit, search through the archives, participate in a program, rest my tired feet in a cafe and get lost in history inside the granite wall of an idea whose time has finally come, "" Lewis predicted. ""We didn't give up, didn't give in. We didn't give out. We didn't get lost in a sea of despair. We kept the faith. We kept our eyes on the prize."" The five-acre site, selected six years ago by the Smithsonian, is located between the Washington Monument and the National Museum of American History. The museum will be the first environmentally sensitive ""green"" building on the Mall. It is expected to cost $500 million, half of which will be covered by federal funds. The groundbreaking ceremony was emceed by actress Phylicia Rashad, best known for her role as Claire Huxtable in the 1980s sitcom hit ""The Cosby Show."" Opera singers Denyce Graves and Thomas Hampson also performed. CNN's Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Groundbreaking held for Museum of African American History and Culture .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The Islamic State of Iraq has claimed responsibility for Thursday's attacks in that country that killed dozens of people and wounded hundreds more. The umbrella group, which includes al Qaeda in Iraq, issued an audio message that was posted on an al Qaeda-linked website. ""Shiite forces have been conducting campaigns, targeting Sunni people inside their homes day and night,"" the group's spokesman, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, said in the message. ""I am calling on Sunni people in Iraq to wake up before it's too late and put their hands with the jihadis' hands and stand against the Shiite campaign,"" he said. Al-Adnani added a warning that ""the gates of hell have opened"" and that the Islamic State of Iraq ""will carry out more attacks in the near future by suicide bombers, car bombs and roadside bombs."" He specifically threatened that the group will track down Shiite judges and investigators. The series of explosions and shootings Thursday killed at least 44 people and wounded more than 200 in Baghdad and elsewhere, police said. While most of the Baghdad attacks targeted majority Shiite neighborhoods, explosions also took place in the majority Sunni provinces of Salaheddin, Diyala, and Mosul. The country has seen more coordinated attacks since U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq at the end of 2011, the official said. An Iraqi government spokesman declined comment Thursday. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said it ""strongly condemns"" the terrorist attacks. ""These heinous acts targeted people going to work and shopping, children going to school and security forces working to protect the citizenry,"" the embassy said, adding the attacks were ""targeted at all the people of Iraq in a desperate effort to undermine Iraqi society and its institutions."" The United Nations' Assistance Mission in Iraq also condemned the violence ""in the strongest possible terms."" ""The continuing violent attacks on Iraqis are totally unacceptable and have to stop,"" said Martin Kobler, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general, in a statement. The attacks ""are meant to hinder the achievement of national unity and stability,"" he said. Iraq's Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish leaders have squared off in recent months after an arrest warrant was issued for Tariq al-Hashimi, the country's Sunni vice president. Al-Hashimi is accused of organizing his security detail into a death squad that targeted government and military officials. The warrant was issued shortly after the vice president's Sunni-backed Iraqiya party said it would boycott Parliament, saying Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki was cutting it out of the decision-making process. Al-Hashimi last week denied the charges in a televised speech, saying the Iraqi judicial council is under the control and influence of the central government and that the charges are ""politically motivated."" Iraqi officials expressed concern Thursday that the violence could cast a shadow over Iraq's hosting the next Arab summit on March 29. The government said earlier this month that logistical and security arrangements had been agreed upon for the event.","The Islamic State of Iraq claims responsibility for Thursday's attacks .

"(Financial Times) -- Walmart is taking a 51% stake in Yihaodian, a leading Chinese e-commerce website, in a significant move by the U.S. retailer to boost its online presence in China. Walmart did not disclose financial details for the partnership, which Neil Ashe, president and chief executive of Walmart Global e-commerce, said would help deliver a ""superb customer experience"" to consumers in China. ""This is testament to how seriously Walmart is developing their e-commerce platform in China. Having a controlling stake obviously gives them a much more direct say in how Yihaodian expands,"" said Torsten Stocker, an analyst with the Monitor Group. Founded in 2008, Yihaodian is one of the fastest growing companies in China, selling more than 180,000 products ranging from grocery items to consumer electronics and apparel. Yihaodian, in which Walmart already held a minority stake, runs logistics centers in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Wuhan and Chengdu and is able to offer same-day and next-day delivery. The Chinese consumer e-commerce market is dominated by homegrown online retailer Taobao. Walmart remains a relative novice in e-commerce in the United States where the market is led by Amazon. Online sales account for a tiny percentage of Walmart's total U.S. revenues, but in the past year it has sought to boost its in-house expertise by acquiring two U.S. technology companies: Kosmix, which specializes in organizing information from social media sites such as Facebook, and Small Society, which develops apps for mobile shopping. While Walmart's website sells dried and packaged food as well as general merchandise for delivery across the US, its only involvement in selling fresh food online is a small pilot program launched in San Jose, California, last year. Walmart has more than 350 stores in China, where it has been making steady progress. In the three months to the end of October it reported a 16.1% increase in China sales from the previous year, but although individual shoppers were spending more money on each trip, visitor numbers were down 7.1%. The company this month appointed Greg Foran, a 30-year industry veteran, as the chief executive of its China business. Mr Foran will take over next month. His predecessor, Ed Chan, stepped down in October, the fourth senior-level departure for the China business in six months. In October, Walmart China closed its stores in Chongqing for a fortnight after the local government found it had mislabeled ordinary pork as organic. ""Monitoring Walmart is as effective as punching cotton,"" Tang Chuan, head of enforcement at the Chongqing Administration of Industry and Commerce, told Xinhua news agency at the time. Mr Ashe said that, in addition to helping Walmart's e-commerce goals in China, the increased investment in Yihaodian would ""further contribute to China's domestic consumption, help stabilize prices, and advance expansion in the middle and western regions"" of China -- a nod to Beijing's oft-repeated desire to make progress on these goals in the current Five Year plan. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Walmart has more than 350 stores in China .

"LEWES, England (CNN) -- Tired of soaring prices and uncertain financial markets, a small town in southern England is fighting back -- with its own local currency. Tuesday evening, the wealthy English town of Lewes plans to launch the Lewes Pound as a complementary currency to the British pound. About 50 local traders have agreed to accept it, and organizers are selling the notes at a discount to entice people to buy them. ""If you spend a pound in a supermarket,"" campaigner Adrienne Campbell told CNN, ""it almost immediately goes out of the community, leaks away, and then isn't remaining in the community serving the local people."" Organizers say the Lewes Pound benefits shoppers by strengthening local shops and increasing a sense of pride in the community. For traders, it increases customer loyalty, minimizes the cost of card-based transactions, and attracts attention to the town. The Lewes Pound also benefits the environment by keeping transactions local, thus reducing carbon emissions, organizers say. Local cheese shop Cheese Please -- which plans to accept the new currency -- offers an example in the economics. Owner Fiona Kay fills her counter with local cheeses, and a customer would use the Lewes Pound to buy them. Kay would then pay the dairy with Lewes Pounds, and the dairy owner would use the Lewes Pound to buy local supplies. The Lewes Pound is a basically a voucher worth one British pound that can only be redeemed at locally-owned participating stores. Customers can buy it at several issuing outlets around town and trade it back for sterling at any time. ""I think we will be keen to take it,"" said Hamish Elder, managing director of the local Harveys Brewery. ""For us, it's as much about how well it's welcomed by the people who are using it. If they find it a nuisance, and there is no real benefit for them, they they are not going to back it, so there is no point (in) us backing it."" To encourage people to buy the currency, organizers are offering a 10-percent discount on the notes for the next two weeks. It's all part of a year-long pilot program designed to test how well the system works. Lewes Mayor Michael Chartier plans to launch the program Tuesday evening in a ceremony at the Lewes Town Hall, unveiling the nearly 10,000 Lewes Pounds that have so far been designed. Lewes has a history of being a bit rebellious. U.S. revolutionary Thomas Paine spent six years in Lewes until 1774, and for hundreds of years the town has hosted a wild and colorful annual bonfire parade. The town has also had its own currency once before, between 1789 and 1895. The current currency initiative has the backing of Transition Towns, a non-profit organization that works with local communities to develop their own initiatives to address high oil prices and climate change.","UK town of Lewes launches own currency to encourage residents to shop local .

"(CNN) -- Opening statements are scheduled for Friday in the case of a former Rutgers University student who allegedly used a webcam to stream footage of his roommate's sexual encounter with another man. Dharun Ravi faces a 15-count indictment, which includes hate crime charges, in connection with the death of Tyler Clementi, Ravi's roommate. Clementi killed himself after the incident, jumping from the George Washington Bridge between New York and New Jersey. Last year, Ravi turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. ""You want to know why he's rejected the plea?"" his attorney, Steven Altman, said in December. ""Simple principle of law, simple principle of life -- he's innocent. He's not guilty."" Ravi is a citizen of India who was studying in the U.S. legally. The deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors would have required Ravi, 19, to undergo 600 hours of community service, counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man that Clementi was with. Prosecutors also offered to help Ravi avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. A second student charged in the scandal, Molly Wei, 19, reached a plea deal and that requires her to testify against Ravi. Less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Barack Obama released a taped video message condemning bullying.","Dharun Ravi faces a 15-count indictment involving hate crime charges .

"(CNN) -- Australian spin king Shane Warne suffered a losing return to cricket on Saturday as he was upstaged in the Melbourne Stars' opening Big Bash League defeat by Sydney Thunder. Playing in his home city of Melbourne for the first time in five years, the 42-year-old conceded 19 runs from his two overs as David Warner smashed 102 from just 51 balls to give Sydney a six-wicket win with six deliveries to spare. Warner, who scored his maiden Test century in Australia's recent defeat by New Zealand, smashed Warne over the boundary ropes twice as he hit six sixes in a successful chase to overhaul the Stars' 153-7 from 20 overs. ""Didn't go to plan for us tonight but hey it's only the first game. We will bounce back -- well played David Warner, looking forward to Brisbane,"" Warne wrote on Twitter ahead of Tuesday's match against the Heat. Warne retired from international cricket in 2007 but played in the Indian Premier League until earlier this year. He went into the match under an injury cloud after burning his hand while cooking, but was boosted when his partner, actress and model Elizabeth Hurley, performed the pre-game toss of the coin. She accompanied her son Damian and Warne's children Brooke, Summer and Jackson in the middle of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. However, it was downhill from there for Warne as the Stars lost the toss and struggled after batting first. David Hussey top-scored with 52 as Warne was not required to bat, then Warner took center stage as he scored more than half his team's runs. Meanwhile, South Africa crushed Sri Lanka by an innings and 81 runs in the first Test in Centurion on Saturday. Vernon Philander claimed his second five-wicket haul of the match to finish with figures of 10-102 as the tourists were bowled out for 150 in their second innings before tea on day three. Wicketkeeper Mark Boucher claimed six catches as he matched the national record for the fourth time. Sri Lanka trailed by 231 runs after the first innings, and slumped to 38-4 before lunch.","Shane Warne's Melbourne Stars lose in spinner's comeback match on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Mike Milbury, a former National Hockey League player, coach and executive, is accused of assault and battery on a child stemming from an incident at a youth hockey game. Hours after the allegations became public, NBC -- the network where Milbury serves as a studio analyst for the ""Game of the Week"" broadcast -- announced that he won't appear on air for an indeterminate period of time. ""In our discussions with Mike, we both came to the conclusion that he should remain off the air while focusing on his affairs,"" NBC spokesman Chris McCloskey said in a statement. Milbury, 59, will be charged with one count each of assault and battery on a child, threatening to commit a crime and disorderly conduct, the Brookline, Massachusetts, police said Friday. Daniel Rabinovitz, Milbury's Boston-based attorney, said Friday that his client ""denies any allegations that there was an assault of any kind."" ""He simply intervened in an altercation between his son and an opposing player,"" Rabinovitz said by e-mail. ""No one was struck, no one was injured, and no one was threatened."" The alleged incident occurred at a skating rink in the suburban Boston community of Brookline. Milbury is an assistant coach for one of the pee wee hockey teams that had been playing, according to a police statement. The police did not immediately offer any further details. Players on pee wee teams generally are 11 and 12 years old. Born in Brighton, Massachusetts, Milbury attended high school in nearby Walpole and then went on to Colgate University. After playing three games with his hometown Bruins in the 1975-76 season, Milbury became a regular on the NHL team's roster the next season, remaining a key part of the team until his retirement in 1987. He ended up playing 11 full seasons with the Bruins, compiling 49 goals, 189 assists and 1,552 penalty minutes over his career, according to the league's official website NHL.com. His also had a plus/minus rating of 173, meaning his team scored 173 more goals than it gave up when he was on the ice. In 1979, Milbury participated in a hockey brawl when he joined his Bruins teammates in going into the stands to fight with fans in New York's Madison Square Garden. Videotape of that incident shows Milbury removing a shoe from one spectator and striking the fan with it. Milbury then went on to become a coach and executive with the Bruins and the New York Islanders. Known for his provocative comments, he is a studio analyst for Boston-based NESN and TSN in Canada as well as NBC.","NEW: Milbury and NBC agree ""he should remain off air"" after the incident, NBC says .

"(CNN) -- An arraignment is scheduled Thursday for Pfc. Bradley E. Manning, who is suspected of leaking secret documents to the WikiLeaks website. Manning, who is also the subject of a court martial, faces charges that include aiding the enemy, wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, theft of public property or records, transmitting defense information, and fraud and related activity in connection with computers. If convicted of all charges, he would face a maximum sentence of life in prison, reduction to the lowest enlisted pay grade, E-1; forfeiture of pay and allowances; and a dishonorable discharge. Aiding the enemy is a capital offense, but the investigating officer endorsed the view of military prosecutors not to seek the death penalty. Manning is accused of orchestrating the biggest intelligence leak in U.S. history. During the Article 32 proceedings in December, prosecutors presented evidence that Manning allegedly communicated with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in a series of Internet chats about uploading 700 Guantanamo Bay detainee interrogation reports. Prosecutors charge that Manning put software on secure computers that allowed him to download classified material and burn it to a compact disc. Manning was assigned as an intelligence analyst in Iraq and had a top-secret clearance. He worked in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF). Manning is being held in military custody. At an Article 32 hearing a few weeks ago, Manning's defense lawyer, David Coombs, focused most of his attention on two issues: lack of security at the SCIF and the Army's lack of response to Manning's emotional and behavior problems. WikiLeaks, the international online group that publishes secret government documents it receives from outside sources, set off a firestorm a year and a half ago when it made public on its website U.S. diplomatic cables and other sensitive documents, most of them pertaining to the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The disclosure of hundreds of the documents continues to cast a shadow over the U.S. intelligence community. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told an information-sharing conference in January that plugging leaks of classified materials is still a challenge for the community as it develops new systems to protect information, while at the same time ensuring the right people have access to it. The fact that Manning had access to so much secret information called into question whether the government had gone too far in responding to one of the biggest failures associated with the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The intelligence community and law enforcement were faulted for failing to share information that might have prevented the attacks. Clapper called the WikiLeaks disclosure a ""terrible event"" that heightened the intelligence community's sensitivity to inside threats. He said changes have already been made to monitor information and keep track of who has access to it. But he said it is a work in progress. ""We have to do more to both tag data and ensure that we can properly identify people so that they are actually authorized to receive the information,"" he said.","Manning faces court-martial in the military case .

"(CNN) -- The Chicago Bears waived wide receiver Sam Hurd on Friday, two days after federal authorities arrested him on charges of conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine. Hurd, 26, was arrested Wednesday at a Chicago restaurant, where he accepted cocaine from an undercover U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court. Authorities say he was trying to set up a drug distribution network in Chicago, having allegedly expressed interest in getting a supplier to sell him hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of cocaine and marijuana per week, and that Hurd was a target of a five-month investigation in Dallas, where he once played for the Cowboys. ""We are very shocked about what we heard,"" Bears General Manager Jerry Angelo said Friday while announcing Hurd's release from the NFL team's roster. Hurd was freed from custody Friday after a judge in Chicago granted him a $100,000 cash bond, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago. His attorney, Brett Greenfield, said Hurd had waived his preliminary hearing, and that a grand jury will now decide whether to indict him. The case will be handled by a federal court in the northern district of Texas, where the criminal complaint was filed this week. Greenfield said Hurd's frame of mind is confident, and that there is a ""very high level of relief"" that he is out of custody. The complaint says that Hurd met with an ICE undercover agent at a restaurant in Chicago on Wednesday night. A confidential informant with whom Hurd had communicated previously also attended the meeting, according to the complaint. He was interested in buying 5 to 10 kilograms of cocaine, at $25,000 per kilogram, and 1,000 pounds of marijuana at $450 per pound, per week for distribution in the Chicago area, according to ICE. Hurd said that ""he and another co-conspirator currently distribute about 4 kilograms of cocaine per week in Chicago, but that his supplier couldn't supply him with enough quantity,"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. After they finished negotiating, Hurd accepted a kilogram of cocaine from the undercover agent, according to the complaint. ""Hurd stated that he plays for the Chicago Bears and that he gets out of practice at about 5:30 p.m., after which he would make arrangements to pay for the kilogram of cocaine,"" ICE officials said in a news release. ""Hurd left the restaurant with the bag of cocaine and was arrested shortly thereafter in the parking lot of the restaurant."" If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine. Hurd, a sixth-year NFL player out of Northern Illinois University, joined the Bears in July after playing with the Cowboys for five seasons. Angelo, the Bears' general manager, said Friday that team research on Hurd turned up no red flags before he signed in July, according to the Bears' website. ""We spend an inordinate amount of time on character, making sure we know the player as well as we can,"" Angelo said. ""But no system is foolproof. For me to sit here and say that we should have known something that we didn't know, I can't say that in this case. There's no foundation for anybody to say that."" NFL wide receiver Terrell Owens also expressed shock after hearing of Hurd's arrest. ""It would never cross my mind that Sam would ever be dealing or using drugs,"" said Owens of his former Dallas Cowboys teammate. ""This is completely out of character for him."" Though Hurd has only eight catches for 109 yards in this season's first 13 games, he contributed in other ways. He has long been a special teams force, leading the Cowboys in special teams tackles in 2009 and 2010. CNN's Karan Olson, Jim Barnett, Bill Kirkos and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Sam Hurd is released on $100,000 bail .

"(CNN) -- You can take the man out of the uniform, but you can't take the uniform out of the man. Once a soldier, always a soldier. That's why, despite my cautious optimism regarding President Obama's recent announcement of the planned end of the Iraq war, I'm still a little wary. This isn't the first time a president has told me the war was over. On May 1, 2003, my men and I were in Kuwait, waiting for orders to move into Iraq. A young rifle platoon leader in the infantry, I knew just enough to be both eager and nervous. Everyone knows what happened next: the aircraft carrier, the flight suit, the Mission Accomplished banner. A declaration of an end to major combat operations. We thought our war had ended before it even began. Little did we know it was just starting. Our orders to move north were issued that very day. And very soon, we found the war we thought was gone, in the streets and alleys of Baghdad. Eight-and-a-half messy years later, a war the American people were led to believe would only last a few weeks is -- in theory -- winding down. Historians will debate the question of whether it was worth it for generations. Did it establish a stable democracy in the heart of the Middle East? No one can say for sure. Did it punish the deserving and bring justice to those that sought to do us harm? That's an even tougher one. Did it affect the Arab Spring? Perhaps, but so did Twitter. And can we really say the war is ""over"" when bombs are still going off and killing Iraqis, untold amounts of contractors are staying, and troops are still dying? What can't be debated are the effects on those who did the fighting. More than 4,400 American families are forever shattered, having lost a son or a daughter or a mother or a brother. Over 32,000 service members were wounded in action physically. And the war lives on in the hearts and memories of every Iraq veteran, whether they've transitioned smoothly back to civilian life with a job or are still ravaged by their experience and in desperate need of help. Make no mistake about it -- America has only started to pay for this war. It's like the hidden charges on bills from the cable company, they might not get you right away, but they'll get you eventually. Iraq veterans are young hard-chargers now, but as time passes, that will change, just as it does for every person. They will grow older, marry, have kids, and, if given the opportunity, grow into the New Greatest Generation title bestowed upon them. But that's going to take time, care and money. Long term, it's estimated that these wars could cost between $600 billion and $1 trillion, to include the care for more than 2.3 million Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. Those are imposing numbers, to be sure, especially in this time of an economic recession and spiraling debt. But those numbers will only increase with time if we slash veteran program funding in a shortsighted rush, as some in Washington have begun chattering about. Whether one agreed with the Iraq war or not, we all own it now. That's how our country works. Every single brave man and woman who wore the uniform overseas went over there wearing the American flag, representing us and our nation's ideals. Now, the time has finally come for all of them to return home on December 31, 2011. And a new front awaits back here. One president began the Iraq war. Another ended it. But it was yet another commander-in-chief, President Lincoln, who said, ""Let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan."" That work isn't done. And until it is, I won't consider the Iraq war over. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Rieckhoff.","Paul Rieckhoff says he once was fooled into thinking the Iraq war was over .

"(CNN) -- A late goal from Eric Abidal gave Barcelona a 2-1 comeback victory in the first leg of their Spanish Cup quarterfinal clash with arch rivals Real Madrid. The French defender scored the decisive goal in the match known as 'El Clasico' at Real's Bernabeu stadium after Barcelona captain Carles Puyol had canceled out Cristiano Ronaldo's opener. It means Barcelona are favorites to progress into the final four of the competition and eliminate the holders when the two contest the second leg next Wednesday. After a cagey opening, in which Barcelona dominated possession, Real took the lead with their first meaningful attack on 11 minutes. Karim Benzema's pass found Ronaldo scampering through the middle, and the Portuguese forward stepped past Gerard Pique before firing beyond Barca keeper Pinto. Ronaldo, who has been criticized by some fans for not celebrating some of his recent goals and for missing several chances in the last match with Barca, certainly looked like he enjoyed his opener. Five minutes later Barcelona striker Alexis Sanchez, from Chile, got on the end of Cesc Fabregas' pass but though his looping header beat Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas, it bounced back off the post. Lionel Messi had his first sight of goal on 26 minutes as his low shot forced Casillas into a smart save at his near post. Andres Iniesta then made some room inside the penalty area but he fired wide after Sanchez's lay off. But just three minutes into the second half Barcelona pulled level as their captain Carles Puyol stooped to head a corner into the net. Moments later Real defender Sergio Ramos deflected a volley from Iniesta onto the woodwork after a chipped pass from Fabregas. Real then hit the woodwork themselves as Benzema's header cannoned back off the upright with Pinto beaten. Tempers frayed when Real's Pepe appeared to stamp on Messi's hand as the Argentine was on the floor after a foul before Barca edged in front with just over ten minutes to go. Abidal, who signed a new contract at the club this week, controlled Messi's pass on his chest before shooting low into the net. In Italy, AC Milan progressed to the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup but they needed extra time to beat Novara 2-1. Stephan El Shaarawy gave the Rossoneri the lead on 24 minutes with a curling shot but Ivan Radovanovic equalized for Serie A's bottom club with a long range free kick two minutes from time. It was left to Milan's Brazilian striker Pato to seal victory, ten minutes into the extra half an hour.","Barcelona beat Real Madrid 2-1 in their Spanish Cup quarterfinal first leg tie .

"(CNN) -- A hot night in Beirut and hipsters, dressed to kill, dance the night away. A DJ plays in a bar in Gemayzeh -- one of the few areas in Beirut where nightlife continues . A few years ago this scene would have played out across the city. Now, soldiers line the pavements and night time revelers are more likely to hear the sporadic crack of gunshots than dance music beats. While trendy districts of Beirut like Gemayzeh are valiantly carrying on as usual, the nation's critical political and economic situation is hard to ignore. ""The Lebanese have this vibrance for life, this addiction for life, and the people just really want to exclude themselves from the political scene,"" Mazen Hajjar, owner of 961 Brewery. It is a devastating political scene culminating in the current parliamentary deadlock which has blocked the election of a new president and put the economy on ice. ""Our best export from the country is now exporting our highly educated young men and women. We are losing them at the rate of six to seven thousand a month,"" said Fadi Abboud, President of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists. The Lebanese who have chosen to stay are uncertain and fearful of war. They are staying in and saving money in case the political situation deteriorates. In spite of the discouraging climate, young entrepreneur Mazen Hajjar is bucking the trend with his 961 micro-brewery. ""We're doing very, very well,"" he said, ""We're looking very much like a lot of our counterparts to now start expanding internationally,"" continued Hajjar. But then Hajjar is not short of nerve. He started 961 Brewery -- which is named after Lebanon's international dialing code -- during the 2006 Hezbollah war with Israel. 961 Brewery is an example of the complicated economic situation in Lebanon where some industries thrive and others fail. Construction is another industry which is booming while others go bust. Fuelled by low interest rates and Gulf oil money, it is growing at around 30 to 40 percent a year. Fears of more sectarian violence and another war with Israel are ever present -- and they are the kiss of death for sensitive industries like tourism. The Lebanese are renowned for their love of a good time and Beirut's club scene used to attract tourists and partygoers from all over the region. Tourists from Kuwait and Bahrain used to spend as much money on Lebanon's ski slopes in the winter as on its beaches in summer. But recently their governments advised tourists not to travel there. Saudi Arabia, Lebanon's main bankroller, has also warned its citizens to steer clear of the unstable country. Shopkeepers are missing the custom of Saudis and Emiratis who are known for the extravagance of their purchases and hoteliers have noticed a big drop in occupancy rates. According to the General Union of Arab Chambers of Commerce, losses in the Lebanese tourism sector over the past two and a half years have run to $2.2 bn. Lebanon's beleaguered industrialists have also been hit hard by the political turmoil. They claim they are being ruined by high, unsubsidized energy costs and war damage. This has meant factories have closed and workers laid off. ""We are the Phoenicans for God's sake. We invented glass. It is now not commercial to produce glass, ceramics, plastics, building materials and bricks. All intensive energy industries are suffering and they have no future,"" Abboud told CNN. Criticisms have been leveled at the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) for failing to put any measures in place to support Lebanon during this time. The complicated nature of Lebanon's economic situation means that relief is coming from an unexpected source -- the country's huge diaspora. Lack of stability may be keeping the expatriate population from returning home but it doesn't stop them from sending back money -- roughly $6 bn a year which makes up around a quarter of the country's GDP. This money cannot keep the economy afloat indefinitely and the political problems must be solved before any long-term solutions can be found to the economic issues. Nicholas Chammas, an eminent strategy consultant based in the country thinks Lebanon must rethink even more radically than that. ""We cannot defy gravity indefinitely. Lebanon has to go back to basics. We cannot function as we used to do before the war, or even 10 years ago. We have to change gears. We have to reinvent the Lebanese economy.""  E-mail to a friend .","Lebanon is famous for its nightlife but political deadlock is wrecking the sector .

"(CNN) -- Diego Milito scored the only goal as Inter beat Milan 1-0 in the San Siro derby, a result that threw open the Italian Serie A title race after the top three teams all failed to win on Sunday. After leaders Juventus and third-placed Udinese both struggled in earlier matches, defending champions Milan knew victory over their city rivals in the evening kick-off would send them two points clear at the top of the table. And Milan nearly took the lead on the stroke of halftime when Mark van Bommel's strike crashed against the crossbar with goalkeeper Julio Cesar well beaten. Who are football's top January transfer targets? Inter made the most of that stroke of good fortune and Argentine forward Milito scored the only goal nine minutes after the break. Milan defender Ignazio Abate slipped as he attempted to clear Javier Zanetti's cross and Milito was on hand to stroke the ball home. Inter's victory consolidated fifth place, but just six points separate the top five teams after 18 games. The defeat left Milan a point behind Juventus, who remained top and unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at home to mid-table Cagliari. A superb team move resulted in striker Mirko Vucinic tapping home the opener for Juve after just seven minutes, but the Sardinian visitors leveled early in the second half through Andrea Cossu's long-range strike. Udinese dropped two points behind Milan after slipping to a 3-2 defeat at Genoa. Damiano Ferronetti headed Udinese into the lead but quick-fire goals from Andreas Granqvist and Bosko Jankovic gave Genoa the advantage early in the second half. Rodrigo Palacio added a third before Antonio Di Natale pulled a goal back from the penalty spot after Genoa captain Marco Rossi had been sent off. Goals from Brazilian midfielder Hernanes and veteran Germany striker Miroslav Klose gave Lazio a 2-0 home win over Atalanta, putting the Rome club five points behind Juve in fourth position.","Diego Milito scores the only goal as Inter beat Milan 1-0 in the San Siro derby .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In the beginning the question was whether we could do it at all. Around-the-clock news? Was there even enough news to fill 24 hours? Those were the questions being asked when I joined the staff of CNN on February 4, 1980, five months before the network went on the air. I had come to CNN from the Atlanta Journal via a six-year stint at UPI. Aside from knowing how to write a five-minute newscast for the broadcast wire, I knew nothing about television. That day I was told I would be the broadcast industry's first full-time copy editor. Even at the networks, it seemed, producers had read scripts, but with 24 hours of news, editors had been added to the team. Down to the last few minutes before we went on the air at 6 p.m. on June 1, 1980, there were doubts about whether we could do it. Ted Kavanau was the fast-talking, endlessly energetic vice president whose job was not only to get us on the air but make our shows interesting. As the clock ticked down, he called the show team into the back where the executive offices were located. ""Listen,"" he intoned. ""We don't know if this is going to work or not. But do not worry. If it doesn't work, we will all go to TV stations and hire one another."" And on that cheery note, out we went to produce the first show. We had been asked to tie our futures to the dreams of Ted Turner, someone many considered to be a mad man. Not only were we ready, but eager. As Turner was dedicating the news channel to America, I was marking up seven-part scripts with a black copy pencil in the newsroom downstairs. And by the end of that first hour, I knew the answer to the question of whether CNN would survive. Civil rights leader Vernon Jordan had been shot and was in a Fort Wayne, Indiana, hospital. That day his friend, President Carter, flew to Fort Wayne to visit his bedside. When Carter came out of Jordan's room and stepped up to the waiting microphones, CNN was live. The three broadcast networks would air portions of Carter's remarks later on their 30-minute evening newscasts, but CNN was live as it happened. As I listened to Carter speak, I thought to myself, ""You know, this is going to work."" And it did. Cell phones were still a few years away. There was no Internet, but people could look at CNN and see history unfold before their eyes. A cartoon in the New Yorker magazine from that time showed a dead bird, its feet in the air and a CNN cameraman capturing the event. ""A sparrow falls,"" said the caption, ""and CNN goes live."" There were countless important events in those first years. The arrival of the hostages who had been freed by Iran in 1981, the chaos following the shooting of President Reagan that year, and those unforgettable images as the Challenger blasted off into a clear blue Florida sky in January 1986 only to explode a few moments later. A breakthrough moment came with the start of the Persian Gulf War. That war produced something called ""CNN Syndrome."" As video of bombs falling on targets and reports from the field streamed in, people were reluctant to be away from their televisions. They carried pocket radios into business meetings to listen to CNN Radio. They were unwilling to be unplugged, and it was more than exciting to be a part of it. In 1993, CNN created its own internal wire service, The CNN Wire, and I was one of three members of that fledgling staff. We were to be the repository of what CNN knew because our charge was to cover the major story of the day. In 1994, it included a slow chase down a Los Angeles freeway. When caught, O.J. Simpson was charged with murdering his wife, Nicole Brown-Simpson. My colleague Anne Brown and I watched and filed dispatches on every day of the trial. In 1996, I went to Moscow to cover the first democratic election of a Russian president. Boris Yeltsin danced on the stage at Rostov-on-Don and swept past the Communists to win. Then followed four trips to Israel to cover elections there. One evening my colleague Izzy Lemberg invited me to visit his home in Abu Tor, a mixed neighborhood in Jerusalem where Israelis and Palestinians live. The cab driver was a little reluctant but took me anyway. On the terrace roof of Izzy's home that summer evening we ate cool slices of watermelon and sipped Israeli wines. As darkness fell, an arc of lights was visible on the horizon. ""That is Amman, Jordan,"" Izzy said. ""It's only about 70 miles away."" Soon bright flashes of light began to appear off to the right, beyond the Mount of Olives. Izzy and his wife Rickie seemed to pay no notice. What was that, I wanted to know. ""Oh, that, just the Israelis practicing tank fire in the Jordan Valley,"" Izzy said. Normal life in Israel. One of my most memorable days at CNN was a day of tragedy, April 19, 1995. A national desk editor had received a call from a CNN affiliate in Oklahoma City. The station had heard on a police scanner that an explosion had occurred at the federal building and planned to send a reporter and a microwave truck. I called the Oklahoma City police to find out what was going on. I asked if there had been an explosion at the federal building. ""Yes,"" the dispatcher told me, ""and it's bad."" She slammed down the phone, but with that confirmation I wrote the first bulletin of many I would write that day. Within the next 10 minutes, the first video of the scene was streaming in -- the mushroom cloud of black smoke, the faÃ§ade of the building collapsed into the street. As the lead writer on the story, it was my job to take that stream of facts, update the story as developments came in, and try to keep the story as coherent as possible. At times that day, it felt as if I had grabbed a live wire as the death toll inched toward 168. The stories of survivors began to flow in. And then there were the questions. Who did this and why? About 80 minutes after the blast, Timothy McVeigh, the man who would ultimately be convicted of the worst act of homegrown terror in American history, was arrested in a routine traffic stop in Perry, Oklahoma. In 1997, I would go to Denver to cover his trial. My worst day at CNN was an even worse day of tragedy. September 11, 2001, when almost 3,000 people died. That Tuesday morning began routinely. An editorial meeting had started on the 6th floor of the CNN Center when word came from the New York bureau that a plane had hit the World Trade Center. Like many, I thought it must have been a small private plane and wondered how it got so close. Then the first video came in from CNN affiliate WABC with the Trade Center's North Tower ablaze. I sat down and wrote a bulletin. My colleague, international desk editor Lynn Felton, and I were watching a monitor when a plane entered the frame and struck the South Tower. Did we really see what we just saw? I wrote another bulletin. Then, as we tried to understand the magnitude of what had occurred, a third plane, at the Pentagon. Another bulletin. Then a fourth plane crashed into a field in Pennsylvania. Another bulletin. That short span -- between a few minutes before 9 a.m. until just after 10:30 a.m. -- was the longest period of time I have ever experienced. The seconds ticked down as if they were made of lead. We were under attack, and it wouldn't stop. But, of course, the story was just beginning to unfold. Very soon, the twin towers would collapse in roiling clouds of smoke and ash. A lead writer's job when a story begins is to give the facts as quickly, clearly and concisely as possible. But as the day progresses, it is the writer's job to pull back, look at the larger picture, include some context, and say, if possible, what this means. My final lead that day talked about terrorists striking the twin symbols of America's financial and military might, the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The only routine thing about September 11 was at the end of the day when the lead writer who was to replace me tapped me on the shoulder. I logged off the computer, stood up and stumbled away -- spent both emotionally and physically in a way I had never been before. On the day of Ted Turner's last visit to his office in the CNN Center, my old friend and colleague Will King, who like me was there on day one, happened to ride the elevator down with Turner. As they crossed the bridge over the food court, Will tried to express to Turner what his vision had meant to us, how proud those of us who were there at the beginning had been to be a part of it. Turner thanked him and headed down the escalator. Then the mad man turned, threw up his hand, and shouted back to Will, ""Keep the spirit!"" This week, more than 32 years after I joined CNN -- after being a part of thousands of stories, working with thousands of people, and forming friendships that have lasted a lifetime -- I will sign off of my computer for the last time and retire. It has been a great career. As I leave I am as convinced today as I was early on that there is no better front seat to history than to be a part of CNN. And as I slip down the escalator, I plan to turn back and wave to all the colleagues I'm leaving behind, confident that the spirit lives on.","Randy Harber retires this week after a career that goes back to the first day of CNN .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City reaffirmed their grip on top spot in the English Premier League on Saturday with a 3-0 win over Fulham at the Etihad Stadium. Sergio Aguero put the Sky Blues ahead from the penalty spot in the 10th minute after Adam Johnson was brought down by Chris Baird. The Northern Ireland defender compounded his mistake with an own goal 20 minutes later with Edin Dzeko adding a third midway through the second half to ensure three points and maintain City's 100% home record. Manchester United can join their city rivals on 57 points if they beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Arsenal banged in seven goals against Blackburn Rovers at the Emirates Stadium to banish the disappointment of drawing away to Bolton Wanderers on Wednesday. Robin van Persie's scored a hat-trick while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scored a brace as the Gunners ran riot. There were also goals for Mikel Arteta and Thierry Henry to complete a 7-1 victory to move Arsene Wenger's men up to fifth place ahead of Newcastle who entertain Aston Villa on Sunday and Liverpool who take on Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield on Monday. Defeat keeps Blackburn in 19th place with 18 points. Norwich City move up to ninth place after a 2-0 win against Bolton at Carrow Road. Second-half goals from Andrew Surman in the 70th minute and Anthony Pilkington five minutes from the end sees Bolton slip back into the relegation zone. Wolverhampton Wanderers, meanwhile, move up to 17th place thanks to a 2-1 win against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Second-half strikes from Matt Jarvis (46th minute) and Kevin Doyle in the 71st minute cancelled out debutant Bobby Zamora's first-half goal. The defeat, which also saw other new signing Djibril Cisse sent off for violent conduct in the 33rd minute, keeps Mark Hughes' men in 16th place. Sunderland continued their excellent run under new manager Martin O'Neill as they beat 10-man Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium. Robert Huth's tackle on midfielder David Meyler earned the German defender a straight red shortly before half-time. Sunderland's numerical advantage soon told as James McLean scored in the 60th minute to earn Sunderland a fifth win in six league matches. Swansea City claimed a rare away victory beating West Bromwich Albion 2-1 at the Hawthorns. Marc-Antoine Fortune gave the home side the lead nine minutes into the second half but Swansea wasted no time getting back on level terms with Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson netting a minute later. Four minutes later, English striker Danny Graham put the Welsh side in front. The win -- only the second on Swansea's travels this season -- moves Brendan Rodgers' side up to 10th with 30 points while West Brom remain in 15th with 26 points. Everton couldn't match their midweek heroics against top-of the-table Manchester City in their match with bottom-side Wigan. A Phil Neville own goal in the 76th minute put Wigan on course for their first league win since November, but Nigerian striker Victor Anichebe grabbed a point for Everton, heading home seven minutes from the end to salvage a point. Wigan remain bottom with 16 points, while Everton are 11th with 30 points.","Manchester City enjoy comfortable win over Fulham after shock defeat to Everton midweek .

"(CNN) -- Guinea equaled the record for a winning margin in an Africa Cup of Nations match on Saturday with a 6-1 over 10-man Botswana in Franceville. Sadio Diallo opened the scoring in the 15th minute when he coverted a Abdoul Camara cross. Dipsy Selolwane equalized for Botswana scoring at the second attempt from a penalty in the 23rd minute after Jerome Ramatlhakwana was brought down by Guinea goalkeeper Naby Yattara. But parity didn't last long as Diallo scored his second four minutes later to put Guinea back in front. Camara extended the lead in the 42nd minute and Ibrahima Traore made it 4-1 in first half injury time.

In Group D's other match, Ghana beat Mali 2-0. Asamoah Gyan opened the scoring from a free kick in the 63rd minute with Ayew doubling the Black Stars' lead 13 minutes later. Saturday's results means the 2010 World Cup quarter-finalists sit at the top of the group with six points from their two games while Guinea and Mali both have three points.

"(CNN) -- An injury time penalty from Mario Balotelli secured a dramatic 3-2 win for Manchester City as they staved off a brave fight back from Tottenham to maintain their three point lead at the top of the English Premier League. City's main title rivals, Manchester United, also negotiated a difficult test at Arsenal by winning 2-1 to remain on the coat tails of their big-spending neighbors. Victories for both Manchester clubs saw them pull clear from third-placed Tottenham -- City are now eight points ahead of them, and United five -- with the race for the championship now seeming like a two-horse race. Italy striker Balotelli was involved in another contentious incident in the match as he appeared to aim a stamp at Scott Parker's head, a flashpoint that angered Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp. ""What reason did he have to kick Scott in the head with his studs while he is lying on the floor? It's not a nice thing to do and it has no place in football,"" Redknapp told a press conference. ""It's not the first time he's done that is it? I'm sure it won't be the last. I'm the last person to talk about getting people sent off, but it's blatantly obvious if you see that, he reacts like that at times to challenges."" Prior to Balotelli's late spot kick the game burst to life in nine second half minutes. First, Samir Nasri's emphatic finish from Silva's pass on 56 minutes gave City the lead before Joleon Lescott bundled a corner into the net three minutes later. But City let the visitors back into the game within a minute as centre back Stefan Savic failed to deal with a long ball and Jermain Defoe took the ball round City goalkeeper Joe Hart to finish into an empty net. And five minutes later, Tottenham were level as Gareth Bale struck a superb equalizer from the edge of the penalty area after Aaron Lennon's pass. Defoe had a chance to win the game for Tottenham in injury time but though he stretched to connect with Bale's cross he could only poke the ball wide of the target from four yards out. And Tottenham were made to pay for that miss as Ledley King brought down Balotelli in the final minute of added on time and the Italian made no mistake from 12 yards. Manchester United took the lead at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium in north London when Antonio Valencia headed home Ryan Giggs' cross on the stroke of half time. Arsenal's Dutch captain Robin van Persie, who had already squandered a great chance to bring his side level, found the net on 71 minutes with an angled drive from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's pass. Teenage winger Oxlade-Chamberlain was substituted straight after the equalizer, drawing boos from the home support. And his replacement, Russian Andrei Arshavin, failed to close down Valencia as he got into the area late in the game to tee up England striker Danny Welbeck for the winner.","Mario Balotelli's late penalty hands Manchester City a 3-2 victory over Tottenham Hotspur .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich failed to regain top spot in the Bundesliga on Saturday night after dropping points in a 1-1 draw at Hamburg. Hamburg took the lead in the 23rd minute when Jacopo Sala headed home from a Jose Guerrero cross. Bayern pushed for an equalizer but were frustrated by a resilient Hamburg defence but Croatian striker Ivica Olic found a way through in the 71 minute to salvage a point. The result completes a thoroughly mixed bag of results for Bayern since resuming after the Christmas break with four points taken from a possible nine. Their current indifferent form means that, thanks to a 2-0 at Nuremburg on Friday, Borussia Dortmund finish the weekend on top of the Bundesliga with 43 points with Bayern on 41 points. Third-placed Schalke also have 41 points after a 1-1 draw at home to Mainz. The visitors took a shock lead when Egypt striker Mohamed Zidan scored 15 minutes into his Mainz debut. But Schalke were back on level terms after an hour thanks to a strike from Nigeria striker Chinedu Obasi. Fourth-placed Moenchengladbach could only manage a goalless draw at Wolfsburg while fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen also drew (2-2) with mid-table Stuttgart as both sides finished with 10 men on the pitch. Leverkusen had Czech Republic defender Michal Kadlec sent off midway through the second half for his second bookable offence while Stuttgart's Cristian Molinaro saw red in the 92nd minute for striking Andre Schuerrle in the face. At the other end of the table, 17th-placed Augsburg earned a point with a 2-2 draw at Hoffenheim.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona survived a late onslaught from rivals Real Madrid to win their Spanish Cup quarterfinal tie 4-3 on aggregate and knock the holders out on Wednesday. In a dramatic game at Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium, the hosts went 2-0 up thanks to goals from Pedro and Daniel Alves before strikes from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema leveled the match at 2-2. Real laid siege to their opponents' goal in the final stages, even after defender Sergio Ramos was sent off, but couldn't find the goal that would have taken them through. Jose Mourinho's side complained bitterly to the referee after the match but the result is sure to intensify pressure on the Portuguese coach, who has been forced to deny press rumors he is set to leave the club in June. Is Mourinho finished at Madrid? ""You sometimes score a goal without trying much for one, and we happened to fail to score from four or five of our chances,"" Mourinho said. ""It was easy to talk to my men during halftime. I had few things to change. Halftimes are short when your team isn't playing well; those ten minutes don't seem enough. I only needed one minute today because my team played very well in the first half. I told them to keep it up. ""Maybe Pep Guardiola congratulated us after winning last year's final because it was a clean match without any havoc. If you like I'll congratulate him for winning last week's match. I have no problem doing so. They deserved to win that game."" Real had the first chance of the match inside 15 seconds as a mistake from Gerard Pique let Gonzalo Higuain in on goal but the Argentina striker fired wide with only Barca keeper Jose Manuel Pinto to beat. Higuain had another two chances to open the scoring but Pinto saved his close-range effort from Xabi Alonso's free kick, before blocking a shot after he had surrendered possession. Germany international Mesut Ozil then struck the bar with a fierce shot from 35 yards with Pinto beaten, before Ronaldo drew another save from Barca's reserve keeper. A melee ensued after Real midfielder Lassana Diarra brought down Argentina striker Lionel Messi and was fortunate not to receive a second yellow card. Real were made to pay for their profligacy when Messi ran at Real's defense and teed up substitute Pedro to score shortly before the break, and just minutes later Brazilian fullback Alves made it two with a thunderous drive into the top corner. In the second half Real came back at their opponents as Ronaldo rounded Pinto from Ozil's pass to make it 2-1 and when France international Benzema made it 2-2 with 18 minutes left Real sensed victory. They continued to pour forward after Ramos was shown a second yellow card but couldn't find the vital third goal. Barca's night was marred by an injury to Andres Iniesta, who has a suspected hamstring tear and was replaced by Pedro after half an hour. His fellow Spain midfielder Xavi celebrated his 32nd birthday by equaling Joan Segarra's Barca record of 31 appearances in Clasico matches. Barcelona will now face either Valencia or Levante in the semifinals. The pair play Thursday, with Valencia 4-1 up from the first leg. In Wednesday's other tie, Athletic Bilbao sealed a clash with third division Mirandes in the final four after a 1-0 win at Mallorca sealed a 3-0 aggregate victory in an all-La Liga encounter. In England, Liverpool booked a League Cup final date with second division Cardiff after beating Premier League leaders Manchester City 3-2 on aggregate at Anfield. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg, Nigel De Jong brought City level on aggregate with a vicious long range drive before Steven Gerrard restored Liverpool's advantage from the penalty spot. Striker Edin Dzeko put City back on terms when he tapped in Aleksandar Kolarov's cross on 62 minutes before Wales forward Craig Bellamy equalized against his former club to make it 2-2 on the night and secure a 3-2 aggregate win.

"(CNN) -- AC Milan stayed just one point behind Serie A leaders Juventus with a convincing 3-0 win over Cagliari in the San Siro Sunday. Juve had kept up the pressure with a 2-1 win over Udinese Saturday, but Milan responded in style.

"(CNN) -- Four-time grand slam champion Kim Clijsters made a successful return from injury by defeating world number one Caroline Wozniacki in an exhibition match in Antwerp, Belgium. Clijsters, U.S. Open champion in 2005, 2009 and 2010, has been out for almost four months after sustaining a stomach muscle injury in August. ""So far, and today, everything felt really great,"" the 28-year-old said told the 10,000-strong crowd after winning 6-2 7-6 (7-5) at the Antwerp Sports Palace on Thursday. The Belgian will now focus on preparing to defend her Australian Open crown in Melbourne in January after securing victory in one hour and 35 minutes. Clijsters climbed to the top of the world rankings in February before sustaining shoulder and ankle injuries in April. She injured her stomach while attempting to recover in time to challenge for a fourth U.S. Open title and is only now regaining full fitness. ""I am happy to have played a match and break the rhythm of daily training,"" the 41-time WTA Tour winner said. Clijsters initially retired from tennis in 2007 to concentrate on raising her daughter, but in 2009 she performed a u-turn and announced she would return to sport. It was a spectacular comeback as Clijsters gained wild-card entry to the U.S. Open before going on to win the title at Flushing Meadows two years in a row. However, the Australian Open draw will be missing Sweden's former world No. 4 Robin Soderling, who has confirmed his absence from the 2012 season's first grand slam.

"(CNN) -- Brazil, which recently overtook the UK as the world's sixth-largest economy, has been enjoying a lot of positive press. It is sealing its reputation as a dynamic place, a fun place, a diverse place -- but, with this last point in particular, the country still suffers black eyes. A recent court ruling ordered Sony Music Brazil to pay a hefty fine for a song with racist lyrics. The song, about a black woman's hair, led civil rights organizations to sue Sony not just because it is offensive but because such pejoratives remain common in Brazil. An appeals court in Rio de Janeiro ruled December 15 that Sony must pay nearly 1.3 million reais (U.S. $723,000) for publishing ""Veja os Cabelos Dela,"" or ""Look at Her Hair,"" by the singer and comedian Tiririca. Tiririca, whose real name is Francisco Everardo Oliveira Silva, is now a federal congressman and was not named in the suit. Even the judicial process for this case was slow: The song came out more than 15 years ago, and the initial lawsuit was filed in 1997. ""In the bigger picture, I think the music companies are going to be more careful when they choose music to sell,"" said Humberto Adami, the lawyer for the rights organizations. The recent ruling was simply the completion of the monetary part of the case; the heart of it was decided years ago, and Sony has abided by it, the company said. ""Since 1997, spontaneously, Sony Music Brazil removed the track from this product and reissued it in the market,"" the company said. Adami, who recused himself from the case for a period while he served as ombudsman for Brazil's agency for racial equality, said the ruling comes in an environment where racism lingers. Tiririca's song, which he reportedly wrote to his wife, includes lyrics comparing a woman's hair to ""scouring pots and pans"" and about her ""stench."" In fact, Adami's clients lost in the first trial because the judge ruled that such comments and ""jokes"" were commonplace in Brazil and that Sony shouldn't be singled out to pay for it. But the rights organization persisted, given the outrage over the song. Some black children did not go to school because others were bullying them by singing the song, Adami said. ""Bullying combined with racism is a very difficult thing, a very sad and awful thing,"" he said. An appeals court later ruled against Sony by a vote of 2-1, with the dissenting judge using the same argument as the judge in the first trial. The case was appealed to Brazil's highest court, but it declined to take the case, so the appeal court ruling stands. But the case was far from over and dragged on for years as both sides went back to the lower courts to fight about how big the fine should be. Sony had paid a smaller fine, but an appeals court last month upheld a ruling that the actual amount to be paid was much larger, closer to the 1.3 million reais. ""This case is a real step forward for Brazil, and Brazil is changing,"" said France Winddance Twine, a sociology professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara. Brazilians see themselves as a tolerant society -- interracial marriage was never illegal, other forms of state-sanctioned racism were never implemented, and there were no groups like the Ku Klux Klan -- but the truth is not as tidy. The particular form of racism found in Tiririca's song has been tolerated for a long time in songs and jokes, said Twine, who has written a book about race in Brazil. ""For the first time, the court is saying, yes, this is common, but it is no longer acceptable,"" she said. ""They are acknowledging that this is harmful to people.""","A judge recently upheld a fine against Sony Music for a racist song .

"(CNN) -- The US has slapped sanctions on three firms including a major Chinese oil trader for selling refined oil products to Iran, just days after US Treasury secretary Tim Geithner travelled to Beijing to press for Chinese support on Iran sanctions. The US State Department announced late Thursday night that penalties would be imposed on China's Zhuhai Zhenrong, the Singapore-based oil trader Kuo oil, and the UAE-based independent oil trader FAL. While the measures are unlikely to have a big immediate impact on these three companies, they send a strong warning signal to energy companies working in Iran at a time when the US has been canvassing Asian countries for more support in isolating Tehran. The US State Department called the sanctions against the three firms an ""important"" step in convincing Iran to change its behaviour, and highlighted the ""potential connection between Iran's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of its proliferation [of] sensitive nuclear activities."" A spokesperson for Zhuhai Zhenrong said the company had not sold gasoline to Iran. ""We've never exported a barrel, not even a wee bit of refined fuel to Iran,"" said Zheng Mei, director of the public affairs department. According to the statement, the three firms violated US restrictions on supplying Iran with refined oil products that were passed in 2010. ""Under the sanctions imposed today, all three companies are barred from receiving US export licenses, US Export Import Bank financing, and loans over $10m from US financial institutions,"" the US State Department said. Importing refined oil products like petrol and diesel is crucial for Iran's economy because the country doesn't have sufficient refining infrastructure to process enough of its own crude into products. China is the biggest buyer of Iran's crude oil and, according to the US State Department, is also a significant source of gasoline for Iran, but Chinese companies have until now avoided sanctions from the US. China supported the most recent United Nations sanctions resolution on Iran in 2010, and some analysts believe that in exchange for that support the US may have turned a blind eye to Chinese companies which may have violated US laws. Last year the US placed sanctions on seven companies for selling refined oil products to Iran, but none of those were Chinese. Zhuhai Zhenrong is a state-owned oil trader based in Southern China. The company has a special mandate from the State Council to do crude trades that offset military trade debt with Middle Eastern countries, according to their website. Ms Zheng, the spokesperson for Zhenrong, said the company would continue buying Iranian crude. ""Zhuhai Zhenrong's trade with Iran is carried out under the two governments. The trade accords with international law and Chinese laws and regulations,"" she said. ""What we've signed with Iran are long-term contracts and we import around 12m tonnes of crude from Iran each year,"" Ms Zheng said. ""We've never exported gasoline to Iran. This is out of thin air! "" The US State Department said Zhuhai Zhenrong is Iran's largest supplier of refined oil products, brokering sales of gasoline worth more than $500m between July 2010 and January 2011. The sanctions are likely to have little immediate impact on Zhenrong because the company does very little, if any, business in the US.

Suggested Activity . Examining the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Inform students that, in 1985, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow, Coretta Scott King, initiated a massive research effort to gather and share historical information about her late husband. This research endeavor, called the King Papers Project, seeks to publish a 14-volume series of Dr. King's most significant letters, sermons, speeches, published works and unpublished manuscripts. Ask students: Why do you think that historians and researchers have engaged in this effort? Who else might find such a definitive collection valuable? Organize students into pairs, and have each pair consult print and online resources to select a different work either written or spoken by Dr. King. Instruct students to assume the roles of historians as they answer the following questions about their chosen documents: . • When was the work written or spoken? • Who do you think was the primary audience for the work, and why? Do you think that there might have been a secondary audience? If so, who was that audience? • What do you think was the intended goal or message of the work? • What is the tone or mood of the work? What techniques, if any, did Dr. King use in the work to convey his message? • What does the work reveal about life in the U.S. at the time when it was written or spoken? • How might different groups of people have interpreted this work at the time when it was first written or spoken? • If you had the opportunity, what questions would you have asked Dr. King about the work? As students present their research, post each work along a civil rights timeline. Discuss each work in the historical, social and political context in which it was originally presented. Then, encourage students to examine the philosophies of Dr. King over the course of his lifetime. Pose the following questions for discussion: . • What is the historical significance of Dr. King's works? • Do you see any patterns or changes in Dr. King's ideology as expressed in works as time passed? If so, how might those changes be reflective of the changes in society or in the civil rights movement? • What significance do they have today? • Do you think that the study of historical documents can provide lessons for addressing modern-day social, economic or political struggles?

"(CNN) -- With Germany's title race set to resume in earnest on Sunday, Bayer Leverkusen took center stage in Saturday's Bundesliga action by claiming fifth place with a 2-0 win at struggling Cologne. Midfielder Lars Bender scored both goals to give Leverkusen successive victories for the first time since August and a one-point advantage over Werder Bremen, who crashed 1-0 at Nuremberg in the late kickoff. But it still left Leverkusen seven points adrift of Schalke, who travel to third-placed Bayern Munich on Sunday. Champions Borussia Dortmund, meanwhile, can stretch their two-point lead with victory at home to Hanover following second-placed Borussia Monchengladbach's home draw with Hamburg on Friday. It could be a pivotal round of matches, with five points separating the top four teams. Nuremberg climbed eight points clear of the relegation zone as Alexander Esswein's 65th-minute goal gave the visitors a second win in the last 10 meetings with the 2004 league champions. Bremen hold a two-point advantage over Hanover in the race for the final Europa League qualification spot, with Stuttgart a further five points back despite the 4-1 win over bottom side Freiburg in which Martin Harnik scored twice. Hoffenheim stayed behind their south-west rivals on goal difference after winning 2-1 at Wolfsburg, who dropped behind Hamburg and Mainz -- 4-0 victors over second-bottom Kaiserslautern. Cologne are four points above the relegation playoffs after a sixth defeat in seven, while Augsberg moved out of the bottom three with a 3-0 win over fellow strugglers Hertha Berlin thanks to two second-half goals from striker Torsten Oehrl.","Bayer Leverkusen move up to fifth place in Bundesliga with a 2-0 win over Cologne .

"(CNN) -- Like two heavyweight boxers slugging it out over 12 rounds, Briny Baird and Bryce Molder stood toe-to-toe. With darkness descending, the pair traded blows for a remarkable two hours before Molder, at 31 eight years Baird's junior, triumphed in the longest and most dramatic golfing playoff of 2011. In the end, Molder's six-foot birdie putt on the sixth extra hole of October's Frys.com Open in California proved enough to snatch victory and ensured that Baird's 348th PGA Tour event would go the same way as the previous 347. When CNN contacted Baird we expected to find a man down on his fortunes, ruing another missed opportunity to finally claim the first Tour victory of his career. Yet nothing could have been further from the truth. The 39-year-old Florida native was out fishing, relaxing on his 22-foot Pathfinder boat in a bay off Stuart on the Atlantic coast, about 90 minutes north of Miami. And he already had his dinner plans taken care of for the evening. ""I've caught two speckled trout and one red fish,"" he told me enthusiastically. ""I am going to a friend's house later, where we will clean them up and have them for dinner. I only really play golf so I can support my fishing!"" If that really is the case, then Baird's fishing hobby has been pretty well supported over the years, to the tune of $12,460,542 to be precise, and his latest heartbreaking near-miss added another $540,000 to the coffers. That impressive prize fund puts him in 87th position on the all-time PGA Tour money list, ahead of such luminaries and major winners as Tom Kite, Ben Crenshaw, John Daly, Craig Stadler and the legendary Tom Watson, to name just a few. ""I would rather be the guy who has won the most money without a victory than the guy who has won the least money! A stat is only as bad as you want it to be,"" said Baird. ""If you are going to do something for a living that you love to do, and you are financially rewarded for doing it, that is a complete bonus. On the flip side, the negative is true and I cannot deny it. I am not out there trying 'not to win.' Not winning is not something I relish."" Golfing is in Michael Jancey Baird's blood -- his nickname comes from a character in Herman Wouk's novel ""The Winds of War,"" which his mother was reading when Briny was a young boy. The son of professional Butch Baird, the young Briny was introduced to the sport at a very early age. ""My dad being a golfer was a big part of my life growing up. It gave me an insight into how you should go about playing golf and he was a good player -- winning twice on the PGA Tour. ""He was completely hands on -- my golf swing was made by my father -- but my parents went through a really bad divorce when I was 18 and I and haven't spoken to my dad for eight years. ""From three to 18, everything I learned, 100%, was from my dad. The next 20 years, nothing through him."" Baird pauses for a moment, before continuing: ""People are disbelieving when I tell them, but for me it is a non-issue. ""I think people find it more shocking because we both have the same careers -- they don't relate to it as life, just golf. My dad and I don't speak because of life, not because of golf."" Baird's early college years were spent in exalted golfing company at Georgia Tech. ""I was in the same golf team as David Duval and Stewart Cink (both winners of the British Open). ""We had a great time and are all still firm friends now, but out of school I didn't enjoy it as much, so I left for Division Two school Valdosta State, where I had a blast ... and met my wife!"" Despite becoming a millionaire from playing the sport he loves, Baird has also experienced the downside of being a professional. He lost his PGA Tour card in 2004, agonizingly finishing one place outside the top 125 players that are invited back, while last year he again just missed out, finishing 127th. That meant he was playing on a limited schedule this year, although his second place in California ensures no such worries for 2012. ""Having to play in the qualifying school sucks, it is not fun at all,"" says Baird. ""You are playing for your job for the entire year and possibly for your entire career -- it is more pressure than any other tournament. A guy can miss a putt on the 18th hole and not have a tour card as a result. It's very hard."" Perhaps the phrase is overused, but Baird is genuinely one of golf's nice guys. We chat away for over half an hour like old friends and nothing seems too much trouble for him, although the feeling remains that finishing second for a fifth time in his career, and in such dramatic circumstances, will leave an indelible mark on Baird. But his mood is upbeat, positive and determined. Briny Baird is convinced he will win a tournament one day. ""Look, I am not going to lie to you, it was a massive disappointment to lose that playoff. I honestly felt I was going to win the tournament. I know I can win on tour. In fact, I know I can win more than once on tour,"" he says. ""I walked away thinking I had done things I hadn't done before. I played to win and in my mind I knew I was going to win. ""I felt in control and played really good coming down the stretch. I don't know how many times I have done that, for me that was a big hurdle to overcome."" If self belief was a golf tournament, Briny Baird would be a multiple winner, and his latest narrow defeat will not dent his confidence or dilute his desire to secure that elusive first victory. Golf's richest runner-up is determined to reel in that big prize soon, don't be surprised if he hooks his biggest-ever catch in 2012.","American Briny Baird has won over $12 million in prize money since turning pro .

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A day after an election official announced that Nigeria's parliamentary election was postponed for two days, the nation's election commission announced that all elections would be pushed back a week. The Independent National Election Commission said the parliamentary, presidential and gubernatorial elections would be put off because of the late arrival of voting materials. ""We cannot proceed with these elections if we want them to be free, fair and credible if there are no result sheets,"" said Attahiru Jega, chairman of the election commission, on Saturday, when the parliamentary race was supposed to happen. ""We cannot bury our heads and say there are no problems. It is regrettable. It is unfortunate. It should not have happened."" Jega also had said he took full responsibility for the fiasco but he said a vendor that was supplying results sheets and ballots was unable to deliver them on time. The vendor, said Jega, cited the diversion of planes to carry relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Japan as the reason for the delay. Citizens of Africa's most populous nation were supposed to vote Saturday for 360 House of Representatives seats and 109 Senate seats. That vote will now be held April 9. And they were scheduled to vote next Saturday in a presidential election and for state governors the following week, all of which has been bumped to April 16 and 26, respectively. Before the logistical problems, the election, the most expensive in Nigeria's history, had already been marred by riots, bombings and assassinations. ""The unprecedented levels of violence that have seen several people either killed, maimed, kidnapped or intimidated for political reasons pose the single most significant threat to the conduct of general elections,"" warned the Nigeria Elections Situation Room -- a forum of groups focusing on the upcoming elections. Human Rights Watch estimates at least 70 people have been killed in political violence in the run-up to the voting. The European Union described Nigeria's 2007 elections as the worst they had ever seen anywhere in the world, with rampant vote rigging, violence, theft of ballot boxes and intimidation. Nigeria had hoped to gain a cleaner image this year. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","Late arrival of voting material has forced the delays .

"Washington (CNN) -- Human rights groups met a somewhat skeptical Supreme Court on Tuesday as they presented arguments on whether foreign victims of torture and other crimes against humanity can sue corporations and other organizations in U.S. federal courts. The cases argued could have enormous global impact from a moral, political, and financial perspective. At issue is the scope of two federal laws that are increasingly being used in an effort to hold businesses accountable for human rights atrocities committed overseas. Two separate civil cases before the high court involve Nigerian political activists claiming foreign oil companies were complicit in violent abuse at the hands of the country's military; and an American family alleging their father was tortured and killed while in the custody of the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Liberation Organization. Both cases were earlier blocked from going to trial in federal courts, for separate legal reasons. Now the justices are being asked to sort out whether political groups and corporations enjoy broad immunity, and whether the American laws intend only for individuals to be held liable for international law violations. ""There's no connection to the United States whatsoever"" in these lawsuits, said Justice Samuel Alito. The statute being challenged here ""was enacted -- there seems to be a consensus -- to prevent international tension, and this kind of lawsuit only creates international tension."" But Justice Elena Kagan, an active questioner, was convinced such cases could proceed. ""Take an example that has all the extraterritoriality aspects of this case taken away from it,"" she said. ""Let's assume that the French ambassador is assaulted or attacked in some way in the United States, and that that attack is by a corporate agent. Would we say that the corporation there cannot be sued"" under the federal law? The first appeal was filed on behalf of residents of the oil-abundant Ogoni area of the Niger River delta. Two decades ago, they protested the long-standing environmental harm caused by Shell and other energy firms from the petroleum extraction. They and their families claim the Nigerian government brutally suppressed them, ""aided and abetted"" by private corporations doing business there. The Ogoni 9 -- as the key leaders became known-- were allegedly detained, tortured, and tried by a special Nigerian military tribunal, in violation of international human rights treaties. The government's 1993-95 crackdown sparked global outrage after author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists were convicted, then hanged. Among those bringing suit is his nephew, Charles Wiwa, who escaped the Nigerian oppression and now lives in Chicago as a political refugee. He described being a student activist beaten by soldiers for hours in front of a crowd of onlookers, then detained and tortured for days . He claims Shell -- based in the Netherlands and Britain -- conspired with the government to keep its business operations going in the face of protests, and should be held accountable for ignoring or encouraging a pattern of killings, rapes, beatings, and property destruction. He said the only place to obtain justice is in the United States. ""Nigeria's dictatorship has grown rich from its oil,"" Wawa told CNN. ""It is important those (oil) companies be held responsible, because we cannot bring any legal action in courts in Nigeria."" The law in question is the Alien Tort Statute, or ATS, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over claims from foreigners that they were harmed by international law violations. It was ignored for decades, but has now become an important legal vehicle for those bring human rights claims. Similar lawsuits involve Chevron and Exxon energy operations in Indonesia; Chiquita Brand fruit farms in Colombia; and businesses that operated years ago in the now-outlawed apartheid system in South Africa. The high court in 2004 endorsed use of the ATS, but only in limited circumstances. That approach was apparent among several of the conservative justices during Tuesday's two-hour oral arguments. ""In this case, the corporations have residences and presence in many other countries where they have many more contacts than here,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy said. Later he told the Obama administration lawyer supporting the Nigerian plaintiffs, ""Suppose an American corporation commits human trafficking with U.S. citizens in the United States. Under your view, the U.S. corporation could be sued in any country in the world, and it would have no international consequences. We don't look to the international consequences at all."" ""If there is no other country where this suit could have been brought, regardless of what American domestic law provides,"" asked Chief Justice John Roberts, ""isn't that a legitimate concern that allowing the suit itself contravenes international law?"" But Kagan and Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were skeptical about giving corporations a judicial free pass of sorts. Breyer pointed out the ATS was passed more than two centuries ago in response to piracy on the high seas. He used a humorous hypothetical to make his point. ""The principle that here would apply is Pirates Inc. Do you think in the 18th century if they'd brought Pirates Inc. (to court in a lawsuit), and we get all their gold, and Blackbeard gets up and he says: 'Oh, it isn't me, it's the corporation' that is responsible -- do you think that they would have then said: 'Oh, I see, it's a corporation. Good-bye. Go home.'"" ""Yes, the corporation would not be liable"" even in that case, said attorney Kathleen Sullivan, representing Shell. The second case involves the Torture Victims Protection Act, passed two decades ago, and whether its provisions for liability for human rights abuses apply only to ""natural persons."" The family of Palestinian-born Azzam Rahim Mohamad -- a naturalized U.S. citizen -- claims intelligence officers are responsible for his beating death in 1995. U.S. officials later said three of the officers were implicated in the incident, but Rahim's relatives believe the Palestinian organizations that have defacto control of the disputed Mideast territories hold ultimate responsibility. The civil lawsuits in the international law context have been compared to a separate, high-profile domestic political dispute. The high court in 2010 concluded corporations -- businesses, unions, and issue advocacy groups -- enjoy the same free speech rights as individuals when it comes to independent election spending. Now the issue is whether corporations and political entities should be treated the same as individual offenders when it comes to enforcing international human rights. The cases are Kiobel v.

"(CNN) -- A Virginia man pleaded no contest to capital murder on Tuesday in the death of his girlfriend and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, Roanoke County officials said. Jeffrey Scott Easley, 33, was accused of murdering 41-year-old Tina Smith and abducting her 12-year-old daughter. Smith's body was discovered in her home on December 6, 2010. The daughter was found five days later in San Francisco after being spotted outside a supermarket. Circuit Court Judge James Swanson accepted Easley's plea and found him guilty of capital murder. He dropped the ""abduction with intent to defile"" charge and sentenced him to life in prison with no chance of parole. In January 2011, Easley wrote a letter to the Roanoke Times, saying the girl was his willing cross-country companion. ""I did not kidnapp her or take her aginest her will,"" Easley wrote in a misspelled letter postmarked from the Western Virginia Regional Jail. ""She made me promise not to leave her."" Smith died from blunt force trauma to the head, strangulation and suffocation.","A judge sentences Jeffrey Scott Easley to life in prison without the possibility of parole .

"(CNN) -- Victims and campaigners from the Bhopal disaster of 1984 have staged a ""die-in"" outside the UK's sports ministry to protest at the sponsorship role Dow Chemical Company will play in the London 2012 Olympics. The demonstrators object to the International Olympic Committee's 10-year deal with Dow, who in 2001 became owners of the firm that caused one of the worst industrial disasters in India, when nearly 4,000 people were killed by a gas leak at the Union Carbide plant. An estimated 45,000 others were said to be affected by the emission of poisonous gas at the site in Bhopal, which has caused cancer, disability and renal failure. The demonstrators want the Indian government to boycott the 2012 Games if the IOC keeps Dow as a sponsor, and said they will continue their protests after the Olympic body insisted their partner was not responsible for the tragedy. The campaigners are lobbying the UK government to rectify what it claims are ""transparent errors of moral judgment and legal reasoning"" in its failure to remove all support for Dow's sponsorship. India's government has written to the IOC to ask it to drop ties with Dow, while the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has threatened to withdraw from the Games if no action is taken. In a letter to the IOA, Jacques Rogge, president of the IOC, said: ""IOC recognizes that the Bhopal tragedy in 1984 was an horrific event for India and the world. ""The Olympic Movement sympathizes with the grief of the victims' families and regrets the ongoing suffering people face in the region. ""Dow had no connection with the Bhopal tragedy. Dow did not have any ownership stake in Union Carbide until 16 years after the accident and 12 years after the $470 million compensation agreement was approved by the Indian Supreme Court. ""We only enter into partnerships with organizations that we believe work in accordance with the values of the Olympic Movement."" But with the Indian Supreme Court reviewing the case for a third time, the protestors claimed Dow was engaged in an ""unethical refusal to deal with its unresolved legal and moral liabilities in Bhopal."" They also claimed Dow are misrepresenting facts and ""prolonging the suffering of thousands of people in Bhopal, including that of unborn generations."" Officials from the protest group met with representatives from the UK's high commission and handed over a petition complete with 21,000 signatures that asked for Dow to be dropped as an Olympic sponsor.","Indian group protest to UK government over sponsorship deal for London 2012 Games .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Drug Enforcement Administration is extending for another six months its emergency ban on five chemicals used to make synthetic drugs such as Spice, the DEA announced on Wednesday. The DEA already had banned the substances for a year, but with that period soon to expire, the DEA announced it will file a notice in the Federal Register on Thursday that will mean the chemicals will continue to be illegal. The substances used to make the fake pot products are: JWH-018, JWH-073, JWH-200, CP-47,497 (that's all one chemical CP-47,497) and cannabicyclohexanol. The names sound like an alphabetical and numerical soup. But the drugs are marketed as herbal incense under such names as K2, Blaze, Spice and Red X Dawn and have been popular with teenagers and young adults. The DEA says the products are made of plant material coated with chemicals that claim to mimic THC, the key ingredient in marijuana. The DEA's emergency action means the chemicals are designated as Schedule 1 substances, the most restrictive category of drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. ""Schedule 1 substances are reserved for those substances with a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision,"" according to a DEA press release. Poison control centers reported about 13,000 calls about problems with synthetic drugs in 2011, Deborah Carr of the American Association of Poison Control Centers said earlier this month. ""Sixty percent of the cases involved patients under the age of 25,"" said Carr. The poison centers and emergency room doctors say users of these synthetic drugs might have symptoms as convulsions, elevated heart rates, vomiting and disorientation. DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said the chemicals ""present an imminent danger to public safety."" The DEA's emergency powers to restrict the drugs cannot be extended more than 18 months, but the Department of Health and Human Services can take action to make the ban permanent. DEA officials also would like to see Congress pass legislation to outlaw synthetic drugs. The House passed a bill but the Senate has not followed suit.","The Drug Enforcement Administration is extending its ban for six months .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Dozens of Israeli security personnel stormed the compound housing the al-Aqsa mosque Friday after Palestinians threw rocks at nearby police, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. More than 100 Palestinians began throwing rocks at a police location following Friday prayers, prompting the police to enter the compound, Rosenfeld said. According to witnesses, Israeli forces used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the Palestinians. Ziad Hammouri, the director of Palestinian Jerusalem Center for Socio-Economic Rights, said a number of Palestinians were arrested and there were reports of some injuries. The disturbances mark the latest in a series of clashes and rock-throwing incidents around the compound in the past week, amid reports that Israeli authorities were allowing right-wing Jewish activists access to the site in order to stoke tensions with Palestinians.","Israeli security personnel enter mosque compound after Palestinians throw rocks at police .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A group of American and British pro-democracy activists accused of fomenting unrest in Egypt have left the country on a U.S. military plane, U.S. and Egyptian officials said Thursday. The workers were among a group of international workers for pro-democracy groups that had been under a travel ban that Egypt's government lifted Wednesday. One of the organizations involved praised the decision, but expressed concern for its Egyptian staffers who remained behind. Sixteen Americans were among the 43 workers for non-governmental organizations targeted in a December crackdown by Egypt's military-led government. They faced fraud charges before an Egyptian court, straining ties between Egypt and the United States, its leading ally. An Egyptian appellate judge, Abdel Moez Ibrahim, said Wednesday that the charges are still pending. And a lawyer representing some of the defendants, Negad El Borei, said the defendants paid bail of 2 million Egyptian pounds (about $132,000) before being allowed to leave. An Egyptian court opened their trial on fraud charges Sunday, but adjourned until late April after the charges were formally read. The three judges handling the case stepped down Tuesday. The workers are charged with operating in Egypt without being officially registered and receiving foreign funding. Egyptian authorities called their work part of a pattern of international interference that was stoking continued protests against the current government. One of those charged is Sam LaHood, director of Egypt operations for the International Republican Institute and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. The group said Thursday that it ""welcomes this decision and is hopeful that the charges against its expatriate and local Egyptian staff will be dismissed."" ""IRI views the decision as a positive development, but remains very concerned about the situation and our Egyptian employees along with the continuing investigations of Egyptian civil society groups and the impact it will have on Egypt's ability to move forward with the democratic transition that so many Egyptians have sought,"" it said in a written statement. Other groups targeted by the raids included the National Democratic Institute, Freedom House, the International Center for Journalists and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Only seven of the Americans were believed to have remained in Egypt, all of them at the U.S. Embassy. Their departure could ease a tense patch between Egypt and the United States, which provides more than $1 billion in annual aid to Egypt's military.","The activists had faced charges in an Egyptian court .

"(CNN) -- ""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine"" (Relic Entertainment, THQ) deftly takes the popular tabletop miniatures game and puts it into a video game with gun-blazing, sword-swinging action and a story that flows well. Players control Titus, a captain of the Ultramarines, as they and their comrades attempt to battle orks, demons and the forces of Chaos. There are plenty of weapons to satisfy your melee or missile tendencies in battle. All the action takes place in the third-person point of view, so the field of battle is easily kept in sight at all times. Minor enemies attack en masse and in waves, while tougher enemies usually show up to scrap all alone. Boss battles are demanding, and pulling off multiple attacks is almost required to conquer the last foe. Players often are accompanied by two other space marines who contribute to the wholesale slaughter of lesser opponents but seem to have little effect on boss battles. Hand-to-hand weapons can be knives, swords, axes and hammers while long-distance weapons start with pistols and go all the way to cannons. Ammunition and grenades can be found strewn around the battlefield to supply whatever weapons you have in your possession. Modes of combat are interchangeable and offer plenty of ways to wipe out enemies. Trigger buttons control the long-range weapons while controller buttons activate hand-to-hand abilities such as stun and execution. Performing an execution on a stunned enemy also rewards the player with points for good health. Hack-and-slash action makes for an enjoyable fight and really enhances the game. But it is more than just blood and gore (which, incidentally, gets splashed all over your character during battle, then magically disappears afterward) that make ""Space Marine"" worthy. The characters seem like they are ripped right from the British navy, with accents that sound like they come from the streets of London. Each character has his own feel and motivations, giving personality to even the lowliest speaking ones. The game's three main space marines all have their own quirks and idiosyncrasies. They are outfitted in colorful armor that probably would feel right at home in a ""World of Warcraft"" setting but with nods to symbols and icons of ancient civilizations. I found myself listening a little more intently than normal as characters spoke about their trials and tribulations. Small bits of soldiers' lives were revealed, helping make the entire experience more immersive. The story -- one of honor, courage and sacrifice -- could have readily been ignored or glossed over to focus more on the combat. However, developers were able to knit together a tale that also includes loss and betrayal while giving the player a feeling of omnipotence that makes it unique for shooters. But the single-player campaign game felt like it didn't last long enough, and the maps, while beautiful, were linear -- not allowing for exploration. The panoramic views and immense weaponry teased with the prospect of a wide world to be explored and liberated, only to be stifled by rubble and downed machinery at every turn. The ending, a cliffhanger of sorts, really was a jaw dropper. It's a testament to the writers for crafting an interesting (but short) story as well as the developers for making me feel so invested in my characters. I have never played ""Warhammer 40,000"" on the tabletop (mainly because I didn't have the funds to lay out for the miniature figures that are required), but ""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine"" on the console is well worth the investment. ""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine"" is available for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is rated M for mature due to blood and gore and intense violence. This review was done playing the single-player campaign on the Xbox 360.","In ""Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine,"" players control Titus, a captain of the Ultramarines .

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- Jazz, soul and a blend of rock and roll combine to make Senegalese music sound quite familiar, while the sound of the sabar, a traditional Senegalese drum, keeps the music true to its West African roots. I'm listening to the mbalax style of music for my latest ""Inside Africa"" assignment: to experience the special sounds of Senegal. Without a doubt, the biggest name in Senegalese drumming is Doudou N'Diaye Rose. He's almost mythical; every person I interviewed spoke of him as the ""sabar master."" With more than forty children and an untold number of grandkids, he's been performing since the 1930's, gradually crafting the unique rhythm of this part of the world -- literally with his bare hands. Meeting the legend was not what I expected. At 82 years old he has a small frame and is such a humble person. When we arrived at one of his homes, he was more concerned with our crew eating breakfast than showing off his many accomplishments. Doudou has performed with the Rolling Stones, Miles Davis, at the Cannes Film Festival and has been declared by UNESCO as a ""living human treasure."" Most of his children learned from him, playing in a traveling orchestra. Even his female grandchildren formed a group, practicing on the rooftop. However, when Dakar's chief drum major -- who is draped in an elaborate Grand Boubou print -- steps behind his wide array of drums, modesty leaves the room. The beats are complex, quickly changing from soft, rapid taps of the finger tips and palm to loud strikes by the galan, or stick. Strings pull the shaved goatskin surface tight and, by twisting a series of cylindrical pegs, each drum can be tuned just like a guitar. Doudou explains that what I'm hearing is more than music -- it's a beautiful language reminiscent of his childhood in the Plateau district. A time when certain types of drums would be used to communicate certain ideas; calm, joyful messages for wedding ceremonies, or exciting, encouraging sounds for young men heading off to battle. See also: Senegal island exposes horrors of the slave trade . Today, younger Senegalese artists are taking the Doudou sound and modernizing it. He often appears as a special guest on stage with artists like Coumba Gawlo -- currently one of the best selling female singers in the country. When I watched her performing, she was serenading crowds in the local language of Wolof, belting out the mbalax sound as she was being lowered in a golden cage onto a smoke-filled stage. But even next to a curvaceous woman wearing a sparkling dress, Doudou holds his own -- an octogenarian with as much stage presence as a pop star. From inside a lively recording studio elsewhere in town I find more local artists who cite Doudou as their inspiration. Daara J Family is a group made up of Faada Freddy and Ndongo D, plus the support of drummers, electric guitar players and a keyboardist. The sound is eclectic; I can hear Jamaican reggae influences in their beats and in Ndongo D's fast rapping style. Faadda Freddy tells me that in songs like ""Bayi Yoon,"" they pull from the South African vocal tradition, essentially sampling from every place they've toured. Local history is important to them as well. On Daara J Family's second album they included a song about Senegal's Goree Island as a modern way of discussing the trans-Atlantic slave trade. But mostly, the group is optimistic and forward-looking. Ndongo D explains to me that while they pull from the Doudou-created Senegalese sound they want to include more aspects of music in the African diaspora because ""we all came from Africa, and then went to different horizons to settle."" Their aim is to connect with people globally. See also: Beach life gives a taste of real Senegal . On this journey of discovery, it's becoming more apparent to me that music has been a powerful form of communication, expression and family bonding in Senegal. Getting to a place of a strong, almost spiritual connection is what mbalax is really about - even though it might sound quite foreign to many of us. It was a privilege to meet Doudou (and even get a personal lesson in drumming), wonderful to see traditional music get a contemporary twist, and eye-opening to see West African artists reaching out to the rest of the world. Faada Freddy summed up my impressions best: ""Being African is not a matter of color -- it's about heart.""","Mbalax, combining jazz, soul, and rock with traditional beats, is the dance music of Senegal .
The godfather of the scene is the 82-year-old drummer Doudou N'Diaye Rose .

"(CNN) -- Prue Murdoch, the daughter of Rupert by his first marriage, once told me that her abiding memory of her father over the breakfast table was not of his beaming face, but of the back page of a newspaper. One doubts if James Murdoch even remembers that. Judging by his evidence to the parliamentary inquiry into the ""industrial-scale"" hacking of innocent parties' phones by the News of the World and The Sun -- over which he presided, as executive chairman of their publisher, News International -- he appears to have suffered so bad a case of amnesia that it's a miracle he even remembered his own name. That his inquisitors, competitors and shareholders have struggled to believe his evidence is an understatement. Nonetheless, it still came as a surprise when James resigned from his position Wednesday, congratulating himself on the successful launch of the new Sun on Sunday last weekend. Coming so soon after the closure of the News of the World -- in apparent contrition for its despicable and illegal snooping, but in fact because advertisers had withdrawn their support -- the publication of the new Sunday rag has been widely perceived as an act of breathtaking cynicism. Pundits have even wondered if it was the Murdochs' plan all along to cut costs by replacing two papers with one leaner, seven-day operation. But that's another story. Today's questions are: Why did James go now; and how has his departure played in Parliament, in the press and with the public? To the first, the quick answer is that his I-don't-know-nuthin' stance was becoming untenable. Even the News of the World's ex-lawyer has pointed the finger at him, and it can only be a matter of time until hard proof of his complicity in either the hacking or its coverup becomes apparent. At another level, it can be seen as a PR move: Let the parliamentarians think they've got a scalp; and let the public and shareholders think there's a new broom in New International's Augean stable. If so, it has certainly impressed the money men: News International's share price rose 2% on the news, and there is speculation that the company is being primed for a sale. Many politicians are also happy. Against all the academic research, it is generally believed that the press has a huge effect on the public's voting intentions. And since the Murdoch press generally leans to the right, while its tormentors lean leftward, they are counting James' resignation as a victory for the common man. While the Conservative Party has been rather muted on the subject, Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman has weighed in with veiled demands for James' arrest and prosecution. But what of the common man? The truth is, he probably doesn't give a flying fig. A friend of mine who works in the popular press tells me that she recently commissioned some research into the attitudes of 1,000 former readers of the News of the World. ""If the paper was still being published, they would still be buying it,"" she said. ""Ninety-five percent of them either didn't know or didn't care about the methods by which the paper got its stories. ""They can feel sympathy for the parents of Milly Dowler [the murdered schoolgirl whose phone was hacked by News of the World investigators], as they can for Charlotte Church [the celebrity singer and another phone hacking victim]. But at the end of the day, their interest in a story will always outweigh any qualms about how it was obtained."" True, the public's interest in the James Murdoch story has hardly been piqued. Most papers have made very little of it. Maybe that's because they have their own misdemeanors to conceal; maybe because, in such a close-knit profession, it limits job prospects to attack the son of a major employer; maybe because of an unspoken convention among the press barons that they don't attack each other. But one suspects that our editors know what their readers really care about. Today, that's the death of Monkees frontman Davy Jones. And ain't that a shame? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tim Willis.","James Murdoch resigned as the chairman of News International on Wednesday .

"Buena Park, California (CNN) -- A hostage situation in a Southern California bank ended abruptly Thursday when the suspect was shot, police said. Aerial footage showed a person being carried on a stretcher through broken glass that earlier had been the window for a Saehan Bank branch in Buena Park, about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Emergency personnel could be seen attending to a person -- who appeared to be shirtless, bloodied and not moving -- before the person was taken away by ambulance. Around that time, Buena Park police Officer Andy Luong said, ""Shots have been fired, (and) the suspect is down."" It was not immediately clear what had happened, and the wounded person's condition also was unknown. Luong described the suspect then as ""still uncooperative."" A short time later, Luong said that ""the hostage is safe"" and the alleged kidnapper had been apprehended. Buena Park police said earlier that authorities got 911 calls shortly after 11 a.m. (2 p.m. ET) from customers who saw a man enter the bank with a gun. Bank employees also called police to report the largely silent gunman was walking around the bank, which serves predominantly Korean customers, according to Buena Park police Sgt. Bill Kohanek. A bank employee called 911 early on, helping negotiate the release of about 10 employees, customers and a security guard, police said. Kohanek said that, for a time, authorities were able to communicate with the hostage taker. ""He complied in all but one (case): He asked the bank manager to remain with him,"" the police sergeant said. The armed suspect was described, by police, as a man of Asian descent who was approximately 45 years old. The bank manager was a woman of about the same age. Authorities created a buffer zone between one-quarter and one-half mile of the small storefront bank, which is located in a strip mall next to a dentist's office. A Buena Park SWAT team was on hand and an FBI team was also ready to act, Kohanek said.","NEW: ""The hostage is safe,"" police say .

"(CNN) -- An international tribunal will issue a verdict in the war crimes trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor next month, the United Nations said. Taylor, who led Liberia from 1997 to 2003, was the first African ruler to appear before an international war crimes tribunal. Prosecutors allege he armed rebels and fueled a bloody civil war that led to widespread murder, rape and mutilation in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone. He has pleaded not guilty to charges including five counts of crimes against humanity and five counts of war crimes. The U.N-backed war crimes court said it will issue its ruling April 26. Taylor has been on trial since 2007 at the special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, Netherlands. United Nations officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities. In 2010, the United States said the trial faced a financial crisis and pledged to expedite a $4.5 million grant to the court. At the time, Washington urged the international community to donate to the court before its financial resources ran out. Closing arguments occurred last year. During the trial, the judges heard testimony from more than 100 people, including Taylor and supermodel Naomi Campbell . Campbell testified that Taylor gave her ""dirty-looking"" uncut diamonds as a gift during a dinner in South Africa. Prosecutors were hoping her testimony would tie him to so-called blood diamonds used to fund rebels during the war.","Taylor is the first African ruler to appear before an international war crimes tribunal .

"(CNN) -- Starbucks, better known for amusingly complicated premium coffee offerings, took a cue from fast-food chains and announced a plan Monday to sell pairings of coffee and breakfast for $3.95, citing the economic downturn. Will that be a breakfast sandwich or a roll with your coffee? Starbucks says it's offering breakfast pairings. With the $3.95 breakfast offer, customers will be able to get a 12-ounce coffee with a breakfast sandwich or roll or a 12-ounce latte with either oatmeal or a coffee cake. The company called the latest promotion an extension of various other recent Starbucks offers, including a loyalty card and discounting 16-ounce cold drinks to customers who made a purchase at Starbucks that morning. But the move may be more targeted to drawing back business lost to more cost efficient retailers like McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. Starbucks reported a profit of 9 cents per share in the last quarter of 2008, compared to a 28 cents per share profit a year earlier. The company announced last month it was slashing 6,700 jobs and closing 300 stores on top of the 600 stores it shut down in 2008. Over the last two decades, Starbucks transformed coffee from a commodity drink into a luxury item, growing into a chain with over 10,000 cafes internationally. But sales have taken a hit in the recession. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Howard Schultz, the company's chief executive, said the economic environment ""is a reset of both economic and social behavior."" Research done by William Blair & Co. suggests Starbucks' price premium ""has nearly evaporated over the past 18 months, with pricing now largely on par with Dunkin' Donuts."" The survey found that when adjusted for size differences, some varieties of Starbucks coffee were cheaper than Dunkin' Donuts. According to the research, McDonald's is still cheaper, but the price gap has narrowed since 2007. Blair & Co. also predicted that a trend downward in same store sales in 2008 would continue in 2009. Michelle King, a spokesperson for Dunkin' Donuts, told CNN the company still believes it is ""the faster and more affordable alternative."" Calls to McDonald's were not immediately returned.","Starbucks to offer pairings of coffee, breakfast for $3.95 .

The number of people traveling this holiday weekend is expected to increase slightly, compared with last year, although the number traveling by air is expected to decline, according to the American Automobile Association, a motorist and traveler organization. The AAA, which surveyed 1,350 American households, projects that 38.4 million people will travel over the holiday weekend, up from 37.8 million last year. However, the number traveling by air is expected to decline to 2.3 million, the automobile association said. In 2008, 2.5 million people traveled by plane for Thanksgiving. See the FAA's flight delays map . AAA said the slight increase in the number of Thanksgiving travelers from last year reflects improved consumer confidence as well as ""a growing sense among many consumers that the worst of the global economic crisis is behind us."" Citing excess baggage fees and surcharges for jet fuel, along with delays and flight groundings, AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said it's ""not a very friendly environment this decade for the airline industry or the airline traveler."" David Ross, who was at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife and four children to catch a flight to Cancun, Mexico, offered some advice. ""You have to be calm and collected when you come to this airport, especially on a day like today,"" Ross, from Libertyville, Illinois, told CNN affiliate WGN. However, by 1 p.m. ET, delays at the country's airports appeared to be minimal, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's Web site. It reported that some arriving flights at the airports in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey, and at LaGuardia Airport in New York were delayed because of low cloud ceilings. ""So far, so good,"" traveler Andy Warman told CNN affiliate WABC at LaGuardia Airport. ""My flight's on time, so I'm pretty happy about that,"" added Warman, who was headed to Miami, Florida, to see family. At Washington's Reagan National Airport, the morning lines seemed like those of any other day. ""It's deserted,"" one woman told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""There's nobody here."" Of course, the bulk of Thanksgiving travelers will be going by car, AAA said -- about 33.2 million. ""I'm going to probably end up sitting in traffic for five hours,"" said Jack DeManche, 21, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who plans on driving home Wednesday night to Uxbridge, Massachusetts. The drive is usually only about two hours from Amherst, but DeManche -- a resident adviser at the school -- won't be able to leave until he closes one of the student residence halls. ""I have to work until at least 6 p.m., and then I have to pack up,"" he said, adding that in years past, the drive has taken more than twice as long as it does on nonholiday weeks. But even so, he said, he'd rather brave the drive home Wednesday night than Thursday morning. ""I'd so much rather get home tonight,"" he said. In Oklahoma, the state's department of public safety said multiple accidents had shut down Interstate 35 in both directions around Billings. CNN affiliate KWTV said the closures occurred around 12:25 p.m. In California, an accident on the Golden Gate Bridge prompted authorities to close the bridge for a time, snarling traffic. The bridge reopened shortly after noon (3 p.m. ET), but Golden Gate Bridge District spokeswoman Mary Currie said the backup of traffic would take some time to clear. About 2.9 million people will travel by train, watercraft, bus or a combination of transportation modes, and 2.3 million will travel by air, the automobile association predicted. Jennifer Burrell, from Tucker, Georgia, said she, her husband and their two daughters were driving Thursday morning to just outside of Asheville, North Carolina. They'll return Sunday. She said she wasn't expecting traffic on the way up, but ""it always gets heavy"" on the way back. Of course, some Americans are not traveling at all. Heather McKinnon of Broomfield, Colorado, said she is staying home with family for Thanksgiving. ""I don't like to fly and really rarely like flying on holidays,"" she said, adding that she would consider driving. ""I know what it's like going through the airport,"" she said. Plus, she added, ""everything I love is here."" CNN's Taylor Gandossy and Augie Martin contributed to this report.","AAA predicts 38.4 million Americans will travel over the holiday weekend .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama hosted a dinner to salute soldiers recently back from Iraq -- marking his first major tribute to the veterans since officially withdrawing all troops from the nation. The White House said it invited more than 100 veterans and one guest each to the event Wednesday night, and a few veteran groups and Gold Star families. ""In the history of this house, there has never been a night quite like this,"" Obama said. ""This evening we welcome not the statesmen who decide great questions of war and peace, but citizens men and women from every corner of our country, from every rank of our military, every branch of our service, who answer the call, who go to war, who defend the peace."" Touching upon veteran difficulties following the Vietnam War, Obama pledged to thank and honor the service of wartime veterans. ""You succeeded in your mission,"" Obama said. ""In your resilience, we see the essence of America because we do not give up. All of you taught us a lesson about the character of our country."" At the end of his 10 minute speech, the president raised a glass of water and toasted his guests. ""To the country we love, to the men and women who defend her, and to that faith -- that fundamental American faith -- that says no mission is too hard, no challenge is too great,"" Obama said. ""Through tests and through trials, we don't simply endure, we are stronger than before, knowing that America's greatest days are still to come. And they are great because of you. Cheers."" The dinner, which the White House called ""A Nation's Gratitude: Honoring those who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn,"" also included remarks from Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. ""Thank you for your duty, for your dedication, for your service to this great nation,"" Panetta said. ""Tonight we are truly in the company of heroes."" The president promised that these types of events would continue. ""This is not the first time we've paid tribute to those who served courageously in Iraq,"" Obama said. ""This will not be the last.

"New Brunswick, New Jersey (CNN) -- The man Tyler Clementi was intimate with just days before he committed suicide took the stand Friday, telling jurors that he had noticed a web camera aimed at Clementi's bed. The witness, who prosecutors named only as ""M.B."" to protect his identity, testified during the sixth day of the trial of a former Rutgers University student, Dharun Ravi. Ravi is accused of spying on and intimidating Clementi, his former university roommate, because he was gay. M.B., 32, testified Friday that he first met Clementi on an internet social networking site for gay men and that they eventually met in the student's dorm room three times. The two conversed online, exchanged text messages and later had sex. At one point when they were together in the dorm room, M.B. glanced over at Ravi's desk and saw ""a camera lens pointed at (Clementi's) bed."" He also testified that he had briefly met Ravi while visiting Clementi. Ravi on one occasion allegedly left the room and came back, ""walked to his desk, shuffled around a bit and then walked out."" M.B. testified that on September 19, 2010, he drove to meet Clementi at his building, three days after the first visit. When he left, M.B. said he saw about five people milling around the hallway who seemed to be looking at him. ""They didn't say anything,"" he said. But they were looking at him in a way that made him wonder why they were staring, he said. ""But as I was a guest in their building, I just brushed it off."" Ravi's lawyer, Steve Altman, has said M.B. looked out of place at the university because of his age, which had prompted the stares. Students also testified that he appeared to look ""shabby."" Altman has argued that his client had switched on the web cam to monitor his personal items because he did not trust his roommate's visitor. But prosecutors say Ravi and another student placed the camera in the room without Clementi's knowledge to spy and humiliate the student because he was gay. After one particular visit, M.B. testified, ""We were both laying together in (Clementi's) bed. I could hear people talking in the courtyard. People joking, people laughing."" M.B. said he last met Clementi on September 21. Just days later, the 18-year-old student took his own life by leaping from the George Washington Bridge and into the Hudson River. During his testimony, M.B. appeared uncomfortable, shifting his eyes between Clementi's family and the ground. On Thursday, Rutgers graduate Geoffrey Irving testified that Ravi had told him after an ultimate Frisbee practice that he set up the web cam and was planning to do it again that evening, September 21. Ravi, 20, now faces a 15-count indictment in Clementi's death that includes charges of bias intimidation, invasion of privacy, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution. His trial began last Friday. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison. Last year, he turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. Less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Obama released a videotaped message condemning bullying. In November, Clementi's family consented to the use of his name on federal anti-harassment legislation called the ""Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act."" The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid ""to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student,"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey.","Friday is the sixth day of the trial of a former Rutgers University student accused of spying .

"New York (CNN) -- The University of Connecticut men's basketball program will be penalized for recruitment violations, including a suspension for head coach Jim Calhoun, the NCAA announced Tuesday. ""The case includes more than $6,000 in improper recruiting inducements, impermissible phone calls and text messages to prospective student-athletes,"" the NCAA said. Additional allegations include, ""failure to monitor and promote an atmosphere for compliance by the head coach, failure to monitor by the university, and unethical conduct by the former operations director."" Following a two-year investigation, the Division I Committee on Infractions found that UConn men's basketball staff members violated NCAA rules, exchanging 150 calls and 190 text messages with prospective recruits, and providing complimentary game tickets. The committee also found that Calhoun, who has been head coach for 24 years, knowingly allowed a booster and certified NBA agent to participate in recruitment and make prohibited financial contributions to a potential student-athlete. ""Penalties include suspension of the head coach for three conference games during the 2011-12 season, scholarship reductions for three academic years, recruiting restrictions, permanent disassociation of a booster and three years probation,"" the NCAA announced. Calhoun responded, saying, ""I am very disappointed with the NCAA's decision in this case. My lawyer and I are evaluating my options and will make a decision which way to proceed."" In addition, the coaches and compliance staff must attend the NCAA Regional Rules Seminar. The former operations director was penalized with a two-year show-cause order, which essentially prevents him from participating in college basketball during the time allotted. ""Let me be very clear, we will comply fully with the NCAA's sanctions and work with great resolve to restore the luster to our men's basketball program,"" University of Connecticut President Philip Austin said Tuesday. Dr. Dean Thomas, chair of the Committee on Infractions, defended the decision against claims from reporters that the punishment might have been too weak. ""I can assure you with 100% accuracy that the committee is not influenced by high-profile cases or high-profile coaches,"" Thomas said on a conference call. ""The committee bases its deliberations on the information presented.""","Allegations include improper recruiting inducements, prohibited phone calls and texts .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched an outspoken defense of the European project on Wednesday, but warned that the bloc's richest nation would not make bailout promises to solve the eurozone crisis that it cannot keep. Speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos, Merkel said Germany is rightly seen as being relatively strong. But if her country commits to paying for a huge expansion of the eurozone's bailout funds, and even that is torpedoed by the capital markets, then there is a real problem. Merkel told a standing room-only crowd that the ""people say it has to be double, then it has to be triple, then we will believe you."" ""We have said right from the start we wish to stand up for the euro, but we don't want to ... make a promise that we can't fulfil."" Map: Europe in crisis . The eurozone set up a temporary bail-out fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- after Greece's first bail-out in May 2010. It initially had €250 billion ($326 billion) in lending capacity, which was later boosted to €440 billion as more eurozone countries stumbled. The creation of the eurozone's permanent facility, the European Stability Mechanism, was brought forward and it will now be in place this year rather than 2013. It will have lending capacity of €500 billion, and is backed by paid-in capital from eurozone member countries. Q&A: Will new deal solve Europe's problems? Merkel appeared to show her frustration with the rest of the European community, some of whose members are suspicious of the motives of the bloc's two strongest economies. ""It is on the one hand expected from Germany and France that we show a harmonious front. ""They don't like us when we don't like each other and they don't like us when we agree on matters before we come here because then we are the ones that call the shots apparently, and that is frustrating."" Merkel also warned that the structure of the ""great European project"" needed substantive reform if the crisis that has brought the European single currency to the brink of collapse is to be resolved. ""There is a clear lack of political structures and underpinnings to make this work."" She was speaking the day after the International Monetary Fund lowered its outlook for the world economy. It called for immediate action to avert a global depression -- raising the specter of the downturn of the 1920s. The IMF now expects the world economy to grow 3.3% in 2012, compared to its previous prediction of 4% expansion this year. The pessimistic outlook was mainly driven by the intensifying debt crisis in Europe, with the 17 nations of the eurozone expected to suffer a mild recession this year, the IMF said. ""We are not going to become fainthearted. We will not be able to wave a magic wand to address this,"" she told delegates in Davos, adding that there was ""a clear erosion of confidence"" in the rest of the world with Europe. In comments that could cause concerns about Germany's growing influence in Europe, Merkel said: ""We have seen that something needs to be changed here, so it is not only austerity measures ... but also structural reforms that lead to more jobs."" Outside the conference hall, Martin Sorrell, head of advertising giant WPP, said Merkel's ""call for greater political unity was the price for Germany bailing Greece out and putting a firewall around Italy to avoid severe contagion"" in world markets. Sorrell said her call for stronger fiscal and political integration in Europe could mean further confrontation between Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron. EU leaders agreed in October to provide a second €130 billion rescue package for Greece and announced a deal with private sector investors to voluntarily write down the value of Greek government bonds by 50% as part of a debt exchange. But on Tuesday a major credit agency warned that Greece will eventually default on its debts, even if the nation reaches a restructuring deal with creditors. Negotiations with the private sector have also stalled and there is disagreement among some policymakers over whether requiring Greece to enact more austerity as a condition of a second bailout will help or hurt the nation's fragile economy. Merkel, who with Sarkozy, has been at the heart of efforts to rescue the eurozone from the debt crisis, conceded in a newspaper interview published on Wednesday she did have doubts about her demand for more fiscal rigor from debt-ridden governments, which have met widespread opposition. ""Good politicians always have doubts, as a way of constantly reviewing whether they are on the right track,"" the Guardian reported her as saying. Nevertheless she insisted the European court of justice should enforce the public spending and budget policies of eurozone nations. And in another policy that sets her at odds with many euroskeptic politicians including Cameron, Merkel raised the specter of full European political union, with more national laws ceded to Brussels. The only good piece of news for Merkel was that German business confidence brightened for a third month in a row, suggesting that growth may already be resuming in Europe's largest economy.

"(CNN) -- The careers of Russian oligarchs who have sought to wield power against the Kremlin in the media or politics have not tended to go far. Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, an oil magnate who backed an opposition party, has been in jail since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 on charges of tax evasion and fraud. Vladimir A. Gusinsky and Boris A. Berezovsky, both of whom owned media outlets that were critical of the government, fled the country. During the 1990s, it was common for oligarchs to oppose the Kremlin, said Henry Hale, director of the Institute for Europe, Russian and Eurasian Studies at George Washington University. But once Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, ""He started making examples of high-profile business people/oligarchs,"" Hale said. Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, was building an organization that could have served as a platform from which to challenge Putin in 2004, Hale said. ""His real sin was mobilizing a campaign that seemed aimed at the presidency,"" he added. Khodorkovsky's jailing in 2004 ""served as an example for most of the others,"" Hale said. ""You didn't see many other big business people openly challenging the government since that time."" Instead, wealthy Russians have been careful not to draw the Kremlin's ire, he said. ""They either laid low or supported the Kremlin's leadership actively."" Now, it's Mikhail Prokhorov, the owner of the New Jersey Nets whose $18 billion puts him among the world's richest people and who announced Monday he is running to replace Putin. Profile: Who is Mikhail Prokhorov? Though Prokhorov is unlikely to topple the incumbent, his fate could prove more benign than that of many of his fellow oligarchs, said Stephen Cohen, professor of Russian studies and history at New York University. ""He would not do it without the support of Putin or the men around Putin,"" said Cohen in a telephone interview. ""He's not an independent actor ... his wealth is still dependent on Kremlin approval."" Prokhorov, like all the oligarchs who remain in Russia with their wealth intact, has made political and probably financial accommodations with the Kremlin, said Cohen, author of ""Soviet Fate and Lost Alternatives."" Among Prokhorov's assets are vast mineral holdings that remain underground. ""He'd like to sell them outright, or at least a controlling share of them, to Western countries so he can cash in while his political standing is OK,"" Cohen said. But companies in the West will not deal with him or any other oligarch unless a commission established in Russia for such investment approves it, he said. ""And the chairman of the commission is Putin."" That means Prokhorov is unlikely to do anything to offend Putin, Cohen said. So, why is he running against him? As things now stand, Putin will be running against Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the longtime leader of the Communist Party, which represents the only real electoral opposition in the country, according to Cohen. Though not well-funded, the party is well-organized and efficient and could make Zyuganov a more formidable opponent at the polls by the March election, Cohen said. That scenario is even more likely if Zyuganov benefits from protest votes by the thousands of Russians who have taken to the streets in recent days, Cohen said. If the demonstrators and their sympathizers are members of the affluent middle class, as some observers have suggested, ""Then it would make sense to give them somebody other than the Communists to vote for -- if you're looking to divide the anti-Putin vote,"" he said. ""They'll vote for the so-called successful businessman."" Demonstrations challenge Putin's hold on power . Prokhorov's candidacy would likely draw the anti-Putin vote away from the Communists and divide the opposition, Cohen said. ""They think they know what they're doing, and I guess they do,"" he added. But Hale was not persuaded that Prokhorov's candidacy is fake. ""Conspiracy theories sometimes, actually, are just conspiracy theories,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""In this particular case, it seems to be real."" Citing the civil unrest shaking Russia, he said, ""people like him are sensing now's the time to criticize the Kremlin. Still, Hale acknowledged, Prokhorov appears to have hedged his bets. ""He has criticized people around Putin, but not Putin himself."" But even if pseudo-candidates wind up in the election, that's not necessarily a bad omen for democracy, Cohen said. More choice ""is the foundation of a democratic system,"" he added. One reason that suggests Prokhorov may be sincere in his putative effort to unseat Putin is the fact that his sister runs quasi-academic journals financed by her brother that are frequently critical of the Kremlin, said Harley Balzer, a professor of government at Georgetown University. But he, too, said it was not clear. ""It's an important story; I wish we knew what the hell was going on,"" he said in a telephone interview.","Mikhail Khodorkovsky's jailing ""served as an example,"" professor says .
Mikhail Prokhorov would not run without Kremlin's support, professor says .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- A Chinese factory that makes iPhones said Wednesday that it has suspended several staffers after an employee committed suicide, apparently under duress when a prototype went missing. Foxconn manufactures the popular iPhone for U.S.-based Apple in China.

"(CNN) -- Andre Villas-Boas' troubles as Chelsea manager deepened on Saturday as he watched his side go down to a 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion in the English Premier League. An 82nd minute strike by defender Gareth McAuley was enough to sent the Blues' crashing to a seventh league defeat. The result also means they lose ground on London rivals Arsenal in the race to finish fourth place and secure Champions League football next season. ""It wasn't good enough and it's not been good enough for quite some time. We don't win enough games and they are not numbers that make us proud. In football there is joy and there is pain,"" Villas-Boas told BBC Sport after the game. Robin van Persie's deft injury-time volley gave Arsenal all three points against Liverpool at Anfield. Liverpool were awarded a penalty in the 19th minute when Tomasz Szczesny brought down Luis Suarez, but made amends palming Dirk Kuyt's spot kick to safety. But four minutes later the Reds went ahead when Laurent Koscielny turned the ball into his own net as he tried to divert Jordan Henderson's cross. But the lead didn't last long as van Persie headed home his first from a Bacary Sagna cross in the 31st minute. The game looked to be heading for a draw when the Dutch striker caressed the ball past Pepe Reina in the second minute of injury time to leave Liverpool 10 points adrift of a Champions League place. Arsenal are now three points clear of Chelsea in fourth place with 49 points. League leaders Manchester City enjoyed a comfortable 2-0 win against Bolton Wanderers at the Etihad Stadium. A 23rd-minute own goal by Icelandic defender Gretar Steinsson handed Roberto Mancini's team the lead. Mario Balotelli's 14th goal of the season in the 69th minute ensured all three points and a five-point lead at the top of the table. Nearest rivals Manchester United play Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Bolton remain mired in trouble, level on 20 points with bottom side Wigan who also lost on Saturday going down 2-0 at home to Swansea City who despite the win stay in 14th place with 33 points. Stoke City made it back-to-back wins in the league with 1-0 victory over Norwich at the Britannia Stadium -- a result which keeps them in eighth place. Queens Park Rangers drew 1-1 with Everton at Loftus Road to rise to 16th in the table. West Brom's win means Everton drop to 11th.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy rescued a survivor from an Iranian cargo vessel that sank in the Persian Gulf, killing at least three other crew members, the military said Sunday. It was the latest incident in a string of rescues since the beginning of the year, against a backdrop of high tensions between the United States and Iran. The coastal patrol boat USS Firebolt and the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Maui conducted a search and rescue mission for survivors of the capsized Iranian dhow -- a sailing vessel typically used to haul cargo -- on Saturday and Sunday, the Navy said in a statement. The Firebolt's crew also recovered the remains of three of those who had died in the sinking, the Navy said. One survivor was recovered and treated for shock and hypothermia. He said the dhow sank in bad weather Friday night with six mariners aboard. The sailor reported that four of his shipmates died and one was missing, according to the Navy. The U.S. ships searched for the possible survivor and the fourth body, in an effort that also included two Seahawk helicopters and the dock landing ship USS Pearl Harbor. But they could not find them, and ultimately ended the search due to bad weather, the Navy said. The Iranian mariner was transferred to the Maui, and then to an Iranian Coast Guard vessel. In January, U.S. sailors from a carrier strike group rescued 13 Iranian sailors from a hijacked fishing boat, and the U.S. Coast Guard rescued six Iranian mariners from a flooded vessel at the northern end of the Gulf.","The Iranian dhow sank in bad weather, a survivor tells the U.S. Navy .

"San Francisco (CNN) -- As Nokia prepares for its next crucial venture into the U.S. and high-end smartphones, the Finnish cell-phone maker is missing a crucial piece: an abundant catalog of applications. Nokia is attempting to woo app developers with such incentives as pre-installing their software on the forthcoming phone, prominent promotion for their products and funding development of an app, according to three people involved in the negotiations. A vibrant app store has become a major selling point to smartphone customers. In the past, Nokia, which sells the highest volume of mobile phones worldwide, has made efforts to work with some creators of apps for its platforms. A Nokia spokeswoman said the company offers app developers a variety of incentives, some in partnership with Microsoft, which include coding assistance and marketing. ""We do not disclose these arrangements, as each is different,"" she said. Microsoft declined to comment for this story. The premiere phone, which is codenamed Sea Ray and currently being field tested by company executives, will be Nokia's first to run Windows Phone 7, the year-old mobile operating system from Microsoft. Nokia is expected to release the phone in the next few months, say two executives who are familiar with the plans but not authorized to speak publicly. On Tuesday, Microsoft began distributing the new version of Windows Phone, which will run on the Nokia device. Last year, Microsoft made similar offers to developers that make apps trendy on other platforms. Some companies took the cash, but others declined because they feared wasting time working on a platform that would prove unpopular and then having to maintain it. The people involved in the Nokia negotiations expressed similar concerns. One veteran app developer, Ken Sun, said that when he was working at eBay, Microsoft offered his team money to fund the development of a Windows Phone app. Sun, who is now a product manager for Mint financial software, declined to comment on current talks with Microsoft. Developers that turned down earlier offers from Microsoft and are fielding new deals from Nokia should be able to ""double dip,"" or collect payments from both companies, Sun said. Todd Moore, who makes a sleep-companion app called White Noise, received a free Windows Phone device from Microsoft last year in exchange for building his app for the platform. But the version for Windows Phone has performed poorly compared to other platforms and has not generated enough revenue to fund ongoing development, he said. ""It was kind of a horrible experience,"" Moore said. ""The whole thing was just a complete mess. I had to get on the phone with Microsoft just to get my app published."" Offering prizes in exchange for apps is not unheard of. Sony and Adobe Systems recently held a contest for Android tablet apps in which the companies will pay $200,000 in November to the winning developers. Hardware manufacturers and carriers occasionally approach developers with free promotion on their app stores in exchange for offering software for a particular system or storefront, but dispensing cash in private deals as Nokia is doing is less common, according to people familiar with the matter. In a crowded smartphone market quickly being dominated by Google's Android and Apple's iPhone, Windows Phone has struggled to gain traction. That's partly due to its meager offering of apps, as well as a lack of commitment from phone manufacturers and cellular carriers that have favored Android for their flagship products. Microsoft is hoping to solve both problems with its long-term ""strategic partnership"" with Nokia, the highest-volume cell-phone manufacturer worldwide. At the same time, Nokia is hoping to regain smartphone sales sapped by competitors. Nokia's share of the smartphone-platform market sunk to 22% in the second quarter from nearly double that a year ago, according to Gartner, a Stamford, Connecticut-based tech research firm. Nokia said on Thursday that it plans to cut 3,200 jobs, which comes after laying off 7,000 workers in April. Mobile versions of Windows had 1.6% of the mobile operating-system market in the most recent quarter, less than it had a year ago, according to Gartner's data. In contrast, Google had 43%, and Apple had 18%. ""We felt that with Windows Phone we had a greater chance of maintaining long-term differentiation,"" Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a former Microsoft executive, said at a conference in June. However, ""we need the Windows Phone ecosystem to grow overall."" Nokia is opening its wallet in the hope of spurring that growth.","Nokia is offering to pay developers to make apps for its new phone, sources say .
Such payments from phone manufacturers are unusual .

"(CNN) -- Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar was again denied the chance to secure a record 100th international century on Friday as Australia won the second Test in Sydney by an innings and 68 runs to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the four-match series. Tendulkar is international cricket's record run scorer in both the five-day and limited overs formats but has been stranded on 99 centuries since March last year. The 38-year-old batsman made 73 in the first innings of India's 122-run defeat in Melbourne, and this time the ""Little Master"" fell for 80 after being caught by Michael Hussey off the part-time bowling of Australia captain Michael Clarke. Having started the penultimate day on 112-4, 354 runs behind Australia's 659-4 declared, the tourists were dismissed for 400 to end any hopes of a first series win on the continent. Clarke's triple ton squeezes India . It was another frustrating dismissal for Tendulkar, who fell agonizingly short against the West Indies in his home city Mumbai in November when he was out for 94. His last century came against South Africa at the 50-over World Cup when he reached 111. Tendulkar's wicket was all the more sweet for man of the match Clarke, whose unbeaten 329 with the bat put Australia in control of the match. ""It's a very nice wicket to have, that's for sure,"" Clarke told reporters. ""To be able to get such a great player out is a very handy wicket, so I was stoked with that. ""Sachin's been such a great player for so long, everyone goes through that period. It's nice that he's not made his 100th hundred in this series, but there's a long way to go. Never write off great players. As a team we have the greatest respect for him."" Resuming on eight, Tendulkar quickly reached 50 off 89 balls -- including seven fours -- and went to the lunch break on 70, before being caught at slip from Clarke's gentle left-arm off-spin. Opening batsman Gautam Gambhir earlier fell for 83, while VVS Laxman added 103 with Tendulkar before becoming the fifth man to depart for 66. Laxman and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (2) both went to fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus, who completed a five-wicket haul when he dismissed Ravi Ashwin for 62 to end the innings. ""We have lost the chance of winning the series, but with two more Test matches to go we can level the series so that's what we're looking to do,"" said Dhoni, whose team made a disappointing 191 in the first innings. ""It is a bit of a worry but the good thing is in the second innings we saw the batsmen score runs. What we have seen in the last couple of Test matches is everybody has scored at least a 50 which gives us an indication that we need to convert those fifties into big innings and put runs on the board."" Hilfenhaus ended the Sydney match with figures of 8-157, but Australia's celebrations were tempered by the news that promising young fast bowler James Pattinson will miss the final two clashes of the series due to a foot injury. The 21-year-old played a major role in Australia's victory, taking four wickets in the first innings and one in the second, and has an impressive haul of 25 wickets in his first four Test matches. Meanwhile, South Africa clinched a long-awaited 2-1 series victory at home to Sri Lanka after winning the third Test in Cape Town by 10 wickets on Friday. The tourists reached 342 in their second innings after a battling 115 not out by Thilan Samaraweera, which meant the Proteas needed just two runs for victory. Sri Lanka resumed on day four at 138-4 with Samaraweera on 19, and raised hopes of setting a decent target as he took his partnership with Angelo Mathews to 142. But Vernon Philander trapped all-rounder Mathews leg before wicket for 63, and the fast bowler then claimed his third wicket as young wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal went for one. Spinner Imran Tahir and all-rounder Jaques Kallis mopped up the tail to also finish with three wickets each as South Africa won a series at home for the first time since 2008.","Sachin Tendulkar denied the chance to secure a record 100th international century .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- She burst on the music scene as one-third of Destiny's Child, the highest-selling female group of all time. Kelly Rowland took an AIDS test in a tiny counseling room in a Kenyan hospital. And then she proved it doesn't take three to make hits. Sassy Kelly Rowland showed the world she could go it alone and still hit No. 1 on the charts. But now this Grammy-winning R&B sensation is using her considerable charm and charisma to take on the scourge of AIDS. She is the first ambassador for MTV's Staying Alive Foundation, which works to empower young people to protect them against AIDS. In silver high heels and a sundress, Rowland arrived Thursday at the Kenyatta Hospital in downtown Nairobi, Kenya, to take a public stand against stigma and undergo an HIV test. ""For me, knowing your status is glamorous because then you get to carry that with you and you get to protect yourself,"" she said. Rowland and 22-year-old Kenyan John Ngugi took the test together in a tiny counseling room at the testing center at this public hospital. He also wanted to know his status, but he couldn't suppress a large grin at times sitting next to such star power.  Watch CNN's David McKenzie report on Rowland's trip » . ""As a young person from Mathare slum and having a super star to actually have a test with,"" said Ngugi, ""It is just a big promise for me and a big promise for my community and I am just grateful for the test."" Like much of Africa, Kenya struggles with the AIDS pandemic. UNAIDS, the joint  United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, estimates that more than 22 million adults and children are living  with HIV on the continent. And it strikes the youth hardest. ""You could take a situation like having HIV and think of it as having a disability and think of it as something that is going to bring you down,"" said Rowland, ""but I have met kids and young people that are just so inspiring. They inspire me."" In Kenya, as in many parts of Africa, people are often afraid to take an HIV test for fear of being stigmatized. In Kenya, antiretroviral drugs are free for HIV-positive people, but many people would rather not know whether they are HIV positive for fear of facing discrimination in the workplace and in the community. And so Kelly Rowland has added her voice to the campaign to help end the suffering of so many victims. ""It's killing us as people and I think above anything these numbers aren't changing,"" she said. ""The more that I get involved, you get everybody out there ... involved, then hopefully we can see a change -- a big change.""","Singer Kelly Rowland takes an HIV test in Kenya to raise awareness of the virus .

"(EW.com) -- Four new movies were no match for the feline phenom ""The Lion King 3D,"" which ruled the box office for the second weekend in a row with $22.1 million, according to studio estimates. The 1994 Disney classic dropped only 27 percent -- an incredibly impressive hold considering this is the re-release of a 17-year-old film that's coming out on Blu-ray/DVD in one week. The 3-D version has now grossed $61.7 million, bringing ""The Lion King""'s cumulative tally to $390.2 million. Disney says it plans to extend what was originally intended to be just a two-week release, although details are still being ironed out. The weekend's runner-up was the new Brad Pitt baseball drama ""Moneyball,"" which batted a solid $20.6 million. If the estimate holds, that'll represent the best opening ever for a baseball film, beating 2006â€²s ""The Benchwarmers"" ($19.7 million). Surprisingly for a sports movie, ""Moneyball"" drew a crowd that was evenly split between men and women, although it skewed quite older, with 89 percent of the audience at least 25 years old. Both critics and moviegoers were fans -- the PG-13 film received some of the strongest reviews of the year and earned an ""A"" rating from CinemaScore participants. ""Moneyball"" will now try to follow in the box-office footsteps of last year's ""The Social Network,"" which debuted to a similar $22.4 million en route to a domestic total of $97 million. Both movies were released by Sony in the middle of fall and were written by Aaron Sorkin (who co-wrote ""Moneyball"" with Steven Zaillian). The two films even cost around the same amount to produce: $50 million for ""Moneyball"" and $40 million for ""Social Network."" Right behind ""Moneyball"" was the PG-rated family drama ""Dolphin Tale"" with $20.3 million. The Warner Bros. film joined ""Soul Surfer"" and ""The Help"" to become the year's third release to score an ""A+"" from CinemaScore audiences. As a result, ""Dolphin Tale"" is expected to hold up particularly well in the next few weeks and should easily earn back its $37 million budget. Showings in 3-D theaters accounted for 50 percent of the film's opening. Fourth place went to Lionsgate's ""Abduction,"" starring ""The Twilight Saga""'s Taylor Lautner is his first solo lead role. The PG-13 action film debuted to a modest $11.2 million -- slightly below industry predictions. The $35 million movie received most of its business from young women, with 68 percent of the audience being female and 56 percent under than age of 25. Abduction garnered a lackluster ""B-"" rating from CinemaScore moviegoers, though women under the age of 18 were more generous with an ""A-"" grade. And according to CinemaScore, 56 percent of ticket buyers listed Lautner as their main reason for attending the movie. So the 19-year-old actor does have box-office potential, but it's currently limited to teenage girls. Finally, in fifth was the R-rated thriller ""Killer Elite,"" which snagged a disappointing $9.5 million. The $66 million movie, starring Jason Statham, Clive Owen, and Robert De Niro, is the first picture to be released by Open Road Films, a partnership between the AMC and Regal theater chains. But despite its buzz-worthy cast, the film couldn't match the $11.4 million debut of Statham's last live-action project, January's ""The Mechanic."" CinemaScore graders handed ""Killer Elite"" a so-so ""B"" rating. In limited release, the action biopic ""Machine Gun Preacher"" -- starring Gerard Butler as real-life biker-turned-defender-of-Sudanese-orphans Sam Childers -- underwhelmed with $44,000 at four theaters. And ""Puncture,"" featuring Chris Evans as a drug-addicted lawyer, also disappointed, grossing $35,700 from four locations. 1. The Lion King 3D -- $22.1 mil . 2. Moneyball -- $20.6 mil . 3.

"(CNN) -- Tributes have flooded in for former West Indies Test player Runako Morton, who was killed in a car crash in Trinidad Sunday. The 33-year-old Morton played all three forms of international cricket for the West Indies, last representing them two years ago. Reports said he was driving home alone on his way home from a match when the tragic accident occurred in central Trinidad. West Indies Cricket Board president Dr Julian Hunte gave the official reaction to his death. ""Runako's passing, still in the prime of life, leaves us all in shock,"" he said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends as we all try to come to terms with his loss. ""He will be remembered as a fierce competitor on the field who gave no quarter whether he was playing for West Indies, Leeward Islands, Nevis or Trinidad and Tobago."" Former captain Chris Gayle tweeted: ""We lost a True Warrior WI Cricketer Runako Morton - May (h)is soul . rest in peace! While former teammate Wavell Hinds also used his Twitter blog to express his feelings. ""Gone far too soon brother Runako. I will treasure the great memories for sure. RIP. God knows best."" Morton, who hailed from the tiny island of Nevis, scored 573 Test runs at an average of 22.03 and 1519 in one day internationals (ODI) at 33.75. His Test debut came against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2005, and he made his maiden ODI hundred against New Zealand a year later. But despite being an acknowledged talent, Morton was unable to cement a regular place in the West Indies team in any format. In other cricket news Monday, former New Zealand captain Chris Cairns has began his High Court action in London against former Indian Premier League chairman Lalit Modi. Cairns, 41, is suing Modi for substantial libel damages over an ""unequivocal allegation"" made on Twitter that he was involved in match-fixing. The disputed tweet was picked up and reported on the cricket website Cricinfo, but they were forced to remove it by Cairns and pay him damages. However Modi refused to apologize and pleaded justification, maintaining that the charge was true. The case, without a jury, is expected to last two weeks.","Former West Indies international Runako Morton killed in car crash .

"(Financial Times) -- India's weakening economy grew 6.1 per cent in the quarter to the end of December, the slowest in three years, deepening fears about the country's growth prospects. A slowdown in manufacturing, mining and agriculture has accelerated the shift of Asia's third-largest economy to lower growth after a failed push to hit double-digits. Rajiv Kumar, the director-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that an official target of 6.9 per cent growth for the full year was out of reach and a bounce back next year unlikely. He warned that the strong performance of the services sector in the three months to December was unlikely to be sustained in the fourth quarter, January to March, and could be pulled back by poor performance of other sectors. ""It's a sobering number, below consensus. The numbers are telling us that we will be lucky to get 6.9 per cent growth overall for this year,"" Mr Kumar said. He said India was on course for 6.8 per cent growth in fiscal year 2013. The government, by contrast, has predicted a bounce back to 8.5 per cent next year. Data released on Wednesday showed economic growth for the quarter to the end of December slowed to an annualised 6.1 per cent, weighed on by two years of progressive monetary tightening, a retreat of foreign capital and a weakening local currency. ""Policymakers are battling inflation, falling confidence, a stalled government and tepid global demand. They'll be lucky to have growth hit 6.5 per cent in 2012,"" said Glenn Levine, senior economist at Moody's Analytics. Sonal Varma, economist at banking group Nomura in Mumbai, said the slowdown in Asia's third-largest economy was ""clearly evident"". ""What is surprising is the slowdown in investment and manufacturing is worse than during the 2008 global financial crisis. It's the worst for these sectors for a decade."" Economists have taken heart from recent efforts by senior policymakers to energise the economy and make progress with economic reforms. They are now putting considerable store in a central bank monetary policy review meeting on March 15 and the national budget on the following day to take action to arrest the slide in growth. ""India needs concerted policy measures at all levels to support trends at 7 per cent [growth],"" said Rohini Malkani, economist at Citigroup in Mumbai. Samiran Chakraborty, economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Mumbai, said the Congress-led government had to take steps to revive domestic investment. ""Unless action happens from the government to stimulate growth the outlook looks quite ominous,"" he said. Criticism has grown in past months about Mr Singh's economic management. Many senior business figures blame the country's political leadership for throwing away a golden opportunity to put India's domestically-driven economy on better terms with neighbouring China and trading partners in the west. Top executives, like Sunil Bharti Mittal, the chairman of telecoms group Bharti Airtel, and Ratan Tata, chairman of the Tata Group, have appealed to feuding political leaders to revive a parliament now notorious for stalling legislative progress . © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","India's weakening economy grew 6.1 per cent in the quarter to the end of December .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China said Sunday it plans to increase its defense budget by 11.2%, following similar increases in years past and coming on the heels of a renewed U.S. push in the region. The planned increase would lift spending to some 670 billion yuan ($106.4 billion) in 2012, which is almost 68 billion more than 2011 spending, said Li Zhaoxing, spokesman for the National People's Congress. By comparison, the proposed U.S. defense budget for the 2013 fiscal year is $613.9 billion, including $525.4 billion in base spending. That budget cuts half a trillion dollars in spending increases over the next 10 years. Li spoke a day before the annual session of the Chinese legislature is scheduled to start in Beijing. ""The Chinese government follows the principle of coordinating defense development with economic development. It sets the country's defense spending according to the requirement of national defense and the level of economic development,"" he said. Last year, China announced it would increase its defense budget by close to 13%. It reported a 7.5% increase the year before. Li stressed that China's defense spending will go primary toward living expenses, training, maintenance and equipment, China's state news agency Xinhua reported. Given the country's population, long coastline and large territory, the outlays are low, he said. ""The limited military strength of China is solely for safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and will not pose a threat to any country,"" the news agency reported Li as saying. Still, China's announcement is sure to stoke concerns among some its neighbors. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to use force against the island if it ever formally sought independence. China also has claimed a significant portion of the South China Sea as its own territorial waters, putting it in conflict with other nations that have made claims on portions of the region. The move is similarly sure to raise eyebrows in Washington, where President Barack Obama is pursuing a more aggressive approach in the region. During last year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, the president stressed the importance of the Pacific to global economic security. And this year, Obama and top defense officials unveiled a new U.S. defense strategy that focuses heavily on the Asia-Pacific region, a fast-growing economic powerhouse with numerous potential flashpoints that the administration has identified as crucial to U.S. interests. The strategy calls for the United States to increase its military's ""institutional weight and focus on enhanced presence, power projection, and deterrence in Asia-Pacific,"" said Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. Xinhua, while welcoming a peaceful U.S. role in the region, cautioned in a commentary then against the United States acting like a ""bull in a china shop."" CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","The planned increase would lift spending to some 670 billion yuan ($106.4 billion)

"(CNN) -- The heart of a 900-year-old saint has vanished from Christ Church Cathedral in Dublin, Ireland, police and the Cathedral said. St. Laurence O'Toole's heart was kept in a heart-shaped wooden box in a cage bolted to a wall in Saint Lauds Chapel, Irish police said. It disappeared between Friday evening and Saturday noon, police said. Adding to the mystery, there was no sign of a break-in or of damage, police told CNN. Nothing was taken from the chapel other than the heart, although Irish media said there were gold candesticks and other valuables there. Cathedral staff called the disappearance of the relic ""truly awful and strange"" and said they were ""shocked and saddened."" St. Laurence O'Toole was born in 1128, lived until 1180, and was made a saint in 1225, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. Catholics often preserve body parts from saints, believing they should be venerated. When Pope John Paul II was declared ""blessed"" -- a step below sainthood -- last year, a vial of his blood was displayed as a relic.","The heart of St. Laurence O'Toole was kept in a box in Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin .

"(CNN) -- Fehmi Khairullah, a Syrian-American doctor living in New Jersey, says he cannot sleep these days. ""The humanitarian situation in many parts of Syria has reached its lowest point. It is so horrific,"" said Khairullah, who collects and delivers aid to Syria. As violence escalates in the sanctions-hit country and - - many argue -- the lack of government cooperation, humanitarian groups have been unable to reach those suffering the most in the country. Even the International Committee of the Red Cross & Red Crescent, the only independent international aid agency operating inside Syria, has not reached trapped citizens in devastated areas such as the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs. Last weekend, the aid group released a statement saying it started distributing aid to people in the restive city. But Saleh Debaki, its Damascus-based spokesman, said Thursday the aid is located at nine distribution centers around the city, but none has reached ravaged neighborhoods such as Baba Amr. Residents and activists in the neighborhood said Friday they have not had any humanitarian aid reach them in more than a month. ""It is the 13th days of shelling over our neighborhood,"" said Abu Omar, who was reached by satellite internet at a Baba Amr shelter. ""We have not had any electricity, phone service, ... or even running water for weeks. We have not had any food or medical supplies either. We are so desperate! There are only a few houses here that have water wells. That's our only access to any water!"" Abu Omar, who did not want to reveal his real name over safety fears, said the few dozen people staying at shelters in Baba Amr shower once every five days or so and limit other use of water to only drinking. Khalil Ahmed, another resident of Baba Amr, said he has not seen any bread coming from outside the neighborhood in weeks. ""That's why we decided to collect whatever flour we could find to bake some bread and share at the shelters,"" Ahmed said. ""We have no baby formula. Parents put bread in water ... and that's what babies eat and drink."" There is only one medical facility in Baba Amr operating out of a basement of a mosque. It moved there because its last location was shelled in January, killing three medics, according to Mohamed al-Mohamed, one of a handful of doctors running the makeshift clinic using ""primitive tools."" Back in the United States, Khairullah says the suffering will only get worse in many parts of Syria unless there is a way to deliver humanitarian aid to those who need it most. Shortly after the Syrian uprising began on March 15, Khairullah and other Syrian-American professionals started the Syria First Coalition to collect donations and deliver them to affected families in the nation. ""In light of the sanctions, we did not want to fall into any legal traps. And we did not want to deal with the government's institutions. So we started paying influential businessmen inside Syria in U.S. dollars and get food, water, blankets among other humanitarian items in return,"" Khairullah said. This worked for only a few months until no more businessman could risk doing that under the watchful eye of the regime, he said. So he identified financial institutions in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon -- to which the group transferred money in order to buy aid locally. The aid was then smuggled across the Syrian borders. But with more and more limited safe passages into Syria and a drying flow of cash, this option became even harder. The current sanctions allow transferring money to charitable groups in Syria. ""But how could we trust these government-sponsored Syrian groups to oversee the distribution of aid?' Khairullah said. A couple of international humanitarian groups such as the Humanitarian Relief for Syria admit that they only go through Syrian charity organizations to reach affected people inside the country. Others -- such as Islamic Relief and Zakat Foundation -- only reach out to Syrian refugees in neighboring countries. ""The only way to reach us in Homs is through establishing safe passages,"" Abu Omar said. On the international level, France is trying to revive a plan it first introduced in November that tries to do just that. The idea is to provide safe access for relief organizations to deliver aid to affected populations through land border routes, a sea port or an airport - - all under the watch of international observers. But such a plan needs either Syrian government approval or the backing of armed peacekeepers. In the latter case, a U.N. resolution may be needed. French Foreign Minister Alain JuppÃ© discussed his government's ""humanitarian corridors"" plan Thursday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, in order to avoid a veto on a possible U.N. Security Council resolution. The two met in Vienna to reach a compromise despite Moscow vetoing a U.N. resolution based on an Arab League proposal on Feb. 4, according to Russia's state-run Itar-Tass. ""We can possibly reach a compromise on a short-term objective."" JuppÃ© told reporters ""We are ready to work in New York on a draft resolution inspired by the Arab League to stop the violence and provide humanitarian aid."" Lavrov was not committed to the plan and said more details are needed before an agreement, Itar -Tass reported. But many Syrians seem to have no choice but to be optimistic as their tragedy plays out on the international stage. ""I am hopeful,"" Khairulla said. ""I am finally sensing change among international and regional powers regarding the suffering in Syria ... And it is about time!""","""The humanitarian situation in many parts of Syria has reached its lowest point,"" doctor says .

"(CNN) -- The founder of the shuttered file-sharing site Megaupload appeared in a New Zealand court Monday, as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to extradite him and other company officials on criminal charges. But his lawyer insisted his client is innocent. The U.S. authorities shut down Megaupload last week and announced indictments against seven people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an ""international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works."" Four of those charged were arrested in New Zealand at the request of the U.S. government. They included Kim Dotcom, the site's founder, who is also known as Kim Schmitz. The New Zealand police detained Dotcom, a German citizen, on Friday after a dramatic raid on his luxury mansion in the affluent North Shore area of Auckland, the country's largest city. In a packed court on Monday, Dotcom's lawyer, Paul Davison, argued that his client was innocent and should be granted bail. ""Mr. Dotcom emphatically denies any criminal misconduct or wrongdoing and denies the existence of any 'mega-conspiracy,'"" Davison said in the North Shore District Court. But the New Zealand government prosecutors, acting on behalf of the U.S. authorities, argued that Dotcom's bail request should be denied because he presented an ""extreme"" flight risk. Dotcom is a resident of both New Zealand and Hong Kong. Anne Toohey, the prosecuting lawyer, said Dotcom had chartered private planes, helicopters and yachts in the past. ""This kind of access to private transportation is a significant issue in terms of flight,"" she told the court. Megaupload, which traffic-tracking service Alexa ranked as the world's 72nd most visited website before it was taken down, allowed users to share and download files -- many of which were copyrighted works made available for download without permission, according to the U.S. authorities. They said the operation had generated more than $175 million in illegal profits through advertising revenue and the sale of premium memberships. Authorities have seized the company's servers and domain names and frozen $50 million in assets. Among the company's assets were 18 luxury vehicles seized by the New Zealand police in the raid on Dotcom's mansion, including several top-end Mercedes, a Rolls Royce Phantom and a 1959 pink Cadillac. Davison said that without access to his assets or travel documents, Dotcom did not present a realistic flight risk. He also noted that his client wanted to stay in New Zealand with his pregnant wife and children. He criticized the ""aggressive"" approach taken by the police and prosecutors in accusing and detaining Dotcom, saying it had ""amplified the nature and gravity of this alleged offending beyond any reality."" He suggested it had created ""a real misunderstanding and misconception of the business of Megaupload."" The judge at the hearing reserved his decision on the bail request for Dotcom and the other Megaupload officials -- Finn Batato, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk -- until Tuesday or Wednesday. Despite the charges against him, Dotcom appeared ""really calm"" in court, said Emma Brannam, a reporter for TV3 New Zealand, who attended the proceedings. He remained quiet during the hearing and didn't turn to look at the dozens of Megaupload supporters who were watching from the public gallery, she said.","The U.S. shut down Megaupload and announced indictments against seven people .

"(CNN) -- A series of explosions at an ammunition depot killed 200 people and wounded about 2,000 more in Brazzaville, the capital of Africa's Republic of Congo, Congolese officials said Monday. The explosions occurred shortly after 8 a.m. Sunday (2 a.m. ET) when a fire at the depot set off a cache of tank shells, said Betu Bangana, director of protocol for President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. Bangana said at least 200 people had been confirmed dead by Monday morning, and many bodies may be ""unfindable."" Ministry of Information press attache Bruno Impene said hospitals were overflowing, with the wounded lying in the corridors. The blasts destroyed numerous homes in the neighborhoods surrounding the installation, Bangana said. The force of the explosions broke windows up to 5 km (3 miles) away in Kinshasa, the capital of the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. The DRC's military responded by putting tanks and troops on the streets and the banks of the Congo River, which separates the two cities, until it became clear that no attack on the capital was under way. Impene said a short circuit the suspected cause of the fire. Authorities are treating the blaze as accidental, Bangana said.

"(CNN) -- Federal prosecutors want baseball legend Barry Bonds to serve 15 months in prison for his obstruction of justice conviction, according to a sentencing memo filed in court Thursday. Defense lawyers argued in their filing that the judge should accept the probation office's recommendation that Bonds be sentenced to two years probation, fined $4,000 and ordered to perform 250 hours of community service. Bonds, 47, is set to be sentenced on December 16 in a San Francisco federal courtroom, less than two miles from the ballpark where he broke Hank Aaron's major league home run in August 2007. Jurors who found Bonds guilty in April said he was ""evasive"" in his testimony to the federal grand jury investigating illegal steroids use by pro athletes. ""Because Bonds's efforts were a corrupt, intentional effort to interfere with that mission, a sentence of 15 months imprisonment is appropriate,"" the prosecution said in its memo to U.S. District Judge Susan Illston. But jurors, who were deadlocked on three perjury counts, said that it was not proven that Bonds lied when he testified that he had not knowingly used steroids. Prosecutors decided not pursue a retrial. Prosecutors still argued in the sentencing memo that Bonds' denial that he was ""taking steroids and human growth hormone were patently false."" ""Whether his purpose was to protect his drug suppliers or his own reputation, Bonds's pre-testimony efforts to sway the testimony of Giants trainer Stan Conte established that he approached his grand jury testimony with a plan,"" the prosecution said. ""That plan was to evade telling the truth to the grand jury through any means possible, whether through lies, half-truths, non-sequiturs, or simply bluffing his way through the testimony."" ""Bonds's pervasive efforts to testify falsely, to mislead the grand jury, to dodge questions, and to simply refuse to answer questions in the grand jury makes his conduct worthy of a significant jail sentence,"" the prosecution argued. Bonds' testimony in December 2003 was part of the BALCO investigation that targeted employees of a California drug testing laboratory and Bonds' personal trainer Greg Anderson. The testimony that led to his conviction came when a grand jury prosecutor asked Bonds if Anderson ever gave him ""anything that required a syringe to inject yourself with."" Bonds told the grand jury that only his personal doctors ""ever touch me,"" and he then veered off the subject to say he never talked baseball with Anderson. A juror, who identified herself only as Jessica and who would not give her last name, told reporters they agreed unanimously that Bonds was ""not directly answering the question, just kind of evading the question."" Defense lawyers argued that Bonds' thought the creams and ointments Anderson was giving him were made of flaxseed oils. In their sentencing memo, the defense urged the judge to accept the probation office's conclusion that Bond's ""prior history of good works,"" including ""charitable and civic contributions"" should factor into the sentencing. ""It is believed that Mr. Bonds can use his status, as well as his past record of giving to youth-related causes for some beneficial and significant impact to society,"" the report said. Also, the conviction ""appears to be an aberration when taken in context of his entire life,"" the probation office report said. The prosecution rejected the probation office conclusions. ""Bonds's conduct was not a spontaneous act of aberrant behavior, and his charitable works, while laudable, should not allow him to escape responsibility for his criminal conduct,"" prosecutors wrote. ""The conduct in this case was neither aberrant nor insignificant. To the contrary, Bonds's actions were the product of a calculated plan to obfuscate and distract the grand jury from its role in getting to the truth in the Balco inquiry."" Bonds' legal troubles began in 2003 when he was subpoenaed to testify before the federal grand jury investigating the illegal distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to athletes. Bonds was told he was not a target of the investigation, which was centered on the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, known as BALCO. His personal trainer, Greg Anderson, was a target. ""All he had to do was tell the truth,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Nedrow said in his closing arguments last week. Bonds lied to the grand jury because he knew the truth about his steroids use would ""tinge his accomplishments"" and hurt his baseball career, Nedrow said. ""His secret was so powerful that he couldn't admit it, wouldn't admit it."" The grand jury transcript showed that when he was asked about anabolic steroids before the 2003 baseball season, he said he had not knowingly used them. He did acknowledge using substances Anderson gave him known as ""the clear and the cream."" Nedrow argued that it was ""implausible"" that Bonds would take drugs ""and really not know what they were."" A urine sample given by Bonds in the summer of 2003, just months before his grand jury testimony, tested positive for anabolic steroids, but another sample taken weeks earlier tested negative for the drugs. The San Francisco Giants star ended his 21-year major league career in 2007 with 762 home runs. He also set the record for most home runs in a single season in 2001, when he hit 73.","Bonds should get prison for his ""corrupt, intentional effort"" to mislead, prosecutors say .

"(CNN) -- The world of Formula One may seem an unlikely source of inspiration for a major carbon-cutting initiative, but technology used for coordinating pit-stops is primed to slash emissions from airports across the globe. According to Britain's National Air Traffic Services (NATS), more than half the planes landing at London's Heathrow airport are stuck in circles overhead -- often for 20 minutes at a time -- as they wait for its congested runways to clear. NATS says the carbon cost of this pile-up in the sky is an estimated 600 tons a day. And this is where McLaren, the hugely successful Formula One team behind former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button, have come in with an unexpected solution. Over the years the company has developed modeling software to analyze live racing data and visualize a range of potential scenarios -- allowing pit crews to make strategic decisions in the blink of an eye -- all in an effort to get their cars back out onto the racetrack milliseconds ahead of their competitors. It's this ground-level tracking technology that could hold the key to unlocking congestion, reducing CO2 emissions by streamlining the way aircraft make their own pit-stops once they've landed -- dropping off passengers, refueling and departing again with F1 efficiency. This similarity between a motor race and an airport runway was first observed by Peter Tomlinson, head of aviation data solutions at NATS, while attending a workshop on cross-industry collaboration at McLaren's UK technology center three years ago. ""It became clear that the pit-stop in a race track, with cars coming in, changing tyres and refueling and going out again actually is pretty similar to an aircraft arriving at the airport, parking at the gate, passengers getting off, refueling and going out,"" said the air traffic veteran, who has over 30 years experience in the industry. The beauty of McLaren's system is that it reduces the complexity of a racetrack into a circle ""so at the point of decision, presentation of the data is very simple, which allows the engineer in a very stressful environment to make the right strategic decision and also see the data in a very clear, crisp format,"" said Tomlinson. For the last three years NATS has been working with McLaren's engineers to map Heathrow's taxiways and runways -- much as they do a Formula One track. But now, says Tomlinson, in place of a race strategist the system is operated by Heathrow's air traffic control, and instead of a circle the airport's network of runways and taxi lanes are represented by a simple rectangle -- enabling planes to be guided around the airport with greater ease and accuracy once they've landed. The collaboration has been ""groundbreaking"" according to Geoff McGrath, managing director of McLaren Applied Technologies -- the F1 team's tech division. ""To my knowledge this is a first -- NATS has invested in this because there is nothing like it available,"" he added. The system is now in its ""proof of concept"" stage and hopes are high that it will be used by airports around the world within a year. ""Think in terms of the environmental benefits of that,"" enthused Tomlinson. ""Large airports with about 1300 to 1400 flights a day - if you save just one minute of taxi time per flight on average, that equates to one day's worth of taxi time - and that's how much we could save using McLaren's technology.""","London's Heathrow airport hopes to cut C02 emissions by using motor racing technology .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least nine people were killed and at least 72 others wounded Tuesday when four car bombs and a roadside bomb exploded in mostly Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad, police officials said. The first two attacks took place in Sadr City, an area in eastern Baghdad, police said. A car bomb exploded in al-Mudhafar Square, near a group of laborers who were waiting to be picked up for a daily job, police said. A few minutes later, a second car bomb exploded near a busy fuel station. Police said seven people were killed and 35 people were injured in the attacks in Sadr City, which is home to about 1.5 million people. A third car bomb exploded on a road in the al-Hurriya neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad, killing at least one person and wounding 13 others, police said. In a fourth attack, a roadside bomb wounded six people when it exploded near Adan Square in northwestern Baghdad. And a fifth explosion, a car bomb, blew up near an elementary school in the Shulaa neighborhood of northwestern Baghdad, police said. Two people were killed, and 18 others -- including some students from the elementary school -- were wounded. Since the beginning of this year, a wave of attacks in Iraq have killed almost 200 people. Most of those killed were Shiites marking Arbaeen, a Shiite pilgrimage at the end of a 40-day period commemorating the seventh century Imam Hussain, who was killed in a battle. The latest attacks raised concerns among ordinary people about the ability of Iraqi security forces to ensure security in this country, particularly after the United States withdrew troops by the end of 2011. However, Iraqi people are more concerned now about the political crisis. Last week, Iraq's Council of Ministers decided to ban members who are boycotting Cabinet meetings, a government spokesman said. The banned ministers will not be allowed to manage their ministries, according to spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. Last month, the Sunni-backed Iraqiya party announced it would boycott parliament and Cabinet meetings, saying Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite, was cutting the party out of the decision-making process. Iraqiya spokeswoman Maysoun Damluji said the Iraqiya bloc was not surprised by the prime minister's move, calling it unconstitutional and illegal. Iraq's political crisis deepened last year when a warrant was issued for Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is accused of organizing his security detail into a death squad that targeted government and military officials. Al-Hashimi has denied the charges, saying the accusations are politically motivated amid the rivalry between his political bloc and al-Maliki's Shiite majority bloc. In recent weeks, Iraq's Kurdish president, Jalal Talabani, called for a ""national conference"" to address the political crisis. But in the past week, a number of Sunni politicians who are members of Iraqiya bloc were arrested in Baghdad and Diyala province, officials with Iraqiya bloc said. Diyala's deputy governor in charge of investment, Ghadban al-Khazraji, was arrested Friday by Iraqi security forces. Former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi recently accused al-Maliki of targeting al-Iraqiya members and deepening the political crisis. Allawi warned al-Maliki that if the national conference fails, he will have no choice but to call for changing the prime minister and call for early elections, or the Iraqiya bloc will completely withdraw from the political process -- a move that could bring Iraqi politics to complete standstill.","A blast near an elementary school kills two and injures 18, including some students .

"Wukan Village, China (CNN) -- In the end, Xue Jianwan gave up her short-lived political career after family pressure proved even harder to overcome than official intimidation. ""My enthusiasm was just extinguished by my Grandma's tears,"" the 21-year-old elementary school teacher posted early Sunday morning on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. ""I decided to call it quits as soon as they announced the initial election result -- sorry if I let anyone down."" Xue had been running to become a deputy chief of her native Wukan, a fishing village of some 12,000 residents in southern China, part of an unprecedented exercise in grassroots democracy in a country where the Communist Party usually reigns supreme. Some 80% of the 8,300 registered voters, state media reported, flocked to Wukan School on a balmy Saturday to select a new village leadership. As red flags fluttered in an early spring breeze and loudspeakers played folk music, villagers marked their choices in booths marked ""secret balloting"" with election workers and volunteers standing by to answer any questions. Dozens of foreign reporters -- used to government interference in the field -- savored a rare moment to roam freely, filming the event and interviewing voters, as several officials watched from a second-floor balcony. The orderly scene was soon disrupted by the appearance of Xue who was besieged by photographers jostling to get a shot of her. With her small frame disappearing in a sea of flashing cameras, Xue's friends had to rescue her from the press pack. The young woman's celebrity only served as a poignant reminder of the tumultuous period the village had just passed through. From September to December 2011, thousands of locals took to the streets of Wukan, protesting the illegal seizure of their farmland by corrupt officials, expelling local Communist Party leaders and clashing with anti-riot police who surrounded the village. The months-long ""siege of Wukan"" culminated when security agents took several protest leaders into custody early December, and one of them -- Xue Jinbo -- soon died in jail. Authorities blamed sudden illness, but his family and most villagers believed he had been beaten to death. As the untimely death became a rallying call, provincial authorities relented and agreed to the protesters' demands, sacking local officials, launching an investigation into the land dispute, and promising an open and fair village election. When CNN first met Xue Jianwan, who is Xue Jinbo's daughter, in January, she was still reeling with anger and disbelief after the death of her father. Her distraught mother could barely speak. ""Dad was like Superman to us,"" she said at the time, her eyes welling up with tears. ""How can I just accept that he's suddenly no longer with us?"" With a maturity beyond her years, Xue vowed to get her father's body back, which had been held by the authorities, confronting every official who visited the family to offer condolences. Although her father's body was eventually returned in February, and the family received government compensation of 900,000 yuan ($143,000), Xue Jianwan made it clear she would continue to seek justice for his death. Lighting incense sticks and kneeling in front of a large portrait, Xue paid tribute to her late father at home Saturday morning before heading to the polls. Xue tweeted that she had decided to stand for election at the last minute, defying officials who warned her that she may lose the job that provides the only income for her mother and two younger siblings. ""The villagers want me to run,"" she told CNN. ""And I think of my father -- I want to do something for him."" She may be the most unlikely candidate on the ballot, but plenty of voters were willing to embrace a daughter carrying on a cause her father died for. ""We all liked him and are now voting for her,"" said Wu Fang, a 53-year-old villager lingering on the school ground after voting. ""She told us at meetings that she would follow her father's footstep to help us and look after our welfare."" As Wu and her fellow villagers exercised their hard-fought democratic right, some analysts have wondered whether the ""Wukan effect"" could bring wider political freedoms. China watchers estimate the country saw some 180,000 ""mass incidents"" in 2010, most of which occurred in rural areas and were related to land confiscations. While the Chinese central government has permitted direct village elections since the 1980s, critics say the Wukan election is nothing more than symbolism and that the Communist Party still keeps a tight grip on dissent nationwide, especially in the wake of the Arab Spring. Back at Wukan School, Wu Fang echoed other local villagers when she said a ""fairer"" election wouldn't solve the core issue that triggered the original protest: the sale of almost 1,000 acres of land by local officials to developers without any compensation to farmers. ""How can we farmers live without our land?"" she said. ""We want our farmland back and there hasn't been much progress. Without news coverage, our struggle would have died a long time ago."" With two prominent protest leaders declared the winners for the top two positions on Saturday night, it remains to be seen whether there will be any real change in rural China. ""A democratic election produces capable village officials who will help villagers get back their seized land and stolen assets -- so it's a necessary step in the process,"" Yang Semao, who was elected deputy village chief, told CNN before casting his ballot. Xue failed to get enough votes for an outright victory, but is eligible to compete in a runoff Sunday. Worried that she may meet her father's fate, some family members had vehemently opposed her political career from the outset. As her decision to quit the race spread online, reaction among her 25,000 Weibo followers appeared mostly encouraging. ""It doesn't matter whether or not you get elected,"" one supporter wrote. ""Your family has already paid the ultimate price for Wukan."" ""Don't blame your grandmother -- she's been through too much,"" another one chimed in. ""You're still young and there will be time for another run.""","Daughter of Wukan villager who died in police custody ends political career .

"(Mashable)  -- Facebook, which is one of the world's largest photo-sharing sites (in addition to being the leader among social networks), is rolling out some marked improvements to its Photos product. These upgrades include hi-res photos, photo-download links, bulk tagging options and an elegant lightbox interface for viewing images from anywhere on the site. The lightbox in particular reminds us of similar features recently rolled out by Flickr; and some of these improvements, such as hi-res and downloading capabilities, are what have prevented Facebook from serious competition with Flickr as a photo-sharing destination. In the recent past, Facebook photos were best for capturing memories of places, people and events through small images and mobile snapshots; however, these changes allow a whole new class of image-sharing, up to and including photography, modeling and graphic design portfolios. With its 500 million users around the world, Facebook is now poised to take over the photo-sharing market. Beginning today and rolling out to all users soon, you will be able to upload and download hi-res photos up to 2048 pixels wide or high -- that's large enough for print-quality images. (Currently, Facebook only displays 720 pixels; larger photos simply get resized.) Each photo will come with a link to download the JPEG file, as well. Follow Mashable social media on Twitter . The site's new bulk tagging options will allow the uploading individual to temporarily group images and tag friends by simply clicking on thumbnails. Another interesting change is Facebook's lightbox UI, which strongly and clearly puts the focus on images. Starting soon, any time you click on an image anywhere on Facebook, be it in an album or in your News Feed or on a friend's Wall, you'll see a black box hovering over the rest of the screen with some minimal navigation controls and relevant social features, allowing you to concentrate completely on the image at hand. While we don't love the ads in place here, we do realize that hosting hi-res photos costs a lot more and will attract a lot more usage -- both from uploading parties and from viewing individuals -- all of which puts more strain on Facebook's servers. We'll sacrifice an ad-free experience for higher quality photos. What do you think about these changes? Do you think Facebook -- which already competes with Twitter as a status service, Google as an advertiser, and every major social network as a digital hub for friends -- will soon be competing with Flickr for the photos of pros and amateurs alike? © 2011 MASHABLE.com.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When they set sail from harbor most yachtsmen leave only their worries behind. But when Hilary Lister goes out to sea, she sheds an entire way of life. Hilary Lister says she feels ""a thousand times"" more free when she sails. The 36-year-old Briton is a quadriplegic who can only move her head, eyes and mouth and needs to rely on carers for almost every need. In spite of these restrictions she became the first disabled woman to sail solo around Britain Monday scoring a victory against the rare degenerative illness she has suffered from since age 11. The inventive technology behind her voyage is called ""sip and puff"" -- a system of three pneumatic straws positioned near Lister's mouth that allow her to control the boat through a series of semaphore-like commands she can give by either blowing or sucking through the straws. Developed by a Canadian engineer, the system let Lister alter course and trim the sails of her 20ft long keel boat to complete the record-breaking trip over two summers. Lister's passion for sailing is all-consuming and, considering what it has given her, unsurprising. ""When you leave the quayside, you leave behind the stresses of everyday life,"" she told CNN. ""Any sailor will tell you that. ""If you multiply that sense of freedom a thousand times, that's how I feel. I leave behind my wheelchair, a team of carers and suddenly it's just me."" An Oxford University graduate and talented sportswoman in her youth, by 2003 Hilary's illness had laid her so low she was a virtual recluse, never leaving the home she shared with her husband Clifford, and by her own admission deeply depressed. A friend suggested she go to Westbere Sailing. The center specializes in helping disabled people on to the water, but Hilary almost never made the 20-minute trip from her home near Canterbury in southern England. ""I was ill and running a temperature and I was about to cancel it, but something stopped me from backing out,"" she said. She credits the decision to go to the center with saving her life. ""[The staff]treated me like an intelligent, capable person and not like an object to be pitied,"" she said. Her illness is called reflex sympathetic dystrophy. It makes it difficult for her to breathe -- the media interviews she has done since her latest achievement have exhausted her, she said. It also puts her in near-constant agony, a situation that is only manageable with the use of powerful drugs. Despite these hardships, or perhaps because of them, Hilary has no fear when she is out at sea. Her aim is to help other disabled people feel empowered in the same way and to that end she has set up her own charity, Hilary's Dream Trust. The charity exists to provide assistance to disabled and disadvantaged adults who dream of sailing. ""It is difficult to do all the press, my diaphragm is in a bad way and I get tired easily with the interviews. But I want people to know my story because it's important they realize disabled people can accomplish anything, given the right tools."" Her own accomplishment she began last summer with the help of a support boat and a specially adapted motor home that she returned to after each day's sailing to recuperate. Last August she was forced to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and strong winds. She took up the gauntlet again in May and was rewarded with some transcendent moments. ""When I was in the Irish Sea I saw something that looked like a blow hole on my starboard side,"" she said. ""I wasn't sure what I'd seen then suddenly out of the water this huge whale emerged like an Exocet missile. Next thing a pod of them -- we think they were humpbacks -- were all around my boat. ""I remember thinking, 'I wonder if this is safe' but I was enjoying the moment so much. It was so exhilarating.""","Hilary Lister has become the first disabled woman to sail around Britain .

"Tehran (CNN) -- Iran's top cleric has blamed the CIA and Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, for killing an Iranian nuclear scientist, Iran's state broadcaster said. Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, who died Wednesday, was the third Iranian nuclear scientist in two years to be killed by what Iran described as a magnetic bomb attached to his car. A fourth survived a similar assassination attempt. Roshan's death shows that ""the global arrogance spearheaded by the U.S. and Zionism has reached a deadlock in confrontation with the determined, devout and progressive nation of Islamic Iran,"" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted as saying by the state-run Press TV. Those responsible will not own up, Khamenei said, but the attack ""has been carried out by the planning or support of CIA and Mossad [spy] services, like all other crimes of the network of international state terrorism."" Khamenei ended his message of condolence with a warning: ""We shall persist in punishing the perpetrators of this crime, as well those supporting them behind the scenes."" Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent his condolences Friday to the families of Roshan and his driver, who also died following the attack, the state-run IRNA news agency reported. He pointed the finger at ""agents of imperialism and international Zionism,"" a reference to Israel. Other Iranian officials also blamed the killings on Israel and the United States, both of which have accused Tehran of pursuing a nuclear bomb -- a claim it denies. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""categorically"" denied any role in the attacks, but urged Iran to halt its quest for a nuclear bomb. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta reiterated that message Thursday, telling troops in Texas: ""We were not involved in any way -- in any way -- with regards to the assassination that took place there. ""I'm not sure who was involved, we have some ideas as to who might be involved... but I can tell you one thing: the United States was not involved in that kind of effort, that's not what the United States does."" Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said on his Facebook page Wednesday: ""I have no idea who targeted the Iranian scientist but I certainly don't shed a tear."" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon strongly condemned any terrorist action or assassination of anyone, ""whether scientist or civilian."" ""It is not acceptable,"" he said via his spokesman Eduardo del Buey. ""Human rights must be protected."" Meanwhile, a newspaper aligned with Khamenei called Thursday for the Islamic republic to respond in kind to the killings of its nuclear scientists, suggesting Israeli officials could be targeted. The editor of Tehran daily Kayhan, considered the organ of Khamenei's supporters, questioned why Iran should not ""exercise its legal right to retaliate."" Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations, said the assassinations of scientists were intended to deprive Iranians of the right to peaceful nuclear energy. ""We believe that these terrorist attacks are supported by some elements -- especially within the Israeli regime as well as some quarters around the world,"" he said. Iran says its nuclear program is aimed at producing civilian energy, not weapons. But it has rebuffed international demands to halt its enrichment of uranium, and the International Atomic Energy Agency says it has credible evidence that Iran has conducted weapons-related research. The IAEA, which serves as the U.N. nuclear watchdog, reported in November that it can no longer verify that the Iranian nuclear program remains peaceful. The scientist's death comes as Western powers and Japan are tightening the screws on Tehran. Japan announced Thursday it was prepared to gradually reduce oil imports from Iran, which supplies about 10% of its crude supply, while U.S.-led sanctions targeting Iran's central bank are driving down the value of the Iranian currency and driving up consumer prices. At the same time, U.S. observers say a covert campaign of sabotage appears to be under way against Iran's nuclear program. In addition to the deaths of nuclear researchers, Iran's Natanz enrichment plant -- where Roshan was the deputy director for commercial affairs -- has been hit with a computer worm that Western analysts say has damaged about 10% of the centrifuges used in the enrichment process. In the face of increased pressure, Iran has threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway at the mouth of the oil-rich Persian Gulf. It brought down and captured a U.S. surveillance drone over its territory and claims to have arrested a dozen American spies, including an Iranian-American former Marine who was sentenced to death this week. The United States says he was wrongly accused.","President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad offers his condolences to the victims' families .

"(CNN) -- Great Britain's rhythmic gymnastics team has won an appeal against a decision by its own federation to exclude them from the London 2012 Olympics. British Gymnastics ruled that the team had missed an agreed qualifying standard at the Olympic test event in North Greenwich area January. But the team appealed to independent arbitrator Sports Resolutions UK, who overturned the decision Monday. The British Olympic Association has now to inform the world governing body of gymnastics, the FIG, that Britain will be taking up the host nation spot.

"Vienna, Austria (CNN) -- The United States and other countries offered to resume negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program on Tuesday as Iran signaled a willingness to let international inspectors visit a key military base. The United States, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany offered to resume stalled talks in a letter from European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. She was responding to an overture that Iran made last month. The prospect of negotiations comes amid rising concern that Israel may attack Iran to disrupt its nuclear program. Israel and the United States suspect Iran is trying to build a nuclear weapon. International inspectors also have voiced concern, but Iran insists that its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian purposes. Meanwhile, Iran offered Tuesday to let international nuclear inspectors into one of its military bases, but only after significant details are worked out, its team at the International Atomic Energy Agency said. The head of the IAEA, the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, said Monday inspectors wanted to get into the Parchin base as soon as possible because of evidence of ongoing activities at the base, which is suspected of being involved in testing related to nuclear weapons. Also on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that Israel will remain ""the master of its fate"" in ensuring that Iran not obtain a nuclear weapon. ""Israel must reserve the right to defend itself, and after all, that's the very purpose of the Jewish state: to restore to the Jewish people control over our destiny,"" Netanyahu said in Washington. He said time for diplomacy was running out. ""We've waited for sanctions to work,"" he said. ""None of us can afford to wait much longer. As prime minister of Israel, I will never let my people live in the shadow of annihilation."" On Sunday, President Barack Obama warned that ""all elements of American power"" remain an option to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. He also emphasized that he prefers a diplomatic solution. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano declined Monday to provide details on whether the activities at the Parchin military base involve ongoing testing or efforts to remove evidence. ""But I can tell you that we are aware that there are some activities at Parchin and it makes us believe that going there sooner is better than later,"" Amano said. IAEA inspectors had asked to visit the facility during a February trip to Iran but were rebuffed, the agency and Iran have both said. Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations agency said Tuesday the IAEA had been out of line to request access to Parchin, but that once the agency formulated an appropriate request, Iran would let inspectors in. Iran said Tuesday that the request came ""in spite of"" an agreement between Iran and the IAEA. ""Considering the fact that it is a military site, granting access is a time consuming process and cannot be permitted repeatedly,"" Iran said. Nevertheless, it said it would allow access after the IAEA submits paperwork about ""all related issues."" Inspectors believe Iran may have used Parchin to test high explosives that could be used to detonate a nuclear weapon. IAEA inspectors visited Parchin twice in 2005, but inspectors did not go into the building that housed the test chamber then, according to the IAEA. Iran offered access to another site late in the February visit, Amano said. But the inspection team in Iran was not outfitted to examine Marivan, a site the IAEA believes may have been used to test elements of a nuclear weapon in 2003. Iran has said its nuclear program is entirely peaceful, but Amano said Iran's failure to cooperate with international inspectors makes it impossible to be sure. In fact, the agency ""continues to have serious concerns regarding possible military dimensions"" of Iran's nuclear program, Amano said. Because Iran is not following an agreement to provide expanded information and broader access to international inspectors, the agency is ""unable to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,"" he said in a statement preceding his news conference. He added that the concern stems from ""overall credible information that indicates that Iran engaged in activities relevant to the development of nuclear explosive devices."" IAEA inspectors traveled to Iran in January and again in February to discuss the issue, but failed to reach an agreement, Amano said. Monday's statement by Amano is not the first time the agency has questioned the purposes behind Iran's nuclear program. Most recently, after the February visit by inspectors, the agency issued a report announcing that Iran had stepped up its efforts to produce enriched uranium in violation of international resolutions calling on it to stop. The agency expressed ""serious concerns"" about potential military uses by Iran in that report. Among other things, Iran has tripled its monthly production of uranium enriched to contain a 20% concentration of radioactive material and taken other steps to ramp up its nuclear program, Amano said Monday. While Iran has said the higher-level enrichment is meant to produce therapies for cancer patients and other peaceful purposes, international critics have called the efforts a troubling step toward possible militarization of nuclear technology. Nuclear weapons require concentrations of about 90%. Amano said the agency would continue discussions with Iran and urged the country to abide by IAEA and U.N. resolutions on its nuclear program. Iran is under increasing international pressure regarding its nuclear program. The United Nations, the United States, the European Union and other countries have imposed sanctions related to Iran's nuclear research, and speculation regarding a possible military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities has been rampant in recent months.

"New Brunswick, New Jersey (CNN) -- In text messages, a former Rutgers University student touted that ""people are having a viewing party"" to watch what he expected would be surreptitious webcam footage of his roommate being intimate with another man, according to testimony Monday. The then-student, Dharun Ravi, is on trial on a 15-count indictment for allegedly spying on and intimidating his roommate, Tyler Clementi, because Clementi was gay. Days after that and other messages were sent, the 18-year-old Clementi took his own life by leaping from the George Washington Bridge and into the Hudson River. One of Ravi's high school friends, Michelle Huang, testified Monday at his trial in a New Brunswick, New Jersey, courtroom. She read out a Twitter messages from September 19, 2010, in which Ravi wrote that he went into a mutual friend's room, ""turned on my webcam"" and saw his roommate ""making out with a dude."" Huang testified Monday that two days later, Ravi sent another message telling his Twitter followers -- of which Huang was one -- ""I dare you to videochat me between the hours of 9:30 and 12. Yes, it's happening again."" According to Huang, Ravi explained that day in a text to her that he'd set his ""computer to alert (him) if anyone is in (the room) when I'm not there."" Specifically, Ravi wrote that it ""checks"" his bed. Ravi said that he was ""creeped out"" by the September 19 romantic encounter between Clementi and another man, which he suggested he witnessed -- via his hidden camera -- with several others. ""Keep the gays away,"" he wrote, according to a text message that was shown on a screen in the courtroom. Huang said it was her understanding that Ravi planned to broadcast another liaison, without Clementi's knowledge, for others to see. ""Mad people are going to do it,"" she said he texted her, using slang to suggest large numbers planned to watch. ""People are having a viewing party with a bottle of Bacardi and beer in this kids room for my roommate."" That ""viewing party"" never happened, Ravi wrote in a subsequent text exchange. Yet on September 22, 2010, Clementi took a train to New York and posted a mobile status update on his Facebook page that read, ""Jumping off the gw bridge sorry,"" before killing himself. Ravi's lawyer, Stephen Altman, meanwhile, introduced a message sent the next day in which his client told Huang that his roommate had committed suicide and described it as ""crazy."" ""I guess he was quiet because he was depressed,"" wrote the defendant. When she brought up the ""viewing party"" that he'd written about it earlier, Ravi wrote back: ""No that was a joke."" Last week, Rutgers graduate Geoffrey Irving testified that Ravi had told him after an ultimate Frisbee practice that he set up the webcam and was planning to do it again the evening of September 21. Yet previously, Altman has argued that his client had switched on the webcam to monitor his personal items because he did not trust his roommate's visitor, not necessarily because Clementi was gay. And amid testimony Monday by Detective Douglas Rager of the Rutgers Police Department, the defense lawyer noted that Ravi cooperated fully when investigators talked with him for the first time after Clementi's death. Authorities seized Ravi's Blackberry after that initial 45-minute discussion. The trial of Ravi, now 20, began February 24. When it's complete, the jury will weigh his guilt or innocence on various charges including bias intimidation, invasion of privacy, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution. If convicted, Ravi faces up to 10 years in prison. Last year, he turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. He wasn't the only one charged after Clementi's suicide. Molly Wei, who admitted joining Ravi to watch the September 19, 2010, webcam encounter, was charged with two counts of invasion of privacy. She reached a plea deal in May 2011 that required her to testify against her friend and former high school classmate, as well as to complete a three-year program on cyberbullying and do 300 hours of community service. The charges will be dropped if she does all of those things. Testifying last week, Wei said she was surprised to learn that Ravi had talked and taken to Twitter to hype the webcam scheme and to essentially advertise that others could watch an upcoming liaison. ""I was very surprised because my friends brought it up, and I had no idea how they knew, but they said that Dharun had told them. ... They told me about these Twitter, tweets, that they received on Tuesday about him trying to have a viewing party,"" she said. Clementi's suicide stirred national discussion regarding bullying, with President Barack Obama releasing a videotaped message less than a month later condemning such treatment. And Clementi's family consented in November to the use of his name on federal anti-harassment legislation called the ""Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act."" The proposed law would require schools that receive federal student aid ""to create policies prohibiting the harassment of any student,"" said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey.

"(CNN) -- Fans of classic 1970's films like ""Network"" and ""The Parallax View"" should flock to ""The Ides of March,"" George Clooney's fourth outing as a director and second produced screenplay. It's a taut and engaging political thriller that should resonate with Americans of any political persuasion. Liberal, left-wing Pennsylvania Gov. Mike Morris (Clooney) is in the fight of his life, running for the Democratic nomination for president. He leads in the polls and the delegate count, but anything can happen in the week before the primary and a potential spoiler/kingmaker waits in the wings in the form of North Carolina Sen. Thompson (Jeffrey Wright). Stakes are high. The old saying of ""as Ohio goes, so goes the nation"" implies that a win in the primary is the key. However, Sen. Thompson controls a large group of delegates who are likely to go to whatever candidate he endorses. So while trying to win Ohio, both Morris and his rival are at the same time clandestinely courting Thompson's favors, with New York Times reporter Ida Horowicz (Marissa Tomei) doggedly looking for the scoop. With so much of modern politics playing out in the media, the results often hinge on the dance between campaign and reporter. This complicated pas de deux with Tomei's reporter is performed on the campaign side by grizzled veteran campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and hotshot young press secretary Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling). (Which kind of makes it a pas de trois, but never mind.) Gosling is at the center of the film, once again proving that he is more than capable of holding his own in a group of heavyweights, inhabiting Myers like he's been playing him on stage for years. In fact, ""The Ides of March"" is adapted from Beau Willimon's play ""Farragut North."" Ambitious and aggressively idealistic, the only thing Myers cares about more than winning is believing in his candidate, which of course sets him apart from virtually all the real-world political operators working inside the D.C. Beltway and sets him up for a vicious life lesson. As Gov. Morris, Clooney is at his best, with his campaign speeches and television appearances echoing Bill Clinton, but with a charm that leans more towards the urbane than the folksy. At one point Morris flat out tells a debate audience not to vote for him if they don't agree with his positions on the issues. Imagine! It is in the private moments, however, that the true, cynical face of politics shows its face and it is in this cynicism that ""Ides"" finds its true footing. A throwback film in a sense, ""Ides"" is not the ""Pretty Woman"" look at politics and things get ugly. An old saw is that working in politics is a great place to meet women and this holds true here, as Myers meets young, aggressive campaign intern Molly (Evan Rachel Wood) and their short and rather unsubtle flirtation leads to a series of events that, before they conclude, affect virtually everyone involved in dramatic ways and shakes Myers' beliefs to the core. At one point the 30-year-old Myers brags that he's worked on more campaigns than most people have by the time they're 40, but Hoffman's Zara and equally seasoned rival campaign manager Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) in turn play Myers like a violin, proving that ""The X-Files"" was right: Trust no one. To which I would add: and keep your mouth shut. In essence, ""Ides"" is about tests. A test of idealism in the face of reality and a test of political resolve in the face of events that shake conviction. Gosling's Myers is playing with the big boys and navigating the often ethically muddy waters of presidential politics is not for the faint of heart. It is also about compromise. How much of your ideals, integrity and reputation are you willing to sacrifice for ""the greater good"" and does that greater good actually exist? While the choices may be integrity vs. career and ethics vs. ambition, it's not always clear which choice will produce which result. Despite Clooney's outspoken left-leaning politics, this is a film without a partisan agenda and one that both sides of the aisle ought to see and in which they may quite possibly see themselves. It's an entertaining, suspenseful and deeply cynical film, but politics is a cynical business and maybe this will be seen as a cautionary tale...though I doubt it. Was that too cynical?","George Clooney heads up a star-studded cast in ""The Ides of March""

"(CNN) -- As the nation and the world's attention turned to the impending execution of Hank Skinner in Texas before a late stay by a Texas court, one question seemed paramount: ""Why the rush?"" The answer to that question is buried deep inside the psychology of prosecutors and the culture of Texas. Skinner was scheduled for execution on Wednesday for the 1993 killing of his girlfriend, Twila Busby, and her two sons, until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (the top criminal court in that state) issued a stay late on Monday. While Skinner was found hiding in another house after the murders and some tests showed the blood of the victims on his clothes, he has maintained his innocence. He claims he was in the house at the time of the killing, but was too incapacitated by alcohol and codeine to have hurt anyone. Some question his conviction and point to Busby's uncle as another suspect, and Skinner wants some of the items found at the scene tested for DNA. Even the foreperson of the convicting jury has now stepped forward to ask that the tests be conducted. However, the prosecutors have steadfastly refused to allow such testing, and Skinner's attorneys have failed (thus far) to get a court order requiring those tests. The prosecutors have been adamant about an immediate execution, precluding further tests, and it is this fact that many people find baffling. As a former prosecutor who then spent 10 years training future prosecutors in Texas, I am not surprised by this development. Quite simply, the prosecutors are committed to their conviction in a way that should surprise no one. To a prosecutor, convicting dangerous people and incapacitating them is a life's work, nothing less than their duty to a community. Prosecutors have wide discretion in choosing whom to charge with capital murder and whether to seek the death penalty for the person they have charged. Once they have chosen that path, though, it is a somber commitment: It is nothing less than a public pledge to kill another person, and that is the kind of thing that is not done lightly. There is a deep emotional component to it, and that emotional commitment cannot be ignored, especially when it no longer matches the trajectory of justice. Academics such as Susan Bandes and Ellen Yaroshefsky have studied the emotional overcommitment of prosecutors, and explain it in part by looking to peer groups. Throughout the post-conviction process, prosecutors are usually surrounded by people (such as supervisors and investigators) who share their commitment to a conviction. At the same time, ethical rules keep them away from the person with the highest stake in the game, the defendant, who may want to challenge the outcome. Among those complaining about the rush to execution has been the government of France. Here's a news flash: Texans really don't care much what the French think. What do Texans care about? As even a casual observer of the campaign of Texas Gov. Rick Perry for president has probably noticed, many Texans care about the Bible. Texas, for good or bad, has a highly Christianized political culture, and the very center of the Christian gospels themselves contain a dramatic warning against the dangers of overcommitted prosecutors. At the trial of Christ it was the chief priest, Caiaphas, who took the role of prosecutor. As the trial wore on, he became frustrated. The evidence had contradicted itself; it suggested more than one story. Finally, Caiaphas could take no more and demanded an immediate outcome. He tore his shirt and said, ""Why do we still need witnesses?"" It was only then that Christ was condemned to die. That emotion, enough to tear your own shirt, is the kind of commitment that is in the heart of prosecutors. It is a passion born of good intentions, but one that can turn against the good. Caiaphas was not a hero, and Texans of all people should understand that. The commitment of prosecutors is too rooted in emotion to be a deciding factor in a case such as this, and the objectivity of courts must bring to bear what is right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Osler.","Texas was set to execute man who wanted evidence tested for DNA .

"Samm Farai Monro, better known as Comrade Fatso, is Zimbabwe's most popular protest poet as well as a leading political activist and grassroots blogger. He has performed his rebel poetry all over the world and says his debut album has been banned in his own country for being ""too political."" CNN has invited him to blog on events unfolding in Zimbabwe. HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Things are quiet today. The calm before a storm. The silence before swearing. In. People are waiting for Bob to swear himself in. The streets are quiet. People are pensive. Everyone knows this beast. It likes nothing more than victory. No matter how hollow. No matter how bloody. So the people wait for Bob to declare his illegitimate victory. There's no impatience here. No curiosity about results. We all know that he will take all the ballot papers, spoilt and unspolit, and he will build his house of cards. His house of ballot papers built by serial killers. And we wonder how long it will take us to make it fall apart. June 27 (p.m.) HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Sometimes a slogan meant to instill fear can come humorously true. Samm Farai Monro, AKA Comrade Fatso, is a blogger, protest poet and political activist in Zimbabwe. ZANU (PF)'s slogan over the past month for the Presidential Run Off has been ""June 27 Mugabe Chete, June 28 Mugabe Muhofisi."" So the slogan ""June 27 Mugabe's the Only Choice, June 28 Mugabe in Power"" has become reality in a very ironic way. But not necessarily how the powers-that-shouldn't-be hoped it would. Today, Zimbabweans were faced with a single-candidate election in a land with seven-digit inflation where most people eat a single meal each day. So the choice was obvious. Stay away or spoil your vote. The single candidate participating wasn't worth an ""X."" ""I voted first thing this morning,"" says young, dreadlocked Tindo from the sprawling township of Dzivarasekwa. ""I drew 10 'X's all over Bob and spolit my ballot!"" Collin from Highfields was a bit more poetic. He wrote a letter on his ballot paper, voicing his frustration with the election. Many others have spolit their ballots or simply stayed away, despite threats of violence from ZANU's drugged-up militias. The turnout in most high density and low density areas has been tiny. There have only been higher turnouts in areas where the militias have forced people to report to their bases with their ballot paper serial number so that the militias can ""check"" if they voted ""correctly."" So Zimbabwe's subversive, totemless urban dwellers have once again invoked their right to stay away, last used in the late 1990s against ZANU's failed Structural Adjustment Programmes. And apart from a few stragglers it seems that in the urban polling stations it has really been ""Only Mugabe."" June 27 (a.m.)  HARARE, Zimbabwe -- In this town appearance and reality are often two different things. ZANU-PF posters arrogantly hug every wall. Their red, yellow, green and black colors hang from every third car's rearview mirror. Kombis, our public transport, have the party's colors emblazoned on their sides, their drivers, their conductors. These are the lies that license Zimbabweans to live. Every youth militia road block demands that kombis and passengers are in ZANU (PF) regalia. Without this you are beaten. At least. In their hearts Zimbabweans are different. Stubborn. ""Why aren't they sending in the U.N.? It's a war zone here isn't it?"" says the one man in the paint-peeling bar with a Robert Mugabe poster encrusted on its walls. ""None of us will vote tomorrow,"" said the other. ""It will end. And the old man knows it."" Later in the day comrades from the high-density suburb of Highfields talk of the systematic intimidation by ZANU-PF militias. ""They say we must tell them the serial number of our ballot paper after voting and then they will check who we voted for,"" says Taurai. ""But we all know that we should spoil our ballots if they force us to vote."" Even the school children know the truth. ""They are beating and killing people for these elections,"" says a wise 8-year-old school girl. ""Mugabe is a bad man. He must just go."" Thousands of posters can't cover up the deep feelings of a hurt, betrayed people. The run off has no legitimacy. And everyone knows that. June 26  HARARE, Zimbabwe -- What's happening.? What are we doing? What's going to happen on Friday? Harare, the rumor city, seems to have been struck by questions. The usual commas and exclamation marks have been electorally cleansed from street talk. From the hustlers on street corners to restaurant kitchen staff, all talk in question marks. The week has gone from the familiar certainty of a bloody election to the unknown reality of a boycott. And Zimbabweans can't find the answer to that. So question marks hang over the people's heads like paused sickles. Some still joke. Mugabe decided that multiple choice in elections was an imperialist creation so he has given the people a simplified election: a single candidate. But that's the length of the joke. And even the jokes here are said with question marks lurking at the end. Like paused sickles above the people's heads.    May 22, 2008 . HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A sick, old man shuffled towards me as I walked towards my car from a civil society discussion on elections. I said instinctively that I didn't have any money. He asked me to wait. Patiently, hopefully, urgently. His quiet desperation stopped me. ""Please just listen to me."" I listened. ""I am sick. I am going to die if I don't have this operation."" All he asked was that I take his bank account details and see if I could deposit some money towards his operation. This is public healthcare Zanu (PF) style. Everything has fallen apart here. A once excellent public health care system is now a mortuary of unaffordable drugs. The roads have more potholes than white lines. The zeros on our dollars are so many that the supermarkets now ask us to add three zeros in order to work out the actual price. Some restaurants make up their own concepts, charging in ""thollars"" -- thousands of dollars -- so that once again the customer has to add three zeros to the bill. The Zanu (PF) military junta's only policy at the moment is to beat its disobedient people into line. What they don't realize is that fists and sovereignty won't make us vote. It's the stupid economy. May 7, 2008 . HARARE, Zimbabwe -- As the fireworks erupted we thought that maybe there was hope. Harare's sky was burning with fire. With what-could-be. Hope, anger, resistance, sadness. And hope again. This was the opening show of HIFA, the Harare International Festival of the Arts. Comprised of some of Zimbabwe's leading singers and artists it was a show about a people whose dreams are stolen by a tyrannical king. This Idi Amin suit-clad king was modeled on our own dictator here in Zimbabwe. His hyenas were a symbol of the scavenger-like youth militia terrorizing the peasants. But the people's deepest dreams and strongest songs cannot be stolen. So songs of resistance like Bob Marley's ""Zimbabwe"" were sung to the crowd of 8,000 Zimbabweans gathered in Harare Gardens last week.  As the king's hyenas marauded on the stage attacking young children the singers broke into revolutionary songs from the liberation struggle. It culminated in an emotional rendition of John Lennon's ""Imagine"" by Zimbabwe's leading vocalist, Chiwoniso. All of us artists involved felt as if we were given a window into what-could-be. As fireworks went off over the heads of thousands of dreamers we all dreamt of a peaceful country without tortured bodies and burnt homes. For the one week of the festival we believed. For one week we had a window into the future. And it's beautiful. For more of Comrade Fatso's writing and music, click here.

"Bournemouth, England (CNN) -- When Rowena Macintosh was deciding on whether or not to get breast implants, she told the operating surgeon that she was concerned about leaking silicone from the implants. So he placed in front of her an implant and sliced it open to show her how the silicone remained solid inside, assuring her it would not spill out into her body. She said it looked like jelly candy. ""When I was told that there was absolutely no chance of this breast implant leaking because of this 'jelly baby effect', if you like. Well, that was about 50% of the decision because it felt safe and it was guaranteed for 25 years,"" Macintosh told CNN at her home in Bournemouth. ""I didn't think to check the manufacturer ... because it's not something you do. You go to someone who's supposed to be medically qualified and you trust them,"" she said. ""When you go to a doctor, you don't say: Who makes your medicine? You just assume they're going to be safe."" The manufacturer was PIP -- the bankrupt French company that appears to have used industrial grade silicone intending for stuffing mattresses inside breast implants. Now, there are concerns that PIP implants are also more prone to leaking and rupturing. French authorities announced last month that the government would pay for the removal of the bankrupt company's implants. Authorities in France and England have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants, but have said the devices are prone to rupture and could cause inflammation, scarring and fibrosis. More than 500 French women have had the implants removed since last year, according to the French government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products. Since then, more than 1,000 implants have ruptured, the agency said. Germany, UK weigh in on breast implant concerns . Months after her surgery, Macintosh says she began to get burning and stabbing pains in the area. More recently, she has found a hard mass in one breast. She fears that her PIP implants have leaked and she wants them removed and replaced immediately. ""It's like a ticking time bomb inside me. Until someone says you can have them taken out and put back in again, I'm going to be worried,"" Macintosh says. The problem: Who will pay for the operation? Britain's National Health Service does not pay for cosmetic surgery, so an estimated 95% of breast implant operations are done in private clinics. But now that women are demanding PIP implants be removed, some clinics are refusing to treat them. Rowena Macintosh says she saved up and paid almost $8000 for her breast implants, including surgery and after care. But the clinic refused to giver her a scan to detect ruptures, she says, and also declined to consider removing and replacing the implants until there was a proven problem. The clinic refused to comment to CNN citing privacy concerns. ""I think ultimately it's the surgeons and the clinics, whoever bought the implants and certified their use, that should be held responsible,"" she says. The British government agrees, but says there is still no statistical data to show that PIP implants are either toxic or more prone to rupturing. ""Our advice remains the same that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend routine removal. We have always recommended that women who are concerned should speak to their surgeon or GP,"" British Health Secretary Andrew Lansley in a statement. ""The NHS will support removal of PIP implants if, after this consultation, the patient still has concerns and with her doctor she decides that it is right to do so. ""We believe that private healthcare providers have a moral duty to offer the same service to their patients that we will offer to NHS patients -- free information, consultations, scans and removal if necessary,"" Lansley said. But if clinics do not follow through, he added, the National Health Service will be called upon to step in and support patients. Ultimately, taxpayers may have to foot the bill in some cases. That's not what Rowena Macintosh wants. She wants the private clinic and surgeon to pay to remove and replace the PIP implants as soon as possible, but she realizes that may not happen until after a long legal battle. She doesn't regret the decision to get implants, she says, but she does wish she had chosen a different, more discerning clinic. ""And to think I've got mattress silicone inside me and God knows what else they used,"" she grimaces over a cup of tea in her kitchen. ""It's just disgusting, really.""","A UK woman with implants worries about leaking silicone from her implants .

"San Antonio, Texas (CNN) -- For Holly Hirshberg, gardening started as a way to bond with her children. But when the recession hit, her backyard hobby became a necessity. ""In 2008, my husband lost his job just like many other Americans, and we were living off of our garden,"" she said. Hirshberg and her family of four ate a variety of homegrown foods -- including broccoli, carrots, okra, squash and tomatoes -- so they could make ends meet. She was pleasantly surprised by how simple and healthful they were. ""It was nice to know that not only could I take care of (my family) out of what I grew in my garden, but I could take care of them really well,"" she said. After realizing how much nutritious food she was able to grow, Hirshberg began collecting seeds from her garden and sharing them with others. In 2008, she started The Dinner Garden, an organization that provides free packs of seeds to people so they can grow enough food to feed a family of four. Since its inception, The Dinner Garden has provided seeds to 65,000 families across the United States. ""When you're having trouble or struggling, you have so many things to worry about,"" said Hirshberg, 39. ""How are you going to pay your mortgage? How are you going to afford your medicine ... your kids? If you know you have food, you don't have to worry."" According to a 2009 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 14.7% of American households were ""food insecure"" at least some time during that year. ""Food insecure"" means all household members did not always have access to enough food for an active, healthy life. Hirshberg is hoping to help change that by making gardening simple and accessible to anyone. The Dinner Garden offers gardening supplies and tips, and its website lists locations throughout the United States where seeds are available for pickup. People can also fill out a seed request form online, and Hirshberg and her volunteers will send seeds directly to them. ""If you have a willingness to garden, we can help you find a way to do it,"" Hirshberg said. ""The seeds do all the work. You put them in the ground, they will grow. ... With just a couple minutes a day, you really can grow a lot of food for your family."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2011 CNN Heroes . The Dinner Garden gets its seeds through donations from seed companies as well as some of the people it sent seeds to in the past. ""People who get seeds from us are some of our biggest donors. ... They save their seeds from the stuff they grow and donate back for us so they can help another family in need,"" Hirshberg said. ""I love that."" Hirshberg's evenings are often spent packing and labeling seeds, and she also runs volunteer seed-packing sessions. The packs of seeds are customized for recipients' areas and climates to ensure they will have success growing the produce. ""We find between 10 and 11 varieties of seeds that will grow in their area,"" Hirshberg said. ""We do melons and carrots, broccoli and all the good things, and then we throw in something interesting in each one ... to expose them to something new and different."" Hirshberg said she started to love vegetables after growing her own, and she believes that there is a veggie eater in everyone. ""What you see in the grocery store is such a small percentage of what's available,"" she said. ""A lot of tomatoes come in black and purple and striped. You can get the broccoli in purple ... or carrots that come in red ... that are more fun to eat, I think."" Seed recipients often call or write Hirshberg for information about gardening, and she tries her best to respond to all of them. ""We want to help people provide for themselves,"" she said. ""Gardening is a skill that once you get it, you have that for the rest of your life. You can garden if you have a disability. You can garden if you're blind."" Julie Autaubo lives with a disability but has found gardening to be a great way to cope. It has also helped her financially. ""I would not be able to afford vegetables if it wasn't for my garden,"" said Autaubo, 52, who got her first seeds from The Dinner Garden and now volunteers with Hirshberg. ""I can grow tomatoes, eggplant, bell pepper in just flower pots. ... I've got a trellis with cucumbers growing on it. If I want a carrot, I just go out to the garden and get a carrot. I don't even have to leave my apartment."" Hirshberg said The Dinner Garden isn't just about the seeds and the food. It's about keeping people healthy and giving them hope. ""It is about showing people another way to live,"" she said. Bill Beam's health had been deteriorating since a fall left him disabled last year. The 56-year-old said eating fresh food grown from The Dinner Garden seeds has helped him turn his life around. ""Ever since I hooked up with The Dinner Garden, I've been doing a lot, lot better,"" Beam said. ""My health improved. ... My diabetes and my blood pressure are finally under control after being sky-high for so long."" Ultimately, Hirshberg hopes that her work is helping families get ahead.

"(CNN) -- One of Asia's youngest self-made billionaires, 35-year-old Yoshikazu Tanaka looks the part of a young internet tycoon. The Japanese founder and CEO of mobile social gaming business Gree arrived for his CNN interview wearing a hooded sweatshirt, ripped jeans and a pair bight red shoes. His personal wealth is valued at $2.2 billion so he can afford to wear whatever he wants to the office. Gree has grown from Tanaka's self-financed project into a company with a market value of around $7 billion. The share price is more than sevenfold what it was at its 2008 IPO. The company is now partnered with Tencent, one of the largest social networks in China, and in April 2011 it acquired OpenFeint, a large U.S.-based gaming network. Tanaka hopes to take Gree into Europe, the United States and emerging markets like Brazil to increase the number of users to one billion, five times the current level. Q&A: Andrew Stevens meets Japan's 'Zuckerberg' What makes Tanaka's success so intriguing is that he's built a profitable business against the tide. The Japanese economy has just begun its third decade of lackluster economic growth and large Japanese companies like Sony, Panasonic and Toyota are retrenching after facing record losses or scandals abroad. The triple blow of last year's earthquake, tsunami and reactor meltdown at the Fukushima-Daichi nuclear plant added to the country's gloomy economic outlook. Sony expects nearly $3 billion loss . If traditional Japanese corporate powerhouses are flagging, few have risen up to replace them. Tanaka believes a key weakness of corporate Japan has been its insular attitude. ""I think the biggest problem is that so many people have not been able to accept the fact that we cannot survive without trying to compete globally,"" he says. It's easy to lay blame at the feet of the politicians but Japan is a democracy and so everyone has to share responsibility, believes Tanaka. He hopes Gree can have positive impact on Japan as an example of a successful start-up. ""People say there is no culture of growing a business from scratch in Japan but actually social games and our company Gree became successful within seven years,"" he says. Tanaka is aware of the comparisons to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, and not just in his dress sense. Both men started companies for themselves in 2004 and continue to lead them as they've grown into global players. Both believe there is more to business than just making money. ""Facebook became very big; big enough to change society. I think we can change society as well, but in our own way,"" he says of Gree. He doesn't know if the online gaming industry can be the savior of corporate Japan, but he believes there are few other sectors where the prospects are so bright in this struggling country.","Yoshikazu Tanaka is billionaire founder of mobile games company, Gree .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama gave the go-ahead for U.S. forces to raid a northern Pakistan housing compound based on ""what was probably a 50-50 chance that Osama bin Laden was there,"" his national security adviser said. ""It was a circumstantial case ... But what he had 100 percent confidence in was the ability of our special forces to execute the mission,"" Tom Donilon told CNN's Candy Crowley on Saturday, part of an interview that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union."" On April 28, Obama attended the last of several National Security Council meetings focused on finding and going after the al Qaeda leader. During that meeting, some advocated for the commando raid while others advised against it, Donilon said, given there had been no clear-cut sightings of bin Laden by that point. ""He had gotten divided counsel, and that happens a lot in these things, as you would imagine,"" Donilon said. After a night's sleep, Obama told Donilon at 8:20 a.m. the next day to draft the order for the raid. By Sunday evening -- which was early Monday morning in Pakistan -- the 38-minute mission was over, the 25-strong U.S. team having flown out of the country along with bin Laden's dead body. Like other Obama administration officials, Donilon applauded the decision and its end result of knocking out the No. 1 man on the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorist"" list. He called it ""the single biggest achievement we've ever had"" in the fight against al Qaeda. Especially as they continue poring through voluminous material taken from the complex, U.S. authorities are more convinced than ever that bin Laden had a significant operational and strategic role, not to mention a key symbolic one, in the terrorist network. His death, said Donilon, is a major blow to al Qaeda. ""At the end of last year, we assessed that al Qaeda had been diminished ... to its weakest since 2001,"" said the security adviser, who previously served in the administrations of presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. ""And they took a very big step back Sunday."" One reason for that assessment is what Donilon called the ""extraordinary"" amount of intelligence that U.S. special forces were able to take from the Abbottabad compound. A multi-agency task force is currently poring through those documents, computer hard drives and other materials -- intermittently releasing information including five videotapes featuring bin Laden that came out Saturday. ""This is the largest cache of information gotten from a senior terrorist -- gotten from any terrorist in one operation,"" Donilon said, calling the amount of seized material about equal to ""the size of a small college library."" Despite doubts from some conspiracy theorists, al Qaeda itself has admitted that bin Laden was killed. That means that his deputy, Egyptian doctor and radical Ayman al-Zawahiri, will rise to the top of the FBI list, according to Donilon, even as U.S. and allied forces continue their efforts to find him and other al Qaeda leaders. Last week, CIA Director Leon Panetta (who Obama has nominated to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary) told House members during a closed-door briefing that Pakistan was ""either involved or incompetent,"" according to two sources in attendance. There have been no indications Pakistani authorities knew about or acted upon knowledge that bin Laden was living in the same town as one of its top military academies. Donilon did not suggest Pakistani authorities knew the al Qaeda leader lived in the city, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of the capital Islamabad, or that they somehow harbored him. He said, ""I have not seen any evidence, at least to date, that the political, military or intelligence apparatus knew about the presence of Osama bin Laden."" Yet U.S. authorities are troubled by the fact that the al Qaeda leader could stay there ""for six years or so"" undetected, said Donilon. ""We'll clearly be working with (Pakistani authorities) to understand how we got to this point,"" he said. Donilon noted Pakistan's active role in tracking down terrorists, calling them a ""very important partner"" despite the existence of some ""differences"" with U.S. authorities. He said, ""If we find things ... that are highly disturbing, we'll certainly press that"" -- though he expected that Islamabad and Washington would continue to work together. ""We need to look at this in a calm and cool way,"" Donilon said, adding, ""a relationship with Pakistan, given everything we have at stake in that region, is an important relationship.""","National Security Adviser Tom Donilon says Obama got ""divided counsel"" on raid .

"(Financial Times) -- China plans to boost its official defence budget by 11.2 per cent this year as Beijing is balancing the modernisation of its armed forces against the need to keep military spending in line with economic development. Defence expenditure is budgeted to rise to Rmb670.247bn ($110bn) in 2012, Li Zhaoxing, spokesman of the National People's Congress, told reporters a day before China's rubber stamp parliament opens to hear premier Wen Jiabao's budget report. The rate of increase is slightly lower than last year's 12.7 per cent but in line with the growth trajectory over the past two decades. China has reported double-digit increases in official military spending for each year since 1989 except for 2009, when the announced growth rate dropped to 7.5 per cent. Beijing says it is committed to keeping military spending in line with the overall pace of economic development. Foreign analysts agree that Beijing's official defence budget does not represent the full amount China spends on the military, but most external estimates still assume that the overall growth trajectory of military spending is in line with the announced figure. The Stockholm Institute for Peace Research, one of the most respected independent research institutions, estimates that the official figure accounts for about 60 per cent of China's total military spending. Some of the remaining funds are for the People's Armed Police, a force directly under central government orders which has a separate budget, and the militia, which is partly funded by local governments. The SIPRI analysts say the biggest uncertainty is hidden in research and development and acquisitions of new weapons systems. In general, the Chinese government lists soldiers' pay, training and maintenance, and equipment costs as the three areas on which its military budget is spent. In a departure from this terse formula, Mr Li claimed that the official number included all other spending. ""Spending on the research, testing, acquisition, maintenance, transport and storage of equipment, including new weapons systems, are also included in the defence budget figure which is announced every year,"" he said. Independent defence experts doubt this claim as they believe the official figure is not enough to cover for the cost of major weapons systems that the People's Liberation Army has under development or which it has started deploying. Last year, the PLA finished refurbishment of an old aircraft carrier which it has started using for exercises. ""Given that they're taking it out for navigation training and that they're training large numbers of pilots for carrier operations, the cost here has to soar,"" said a south-east Asian military official in Beijing. The Chinese military has also started deploying a land-based anti-ship missile with which it intends to limit access for US carrier groups to regional waters. Foreign defence experts said the additional radar and satellites needed for accurate targeting were also bound to cause a spike in weapons acquisition cost. The 11.2 per cent increase comes as the US, which has the world's largest military budget, is cutting defence spending while at the same time shifting its focus to Asia-Pacific, widely seen as an effort to re-assert its regional influence against a rising China. Over the past year, the Obama administration has moved to strengthen military ties with traditional allies in the region including Australia, Japan and the Philippines. South-east Asian countries welcome a stronger US presence in the region to balance what they see as an increasingly assertive China. As Beijing has stepped up patrols in disputed waters of the South China Sea and continued to add advanced military hardware, neighbours such as Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia have reacted by stepping up weapons purchases themselves. For the US, maintaining its naval presence in Asia is more difficult and more costly than for China -- Washington relies on a 'forward' structure of foreign bases and carrier groups whereas the People's Liberation Army can concentrate on building equipment which will allow it to deny US forces access to regional waters. ""It is important to note that Beijing views itself as reacting to the increasingly assertive policies of other countries and has repeatedly said that it does not want to provoke military confrontation,"" said Sarah McDowall, Asia-Pacific analyst at IHS Jane's, a leading defence research firm. ""That said, the increase will be partially motivated by Washington's strategic campaign to re-assert itself in Asia Pacific and will underscore China's growing means to assert its power over maritime claims in disputed waters of the South China Sea, East China Sea and Yellow Sea."" IHS Jane's recently forecast the pace of Chinese defence spending growth to jump to an average 18.7 per cent per year. But analysts believe that any bigger increases would have to wait until a new generation of political leaders have taken over. Xi Jinping, the vice president who is expected to succeed Hu Jintao as president and Communist party chief, has much closer ties to the military than Mr Hu. However, even next year's budget will still be drafted under Mr Hu. © The Financial Times Limited 2012 .","Defence expenditure is budgeted to rise to Rmb670.247bn ($110bn) in 2012 .

"Editor's note: Business Insider is contributing a series of columns to CNN.com that challenge commonly held beliefs about the tech world. (Business Insider) -- Here's the truth about AT&T's wireless network: On the whole, despite what you've heard, it's not actually that bad. It's just bad for the wrong people in the wrong places -- mostly tech- and media-types in New York and San Francisco, California. Those two cities in particular -- and parts of other big cities, like downtown Chicago, Illinois -- are sort of the perfect storm for AT&T. There's a huge concentration of Apple iPhones, owned by tech- and media-savvy folks who demand a ton of bandwidth, and love to complain loudly on Twitter and in the press. And there are tall buildings, landlords and construction processes that make running a wireless network more challenging. That helps explain why there are so many dropped calls and pokey mobile Internet connections in those cities, and also why there are so many angry tweets and news articles. And that's why even Apple CEO Steve Jobs has come to AT&T's side, defending how his partner has tried to beef up its infrastructure in its most troubled markets. At a recent press event, Jobs said that when AT&T wants to add a cell tower in Texas, it may only take three weeks. But in San Francisco, on average, it takes three years. ""No one wants a cell tower in their back yard, but everyone wants perfect reception,"" Jobs said, according to a rough transcript. The rest of the country, overall, isn't such a mess for AT&T. How can we tell? One way is to look at AT&T's customer turnover statistics to see if people are fleeing from AT&T and its supposedly terrible service. The reality is that they are not. During AT&T's second quarter, its monthly ""churn"" -- the percent of customers who leave every month -- was 1.29 percent. If you exclude prepaid subscribers, who tend to switch carriers or discontinue their service more often than average, AT&T's monthly churn was even lower, at 1.01 percent. Those are both record lows for the company and represent improvement over the same period last year. How do those stats compare to the rest of the wireless industry? You'd think that Verizon Wireless -- whose network has a stellar reputation compared to AT&T's -- would have much, much lower churn. Not quite. Verizon Wireless customers are indeed more loyal than AT&T's, but barely. Its monthly churn last quarter was 1.27 percent, only a hair below AT&T's. If you exclude prepaid subscribers, it was 0.94 percent -- again, better than AT&T's, but not by much. For comparison, Sprint was almost twice as bad, and T-Mobile was more than twice as bad as AT&T and Verizon. If things were that bad at AT&T -- and comparatively, that much better at Verizon Wireless -- you'd expect a greater difference in their churn rates. Another recent study leans in AT&T's favor. A 3G wireless performance test carried out by PC World showed that AT&T's network was almost always faster than its competitors, and that its reliability was on par. Both measurements showed significant improvements over its 2009 tests. But indeed, AT&T's performance and reliability in New York and San Francisco weren't as strong as in other cities, such as Seattle, Washington, or Baltimore, Maryland. Anecdotally, I've noticed similar things traveling around the country with an iPhone and 3G-enabled iPad. Last weekend in Maine, my 3G connection seemed much snappier than it typically does in New York. I was even able to stream a Netflix video to my iPad in a moving bus -- something I can't even do reliably when I'm stationary in Manhattan. AT&T pours billions of dollars -- between $18 billion and $19 billion this year alone -- into trying to improve its network. For example, it's going cell site by cell site to add more bandwidth to support faster speeds, a process that will continue through this year and next, an AT&T spokesman says. Many of the carrier's improvements have focused on New York and San Francisco. For instance, AT&T has doubled the capacity of its network in New York over the past year, and is in the process of doubling its capacity in San Francisco. It has also installed specialized indoor systems in high-traffic areas, including Grand Central Station and Yankee Stadium in New York. As a result, mobile download speeds in New York are up 31 percent over the last six months, according to internal testing data. Blocked calls are down almost 40 percent in Manhattan so far this year, and dropped calls are down 23 percent, AT&T says. The company has also complemented its strained 3G network with more free wi-fi hot spots for its customers, including a network recently installed in New York's Times Square, one near Wrigley Field in Chicago and all Starbucks locations. In addition to adding 400 percent more 3G capacity at AT&T Park in San Francisco, it has also doubled the number of wi-fi hot spots there. In those situations, the idea is that customers could hop on wi-fi to send emails or access the Internet, taking a load off cell networks. To be sure, despite these improvements, the company obviously still has a lot of problems in New York and San Francisco. And because of the concentration of tech and media industry types there, we'll probably see the ""AT&T sucks"" rants and ""attfail"" tweets for the foreseeable future. At least until Verizon Wireless gets Apple's iPhone. Then we'll know if this whole mess is really AT&T's fault or just the unique situation of having to support millions of iPhones in use at one time. But in reality, things aren't as terrible for AT&T as you've been led to believe. It's just really bad in the wrong places, for the wrong people.

"New York (CNN) -- New York police arrested 50 protesters Saturday on what organizers from Occupy Wall Street were dubbing a day to ""re-occupy,"" coinciding with the movement's three-month anniversary. Those arrested were charged with trespassing after they attempted to scale a fence belonging to a church in lower Manhattan, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. Browne added that the arrests ""may have stymied plans to cut through the fence on multiple sides."" The fence protected an area of Duarte Park that is owned by Trinity Church. Though supportive of the movement, the Rev. James H. Cooper, the rector of the church, said he does not believe setting up a tent city at Duarte Park enhances its mission or that of the protesters. ""The vacant lot has no facilities to sustain a winter encampment,"" Cooper said in a statement Saturday. ""In good conscience and faith, we strongly believe to do so would be wrong, unsafe, unhealthy, and potentially injurious."" A spokesman for Occupy Wall Street expressed disappointment that the movement did not get more support from the church. ""Churches have been supportive venues -- it is a shame that this came to this,"" Karanja Gacuca said. Protesters are looking for a new home after being evicted last month from the city's Zuccotti Park -- the movement's physical birthplace -- when a New York Supreme Court judge ruled that they could protest at the park, but not camp out. Upon hearing of the protesters' plan to set up camp at the church, officials from the Episcopal Church, which oversees Trinity, warned Friday that demonstrators would be subject to police and legal action should they attempt to trespass on the property. ""In a country where all people can vote and Trinity's door to dialogue is open, it is not necessary to forcibly break into property,"" Archbishop Desmond Tutu said in a statement Friday. Gacuca said Saturday that protesters aren't ""interested in seizing property -- we are interested in justice and expressing our frustrations."" ""The area we're talking about is empty and vacant. It is a tragedy because it is a waste of resource,"" he said. Earlier, Occupy Wall Street protesters gathered in Duarte Park for speeches and music. Protesters called Saturday ""part of a call to re-occupy in the wake of the coordinated attacks and subsequent evictions of occupations across the nation and around the world,"" according to their website. It is unclear when the arrested protesters will be released. A smaller number of Occupy participants marched to Times Square on Saturday night.","Those arrested attempted to scale a fence belonging to a church, NYPD spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- There are no pure ""winner-take-all"" contests on Super Tuesday, but almost all of the 10 states holding contests on the biggest day of the primary season offer candidates some chance of shutting out their opponents in the all-important race to amass delegates. Mitt Romney is the most plausible beneficiary of the states' complex allocation rules. If the former Massachusetts governor can rack up enough of the vote in Idaho, Massachusetts, Vermont and Virginia, he stands to be the sole winner of the combined 133 delegates from those states, almost a third of the 419 delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has a chance of picking up all of Georgia's 76 delegates, according to recent polling. Ohio, Oklahoma, and Tennessee also offer candidates an opportunity to receive all of the delegates available from those states, although various party rules make this a much less likely outcome in these states. Here's a state-by-state breakdown of the ""winner-take-all"" scenarios: . IDAHO . Delegate allocation rule: Extremely complicated version of proportional. Each county holds multiple rounds of voting until one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote in that county. Winner of a county wins that county's allotment of total delegates. If one candidate receives a majority of total delegates, he receives all 32 of the state's delegates. Winner-take-all scenario: Each county is allotted a share of the state's total number of national convention delegates. One candidate wins enough counties to amass more than 16 of the state's 32 delegates and thus automatically receives all 32 delegates. Likelihood: Very possible. State rules were designed to favor a winner-take-all outcome. GEORGIA . Delegate allocation rule: Proportional. 34 statewide delegates allocated in proportion to statewide vote, with a 20% threshold; 42 district delegates (14 districts with 3 delegates each) winner-take-all by district if winner gets more than 50%, otherwise modified proportional. Winner-take-all scenario: If the winner keeps all opponents under 20% of the statewide vote and wins all 14 districts with more than 50% of the vote, then he wins all the state's delegates. Likelihood: Possible. Gingrich leading comfortably in polling, but the question is whether he can hold Romney to below 20% of the statewide vote, while also winning every district with a clear majority. MASSACHUSETTS . Delegate allocation rule: Proportional. All 38 delegates allocated in proportion to the statewide vote, with a 15% threshold. Winner-take-all scenario: If only one candidate reaches the 15% statewide vote threshold, then he wins all the state's delegates. Likelihood: Possible. If Romney wins his home state with a big margin and keeps Gingrich, Ron Paul or Rick Santorum under 15%, then he wins all 38 delegates. Former candidates Michele Bachmann, Jon Huntsman, Rick Perry and ""No preference"" are also on the ballot to further split the anti-Romney vote. OHIO . Delegate allocation rule: Proportional. 15 statewide delegates winner-take-all if a candidate receives more than 50% of statewide vote, otherwise proportional with 20% threshold; 48 district delegates (16 districts with 3 delegates each) winner-take-all by district vote. Santorum did not submit any delegate slates in three districts (congressional districts 6, 9, and 13), which means he cannot win any delegates from these districts. In six additional districts (CDs 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 16), he submitted only partial delegate slates, which means that if Santorum wins any of these districts, he will only receive one or two out of the three possible delegates in that district. Winner-take-all scenario: If the winner gets more than 50% of the statewide vote and wins every CD, then he gets all the state's delegates. Or if only one candidate receives more than 20% of the vote and also wins every CD, he wins all the state's delegates. Likelihood: Unlikely. If Santorum wins statewide, he cannot win every CD because he hasn't fielded full delegate slates. If Romney wins, it's unlikely he'll win more than 50% statewide and also unlikely that he would carry every CD. OKLAHOMA . Delegate allocation rule: Proportional. 25 statewide delegates winner-take-all if candidate receives more than 50% of statewide vote, otherwise proportional with 15% threshold; 15 district delegates (five districts with three delegates each) winner-take-all by district vote if winner gets more than 50% of district vote, otherwise proportional by CD vote with modified 15% threshold . Winner-take-all scenario: If the winner gets more than 50% of the statewide vote and wins every CD by more than 50%, then he gets all the state's delegates. Or if only one candidate receives more than15% of the vote and also wins every CD by more than 50%, he wins all the state's delegates. Likelihood: Unlikely that one candidate will receive more than 50% of the statewide vote and in every CD, according to polling. Also unlikely that only one candidate would reach the 15% threshold. TENNESSEE . Delegate allocation rule: Proportional. 28 statewide delegates winner-take-all if winner receives more than 66% of statewide vote, otherwise proportional with 20% threshold; 27 district delegates (nine districts with three delegates each) winner-take-all by district vote if winners receives more than 66% of district vote, otherwise proportional with 20% threshold. Winner-take-all scenario: If winner gets more than 66% of the statewide vote and wins every CD by more than 66%, then he gets all the state's delegates. Or if only one candidate receives more than 20% of the vote and also wins every CD by more than 66%, he wins all the state's delegates . Likelihood: Very unlikely that one candidate will receive more than 66% of the statewide vote and in every CD. Also unlikely that only one candidate would reach threshold. VERMONT . Delegate allocation rule: Proportional. 14 statewide delegates winner-take-all if winner receives more than 50% of the statewide vote; otherwise proportional with 20% threshold; three district delegates winner-take-all by statewide vote. Winner-take-all scenario: If winner gets more than 50% of the statewide vote, he gets all the state's delegates. Or if only one candidates makes the 20% threshold, he wins all the state's delegates. Likelihood: Very possible that Mitt Romney could win the statewide vote by more than 50% and thus win all delegates. VIRGINIA . Delegate allocation rule: Proportional. 13 statewide delegates winner-take-all if winner receives more than 50% of statewide vote, otherwise proportional with 15% threshold; 33 district delegates (11 districts with three delegates each) winner-take-all by district vote. Winner-take-all scenario: If winner gets more than 50% of the statewide vote and wins every CD, he gets all the states delegates.

"(CNN) -- More than a million people have signed a petition to recall Wisconsin's governor, the state's Democratic Party said Tuesday. That's nearly twice the 540,208 signatures required to seek a recall of first-term Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who drew the ire of labor unions and public school teachers after he stripped public employees of their collective bargaining rights. State Democratic Party officials said they would submit the signatures by close of business Tuesday. The officials also said they would turn in more than the required number of signatures needed for recall elections for the state's Republican lieutenant governor and three state senators. The Wisconsin elections board will review the recall petitions. ""I think it's going to be a very impressive number that we hand in, beyond any challenge that this election is going to happen,"" Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate told CNN affiliate WTMJ Monday. Walker's administration gained national attention last year when he, along with Republican legislators, pushed forward a bill to cut state workers' collective bargaining rights. That bill was signed into law in March, following weeks of protests at the state capitol building in Madison. This would be the first time in Wisconsin's history that a governor has faced recall. In fact, there have only been two successful gubernatorial recalls in United States history, that of California Gov. Gray Davis in 2003 and that of North Dakota Gov. Lynn Frazier in 1921. The more difficult battle will begin once the signatures are approved, and the state schedules a recall election. Both sides will be well financed and ready to battle, said Kenneth Goldstein, president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group. Walker was undaunted by the recall effort, WTMJ reported. ""The optimist in me looks at that and says: the overwhelming majority of the people in the state chose not to sign that and I earned the trust of the majority the last time. My hope is I will earn their trust again,"" he said. Walker set off a firestorm in January 2010 when he moved to curtail the collective bargaining rights of most state employees. With majorities in both houses of the Legislature, Walker and his GOP allies voted to limit raises for public employees except police and firefighters to the rate of inflation, bar unions from deducting dues from workers' paychecks and force them to hold a new certification vote every year. Republicans insisted it was necessary to control the skyrocketing costs of public employee benefits and close the budget shortfall. Democrats argued it was an attempt to gut public-sector labor unions, one of their core constituencies. The public brouhaha all but shut down the Wisconsin state legislature for weeks. It also drew protesters by the tens of thousands, among them union supporters and public employees, who called the measure an attack on workers. A group of Democratic lawmakers left the state for some time in an effort to not allow a quorum for a vote. Eventually, the law was passed and signed by Walker in March. The state Supreme Court upheld the law in June but the battle birthed a storm of political activism that led to the recall effort.

"Anchorage, Alaska (CNN) -- It's a competition that brings out some of the toughest, hardiest, most ferociously determined athletes in the world.

This year, Iditarod spectators had to brave near-record snowfall in Anchorage just to get a glimpse of their favorite teams -- howling at top of their lungs in anxious anticipation of their turn at the starting point. The nearly 1,000-mile race covers some of the most extreme terrain on Earth, each team powered by 64 booted paws and a musher's dogged desire to be the first to reach the finish line on the Bering Sea Coast. The Iditarod has been an annual Alaskan sporting event since 1973, drawing spectators and competitors from across the world. Each year, hundreds of spectators travel to Alaska hoping for some personal interaction with the mushers and their four-legged teammates. There are many opportunities for visitors to meet their favorite mushers along the trail, but it takes some advance planning to get the most out of an Iditarod vacation. The 2012 trail covers approximately 945 miles, so spectators must first determine which portion of the race they aim to see. The ceremonial start of the race is, by far, the most popular choice of fans seeking access and convenience. There are a number of events in and around Anchorage leading up to the Iditarod start, such as the Mushers' Banquet, various Iditarod educational seminars featuring mushers and race officials, and even a competing annual festival and parade in Anchorage, the Fur Rondy. On the first Saturday of March, thousands of Iditarod enthusiasts line Anchorage's historic Fourth Avenue to participate in the celebratory send-off. Race officials personally introduce each team as they depart ""the chute,"" announcers struggling to be heard over a cacophony of howling dog teams. Mushers and their dogs often don festive regalia at the noncompetitive ceremonial start while also toting warmly bundled ""Iditariders"" in their sleds. Iditariders are fans who bid on a ceremonial sled ride as part of a program which helps to support the race financially. The chance at a ceremonial 11-mile Iditarod sled ride begins at $500 and can cost as much as $7,500 for the opportunity to experience the event in a sled driven by a popular race champion. Following a Saturday ceremonial start, mushers quickly regroup their dog teams and reorganize trail necessities for the following day's ""official start"" of the race in Willow, Alaska, 79 miles north of Anchorage. Spectators who travel to Willow by car or shuttle bus can once again line ""the chute"" on Sunday afternoon to cheer on mushers as the race clock officially begins. For most spectators, the next eight to 12 days involve closely monitoring the race online with the assistance of real-time GPS tracking and video coverage from the trail checkpoints -- available on www.Iditarod.com . Behind the scenes at Iditarod 2011 . However, for those seeking a more intensive race experience, travel operators offer various ""flightseeing"" and snowmobile excursions in order to catch mushers crossing through some of the more than 20 remote checkpoints. The price to travel across the diverse Alaskan landscape by bush plane can be expensive during the Iditarod, but the experience is almost always described as unforgettable. The Gold Rush-era town of Nome is the end of the trail where the famous Iditarod ""burled arch"" forms the finish line. Crowds of spectators line narrow, snow-packed Front Street to greet the winner. Last year's Iditarod Champion, John Baker, made it to Nome with a record-setting pace -- 8 days, 18 hours and 46 minutes. A loud siren sounds day or night throughout Nome announcing the arrival of teams nearing the finish line. Hotels in Nome, however, are scarce and must be booked months in advance for die-hard fans and visitors hoping to be present when the leaders arrive. For other spectators happy to simply get any glimpse of the remaining teams' arrivals at the finish line, opportunities continue for approximately a week. While the Iditarod may be known as ""The Last Great Race,"" there's no sign it's coming to an end anytime soon. If you're unable to witness this year's race at points along the trail, 2013 promises to deliver yet another compelling Iditarod -- a truly Alaskan experience.

"FAIRFAX COUNTY, Virginia (CNN) -- It was just after 7 a.m. and Cassie Graham was lighting up her second cigarette of the morning. Cassie Graham, a 17-year-old high school senior,  joined a school support group to help her quit smoking. A school bus passed her parked car, a sign that that it was time for the 17-year-old high school senior from Fairfax County, Virginia, to stop smoking and head to class. If Graham has her way, that will be the last time she ever lights up. ""It's getting pretty bad,"" said Graham who started smoking at age 15. ""It used to be fun and now I have to smoke. I know that it's not normal to smoke all the time, and I have to find some way to quit.""  Watch more on Cassie's struggle to kick the habit » . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 20 percent of high school students smoked cigarettes last year. Smoking rates among ninth- to 12th-graders have remained stable for the past five years. ""When I see a young kid smoking, it's just so frustrating because I actually know the power of tobacco to cause disease,"" said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. Nearly half of all adults in the United States who suffer from emphysema and 40 percent with chronic bronchitis are smokers, the CDC reports. More than 430,000 Americans die each year from smoking-related causes, the American Lung Association estimates. While researchers have a good idea how to help adults kick the habit, little information is available on what to do to assist  teenage smokers. ""It's really hard for somebody who is a teenager in high school to stop smoking, even if they wanted to stop smoking,"" Brawley said. Peer pressure can be tremendous among young smokers, he said. What's more, Brawley noted, it may be difficult for a teenager to seek help from a doctor or counselor without a parent's knowledge. Smoking cessation drugs, patches, gum and lozenges are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for anyone under 18. So what's left to help a teen kick the habit? Support groups. Cassie Graham signed up for a 10-week smoking-cessation class held during one of her free periods at Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax County. ""I'm not of legal age to smoke,"" Cassie said. ""So I was kind of skeptical at first, like 'Am I going to get in trouble for going to this class?'"" Samuel Wagner, a substance abuse counselor at the school, didn't discount Graham's concerns about showing up for the session. ""It's very gutsy,"" he said, ""because students do have that fear that if they come to this group, all we're doing is rounding them up to get them busted."" Wagner, along with school counselor, Tami Marcheski, sat down with five students who've signed up for the support group called Not-on-Tobacco or N-O-T. The American Lung Association designed the program a decade ago for regular smokers, ages 14 to 19, who want to quit. Marcheski called the success rate at her school outstanding. ""Thirty-seven percent of kids have quit and 60 percent reduced the number of cigarettes smoked,"" she said. This particular session was called ""quit day."" Cassie and her classmates talked openly about their reasons for wanting to quit. Almost everyone mentioned health concerns and the expense of the habit. David Thomas, 18, added ""I want to smell better. I won't have to use cans and cans of Axe. I can work out longer and I don't have to worry about carrying mints around."" Lia Pisa-Relli said she started smoking when she was 12. Now at the age of 17, she worries that she has a lot of breathing problems. ""I want to be able to run. I can't even run up the stairs. I can't even walk up two flights of stairs. It's pretty bad."" The counselors spoke with the teens about how to handle nicotine withdrawal symptoms. They passed out lollypops and stress balls to take their mind off cravings. They urged the students to lean on one another and their families for support. Their final exercise of the day was to write down their concerns and fears about quitting on note cards. Cassie read her comments aloud to the group: ""One of my biggest concerns was that I wouldn't be able to quit, but now I know if I just stick to it and actually try hard to quit then I'll be able to."" She and her classmates crumpled up the cards and tossed them in the trash as if they were throwing away a bad habit. Cassie's final words in class: ""I can quit now.""","More than 430,000 Americans die each year from smoking-related causes .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted he is considering bringing goalscoring legend Thierry Henry back to the club on a short-term loan deal. The 34-year-old Henry, who is Arsenal's record all-time scorer with 226 goals for the club between 1999 and 2007, currently plays for MLS side New York Red Bulls, and does not need to return to the United States until March. Wenger is facing a shortage of strikers with Ivorian Gervinho and Moroccan Marouane Chamakh both appearing for their countries in the Africa Cup of Nations in January and February -- and Henry's return could be a viable solution to the problem. Wenger told the official Arsenal website: ""I have to think about it. Short-term is ideal for us, but I haven't made any enquiry yet. Thierry is not with the club at the moment and it has never come up in any conversation. He added: ""January 1 is the vital date for us and I will make a decision in the next seven days on players."" Frenchman Henry, who recently had a spell back training with the club, had a statue of himself unveiled outside the Emirates Stadium earlier this month as part of Arsenal's 125-year centenary celebrations. In his eight years at Arsenal, Henry won two English Premier League titles and three FA Cups, before being sold to Barcelona in 2007.","Arsene Wenger admits he is considering re-signing Thierry Henry on a short-term deal .

"(CNN) -- Joe Ledley scored the only goal of the game as Celtic beat Rangers 1-0 in the Old Firm derby clash Wednesday night. The Welsh international netted with a 52nd minute header as his team took over from their arch Glasgow rivals at the top of the Scottish Premier League. Reigning champions Rangers might have scored with a header of their own by Lee Wallace in the first half but it was ruled not to have crossed the line. On such tight decisions these often frantic affairs are decided and victory for Neil Lennon's men saw them revenge defeat in the first Old Firm match of the season at Ibrox.

"Sao Paulo (CNN) -- Brazil¹s Congress postponed a vote on Tuesday on a controversial forest code, which has pitted farmers and ranchers against environmentalists. According to state-run Agencia Brasil, the vote was rescheduled for next Tuesday so the government can try to secure support for the current text. Lawmakers are still sharply divided, with the rural lobby in Congress demanding more protection for farmers who have cleared land and environmentalists accusing the government of repealing landmark laws. Over the past decade, Brazil has cracked down on clear-cutting, especially in the biodiverse Amazon rain forest, reducing the rate of deforestation by 80%. Environmentalists are concerned that some of those gains could be threatened if the new legislation is passed. The bill eases limits on deforestation and extends an amnesty to some developers who cut down trees illegally in the past. Still, it is more eco-friendly than an earlier version of the bill that was supported by the rural lobby in Brazil¹s Congress. The Amazon rain forest covers a huge area, roughly half as large as the United States, with about 60% of it in Brazil. It is estimated that nearly a fifth of the Brazilian forest has been lost since 1970. Initially cleared by loggers, much of it was turned into pastures and farmlands as Brazil went from being a food importer to a global agricultural powerhouse.","Brazil¹s Congress postpones vote on controversial forest code for a week .

"(CNN) -- The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday it will look into alleged juror misconduct in the murder trial of Jason Young, a man convicted of beating his pregnant wife to death. Judge Donald Stephens requested the investigation after receiving information from employees of a TV station concerning Facebook posts by people who purported to know that a juror might have improperly discussed the trial with members of the public. ""In spite of the fact that this type of gossip is usually baseless, any information reported to the court that challenges the integrity of a jury verdict has to be investigated. The integrity of the court system is more important than any person, any case, or any verdict,"" he wrote in a letter addressed to the director of the SBI. N.C. Department of Justice spokeswoman Noelle Talley later said that the SBI would open an investigation. To his letter, Stephens attached a copy of the social media conversation in question, in which one post reads: ""My hairdresser is friends with a woman in the jury. She was supposedly texting her telling her how the vote was going."" If the allegations of juror misconduct prove true, they would also have to be shown to have had an impact on deliberations to affect the verdict, said Assistant District Attorney Howard Cummings. ""I still have all the faith in the jury,"" he said, characterizing the claims as unsubstantiated and ""just junk."" Months after his first trial ended in a hung jury, Young, 37, was convicted this week of first-degree murder. Jason Young convicted of beating pregnant wife to death . Michelle Young was discovered dead in 2006 in the bedroom of her Raleigh home. Her husband, Jason, first went on trial in June but a jury could not unanimously agree on a verdict. But that was not the case Monday, when several of Michelle Young's relatives embraced and wiped away tears after this jury's decision was announced. Afterward, Stephens ordered Young to be sentenced to life in prison without chance of parole. The defense had argued that intruders, and not the defendant, had killed Michelle Young. They pointed to what they described as holes in the prosecution's case -- including the lack of blood in Jason Young's car and on the jeans he supposedly wore the night his wife died.

"(CNN) -- ""Give the man his money."" That was the demand from Jerome Brown, my teammate when I played for the Philadelphia Eagles more than 20 years ago. It was a Saturday night and we were having one of our regular special team meetings, where we'd watch highlights from the previous week and review the big hits and plays. Jerome was calling for the $100 reward that a player had coming to him for an interception or forcing a fumble or, of course, the de-cleating big hit. It was 1988 and I was in the NFL that I was raised on. I dreamed about being a player in that highlight reel. In 1989, in the midst of my second year with the Eagles, we traded kicker Luis Zendejas to the Dallas Cowboys. Several weeks later we played the Cowboys in Dallas, and the night before the game I talked with Luis and reminded him ""to keep your head on a swivel."" He knew exactly what I was talking about. Days later, that game came to be known as the ""Bounty Bowl"" and our coach Buddy Ryan was accused of putting a bounty on his head. But it was nothing like that at all. No one player was targeted. The incentive was the big play that changed the game. The hit had to be a clean and legal hit. Cheap shots, late or illegal hits were not only disallowed, they were met with boos. The money on the back end was merely ceremonial. For players making league minimum, it became a part of their service, like a tip to a waiter. This was the NFL I grew up watching, and I was playing with guys I watched on TV as a child. It was the NFL that gave us ""Monsters of the Midway,"" the ""Purple People Eaters"" and the ""Steel Curtain."" Bloody knuckles and vicious hits were the script by which the raw, orchestrated violence of the NFL was sold. When the revelations of the bounty that players of the New Orleans Saints players had for their opponents became public, my first thought was the rate of inflation: $10,000 seemed excessive -- but so too does a $100 million dollar contract from someone of my generation. The big money makes the big hit seem more perverse. Still, the whole thing seems rather routine to me. I must admit that when I first retired from football I did not view it as a violent game. While I had been aware of our society's appetite for violent entertainment, the violence of the game remained inconsequential to the goal. But taking a step to the sidelines, I could now see the carnage of the game and modified my view. It's impossible to get past the reality of the way the game has grown. Big hits, big stages, big-time players and big salaries have characterized the growth of the game and its image. And, every player's contract is loaded with performance incentives that work to raise the level of competition. It seems to me that the coaches and players of the Saints were playing according to the model given. Listening to the indignation by the public and most especially the sports media world as they condemn the behavior of the Saints players and coaches, it's hard not to hear some hypocrisy. To be sure, the league has presented the game over the years as a show of hard knocks, where athlete warriors wage their fight. And, young athletes, like I was in the 1970's, grow up striving for that moment they make the highlight reel. The hits must be clean and the intent must never be to maim an opponent. However, as Tom Jackson of ESPN put it, the intent is to physically and psychologically ""damage"" a player with a hit. As someone who was often the one being hit, I understood that quite clearly. Today we are more aware of head injuries and the violent nature of football. But this game has never been sold as the ""two-hand touch"" most boys played in their youth. It's common knowledge that football is not a ""contact sport"" but a ""collision sport."" And, while we must do all we can to prevent injuries, we must also recognize the insatiable appetite we have for the violence -- and the subsequent reward, of admiration and dollars, we bestow on NFL players. We must also be honest about what we expect. This will not go away with admonishment from the media or sanctions from the league -- unless, of course, the media and the league stop promoting the violence and reward how the game is played when it presents it to the next generation. The tradition will not stop on a dime any more than a player can stop as he charges towards an opposing player at full speed. Every football player has heard the phrase ""reckless abandon."" That's the way we were raised to play. Donald McPherson is a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, a feminist and social justice educator.

"Managua, Nicaragua (CNN) -- Daniel Ortega marked the beginning of his third term as Nicaragua's president during an inauguration ceremony Tuesday -- an event both buoyed by his pledges of moderation and marred by months of discord over voter irregularities. The Nicaraguan leader pledged that his socialist government would continue efforts to promote peace and attack poverty. ""Savage capitalism, it is no longer possible. There is no space on this planet for savage capitalism,"" Ortega said in a wide-ranging inauguration speech that touched on a international events, including war in Afghanistan, last year's earthquake in Japan and the killing of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Shortly after taking his oath of office, Ortega hugged Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who were among a number of dignitaries at the ceremony. ""People have tried to give many interpretations to the visit of (Ahmadinejad). I think they still don't understand that it is necessary to look for an authentic path toward peace,"" Ortega said during his inauguration address, stressing that it was within Iran's right to use nuclear technology for energy needs. ""They cannot deny that right to any people,"" he said. Ahmadinejad's Latin American tour . Ortega is known as a Venezuela ally, had been a public supporter of Gadhafi and remains a stalwart U.S. critic. In his speech Tuesday, the Nicaraguan president decried Gadhafi's killing. ""A head of state in Libya was assassinated in the most brutal manner, with some television media basking in the crime. If there were accusations, it was logical to detain him,"" he said. Cable channels throughout the Central American nation were blocked during Tuesday's inauguration ceremony, which drew a crowd of thousands and was broadcast on national television. Since the country's November elections, Ortega, 66, has reached for the political middle, making overtures to the business class with promises of encouraging foreign investment. But his critics say they fear the former leftist revolutionary is looking to solidify Sandinista party control over state institutions and have pointed to reports of ballot fraud and voter intimidation. According to a report presented by the Organization of American States, irregularities included problems providing identification cards to vote, problems in the accreditation of observers and imbalances in political parties present at polling stations. Ortega, who fought against the U.S.-backed contras during the 1980s, won the country's elections in November with 64% of the vote, though subsequent protests and clashes have left several people dead. Nicaragua's constitution bars presidents from being re-elected, but that did not stop Ortega from running in his sixth straight presidential race. Ortega was first elected as president in 1985, and ran unsuccessfully in 1990, 1996 and 2001 before being elected again in 2006.

"London (CNN) -- He may be one of the most sought-after painters you have never heard of, but Emil Filla's name is doing the rounds of newsrooms and international art-loss registers following an audacious theft of his works from a collection in the Czech Republic. Four oil paintings by the Czech Cubist artist, who lived from 1882 until 1953, were stolen on November 18 from a collection at a castle in Peruc, northwest of Prague. The works, which date from the 1920s to the 1940s, are estimated to be worth between 50 million and 80 million Czech crowns (approximately $2.6 million and $4.2 million) according to the Art Newspaper. A spokesperson for the Art Loss Register, an international database of stolen and missing works of art and antiquities, confirmed the works were still registered as stolen on their database. Chris Marinello, Executive Director and General Counsel of the Art Loss Register, said that if any of the paintings were offered to the register's subscribing auction houses, they would be notified immediately. ""Either they are recovered relatively quickly or they will go underground and won't resurface for years,"" he said. The theft comes as interest in Filla's work is rising both in the Czech Republic and abroad. In November, a painting by the artist dating from 1911 and entitled ""Utesitel"" (""Comforter"" in English) was sold at an auction in Prague for 12 million Czech crowns (approximately $640,000), according to Galerie Art Praha, which staged the auction. A spokesperson for the gallery told CNN Filla is undoubtedly ""a major figure"" in avant-garde European painting, having exhibited across Europe and even in the U.S. between World Wars I and II, but has not had much exposure over the last 50 years. All that is changing, according to Czech art historian Vojtech Lahoda. ""Even though there are more collectors of Filla from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, there are more and more foreign collectors (interested in his work),"" he said. The reason may be down to his famous contemporaries, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Guillaume Apollinaire, whom Filla knew when he lived in Paris before World War I and who inspired him to adopt their Cubist style. According to Lahoda, his work presents ""the other face of Cubism, something that is very parallel (to French Cubism) but also different,"" and therefore increasingly sought-after by collectors of work from that style and period. ""It's very difficult to buy the original Cubist works of Picasso and Braque from the 1910s but you can still buy Filla's works from those years,"" said Lahoda. Though he cannot say whether the theft of Filla's paintings from the collection in Peruc is related to his recent upswing in popularity, Lahoda believes it may have been an opportunistic heist, with the thieves taking advantage of the collection's reportedly limited security. ""The Peruc case is a very strange one, because the paintings that were stolen are known, they were published in catalogs and journals, so I would say they are publicly unsellable,"" he said, echoing Marinello's fears they may go underground. Works by the artist are currently on display as part of an exhibition on Czech Modernism at the Gallery of Visual Art in Ostrava, Czech Republic, entitled ""Black Suns: Reverse Side of Modernity 1927--1945."" ""If you want a good collection of Czech modern art from the 1920s and 30s, you can't miss (Filla),"" said Lahoda.","Paintings by Czech artist Emil Filla stolen in audacious theft from collection near Prague .

"(OPRAH.com) -- If we could each pick a few songs to banish from our heads, Diana de Vegh would nominate all those soggy old refrains that say there's one -- and only one -- true love for each of us: our better half, our shining knight, the person we'll be lost without. That line of thought, says de Vegh, a therapist in private practice in New York, isn't benignly corny -- it's harmful, feeding what she calls the myth of love scarcity. ""In the scarcity model, where there's only one person out there, we're all competing for the guy who's rich and handsome,"" she says. Our relationships become fear based: We obsess and clutch instead of creating an environment in which two people try to unfold. Oprah.com: 4 ways to finally get through to your man . De Vegh, a casually elegant woman with penetrating blue eyes, meets with clients in her Greenwich Village office, where richly textured wall hangings, a deep purple sofa, and a fireplace give evidence of a delight in color and comfort as well as an assured originality. Her strong sense of self was hard-won: The reason she has thought so much about how we can separate romantic passion from the misconceptions that often surround it is that she's seen for herself how damaging they are. As a very young woman, de Vegh was swept into an affair with then president John F. Kennedy -- perhaps the ultimate fairy-tale prince. Her own experiences, and those of so many of the women she has counseled over the past 15 years, have sharpened her insights into the ways fantasy romance, rather than completing us, undoes us. ""Love is the ideological bone women have been thrown,"" she says, meaning that in our society, men often get the real power while women are fed the false promises of ""magic candy"" romance -- that someone special will shower us with attention, give us our identity, read our mind, and intuit our needs. ""Mind reading,"" she says, ""is useful between a mother and an infant but not in a sexual relationship between adults."" Oprah.com: Should you really tell him everything? When you want someone who can anticipate your thoughts and desires, you're really looking for an idealized parent -- usually a combination of Mommy and Daddy wrapped into one. ""For years, I was looking for men who would think I was charming and make me feel safe -- like Daddy's best girl,"" she says. The craving for that kind of attention is rampant. ""I see women all the time who say they're looking for romantic relationships, but I believe they're really looking to be parented. We all want to feel special and dear, with our foibles bathed in the loving glow of a doting father,"" she says. ""At the same time that we want Daddy's strong arms, we also want a mother's sweetness and tenderness."" And when the romance goes south, she says, you end up feeling like a child who's been abandoned and is lost. ""We all naturally fall in love with a handsome, married man -- our fathers,"" she says. ""They bring us out into the world. And if we're secure, we grow up to want something more interesting than parent-child love; we want an adult partnership."" But the precondition for that, she says, is a good relationship with ourselves. It's when you view yourself as powerless, with your worth dependent on how someone else treats you, that love gets corrupted, de Vegh says. ""Letting men determine who we are is the negative hinge that turns desire into vulnerability, changes our bodies from sites of pleasure to sites of betrayal, and transforms solitude into loneliness. I think that when people say they're lonely, what they're really saying is that they don't like their own company. And something should be done about that, because if you don't like your own company, then you're the victim of whoever passes by."" Oprah.com: 4 steps to healthy communication . De Vegh suggests we create abundant lives for ourselves, and subscribes to what she calls the salad theory. ""Just as a salad needs some lettuce, a little tomato, cucumber, this and that, a full life involves friends, work, arts, and community. When I ask clients, 'What do you believe you can only get from him?' they say, 'He's so interested, he listens to me, he thinks I'm special, we do things together.' We can do things with zillions of people. Why is it that only he can get you doing things? ""There's no scarcity of love,"" she says. ""We can find it with our coworkers, with our friends and families, in our dance class. We can love what the world offers us; we can love our own vitality. And without question, there can be passionate love between a man and a woman, where you open your heart and soul and you can be yourself -- your 7-year-old self, your 30-year-old self, your 60-year-old self. And he can say, 'I get you, and here I am. Sometimes I act like a spoiled brat, and sometimes I'm a straight-up guy.'"" But the relationship has to be an ""emotional peership"" between partners who are already working toward becoming fuller and fuller individuals. Such a union requires both heart and mind, which is why de Vegh is wary of unexamined attraction. ""Often what we call chemistry is a mix of familiarity and anxiety, and it can be an excuse for not having to think,"" she says. ""Feelings are great, but we also have brains so we can decide what to do with those feelings. Now when someone comes into my office and says, 'Oh, we looked at each other, and I so knew this man,' I think that maybe what she recognized was, for instance, the withholding narcissism of her father. ""If we really had such good parents that we felt filled up with self-respect and the ability to engage in the world, we wouldn't be waiting to be bowled over by chemistry. We'd be saying, 'Oh, you look like a good and interesting person. Here's what I think about the world; what do you think?' We wouldn't be looking to get our needs met. Adults meet their own needs."" Oprah.com: The art of self-exposure . Having seen so many women devastated by the end of an affair -- ""They feel they've failed, and that the halo they were given is gone"" -- de Vegh is adamant that we not label ourselves as losers in love. ""At the church I used to go to, they always said faith enters through a wound. I think wisdom comes through our wounds, that our wounds have to turn into our blessings,"" she says. ""They make us soft and aware so we can say, 'Oh, yes, I learned that.' If it turns out that you and your partner have a different view of reality, that's good to know. You can honor that, and find someone who shares your view. If you're losing yourself in a relationship and he has all the power, it's important to take the self-respecting action of leaving and learning from the experience."" The best thing that can happen after a breakup is that you declare, I give up any hope of ever being parented the way I wish I'd been when I was a child. ""You might have to grieve for that loss,"" she says. ""And there will be moments in a healthy partnership when you can say, 'I'm brain-dead and hysterical. Draw me a bath and put in some rubber duckies.'"" But that's temporary. We have to give up the longing to be the child in the relationship, she says. The good news is that once we do, we're free to find love that's genuinely pleasure based. ""We each have a potential song in us,"" de Vegh says -- one that can find its unique expression after we drop the sour chord of scarcity, dependency, and fear.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Drawings on the back of a Leonardo da Vinci painting may have been sketched by the Italian Renaissance artist, but only more tests by museum experts will tell. Experts from the Louvre are carrying out tests on the painting. The Department of Paintings at the Louvre Museum in Paris and restoration and research experts from the Museums of France discovered the images this year on the back of the painting ""The Virgin and Child with St. Anne,"" the Louvre said in a news release Thursday. The style of the sketches resembles that of da Vinci, but the experts said closer examinations must be done to confirm they are his. After the art experts began studying the circa 1500 painting, an oil on wood, a conservator from the Paintings Department discovered two barely visible drawings on the back of it -- a horse's head and a partial skull. Closer scrutiny also revealed another sketch showing the infant Jesus with a lamb. The drawings, almost impossible to see with the human eye, were photographed with an infrared reflectographic camera, to reveal the underdrawings. The technique intensifies the degree of absorption of certain pigments, such as those that are carbon-based, which was the preferred material used for preparatory drawings during da Vinci's era. According to the experts, drawings on the back of paintings is ""extremely rare,"" and none have been found so far that can be attributed to da Vinci.","Three sketches found under Leonardo da Vinci painting .

"London (CNN) -- We may not immediately equate the activities of archaeologists to trash sifting. Or imagine that the glass-encased artifacts in museums might be one-time refuse. But quite often, this is exactly the case. Studying ancient trash from around the world gives archaeologists and historians the chance to understand the habits that defined people's daily lives, said Dr. Richard Meadow, Director of the Peabody Museum's Zooarchaeology Laboratory and Senior Lecturer on Anthropology at Harvard University. It may not be glamorous but, he said, ""much of what archaeology knows about the past comes from trash, if trash is defined as the products of human consumption. Trash is a proxy for human behavior."" The Peabody Museum is staging a series of talks and events, entitled Trash Talk: The Anthropology of Waste until Spring 2012, on the importance of trash to our understanding of human behavior, both in the past and now. Meadow, who has excavated sites including the ancient Indus city of Harappa in present-day Pakistan, has gleaned much from studying centuries-old trash. Early dumping grounds, or ""middens,"" are often archaeological and anthropological gold-mines, he said, not just for what can be found there but for what they tell us about ancient civilizations, what they consumed and how they organized their urban space to deal with their waste. ""The way that ancient cities used to grow and change through time is actually very much related to the evolution of trash,"" Meadow explained. Ancient people, he said, quite literally lived with their trash, usually dumping it in the streets outside their homes when it wasn't collected and deposited in special pits. Sometimes, he said, whole cities would be filled with trash, to the point where the street levels would rise, submerging homes and forcing people to build on top of it. While this might sound revolting and unhygienic to us now, ancient peoples, said Meadow, became acclimatized to it. And they were at least adept at recycling their trash. ""I think almost all civilizations recycled in one way or another,"" Meadow said, explaining that ancient peoples across the world would recycle organic matter as fuel, while inorganic refuse would be used to build the foundations of a house. Precious metals, he said, would be melted down and re-shaped for a variety of tools. ""It's only when you get to the modern period of consumerism that you get this culture of obsolescence,"" he said. Dr. Jose Remesal Rodriguez is a professor of Ancient History at the University of Barcelona and an expert in the social and economic history of the Roman Empire, with a special interest in the production and trade of food in the ancient world. He is the director of excavations at an ancient dump site in Rome called Monte Testaccio. An artificial hill composed of more than 25 million discarded Roman amphorae -- or vase-shaped containers -- it tells us much about the ancient Roman trade in olive oil, which these amphorae were used to transport. ""A dump can be a particularly interesting source (for finding out) about the daily life (and) development of the civilization that created it,"" said Remesal. From the shards found at Monte Testaccio, he said, archaeologists were able to trace the evolution of food policy in the Roman Empire. ""Testaccio is a very special dump, which gives us information about a concrete product -- olive oil -- and the relations between the capital of the Empire and one of its provinces,"" Remesal explained. This prizing of ancient trash may seem at odds with our attitudes to waste today. But according to Meadow, scientists are already at work studying our trash and what it says about us. He cites as an example American archaeologist William Rathje, director of the ""Garbage Project"" in Arizona, which has sifted through and studied garbage from 1973 to the present day. ""Some amazing statistics have come out of this -- how much food gets thrown out in the trash that was probably OK to eat, and other things hardly used that were thrown away,"" said Meadow. ""It's an incredible array of material,"" he concluded. Dr Richard Meadow will give a lecture entitled 'The archaeologist's view of trash' at the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology on October 6.","Ancient trash is an important resource for archaeologists .
Trash pits or ""middens"" tell us much about the daily life of our forebears, according to archaeologists .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- In a city slashed by war, a tiger fights for life. Osama, a Siberian tiger at the Tripoli Zoo, has been suffering for days. He is on his side, breathing shallowly, his huge paws motionless -- caramel, black-and-white-striped fur covered with flies that he is too weak to brush off. A team of animal-welfare experts from Austria's Four Paws International gently rolls the tiger over and Dr. Amir Khalil, dripping sweat, searches for a vein, then puts in an IV drip to give the animal vitamins. Asked why the tiger is so sick, the veterinarian replies, ""Honestly, we don't know but I believe he's old, 21 years. That's number one. Number two, it was a lot of stress in the surroundings here."" During the struggle for Tripoli, gunfire raged just outside the zoo. When the fighting was at its height some Libyans packed up their cars and fled. The animals at the Tripoli Zoo didn't have that option. The deafening sounds of shooting, the acrid smell of battle -- there was no respite for these sensitive creatures. Shells still litter the zoo grounds. As the zoo's director, Dr. Abdulfatah Husni, leads a CNN crew to the mammal house, he points out bullet casings on the sidewalk. ""This is for Kalashnikov. You know Kalashnikov?"" he asks, referring to automatic rifles. In the mammal house, the roof is marred by a a gaping hole blasted by a rocket propelled grenade. Luckily, no animal died or was injured. For two weeks there was no water in much of Tripoli. For the hippos at the zoo, it was a disaster. The huge, stolid animals stand forlornly by their almost-empty pool, now slowly being filled with water from a large hose. Husni says that during the worst of it, the animals had to drink whatever water remained but they could not swim, as they usually do. The staff had to sprinkle them with what water remained to keep their tough skins moist. ""They're shiny now,"" he says. Even as fighters shot it out on the streets near the zoo, 15 members of the staff came in every day to feed and water the animals, risking their own lives; if they hadn't, many of the animals would have died within three to four days, Husni says. In the tiger house, meanwhile, the animal rescue team still struggles to save Osama the tiger. Dr. Khalil rushed here from Vienna to help after seeing CNN reports about the fate of these animals. He grows more quiet as his efforts seem to have little effect. ""He's finished,"" he finally whispers, acknowledging that the tiger has died. ""It was too late."" The Tripoli Zoo, originally opened in 1986, was under major reconstruction when the revolution broke out. Without the fighting, it was scheduled to be completed in May. But the South Korean construction company working on the project pulled out because of security concerns, Husni says. He hopes the project will continue and says the new anti-Gadhafi transitional leaders pledge to give the zoo support. There will be exchanges with zoos around the world, he says, something that stopped during the Gadhafi regime. He will be able to attend conferences around the world, to learn new techniques of protecting animals in captivity. And, he predicts, the zoo will welcome new animals unscarred by war.","Animal experts from Austria saw CNN reports on the Tripoli Zoo and rushed to help .

"(Southern Living) -- On a bright Big Bend afternoon in far-west Texas, I steer myself along a high-desert, two-lane highway, tufts of dried-up tumbleweed thistle packed like snow against barbed-wire fences. The sky above opens up its cobalt tent; the space beneath stretches as far as an ocean. Rugged landscapes and wide-open spaces inspire artists and visitors in West Texas. U.S. 90 leads me through the Davis Mountains and ocotillo-and-cactus flats to Marfa, Alpine and Marathon, a string of three Big Bend towns just 60 miles apart. Here they live as siblings in a remote, starkly beautiful landscape as mysterious to me as Mars. ""Driving from Dallas, we often joke, 'Who would put a town out here? And who would live in it?'"" says Marfa wood artist Camp Bosworth. ""And we realize, well, us."" Far-off inspiration . It's hard to believe inspiration can come in so far-off and austere a place, but it's all around you. Marfa, Alpine and Marathon sit along U.S. 90 like hitching posts. On first glance, the three are all Mayberrys of another era. Marfa's one blinking red light; the Alpine Dairy Queen and Big Bend Saddlery; Marathon's three blocks of storefronts facing the railroad. But I visit in search of the defining quality that draws people 400 miles west of San Antonio to live and to visit. I'm looking for the real towns, what makes them so alluring and freeing, to ""slow down and see,"" as Bosworth describes. As one New York transplant to Marfa tells me, ""Good things come with space."" Vintage and vogue . Bosworth introduces himself on my first night in Marfa at the opening of a gas-station-turned-folk-art-gallery called Yard Dog. The two rooms of Yard Dog glow in the pitch-black stillness of the nearly 2,000-person town. Inside, the scene teems with locals, some who look like Willie Nelson, some like Brooklyn hipsters, all toasting yet another gallery émigré. Bosworth, who moved to the Big Bend eight years ago, wears a canvas Carhartt jacket and black designer eyeglasses, a stylish mix of rancher and Warhol seen all over Marfa. We step outside. ""Out here you can just breathe,"" he says, referring to the whole Big Bend, where Texas leans toward the Rio Grande and Mexico reaches back. ""That constant push to do is gone. And instantly at night, there are a million stars. In the openness you suddenly feel creative."" SouthernLiving.com: Marfa Travel Planner . True cowboys ride bikes . In Marfa, vintage bicycles replace horses. Bosworth himself owns more than 10 throwback Schwinns and Flyers. After a night's sleep at the Thunderbird Hotel, a motor court revamped with minimalist looks (and record players), I rise early and pedal through town on a hotel bike. I pass the high school, the silver water tower, and the pinkish 1886 Presidio County courthouse -- all signs of Big Bend normalcy. Large cherry red letters mark one gorgeous white building -- JUDD -- near Maiya's, a sleek Italian cafe, and down from the hacienda-like Hotel Paisano. I stop near the single flashing signal by Marfa Book Company and Marfa Public Radio, where NPR programs mix with station manager Tom Michael's local news and interviews. Food Shark . Late morning, the Food Shark, an aluminum-body gourmet lunch truck, rolls into town and parks near the tracks, where honey-colored benches and tables sit under the farmers market pavilion. Jack the dog roams around while folks buy Mediterranean dishes from the Food Shark, manned by a friendly couple, Adam and Krista. Savoring open space . From my chickpea Marfalafel basket, it's off to the Chinati Foundation, a former army base filled with art installations by Donald Judd and his contemporaries. Judd, whose work has had tremendous influence on modern sculpture, began buying land south of Marfa and buildings in town in the 1970s for preservation purposes as well as his own use. He savored Marfa's open space. High desert inspiration . Of the highway town trio, Alpine is the busy one, where outliers visit for dry cleaning, a pharmacy, an Amtrak pickup station or the largest grocery. Alpine's thriving liberal arts university Sul Ross State looks down on the town, which, like its neighbor communities, lives at nearly mile-high elevation. Sweet aromas in the mountain-fresh air pull locals to Judy's Bread and Breakfast, where folks pass the paper over homemade cinnamon rolls. Even as a passerby, I get warm looks that say pull up a chair. SouthernLiving.com: Alpine Travel Planner . Makin' it rattle . A block down Holland Avenue at Kiowa Gallery, the spirited Keri Artzt greets me at the door, as colorfully dressed as the walls in her place. ""You don't come to Alpine for a mall fix,"" Peggy Martin, a nine-year employee, says. ""But we can make it rattle if we need to."" In a town of painted murals -- I see several driving from Kiowa to the Big Bend Saddlery -- Alpineers draw from the same creative wellspring as do its sister towns. Listen to the music . As the sun curves to its peak, Alpine steals a few hours from winter, and guitar-maker Michael Stevens wipes a bead of sweat off his brow. Living on 10 acres just south of town, his workshop window faces uninterrupted miles of native grasses and wispy clouds. His completed instruments, shiny and perfect, hang inside. You'd swear laser-guided machines made the guitars. The craft is astounding. Jackrabbits can talk . Back in town, comic strip artist Chris Ruggia opens his small studio with pleasure. ""Jack,"" his cartoon ode to the ecology of the vast Big Bend wilderness, stars kangaroo rats, jackrabbits and coyotes. ""It's such an emphatic region,"" the quiet man says. ""As an artist, you really respond to it."" Guided by biologists from The Nature Conservancy and Sul Ross, interpreters from Big Bend National Park and his own wandering eye, Ruggia's more than 40 ""Jack"" online episodes bring art and the landscape side-by-side. Long way home . In the couple of days I've spent traveling around these three towns, I've found the rolling drive between places to be quite calming. Peggy Martin at Kiowa Gallery said I would. ""This is a healing place,"" she says, ""because people have time."" From Alpine, I tune into KRTS-FM:93.5, the region's community station, letting the midday classical hour play sound track to the passing miles of sage brush, desert willow and limestone rises. Welcome to Marathon . Thirty miles flash by as a cello player finishes a piece that sounds like strings singing through the radio. Marathon (population 455) is by far the smallest of the three. For days, people in Marfa and Alpine have mentioned two mainstays in Marathon over and over: the Gage Hotel and photographer James Evans. SouthernLiving.com: Marathon Travel Planner . Worth a thousand words . ""The landscape is like a relative now,"" Evans tells me, lounging on a leather chair in his highway photo gallery. Window-size, silver gelatin prints of his ""800,000-acre backyard,"" as he calls Big Bend, hang in the serene, wood-planked room. Evans lights up when I ask about the vistas surrounding us, where the onetime Gage Hotel cook has spent 20 years documenting the region. ""When I first go back, I usually start on old River Road,"" he says about his journeys from Marathon into the rough country. He describes a flashing creek photographed by moonlight on a 30-minute exposure, much the way Ansel Adams shot Yosemite; floating through the Santa Elena Canyon; and how he hikes to spots by dusk so he can wake up there. ""I could shoot this area forever."" Whispering memories . This brief moment with Evans is telling. The photographer's eyes drift off. His voice softens. And he's gone away somewhere miles from this room. His 60,000 photos of the Big Bend must carry countless memories, unspoken things that act as muse and healer both. I find myself remembering this as night falls over Marathon. A fire crackles in my Gage Hotel room, while the fountain in the courtyard slowly begins succumbing to a sinking chill. Outside, I stand in the cold, looking up over the adobe walls at a sky full of stars, believing these places have whispered to me as well.

"(Oprah.com) -- Like most of us, you've probably heard of graphic novels -- but haven't read too many. Here are four new titles (plus one classic) that make you think, feel and daydream just like any other book. What It Is . One of the most moving and emotionally direct forms of the whole graphic genre is the memoir -- in part because it allows for all kinds of inventive approaches to telling life stories, such as using the drawings to show how people look and feel to the writer (a huge, tall, monstery dad, for example). It also helps to have thoughtful, deeply poignant writing, which is exactly what you'll find in Lynda Barry's ""What It Is."" This memoir of a young artist came out in 2008, but it's the one to start with if you've never read a graphic book before. (Note: Graphic novels can be novels, memoirs, biographies or anything in between.) Barry uses text, drawings and even collages to re-create her violent, TV-saturated childhood, describing how she used art as her way out of the trailer park. ""We don't create a fantasy world to escape reality,"" she says. ""We create it to be able to stay."" Discouraged at every turn by her parents and teachers, she grew into an adult who felt that she had little to say creatively and, further, that she couldn't say that little well enough. That is, until she rediscovered an imaginary game from childhood, one that required her simply to sit very still in the corner of a room and wait for inanimate objects (say, the pattern on the wallpaper) to come ""alive"" and move. The magic of that moment and of all Barry's self-examinations is that her ideas apply to just about everybody. We've all had those moments when we think we're not good enough or original enough. Her transformation belongs to all of us. Oprah.com: How to Tame Your Overstuffed Bookshelves in 48 Hours . Big Questions . ""Big Questions"" is just what a novel should be, if by novel we mean a very long story that creates an entire imaginary universe that involves us so deeply that we begin to think of ourselves as characters within it. The book is 585 pages long (not including appendixes), a number that might seem overwhelming in a traditional format. In this case, you'll finish in two days, not only because graphic novels contain a lot less text but also because you'll race through the first time, desperate to figure out the big stuff, only to turn around and reread it in order to figure out all the little stuff you missed. The story takes place in an anonymous bucolic countryside (trees, fields, the occasional house) and follows a flock of birds, each with its own personality and philosophical struggles, from questioning the monotony of a seed diet to wondering about the true perils of snakes to considering ""to what extent are we responsible for the fulfillment of our destinies?"" Life goes on in this manner -- think, peck, think, peck -- until an undetonated bomb drops into their lives, a bomb that many (but not all) in the flock believe is a long, warm metal egg that may contain a savior baby bird. The hilarity and discord that result will astonish you, as will the pathos. Some of the most poignant scenes concern two humans -- an elderly caretaker and her mentally disabled grandson or son -- who are watched by the birds. Nilsen's artwork here needs no words. The endless labor of the old woman -- firewood, dishes, scrub the floor, soak the dentures, weep in secret -- is drawn into brutal reality, as is her unexpected beauty. The six-panel homage to her brushing the long, young-looking hair you never knew she had (it's usually tied in a bun) is, like the rest of the book, an unforgettable visual and emotional experience. Oprah.com: 14 Ways to Have a Successful Book Club . Radioactive . Though National Book Award nominee ""Radioactive"" is ostensibly a biography of Madame Curie, its real allure is romance. Twenty-four-year-old Marie Sklodowska travels to Paris from Warsaw and finds work in the laboratory of Pierre Curie, studying the relationship between heat and magnetism. The attraction is not just between molecules, however, and soon the scientists fall in love and marry. They go on, of course, to make incredible leaps and bounds in the world of science, discovering the elements polonium and radium. In this poignant tale of discovery and passion, Lauren Redniss also examines the greater question of nuclear proliferation through the lens of the couple's work, proving that their research is more than relevant today. A collage of different media, the artwork in the book includes drawings, as well as an electric blue background wash created by a process called cyanotype printing, in which light-sensitive chemicals soaked into paper become intensely bright when subjected to UV rays from the sun. Redniss feels the technique ""captured on the page what Marie Curie called radium's 'spontaneous luminosity.'"" Oprah.com: First Novels That May Help You Change Your Life in 2012 . I'll Be Dead by the Time You Read This . Technically, ""I'll Be Dead by the Time You Read This: The Existential Life of Animals"" isn't a graphic novel or even a graphic short story collection. Maybe it's best described as a graphic poetry collection: When Alaeff adds a line of dialogue to his stand-alone illustrations of a cat or jellyfish or ram, he creates something more resonant than a caption. The key to understanding (and laughing and going ""Ouch!"" with recognition at) these creations is reading the introduction, in which Alaeff describes how he collected bits of overheard conversations between his fellow humans. These verbal snippets, which sounded ""bittersweet if not downright tragic,"" led him to think it was ""a bit absurd that we regularly torture ourselves with thoughts that seem at odds with our well-being."" And so he attached them as bubbles over the heads of nonhumans. Thus, a bear will mournfully say, ""Everyone seems so young all of a sudden,"" or a so-called proud lion will tell himself, ""I need to shut up."" One of the marvels of the book is that the more you read, the more you smile, and then -- bam! -- suddenly you're wondering if you're the cheetah or the snail. My advice: Identify with the bumblebee who claims, ""I know there's happiness in me somewhere."" Oprah.com: The Best Fiction of 2011 . Moby-Dick in Pictures . Don't mistake this gorgeous and wholly original book for a blow-by-blow comic-book-style retelling of ""Moby-Dick."" What artist Matt Kish has done is create one drawing for and inspired by each page of Melville's 552-page masterpiece (for the record, the Signet Classics version). The result is less a story and more a cabinet of visual and literary curiosities. Each image -- rendered in ink, colored pencil or paint -- is accompanied by a single exquisite line from the novel, such as ""But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angel's face"" or ""Thus, while in life the great whale's body may have been a real terror to his foes, in death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a world."" Only the most devoted ""Moby-Dick"" fans will need to read the whole creation sequentially. The rest of us will dip in and out, enjoying the interplay of the insanely beautiful words and images (my favorite, on page 346, is an anatomical drawing of a whale in vivid reds, blues and black) and examining the connection between the two. The most solid and compelling narrative may actually be in the introduction, in which Kish describes not only his lifelong love for the original novel but also his lack of formal artistic education and the only place he had to work, ""a closet that measures about three feet wide by six deep"" inside of which he made 500 drawings. Even if you don't enjoy the book, let it sit on your coffee table as testament to what all of us human beings can do if we stick with it -- and believe in the great white whale of what we are doing.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen holds a presidential election Tuesday with only one candidate on the ballot to replace longtime ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh. Vice President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi took over Yemen's government in November, when Saleh handed over power after months of protests. Though Hadi will be the only name on the ballot on Tuesday, he has insisted on standing for election to make his presidency official. Posters of Hadi with slogans such as ""A new president for a new Yemen"" have gradually replaced images of his predecessor. But some of those who took part in the protests that drove Saleh from power after 33 years say they're not particularly excited about Tuesday's vote. ""Maybe you can call them elections,"" said Nadia Abdullah, an activist in Change Square, the epicenter of the anti-Saleh movement. ""But for me, elections should have more than one candidate."" The 65-year-old Hadi is a British-, Egyptian- and Soviet-trained army officer, recently promoted to the rank of field marshal. He has served as vice president since 1994 and is running for a two-year term as president on pledges of improving security and creating more jobs. But he's never had much of a power base of his own, and Yemen's problems will take much longer to fix than the two-year mandate he's expected to receive. It's the poorest country in the Middle East, with a severe shortage of water and rising levels of malnutrition among its population of about 25 million. Even before last year's upheaval, Saleh faced a separatist movement in the south, sectarian tensions in its north and the growing presence of what Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. For some, particularly in the once-independent south, Hadi is too closely tied to Saleh's rule to represent any change. ""Why do people expect southerners to celebrate that Saleh is gone?"" Mohammed Mosed Okla, a prominent separatist leader in the southern port of Aden, told CNN. ""His regime is still in control, and his family still control all the major security factions in the country. We will not be tricked again, and southerners will not celebrate until complete change takes place in south Yemen."" There was heavy security in Aden for the vote, with at least 10 new checkpoints had been set up around the city. Explosions rocked four separate neighborhoods late Monday, with gunfire reported in one following the blast, but security officials told CNN that no injuries had been reported. Explosions reported ahead of Yemen vote . Hussein al-Aqil, a professor at Aden University and another separatist leader, said Hadi watched as Saleh ""oppressed us for more than two decades."" ""I was imprisoned for three years because I expressed my opinion and rejected the corruption that Ali Saleh stood behind,"" al-Aqil said. ""The old regime tortured me and made me suffer for years. Hadi is part of the old regime, and will not be recognized as a southern leader."" But in Sanaa, Abdullah says Yemen's people are looking to Hadi to start the political reforms needed to save the country. ""If he goes through with it, we will stand hand-in-hand with him,"" she said. ""If he doesn't, or if we see a lot of game-playing between him and the government, I believe the youth will remain in the squares. They would say, 'Leave,' as they did to Ali Abdullah Saleh."" Saleh handed over power to Hadi as part of a deal brokered by Persian Gulf states and will formally relinquish his office after Tuesday's vote. He is now now seeking medical treatment in the United States for wounds suffered in a June assassination attempt at his presidential palace during weeks of street battles between government troops and tribal fighters. The United States, meanwhile, has been backing Yemeni efforts against al Qaeda and has periodically struck targets inside Yemen, as in the September drone strike that killed American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. Gerald Feierstein, the U.S. ambassador to Yemen, told CNN that the transition laid out in the Gulf plan as well as efforts to boost the economy and deliver basic services will be critical ""in terms of our ability to defeat al Qaeda and other violent extremist organizations in the country. ""All of these elements are going to help us defeat al Qaeda and eliminate them as a threat here in Yemen, to the region and to the world,"" Feierstein said. But for patrons in one Sanaa cafe, a bit of normalcy would be welcome. One man said Hadi's first objective should be to ""repair all the damage that was caused by the recent upheavals -- like the electricity crisis, like the gas crisis and all the crises in the country in general."" Journalist Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report for CNN.","Longtime leader Saleh's vice president is the sole candidate on the ballot .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Even the most banal question is met with an amusing and thought-provoking response from Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie, the two quipsters behind ""Flight of the Conchords."" Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie are a struggling musical duo in ""Flight of the Conchords."" ""What's your favorite color?"" went an innocuous query. ""Transparent,"" replied  Clement. ""Umm ... bluish-red,"" said McKenzie. Wait, isn't that ... purple? No matter. Absurd comedy comes as easily to the duo as useless advice flows from Murray, their always-dressed-in-brown band manager (played by Rhys Darby) on their hit HBO program. Five minutes in an elevator, a hallway, or an interview room with Clement and McKenzie, and a scene worthy of inclusion on the show effortlessly unfolds.  Watch the group talk about the price of fame » . Of course the native New Zealanders possess more smarts than their on-screen personas, two scrappy, clueless musicians trying -- and failing miserably -- to break into the music business in New York City. But the resemblance is as clear as the giant, idolizing blue eyes of their lone fan, Mel (Kristen Schaal). ""Most of the stories are based on things that happened to us,"" says McKenzie. ""We take one element, and then we kind of exaggerate it or twist it."" Consider the series' second episode of the new season (which started earlier this month), where Bret and Jemaine squabbled over Bret's ""extravagant"" purchase of a new coffee mug (it cost $2.79). Could a similar scenario have played out when the pair lived together as university students in their homeland more than 10 years ago? ""We were very poor,"" recalls Clement. ""Sometimes in our flat we would have so little money that we were trying to think of schemes, like how can we make some money today so that we can have some dinner."" With the economy taking a turn for the worst in recent months, ""Flight of the Conchords"" now seems more relevant. ""We basically never set out to have the show be a credit crunch show,"" says co-executive producer and co-creator James Bobin. ""But it seems the world has caught up with us."" And CNN caught up with Clement and McKenzie (Bobin, too) to talk about writing silly songs, the sweet tooth of success and to find out why Aussies -- such as CNN's interviewer -- are always in the cross hairs. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: The show is a big hit around the world. Do you consider yourselves worthy cultural ambassadors for New Zealand? Jemaine Clement: I think in some ways our characters are typical of New Zealanders. New Zealand has a reputation as being one of the most boring peoples of the world. You don't know of that? CNN: I wouldn't agree with that. Bret McKenzie: Friendly. I think they're famous for being friendly. Clement: Well, I've heard boring. CNN: As an Australian, I would like to know why you make fun of Australians so much. McKenzie: Because we find them funny. Clement: We've toured in Australia and ... it always struck me when we went out to lunch with people how many times we would be made fun of because of our accents. So we stored up all that resentment and we waited years ... McKenzie: And unleashed it. Clement: We're giving it back to the Australians who made fun of us. CNN: James, what is it like to work with these two? James Bobin: It's a pleasure, obviously. We've been friends for years now. ... The show's incredibly hard work because obviously we do music and comedy at the same time and that's quite a challenge. But they're both very hardworking so it makes it easy. CNN: What's it like on set? I imagine when the cameras start rolling that a lot of what happens is improvised. Bobin: To a certain degree, yeah. We have a script that we like ... so we obviously try to nail that first. And from that position we just play with it a little bit and see where we go. Especially with Rhys, because Rhys is such a brilliant improviser and these guys and Rhys do so well together in those scenes in the band meetings. Often they go way off script. Clement: Yeah, we try and write the script with parts that we know we can improvise off. So we leave some things open-ended. McKenzie: It's between 17 and 18 percent improvised. Clement: But this interview is a hundred percent. CNN: A lot of the musical numbers from the first season you had in stock before you even made the TV show ... Clement: The songs in the second season are not worse than the songs in the first season. CNN: That wasn't going to be my question! How challenging was it to come up with a whole new set of songs? Clement: Well, I think that was the fun part of the show because playing music is fun. Bobin: Also, we had some stories in mind so this time round we could write songs to fit with the stories -- which was kind of nice because last year it was a bit harder to squeeze the songs into a storyline. It just made for very strange situations. Clement: Yeah, and having the songs in the beginning sometimes leads to boring storylines because all the songs are about girls. So when we have a whole lot of storylines about girls our episodes have to be about girls. So we could go off that a bit this time. CNN: How confident are you both in your abilities as musicians? McKenzie: 24 to 27 percent. Clement: I'm 24. He's 27. McKenzie: Combined we're mediocre. CNN: How are you enjoying the fame that's come from the success? McKenzie: Oh it's lovely. You get free desserts. CNN: Just free desserts? McKenzie: Free drinks. Sometimes some free shoes. Clement: Sometimes people invade your privacy. McKenzie: Strangers talk to you. Clement: But balanced against the free desserts, it evens out. CNN: Have you encountered any Mel-like fans? McKenzie: A lot of fans like to come up and say they're the real Mel. Or ""you've actually got two fans."" CNN: Did you know someone who was like Murray? Is he based on a friend or a stereotype? Clement: In some ways, our real manager in New Zealand. McKenzie: She's very maternal. I think Murray's quite a maternal figure. Clement: She gives us lists that are overly detailed. And when we were going to a new country she'd be very worried for our safety. Not that long ago Tenacious D [Jack Black's band] came to New Zealand and we were asked to open for them, and she didn't know who they were, even though they're the biggest musical comedy act ever. And that carries through to Murray. CNN: How surprised were you by the success of the show? McKenzie: I'm surprised by the diversity of the fans. Like there are people who are our age, which makes sense, and then there are people in their 70s who love the show. And then there are children who love the show. There's a scene in the show where I watch television in a box. I get a box sent over from New Zealand. And my friend's son, he watches TV sitting in a box. And he's 9. It's great. HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.","""Flight of the Conchords"" is offbeat musical-comedy duo and HBO series .

"(CNN) -- Penn State has hired a new permanent coach to head its embattled football program, with the team's quarterback saying that he and other players are ""excited"" for a ""fresh start."" Matt McGinn told CNN affiliate WBRE that he hopes the selection of New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien will help ""erase some of the things that have happened in the past year."" ""It should be exciting for everyone,"" said McGinn, acknowledging that some Penn State alumni have voiced dissatisfaction with the move since O'Brien didn't attend the State College school. ""The most important thing is that the players are happy."" O'Brien replaces interim coach Tom Bradley and, more significantly, iconic former coach Joe Paterno. Paterno was fired by school trustees last fall, days after his former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky was arrested and accused of sexually abusing young boys over a 14-year period. That includes a 2002 incident. Former Penn State graduate assistant Mike McQueary has testified that he saw Sandusky possibly sodomizing a boy, saying that what he saw was ""extremely sexual in nature."" He told Paterno, who told then-athletic director Tim Curley, according to a grand jury report. Law enforcement authorities, however, didn't become aware of that allegation until years later. According to his biography on Patriots.com, the NFL team's official website, the Nittany Lions' new football coach grew up in Dorchester, Massachusetts, and attended Brown University. He began his coaching career at that Ivy League school, before going on to take jobs at Georgia Tech, Maryland and Duke. He joined the Patriots in 2007 as a coaching assistant, rapidly rising up the ranks in the subsequent years. ""The Penn State football program has a great legacy and has contributed enormously to our university community,"" said university President Rodney A. Erickson. ""A program of this caliber requires a special kind of leader -- a leader who will embrace that legacy and maintain the university's commitment to excellence on the field and in the classroom. We have that leader in Coach O'Brien, and I look forward to working with him in his new role.""","Bill O'Brien is hired at Penn State's next football coach .

"London (CNN) -- Voice mails left by Paul McCartney for his then-girlfriend Heather Mills were illegally accessed and heard by a former employee of a major British newspaper group, Mills told an independent investigation into press ethics Thursday. The former Beatle left about 25 messages for her one night in 2001, including one where he sang to her, as he tried to make up with her after a quarrel, she said. ""One of them said, 'Please forgive me,' and he sang a little ditty of one of his songs onto the voice mail,"" said Mills. The former Trinity Mirror group employee later phoned her and said he had heard her voice mail. She responded angrily, she testified before the Leveson Inquiry, saying there was no way he could have heard the message unless he had obtained it illegally. Mills said the man laughed, and she said she told him: ""I promise you, if you report this story, even if it's true, you have obtained the information illegally, and I will do something about it."" ""And he never reported the story,"" she added. The inquiry is not releasing the name of the person who heard the message because he is under police investigation, said Robert Jay, the chief counsel to the Inquiry. But it was not a Daily Mirror journalist or anyone working under the supervision of its then-editor, Piers Morgan, Jay said. Morgan now hosts a CNN talk show, ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The voice mail in question was a critical point when Morgan testified in December before the Leveson Inquiry. The probe was set up in response to widespread anger in Britain at the revelation that a murdered 13-year-old girl's phone was hacked by journalists in search of stories -- and that many other crime and terror victims, politicians and celebrities had also been targeted. Rupert Murdoch's News of the World tabloid has been the focus of much of the anger, and Murdoch's son James ordered it shut down over the scandal. But accusations have been leveled against other newspapers as well, including the Daily Mirror. Testifying in December, Morgan said he did not believe phone hacking had taken place when he was editor of the tabloid, prompting Jay to follow up: ""You don't believe so or you are sure?"" ""I don't believe so,"" Morgan responded by video link. Jay pressed Morgan particularly hard about his having written in 2006 that he had heard a message McCartney left for Mills, trying to make up after a quarrel and singing to her. Morgan refused to say who played the message for him or where, but he admitted under sustained questioning that he believed it was a voice mail. ""Did you know that was unethical?"" Jay demanded. ""Not unethical, no. It doesn't necessarily follow that it was unethical,"" Morgan said, insisting he would not ""go down a trail that will lead to the identification of a source."" On Thursday, Mills said she had never authorized Morgan to access her voice mail or to listen to a recording of it. ""Never, ever,"" she said. She said she had never made a recording of any of the messages. ""No, no. They were deleted pretty much straight away,"" she said. Brian Leveson, the judge leading the inquiry, intervened to ask if she had ever authorized anyone to listen to her voice mail. ""No,"" she said. Mills and McCartney divorced in 2008. Morgan has said in the past that he has never hacked a voice mail and vigorously denied ever ordering phone hacking. Morgan said Thursday, ""I have nothing further to add to the evidence I gave to the Leveson Inquiry."" The publisher of the defunct News of the World paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds Wednesday to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians, including former Tony Blair spokesman Alastair Campbell. Piers Morgan is a former editor the News of the World, but left in 1995 -- about seven years before the Milly Dowler hacking -- and went to the Mirror, which he edited until 2004. With Wednesday's settlements, News Group Newspapers has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it. But former child singing star Charlotte Church, who has testified publicly about the damage phone hacking did to her personal life, has refused to settle. Her case is expected to go to court as soon as this month. In addition to the Leveson Inquiry, police are carrying out three separate investigations into elements of the scandal: phone hacking, e-mail hacking, and police bribery. Two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal. Both James and Rupert Murdoch, as well as senior executives at News International, have testified before British lawmakers examining allegations of wrongdoing. There have been 13 arrests in connection with Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan Police investigation into bribery of police officers by journalists. There have been 17 arrests in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone-hacking inquiry. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. No one has been charged. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Jonathan Wald contributed to this story.","Heather Mills says a journalist called her, having heard the voice mail .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN) -- A grassroots activist, a head of state and a symbol of the Arab Spring. Three women -- two who struggled in an African nation plagued by bloody civil war and a third who stood up to absolute dictatorship -- were bestowed with the Nobel Peace Prize Saturday. That the three of them shared the coveted prize was unusual. That all three are women was unprecedented. As was the conversation that followed with CNN. Punctured with the gravity of the unspeakable cruelty women have endured in Liberia and Yemen and with the humor that can come only from women who have led the battle to end it, the conversation reflected the indomitable spirit for which the Nobel was awarded. ""Beyond fighting for our individual countries, we are fighting for the emancipation of women and girls,"" said Leymah Gbowee. This was no token prize. ""We worked very, very hard for this. It's been a long time coming,"" Gbowee said. Women's rights take center stage at ceremony . This was no prize given out of sympathy, either, added Tawakkul Karman, the first Arab woman to win the honor. ""We deserve it,"" she said to thundering applause in the same room where hours before she accepted her medal and diploma. ""It's recognition that women can do a lot."" And Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Africa's first female head of state, said it was still harder for women to achieve what men can. That has not changed. ""Let's face it, in a way, women are stronger than men,"" she said to laughter. The women have much in common, they agreed. But each has their own tale set against a backdrop of injustice and violence. For most of the 1990s, Liberia meant bloodshed, a maelstrom of violence that bled across its borders and where, child soldiers became killers and warlords became presidents. Charles Taylor bludgeoned his way into power in 1997 and many, sadly, predicted perpetual conflict in the West African nation. No one figured that it would be Liberia's women who would be the ones to stand up to Taylor. Gbowee, a trauma counselor, led them by the thousands. They dressed in stark white T-shirts and demanded an end to the violence against them. ""When you find yourself at a place where there seems to be no hope, you find yourself at a place you are destitute, you find yourself at a place where you are angry -- you have two options,"" Gbowee said. You either pick up a gun or you try to do something different, she said. She chose the latter. The women threatened curses on Liberia's men, organized sex strikes and sit-ins to shame them. Gbowee even threatened to shed her clothes as a gesture to show how her dignity had been stripped. ""It was the women in white looking Charles Taylor in the eye,"" she said. Gbowee supposes that many others are deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize for their roles in securing peace in Liberia. But they were mostly people in positions of authority; people who had the power to implement change, she said. But the women she led were ordinary citizens who had nothing in hand. ""The story of the Liberian women is a typical Cinderella story,"" she said. The women braved death to pray for peace. Their movement found a powerful ally in Johnson-Sirleaf, a former finance minister and champion for women's rights who also wanted to an end to the war and its perpetrators punished. When she became president, her challenge was daunting: to bring Liberia back from the abyss. But she brought with her something new for her people: Hope, where there had only been despair. Days before the Nobel presentation, Johnson-Sirleaf was re-elected to office after a runoff vote. She will serve another six-year term. Would she consider herself a success if after her six years, there is peace in Liberia even if little else has been accomplished? ""Definitely. I am already a success,"" she said of the economic strides Liberia has taken. But there will be more than peace, she hopes. She promises progress. There will be lights where streets were dark, running water where there were only buckets. Education, health and all the things that make a nation great. ""We will make Liberia a post-conflict success story,"" she said. ""I am certain of it."" On another continent, on the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula, Karman, also dreamed big. As President of Women Journalists Without Chains, a group campaigning for press freedom, she was a voice of protest long before the Arab Spring took root in Yemen. This year, she came to be known as Yemen's mother of the revolution. By late January, the 32-year-old mother of three children was out on the streets of Sanaa, rallying protesters to call for the ouster of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. She was threatened repeatedly and detained. But that didn't stop her. Yemeni women, inspired by her courage, followed Karman's lead and called openly for change, a daring act of defiance in the conservative Islamic country. Saturday, she was asked if Yemen was perhaps the worst place on earth for women. She replied: ""It's the worst place to be human. We believe our freedom will come through freedom for all of society."" Saleh has stepped down but not relinquished power, she said. And he will never leave Yemen on his own accord. She took the Nobel interview opportunity to ask the world to step up pressure on Saleh as they had done on Moammar Gadhafi and Bashar al-Assad. She did not want the killings and injuries of 28,000 Yemenis to be in vain. Saleh, is a liar, she said. ""And he will continue lying."" She said she wouldn't mind running for president herself. Will there be a free and fair election in Yemen? ""Do we have this opportunity? Please ask this to the American administration?"" she said. But one thing she was sure of. ""If I will run, I will win,"" she said. ""And I will take more than 90 (percent of the vote)."" It was that confidence, that courage that had brought her and her two fellow laureates to the Oslo's celebratory stage. For them, the Nobel was hardly a finality, but another beginning. CNN's Jonathan Mann reported from Oslo, Norway, and Moni Basu from Atlanta. CNN's David McKenzie and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Unprecedented: Three women share the coveted peace prize .

"(CNN) -- Captain Michael Clarke insisted team success was more important than individual landmarks after his record-breaking 329 not out helped Australia strengthen their grip on the second Test against India on Thursday. Clarke's career-best knock was the highest in the Sydney Cricket Ground's history, with the hosts eventually declaring on 659 for the loss of four wickets. He was five runs short of the second-highest total by an Australian, held by Don Bradman and Mark Taylor, and in sight of Brian Lara's world record of 400. ""I'm stoked that I've managed to make 300-odd runs but the most important thing for me is that we win the Test,"" the 30-year-old told Cricket Australia's official website at the end of day three. ""That was a big part of the reason for my declaration ... I didn't think about it (the records) at all. It was about getting the team to a number, a total. ""I didn't expect to score 300 runs in one innings. All the other records ... well, I'm happy where I sit."" Clarke is the sixth Australian to hit a triple century, with Matthew Hayden's 380 the leading score. The middle-order batsman was ably assisted by veteran Michael Hussey as the 36-year-old reached 150 not out on a day when Australia lost no wickets. ""Once 'Huss' got 150 we had a 450-run lead, I thought it's a good time to pull up stumps and try to get a couple of wickets tonight,"" said Clarke. India reached 114-2 at the start of their second innings, ending the day 354 runs behind Australia's huge total with two days to play. ""There's nothing to lose, in the sense that we're so far behind now,"" India batsman Rahul Dravid conceded. ""Everyone's got to go out and play and not even think about drawing the game or anything like that. ""Just go out there and look to play, just bat as long as you can and who knows. I think the key obviously for us is to keep them on the field for long periods of time."" The tourists lost Virender Sehwag for four runs when he was caught by David Warner off the fast bowling of Ben Hilfenhaus. Dravid, the second highest run scorer in Tests behind teammate Sachin Tendulkar, was also dismissed by Hilfenhaus for 29. Opener Gautam Gambhir remained at the crease on 68, with Tendulkar on eight as he continued his quest for a 100th century in international cricket. Australia lead the four-match series 1-0, after victory in the opening Test in Melbourne. Meanwhile, South Africa took 12 wickets as they continued to dominate on day three of the decisive third Test against Sri Lanka in Cape Town. Sri Lanka started the day 431 runs behind South Africa, but added just 90 for their last eight first-innings wickets. Fast-bowling duo Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander ripped into Sri Lanka's batting line-up, with South Africa able to enforce the follow -on after the tourists could only make 239 in response to the hosts 580. South Africa kept up the pressure at the start of the second innings, with Mark Boucher catching opener Tillakaratne Dilshan off the bowling of Philander to leave Sri Lanka struggling on 12-1. Sri Lanka then lost Lahiru Thirimanne for 30 and wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara for 34, before first-innings hero Jacques Kallis caught Mahela Jayawardene to hand Morkel the final wicket of the day's play. Sri Lanka were 138-4 at the close of play, leaving South Africa with a healthy lead of 203 and two days to take the six wickets they need to wrap up a 2-1 series win.","Michael Clarke hits an unbeaten 329 for Australia on day three of second Test .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A 15-year-old girl allegedly tortured by her in-laws in Afghanistan after she refused to be forced into prostitution is not doing well in hospital, aid workers say. Sahar Gul was rescued by police last month in the country's northern Baghlan province after she was locked in the basement of her in-laws' house, starved and her nails pulled out. She is safe, but signs of the abuse she's suffered remain all too clear, said Wazhma Frogh of the Afghan Women's Network. Sahar is too weak to move her body, which has black bruise marks all over from being beaten, and the nurses gave her diapers because she can't get to the toilet, Frogh said. The girl's eyes are bruised and she can't speak. Her hair was also cut short by her in-laws as a punishment after she refused to sleep with other men. A photograph provided by the Afghan Women's Network shows her asleep in a hospital bed, the bruising on her face obvious and her head bandaged. The mental trauma she suffered is also affecting her, and is under medication to help her deal with it, Frogh said. ""We've also provided her with a trauma counselor because she is very traumatized and even when I wanted to take her hand, she resisted,"" despite being unconscious, Frogh said. Because the teenager was beaten and assaulted, she added, ""now she doesn't want anyone to even touch her."" Last month, authorities in Baghlan said they rescued the girl after hearing reports that she was tortured after she refused to be forced into prostitution. But, they said, they were waiting for her to fully recover to talk to her and learn more. Sahar was married off to a 30-year-old man about seven months ago. After her parents reported not seeing her for months, police launched their investigation, Baghlan police official Jawid Basharat said at the time. Meanwhile, Sahar's father-in-law, mother-in-law and sister-in-law have been arrested but her husband -- who Frogh said is thought to be a soldier serving in Helmand province -- has not been caught. The Women's Network is determined to do its best to ensure she gets the care she needs -- but Frogh warned that her recovery won't be easy. ""She needs proper food, proper care that our government's hospitals don't have, therefore we have been collecting donations to provide to the hospital to buy her good food, clothing and other basic needs,"" she said. ""We also have to think of her shelter once she is back into normal life, which is going to take some months."" At the same time, the Women's Network has found a lawyer for Sahar and has persuaded the Afghan authorities to move the investigation to Kabul, where there will be less influence from the local community, Frogh said. It has also contacted the attorney general to appeal for a faster investigation before the girl's in-laws are released from custody. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called for the abuse to be ""seriously investigated,"" his office said in a statement Sunday. CNN's Masoud Popalzai contributed to this report.","Sahar Gul is found by police locked in the basement of her in-laws' house .
