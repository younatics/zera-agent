"By . Rosemarie Lentini . Arrested: Raymond Michael Miranda, 14 (pictured) has been accused of viciously beating an 87-year-old woman at a California nursing home . A 14-year-old boy accused of brutally beating an elderly woman while she slept in her nursing home bed, has been arrested following a nearly week-long manhunt in California. Police nabbed Raymond Michael Miranda in a Temecula hotel room last night over the April 17 attack which left an 87-year-old woman fighting for her life in hospital. Raymond and a 15-year-old boy allegedly broke into the unidentified woman's room at the Camelot Independent Living complex in Hemet and violently beat her in a botched robbery attempt about 2am. Some reports also claim they splashed bleach on the victim. While officials are legally prohibited from identifying juvenile suspects, investigators made an exception with Raymond who they say is dangerous. While the 15-year-old boy was arrested on the day of the attack, officers were forced to circulate fliers with Raymond's name and photo in order to find him. A neighbor told police they spotted the teenage boys outside the woman's living quarters on West Oakland Avenue in the early morning hours of April 17. 'It's . an 87-year-old victim minding her own business in the safety of her own . home,' police Lt. Dean Evans told the Riverside Press-Enterprise. '(She was) accosted and beaten severely and is now in critical condition. The feeling is, if they’ll do that to an 87-year-old lady, they’ll do it to anyone else they come across. So we feel the public might be at risk and we want to prevent that.' Investigators said it appeared the victim was not specifically targeted and they don't know how long the 'torture' lasted. They believe burglary was the motive. Evans told Riverside Press-Enterprise that Raymond has had 'extensive contacts' with Hemet police. 'I know he has some contact with the juvenile justice system,' the lieutenant said, but did not provide details. Raymond's arrest warrant alleges attempted murder, burglary and torture.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teenager in Upstate New York was airlifted to a Massachusetts hospital earlier this week after he accidentally cut off his arm while cleaning a pasta-maker at the Italian restaurant where he works. Authorities say the incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, when 17-year-old Brett Bouchard was cleaning the pasta-maker at Violi's Restaurant in Massena, New York, which sits right on the Canadian border. Other employees told reporters that his right arm was severed at the elbow. 'Horrific' accident: Brett Bouchard's arm was severed when a spaghetti-maker was turned on as he was cleaning it . Bouchard was rushed to Massena Memorial Hospital before being air-lifted to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, about 350 miles away. According to the Watertown Daily Times, a supervisor at Massena Memorial tried to have Bouchard taken to the Fletcher Allen Health Center in Burlington, Vermont - which is more than 200 miles closer to Massena than Massachusetts General - but the hospital would not accept Bouchard. As of Sunday morning, Bouchard was listed as being in critical condition. Bouchard had reportedly worked at Violi's Italian restaurant for a little over a year . It's unclear whether doctors were able to reattach his arm. 'We’re all still in shock. One of our employees severed his arm last . night,' Ross Violi, who owns the restaurant with his brother Dominic, told the paper. Restaurant employees are still trying to figure out how the machine was turned on while Bouchard was cleaning it. Bouchard was forced to be airlifted to a hospital 300 miles away after he was turned away from a much closer hospital . A spokesman for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says it's unclear whether the agency will investigate the incident. 'We are still awaiting word on whether or not an inspection will take . place,' agency spokesman Andre J. Bowser said, explaining that the . nearest OSHA office is in Syracuse, which is roughly three hours away by car. Mia Violi, a manager at the restaurant, has started a GoFundMe page to help raise money for Bouchard's medical treatment and travel expenses for his family. 'A hardworking, young man had part of his arm severed in half while working. We would like to raise money to help with medical expenses and travel expenses for his family. If you can help, please do. Brett is an amazing young man and deserves any help. Thank you so much,' she wrote on the page.","17-year-old Brett Bouchard was cleaning the pasta-maker when it somehow turned on and cut off his arm .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Authorities are hunting for a veteran firefighter believed by investigators to have stabbed his nearly-30-years-younger fiancée to death because she planned to leave him. Sarah Douglas, 26, is said by cops to have been killed early Thursday morning by Orville ‘Moe’ Fleming, 55, in the suburban Sacramento home they shared. Her butchered body was discovered by her sister. Fleming fled the scene in his state-issued fire vehicle and has not been seen since. Authorities have not said if they have any leads on his whereabouts. Doomed pair: 'Moe' Fleming (left) is the primary suspect in the stabbing death of fiancee Sarah Douglas (right) ‘She died horrifically, she died violently, and she didn't have that coming,’ aunt Trina Worley told KFSN. ‘Nobody has this coming.’ The dead woman was out with her mother and sister in the hours before her death, Werly recalled, adding ‘he was waiting for her.’ Sister Stephanie Douglas was on the phone with her just before the killing likely occurred. ‘She enters the house, she comes up from behind, and on the speaker phone you could hear her say 'Oh you scared the s**t out of me. ‘And then she screams, blood curdling screams and the phone went dead, said Werly. Veteran: The lone suspect is a 24-year veteran firefighter that has risen to the rank of battalion chief . House of horrors: The street in front of the home where Douglas was killed has been roped off with police tape . The concerned sister went to the home that morning and had to hop a fence to get in, the aunt explained. ‘She jumped the fence and saw blood on the patio door.’ Werly told KMAX. Her body had multiple stab wounds with a sheet wrapped around her neck. Loved ones grieved online as friends posted messages of support. A family member mentioned seeing the couple over Easter weekend and wrote 'they seemed fine.' ‘Sorry to hear about what happened to your sister. She was beautiful. It hurts my heart,’ a friend posted to her sister’s Facebook page. ‘In absolute shock.... We just started hanging out again. I'm so sorry Sarah,’ wrote a friend. Fleming is a 24-year CalFire veteran, and has even spoken to media at fire scenes in the past. His family has hit out at Douglas, calling her a dangerous, money-hungry woman who did not love the man investigators believed killed her in a jealous fit of rage. Grieving: Loved ones gathered in front of the suburban Sacramento home . Sad days: A memorial in front of the home Douglas once shared with Fleming . ‘She's been calling my mom's cell phone, saying all this stuff that she wants to send someone after my family,’ a woman told KXTV. Another Family member told KMAX that Fleming said Douglas was ‘a prostitute who owed people money.’ Douglas family dismissed those claims. ‘There's no way there was any threats or the reason he did this to her is because she was some way threatening him or his family, or that she could have someone else do that is absolutely absurd,’ Werly told KMAX. ‘No, that's ridiculous that it had to do with money. He pursued her, and she really thought she cared about him, Werly added to KFSN. Fleming’s family has notably not called into doubt his possible involvement in her death. The manhunt for ‘Moe’ and the investigation into Douglas’ death remain ongoing.","Sarah Douglas, 26, was found Friday stabbed to death with a sheet wrapped around her neck .

"By . Dan Bloom . A Swiss zoo has provoked an outcry after putting down a brown bear cub because it was being bullied by its 'jealous' father. The cub was among two born earlier this year to Misha and Masha, who were gifts from then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in 2009. But keepers at Bern's Dahlholzi Zoo refused to separate the animals - even after Misha killed his other cub in front of horrified families last week. Horrified: The cub, pictured, was put down by keepers this week at Dahlholzi Zoo in the Swiss capital Bern . Distress: The cub, nicknamed Baby Bear 4, was not separated from its father even after its twin Baby Bear 3 was killed in the enclosure. It is common for males and even females to kill their own cubs . Keepers claimed the mother of the cub, right, was neglecting it and they could not account for nature's course . When 360kg male Misha started being aggressive towards Baby Bear 4, as the cub was called, zoo chiefs decided to kill it instead of raising it in solitude. But . Swiss Animal Protection, the country's oldest and largest animal rights group, was in uproar. It condemned the action in the 'strongest possible terms' and said the zoo has massively . mishandled the situation. A . spokesman for the group added: 'It is not natural to keep the male bear . with the offspring, and there was more than enough space to have kept . him in a separate part of the cage.' In . the wild, female bears typically drive away males to protect cubs because . males can see them as rivals and attempt to kill them. Despite this, the zoo defended its position even after the first cub was killed last Wednesday. Keepers said separating Misha or Masha from their cub would lead to other problems, and cause lasting damage for the welfare of all the bears involved. Attack: Horrified families looked on last week as Misha killed the first of the two cubs, pictured. Males often turn against their cubs because they see them as competition, and even females can attack their young . Killed: The other cub, Baby Bear 3, being mauled by its father last week . Torn apart: 360kg male Misha killed his other cub (pictured) last Wednesday but keepers kept their policy . Pictured: The cub which was killed last week. Switzerland's animal rights group condemned the decision . Jürg Hadorn, the zoo's deputy director, said: 'After 12 weeks it was clear that Masha was irreparably neglecting her role as mother of cub number four. 'Together with the fact that the male bear Misha had started demonstrating the same aggressive behaviour as he did to cub number three, in order to protect cub number four from more stress and pain, we decided to act. As a result the baby bear was euthanised by a vet. 'It remains unclear now as then as to why our bears behaved in this way. After killing cub number three on April 2 there was an uneasy truce for 48 hours but since the weekend Misha again started to show the same aggression. 'Attempting to distract them and temporarily separating the older animals has only brought short-term easing of the situation. But it also resulted in Masha ignoring the cub even more. 'Misha and Masha are lovely hand-reared orphaned bears who came to us in 2009. They never had the chance to learn from other bears how to behave and their mothers were killed by poachers. Euthanised: The cub put down by the zoo (pictured) was born in January and was one of two . Expert: Brown bear specialist Prof Djuro Huber said bears' natural aggression was well-known and it was 'a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo' 'We have tried when they were here to keep as much distance between them and humans as possible. Our priority is the two adult bears. 'Having young animals is a natural part of the life cycle of every animal and we wanted to ensure that Misha and Masha had the chance as well. But the loss of the young animals in a biological sense and also according to basic principles of good animal protection are less serious than the loss of an adult. 'The loss of cub number four has affected all of us here. Because Misha and Masha appeared to be clearly unable to fulfil their role as parents, Misha will be sterilised in the next few weeks.' He . added he did not want to see a repeat of Knut the polar bear - who was . effectively sentenced to a life of solitude in a Berlin zoo after being . rejected by his mother. In 2007, an animal rights activist controversially said Knut should have been killed rather than being held in captivity alone. Yet . when two cubs were born at another Swiss zoo in January this year, . keepers solved the problem by separating the parents and leaving the . cubs with their mother. Different policy: Sixty miles away, two cubs born at the Juraparc animal park were separated from their father . Happy family: A cub in Jaraparc with its mother. The Bern zoo said it was worse to lose an adult than a cub . Ursina gave birth to King and Zoe at Juraparc animal park near Vallorbe - just 60 miles from Bern. Professor Djuro Huber, chairman of the brown bear expert team for the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, said bears' natural aggression was well-known and it was 'a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo'. He told MailOnline: 'In nature the male bear separates from the female after mating season and is not present with his cubs. 'It is not unusual that the male kills his cubs in captivity. Even the mother sometimes does.' But he added: 'Zoos have too many captive bears and it is almost impossible to send them somewhere. Surplus bears have to be euthanised, and it is better to do that at a very young age when the mortality in nature is also the highest.'","Cub was among two born to Misha and Masha at Dahlholzli Zoo in Bern .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Gunned down in his own rectory: Father Gilbert Dasna was shot dead in his church, police believe he may have have been killed by a gunman they shot dead minutes later . A small Canadian town was terrorized Friday by a crazed gunman who is believed to have shot dead a priest inside a church before going on a rampage before he was gunned down by police. John Quadros, 55, of St Paul, Alberta, was killed by Royal Canadian Mounted Police after he is said by police to have likely killed Father Gilbert Dasna and then going on a high speed chase through the center of town that culminated in a crash derby-like shootout, sources said. Dasna, 32, was shot more than once on the third anniversary of his arrival from Cameroon while inside his rectory, police told the CBC, they do not believe the murder was a random act of violence. The mayhem began just before 6.00 p.m. as the town of about 5,400 just over 120 miles east of Edmonton was rocked by the sound of gunfire. Officers heard shots just outside their station and ran out in pursuit of a black pickup truck being driven by Quadros. Quadros is said by police to have sped straight for the small town’s central business district and rammed at least one squad car while firing shots at police as he went. The force of the impact was so great that car parts were scattered across at least half a block. ‘I've seen movie scenes not as horrific as this. There's bits of pieces of vehicle all over the street a half a block away,’ Chief Supt. Randy McInnes told the CBC. End of the line: John Quadros is seen slumped over in his smashed up truck after being shot dead by an RCMP officer . Three Mounties were injured in the fracas and one was forced to fire back in retaliation – the shot killed Quadros while he was still behind the wheel of his vehicle. The dramatic scene unfolded in broad daylight as locals made their way to restaurants for dinner and home from work. The smashed up wreckage of multiple vehicles sat in the middle of the town’s busiest street after people scattered to avoid the bullets flying through the air. ‘I was shaken by it to the point where I couldn't properly text a message to my commanding officer to let them know what was going on,’ McInnes added. A woman who witnessed the chase said Quadros was driving recklessly through a busy area and even on the wrong side of the road at times. Destroyed: The bashed up remains of an RCMP vehicle Quadros is said to have rammed and opened fire on shortly before he was killed . ‘The way he was driving I thought he might kill somebody,’ she told the Edmonton Journal. ‘He was just flying.’ The female officer who killed Quadros suffered serious leg injuries, said McInnes. A male officer was shot in the hand and another was hit in the face with glass shards, he added. The female officer remains hospitalized, the two men were treated and released. Investigators could not confirm if the priest’s murder was related to the downtown shootout, but refused to rule out the two incidents being more than a coincidence. They happened only blocks from each other. Horrific: A local police officials said the traumatic scene resembled a Hollywood movie . Quadros owned a health store that ‘advocated healthy living through herbs and natural products given to us by GOD,’ according to the Journal. Church officials lamented Dasna’s violent death. ‘It's very disturbing. People don't know what happened,’ said diocese spokesperson Pierre Lamoureux. ‘He was well-loved. He was a man of joy, a man of peace.’ A parishioner told the Journal that Dasna was ‘a nice man [and] you couldn’t ask for a better man.‘Why would anybody kill a priest? I just can’t believe that,’ she added. Mayor Glenn Anderson was in disbelief over the afternoon’s events. ‘A town of our size… doesn't ever expect this to happen,’ he told the CBC. ‘It's never happened in St. Paul.’ ‘I'm just really shaken up by the whole incident.’An investigation into both crime scenes remains ongoing.","Father Gilbert Dasna was shot multiple times in the rectory of his church .

"By . Luke Salked . Nirmal Gill, 49, allegedly murdered his wife Rosemary Gill, 48, in the bedroom of their home on July 20 last year . A jealous husband battered his wife to death with a metal dumbbell after he hired private detectives and found out she was having an affair, a court heard. Nirmal Gill, 49, is accused of murdering wife Rosemary, 48, after becoming ‘possessive’ and suspicious of her behaviour. He contracted private investigators who fitted a tracking device to Mrs Gill’s car, a jury heard. Gill then followed his wife and spotted her embracing her ex-husband during a secret meeting at a motorway service station, the court was told. He is accused of carrying out the fatal  attack three days later, using a metal dumbbell to strike his wife in the head at least 12 times at their home. Mrs Gill’s naked and bloodied body was discovered eight hours later by the couple’s daughter, Jasmine, 19, who had been sleeping in the room next door. Michael Fitton QC, prosecuting, told the jury that Gill admits manslaughter due to a loss of control, but denies murder. But he argued: ‘He didn’t lose control of himself when he beat her to death – he knew what he was doing. He was killing her in revenge for what he had discovered about her behaviour because she had been unfaithful. ‘He was killing her because he was a jealous man who was never going to forgive her, not just for the affair but for lying to him. She paid for her affair with her life.’ Mr Fitton said Mrs Gill had been married to Andrew Cooper between 1982 and 1986, before marrying Gill in 1989. ‘To the outside world, the marriage appeared to have been happy enough, but those in the house were aware  that in reality it was otherwise,’ Mr  Fitton said. The marriage began to struggle in 2013 and the couple began sleeping separately, Bristol Crown Court was told. Mrs Gill met with Mr Cooper at the beginning of the year and they rekindled their friendship and later their relationship, the jury was told. By June, Mrs Gill informed her husband she wanted a divorce and contacted a solicitor to begin the legal process, Mr Fitton continued. The couple argued, with Mrs Gill calling police for help on four separate occasions between June 9 and 21, the lawyer said. ‘The defendant, who had clearly expressed his love for Rosemary many times and continued to do so, was deeply upset about the decline and breakdown of the marriage,’ Mr Fitton said. On July 19, Mrs Gill and Mr Cooper met at the Gordano Services on the  M5 near Portishead in Somerset, at 1.30pm, with the defendant following in a borrowed car. Later that day, Mrs Gill and Gill spoke about their relationship and agreed it was ‘coming to an end’, the jury heard. In the evening Mrs Gill left to meet Mr Cooper at a pub in the Cotswolds, where she told him Gill had agreed to leave home, it was said. Mrs Gill returned home at around 10pm, texting Mr Cooper that Gill was asleep. At 3am, neighbours heard banging noises at the three-bedroom property in Bristol. Miss Gill discovered her mother’s body at around midday, with her father sitting on the side of the bed. 'Possessive' Gill had hired a team of private investigators after he became suspicious that his wife may have been having an affair, Bristol Crown Court heard . On July 19, Mrs Gill and Mr Cooper met at Gordano Services on the M5 at 1.30pm. Gill allegedly used the agency to track his wife's Audi and followed her in a borrowed car. Later that day, Mrs Gill and Gill agreed their relationship was 'coming to an end', the jury heard . She told him to leave the property and he returned at 9pm when he was arrested by police, the court heard. In an interview, Gill initially told police he had flown into a rage after his wife called him a ‘sad, pathetic man’. He later told officers he had taken a ‘cocktail of drink and drugs’ and could not remember attacking his wife, the jury was told. The trial continues.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . As many as 25 dead cats have been found inside neatly-tied plastic bags hanging from tree limbs in a New York City suburb. Tests on three of the cats that were found in Yonkers on Thursday have revealed they were killed by blunt force trauma to the head - and a baseball bat, two shovels and a metal pipe were found nearby. Investigations are underway, but Ernest Lungaro, a director of the SPCA, said there has been tension in the neighborhood over feeding stations some residents set up for feral cats. The animals found on Thursday were in different stages of decomposition; some were skeletons, while others appeared to have been left there just a few days ago. Grisly discovery: The bodies of around 30 cats have been discovered in bags hanging from trees in Yonkers . Police and the SPCA responded to a call . at around 10.50am after public works employees clearing trash from a lot . near Overlook Terrace came across the cats among a cluster of trees . near homes. Bizarre: Some had fallen out of the bags after they were torn by wildlife, authorities said . The cats appear to have been put in the bags at different times, Lieutenant Patrick McCormack told the Yonkers Daily Voice. Each bag appeared to have contained one . cat each, authorities said. But wildlife had apparently torn open some of the bags, causing the animals to fall out, authorities said. Given the sanitation schedule of the area, they were dumped in the . last year, the Journal News reported. Lungaro, who works for Westchester's Humane Law Enforcement Division in the SPCA, told The Journal News . it appeared the cats were dead before being put into the bags because . any cat would have been able to claw its way out. 'It's something very odd,' he said. 'It's a lot of cats to be disposed of in a year.' McCormack said they had not found any evidence that the deaths were connected to a ritual. No suspects have been taken into custody in the incident, but authorities are interviewing residents. Scene: The bags were found by public works employees in trees along this Yonkers street on Thursday . Neighbors said they weren't surprised the cats were found in the trees. 'That place is always dirty so when you see a bag there, it's nothing new,' said Guy John, who lives across the streets. 'You see rats running out of there.' Anyone with information is asked to call detectives at 914-377-7724 or the SPCA's Animal Cruelty Hotline at 914-941-7797.","The neatly-tied bags containing the cats were found by public works employees in Yonkers on Thursday as they cleared out a nearby lot .

"By . Louise Cheer . Australian restaurants are using the internet to sniff out information about the eating habits of their diners. Online reservation sites, social media and Google searches are being used to track the dining experience of food lovers. By simply browsing these sites, restaurants can find out every little tidbit about their diners - including the quantity of food ordered, whether or not a person is a generous tipper, their attitude towards wait staff or how long they stayed after a meal finished. Restaurants are using online reservation sites, social media and Google to get information about diners' eating habits . Stevan Premutico - chief executive officer of online reservation site dimmi.com.au - said the data mining was all part of the process of the restaurant's process of getting to know their customers. 'What they look like, their job, their title, where they live, their social connections, any special celebrations and whether they are an avid foodie are all key things,' Mr Premutico told Good Food. The site's most shared information among restaurants was food and wine preferences, noteworthy habits, seating preferences, allergies and how a customer tips - good or bad. But Dimmi's ResDiary takes it one step further by providing restaurants with a coding system to indicate a person's dining quirks, including if a person is a wine connoisseur, an adventurous eater, a get-in-get-out diner or acquainted with the chef or owner. Stevan Premutico is CEO of dimmi.com.au where restaurants can compare notes on diners and their experience with them . There are also codes for diners who talk loudly, regular reservation no-shows or demanding customers - PIAs also known as pain-in-the-ass customers. Other information restaurants can gain from ResDiary are the customer's postcodes, if a diner is an 'upgrader' who love all the trimmings to a meal - including a drink or coffee after eating - and the level of attractiveness of a customer. Mr Premutico said some joints seated people based on their looks. By doing their homework, some restaurants are reaping the benefits. Information available includes whether or not a person is a good tipper, how long they stay at the restaurant after finishing their meal and even if they are attractive or not . Darran Smith - who has been in the restaurant business for 20 years - said he strived to find more about his customers - from politicians to lawyers to movie stars. 'I remember (Hollywood actor) Owen Wilson was coming in and finding out he really likes tequila so I made sure the bar was stocked with tequila...It paid off,' he told Good Food. Mr Smith also remembers the time he found out via Google that one of his diners at Bondi Beach's Icebergs Dining Room and Bar had sold his company the day before and ended up spending $5000.","Reservation sites, social media and Google used to dig up information .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An alleged white supremacist is accused of torturing and sexually assaulting his two teenage stepdaughters over five years because he didn't like that they were Latina. Justin Ladd, 33, faces 21 criminal counts after the girls told police that he slammed their feet with hammers until they were flattened, pulled on their tongues with pliers, beat them with belts and straps and exposed himself to them. The girls, now 14 and 16, said Ladd abused them between September 2008 and February 2013 in their Massachusetts home, and warned a motorcycle gang would rape and kill them if they told their mother.

"By . Becky Barrow . Its 970 acres offer you breathtaking island views, unspoilt sandy beaches and the chance to watch otters, golden eagles and red deer. If you fancy the self-sufficient lifestyle, Wiay off the north-west coast of Scotland also boasts an endless supply of lobster, scallops and grouse. The private island has just gone on sale for £500,000 – less than you’d pay for a family home with a tiny patch of garden in London and many parts of the South. The island of Wiay: It has been uninhabited since the Second World War . Famous visitor: Hercules with owner Maggie Robin . Before you decide to leave the chaos, . expense and pollution of city life behind, however, a word of caution: . Although it looks idyllic in this picture, Scotland’s north-west coast . is the windiest part of Britain, and it suffers more than its fair share . of rain – up to 250 days a year. Wiay (pronounced ‘wee-a’) used to be . home to a crofting family with ten children, but has been uninhabited . since the Second World War. Half a mile south-east of Benbecula, it has . to be accessed by private boat from nearby Petersport. The island is currently owned by Sarah . Chettle, a mother of five from Dorset, who bought it for about £20,000 . in 1980 after she and her late husband, Robert, spotted a small advert . in a newspaper. She said: ‘It just seemed such an opportunity to have our own island. It was a bit of a romantic whim.’ As far as she can recall, they did not . even visit the island before buying it. The hideout used by Bonnie Prince Charlie following the Battle of Culloden in 1745 was put up for sale earlier this month . The 970-acre island also has sporting rights, and in recent years the land has been used for woodcock and duck shooting. There is also red deer stalking and fishing . Mrs Chettle, 57, compared . owning the island to having ‘your own wildlife reserve’, adding that . deer often swim over from nearby islands. Wiay, which has views to neighbouring North and South Uist, has two claims to fame. The fugitive Bonnie Prince Charlie is . said to have hidden in a cave there for a few days after the disastrous . Battle of Culloden in 1746. The cave, known as Prince Charlie’s . Rest, is on the east side of the island, which is mostly covered in . heather with a number of small freshwater lochs. More recently, the island was briefly . home to Hercules, the tame grizzly bear which ran away while being . filmed for a TV advertisement for Kleenex tissues. In August 1980 Hercules, who was an . impressive 8ft 4in, escaped while swimming, triggering a three-week hunt . which became a worldwide media sensation. Wiay from the air. The island has been uninhabited for over a century, although the current owners - the Chettle family from England, who bought it in 2003 - used it for holidays and summer camping . Bonnie Prince Charlie eventually sought shelter in this cave on Wiay, now known as 'Prince Charlie's Rest', while his followers kept watch for the British navy . The prince eventually obtained passage to France and escaped, pledging to his remaining followers that he would return with an army . After a long and fruitless search, the . first clue was found on Wiay when his collar and his pawprints were . spotted there. He was eventually rescued on North Uist and reunited with . owner Maggie Robin. Yesterday Archie Leslie-Melville, an . associate at Bell Ingram, the estate agency selling the island, said it . has already attracted one viewer keen to return for a second look. But there are some significant hurdles . for anybody keen to get away from it all and live the ‘Good Life’ dream. There is no house on the island, except the ruins of an old stone . cottage, although it does have planning permission to be turned into a . small three-bedroom home. The planning rules dictate that it can . be used only as a holiday home, although it is not clear who will . enforce this rule if the new owner decides to move permanently to the . island. It currently has neither running water . nor electricity, although Mr Leslie-Melville said both problems could . be fixed by a wind turbine, solar panels or a generator, and water pipes . from the fresh water lochs. He said: ‘You could live on the island very happily and be self-sufficient.’ It is likely to have its own salmon and sea trout fishing rights, although these are currently being negotiated. For her part, Mrs Chettle admits that . she and her children rarely visit the island, which is why she has . decided to put it on the market, although she feels in two minds about . the decision. ‘I don’t really mind if it does not sell,’ she said.","Wiay, off the coast of South Uist, has been put up for sale for £500,000 .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Police in Italy believe that a murdered prostitute who was found stripped naked and ‘crucified’ could have been the victim of a serial killer. The 26-year-old Romanian was found dead beneath a bridge in Ugnano, a village near Florence, hanging from a cross. The woman, identified as Andrea Cristina Zamfir, was completely naked except for her shoes and was bound with tape to an iron bar in a position similar to crucifixion. The scene where the woman's body was found stripped naked and crucified in a village near Florence in Italy . Investigators have not ruled out that the woman may have been the victim of a serial killer given that a year ago an Italian prostitute was found in the same place and in a similar state, although she was still alive. ‘For now all we can assume is that we are dealing with a case of a client who killed a prostitute. Our investigations will also determine if there is any connection between this death and the case that happened a year ago, when a prostitute was found by a client in a similar position. Fortunately, she was still alive’, said one of the investigators. A local police inspector said the woman had a slow and terrible death after being found in the crucifixion position . The woman's body was found under this bridge in the small village of Ugnano near Florence . Police have begun house-to-house enquiries in a bid to track down her killer. The victim had a criminal record in Italy for prostitution, and was identified through her fingerprints. Sources in the investigation said evidence shows that the dead woman was sexually abused before she was taped to the iron bar and then abandoned. The allegations are supported by numerous bruises on her arms and back, showing that she tried hard to free herself. A local police inspector said she had a terrible and slow death. He added: ‘The woman was found by a cyclist under the bridge in an area known to be frequented by prostitutes and drug users.’","Body of Andrea Cristina Zamfir, 26, found beneath bridge in Ugnano near Florence .

The militant group Asaib Ahl Haq (League of the Righteous) was presenting its candidates for elections on April 30 at the rally in eastern Baghdad. Three bombs exploded in succession as people were leaving, reporters at the scene said. Scroll down for video . Three bombs were detonated at a . political rally in Baghdad on Friday, reports suggest . An explosion is seen at the Shi'ite political organisation rally. It is thought 28 lost their lives in the attack . A roadside bomb went off near the main gate, followed by a suicide car bomb after a few minutes and then a final explosion. Al Qaeda offshoot the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on the Internet. The group said it had carried out the bombings in response to 'murder, torture and displacement' of Sunnis by Shi'ite militias which 'massacred children and women'. The attack came as tensions ran high in Iraq in the runup to a national election on April 30 and as the Iraqi security forces are locked in a four-month battle with ISIL in western Anbar province. It appeared to be the work of ISIL aimed at baiting the group to strike Sunni neighbourhoods or communities in hopes of provoking a full-fledged civil war. Iraqi security forces react at the scene of a car bomb attack. A further 40 people were injured in the blasts . Security forces tend to the injured - as a car goes up in flames behind them . Asaib's main leader Sheik Qais Khazaali had just delivered a speech accusing some politicians of aiding terrorism and vowed his movement was ready for any action by ISIL. 'To all ISIL ... we are ready. We are prepared,' he said. 'We are the defenders of this country. You will never reach us.' He added: 'If ISIL is the sickness, were are the medicine.' As people started to leave the stadium, the first bomb exploded. Grey smoke rose in the air and people ran or scrambled for cover. The a white mini-van raced to the stadium's main gate and detonated, unleashing a massive ball of fire. Army and police shot in the air and a final explosion shook the ground. Asaib members commandeered cars to rush the injured to hospital. A wounded man limped away, stained in blood, while people hunted for missing friends or relatives. Al Qaeda offshoot the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has now claimed responsibility for the blasts . People run from the scene of the blast. The attack came as tensions ran high in Iraq in the runup to a national election on April 30 . Asaib, which has formed its own party, al-Sadiqoon (the truth seekers), is accused by some Sunnis and Shiites of carrying out killings and driving families from their homes. Khazaali denies the allegations but says his movement defends Iraq against terrorism. Some of Asaib's members are in Syria defending the shrine of Sayyida Zainab in Damascus. Pictures of its slain fighters from Syria can be seen around Baghdad and Shi'ite cities across the south. Khazaali was an aide to Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr and led his own faction of fighters, who broke away from Sadr's Mahdi Army militia. At the height of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007, some of the worst attacks on Sunnis were blamed on Asaib.","28 killed and more than 40 wounded at a rally in eastern Baghdad .

"By . Darren Boyle . Three people were killed and twenty two were injured following clashes between anti-government protestors and police in Thailand. The violence has flared over planned elections in July which are likely to be postponed because of the ongoing tension. Caretaker prime minister Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan was holding a meeting with the country's Election Commission when protestors stormed a military compound where the talks were taking place. Three people were killed and more than 20 injured after security forces attacked protestors at the Bangkok Democracy Monument . Protestors stormed the Royal Thai Airforce base in Bangkok to disrupt a meeting between the nation's interim Prime Minister and the Election Commission . More than 100 protestors managed to get past riot police to bring an end to the meeting to fix a date for the next general election . The Prime Minister was forced to flee the military compound after 100 protesters entered through a side gate, despite a heavy police and military presence. Protestors blew whistles and flew Thai flags forcing security officials to evacuate the Prime Minister and several of his cabinet. The protesters were followed into the air force academy by opposition leader Suthep Thaugsuban. Lt General Paradom Pattanathabutr said: 'The government side agreed that we should leave for our own safety,' said Lt. Gen. Paradorn Pattanathabutr, a senior government official who attended the meeting. 'The protesters wanted to get in, so we had to leave in our vehicles immediately.' He said the government has suggested that future meetings be held by teleconference. Anti-government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban said the planned election on July 20 could not go ahead . After the commotion ended, Election Commissioner Somchai Srisuthiyakorn cast doubt on the likelihood of an election taking place July 20 - a date the commission had selected but still requires a royal endorsement to become official. 'It looks like it will be impossible for the general election to take place on July 20.' Last week, Thailand's constitutional . court removed former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and nine of her cabinet over claims of nepotism. Protesters . want the courts to install a 'neutral' prime minister, although senior . government figures suggest this would be a 'judicial coup'. The elections are due to take place on July 20 although protestors want the nation's constitutional court to instal a 'neutral' prime minister . Since the protests begun in November, almost 30 people have been killed and an estimated 800 injured . Government political sources claim that any attempt to 'impose' a new prime minister would result in a 'judicial coup' Several hours after the meeting with the government and the Election Commission was abandoned, security forces attacked protestors near the Bangkock Democracy Monument, where demonstrators have been camping out over the past six months. Police Colonel Krailert Buakaew said at least three grenades were detonated and machine guns fired at the protestors during the early morning attack. Colonel Buakaew said one sleeping protester and a volunteer guard were both killed during the attack. The Erawan Medical Centre said at least three people were killed and 21 wounded. Since the protests begun in November, 28 people have been killed and approximately 800 injured. Former popular prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra was deposed by a military coup in 2006 after the telecoms billionaire was accused of being corrupt and disrespecting King Bhumibol Adulvedej.","Protestors storm election planning meeting forcing Prime Minister to flee .

"By . Belinda Robinson . and Lucy Crossley . A father is thought to have killed his ex-wife and then himself while their three daughters slept after she started up a new relationship with a teenager. Hayley Stringer, 29, and her estranged husband David, 32, were discovered dead at a house in Walsall in the West Midlands, while their three daughters Chloe, 11, Chelsea, 8 and seven-year-old Lottie were safe in bed. It is thought that Mrs Stringer’s new partner Matthew Read discovered the bodies and called the emergency services. Detectives are now thought to believe that the case is a murder-suicide with West Midlands Police not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Tragedy: Estranged couple, named locally as Hayley (left) and David Stringer (right), were found stabbed to death at their home in Walsall, West Midlands . It is expected that post-mortem examinations will rule out the involvement of a third party. Police had arrested a man, believed to be Mr Read, in connection with the investigation but he has since been released without charge. Last night the 19-year-old from Cannock in Staffordshire, who Mrs Stringer is thought to have met at work, declined to comment. One neighbour of Mrs Stringer has spoken of how she was woken early on Saturday by a woman’s screams. She added: ‘That must have been Hayley. It was awful – it’s been on my mind all the time since. Annette Johnson, 60, said she too had been woken up by the sound of a woman's screams shortly after midnight, and had then seen the flashing blue lights of police cars at around 4am. Estranged: The couple, whose daughters aged 11, eight and seven were unhurt, had split earlier this year, and Mrs Stringer had started a relationship with a younger man, neighbours said . Matthew Read, 19, who is thought to have discovered the bodies of Hayley Stringer, 29 and her estranged husband David . 'I knew Hayley and the girls very well and would speak to them quite a lot,' she said. 'I didn't know David as well because he worked a lot but I would still say hello or wave to him. 'Hayley was lovely, she was always talking to people and had time for everyone. 'They moved here about three years ago, I don't know where they came from. They seemed to be a normal happy family.' Mrs Johnson said she had heard of the couple's split, but she had not spoken to Mrs Stringer about it. 'I saw that she was in a relationship with this young lad on Facebook too,' she said. Tributes: Bouquets of flowers were left outside the couple's home by shocked friends . Investigation: The floral tributes were left alongside the red-brick home as officers continued to search the property for clues as to how the couple met their death . 'I would see them walking together in the street but I don't know if he was living there. 'It is just so sad for the girls. The oldest one starts big school next year and she won't get a uniform bought from her mother. It's tragic.' Another neighbour said Mrs Stringer had ‘kicked out’ her husband only three weeks ago adding: ‘We’ve heard David came back.’ Although Mr Stringer, who worked for a metal importing and distribution company, was not the natural father of Chloe, neighbours said he raised her as his own. The father had changed his Facebook profile picture to a picture of his three ‘angels’ fewer than three weeks ago. On her Facebook page, Mrs Stringer - who worked for Spanish-owned engineering firm Gestamp Automocion in Cannock, Staffordshire - had listed herself as being in a new relationship with bespectacled Mr Read in April. Patrol: Police stand outside the property on Hollemeadow Avenue in Walsall . Murder scene: A man and woman have have been found dead with stab wounds, at a house in Walsall . Post mortem examinations of the bodies were due to be conducted yesterday, with the results expected to be released tomorrow. Mr Stringer, who was a darts fan, has a twin sister Zoe and a younger sister, Natalie, 31, who were both too upset to comment yesterday. Chloe’s father is Dean Gallagher from Burntwood, Staffordshire. He did not return messages last night. Although a precise cause of death has not yet been established, detectives believe both victims died as a result of knife injuries. Police officers also recovered a weapon at the house. Detectives have been carrying out house to house enquiries and forensics officers are at the scene in a bid to try and establish what happened. Detective Inspector Caroline Corfield: 'The man who will face no further action is fully supportive of our investigation. Probe: A forensics officer at work outside the house where the two bodies were discovered . 'He has provided the team with invaluable information which has led us one step closer to uncovering the truth.' The three children are being cared for by family members and specialist family liaison officers are also supporting the victim's families. DI Corfield added: 'Two families have experienced a tragedy and three young girls have been robbed of a mother. Our thoughts remain with them today. 'So that we can provide much needed answers for them and the local community a large team of detectives, forensic examiners and others from West Midlands Police are working really hard to get to the bottom of what happened. Evidence: A car is carried away from the scene and a murder inquiry has been launched by West Midlands Police . 'We're keeping an open mind as to what took place inside the house and are exploring a number of possibilities. 'If we're to get to the truth I'd ask anyone with information which may move the investigation forward to call us. Please don't assume that someone will have already told us what you know or what you've heard.' Shocked friends and neighbours had placed bouquets of flowers outside the home. One of the floral tributes from Mr Stringer's work colleagues wrote: 'RIP Dave & Hayley. From the lads at Holme Dodsworth' - a metal importing and distribution company that he lists as his job on his Facebook page. Another tribute read: 'Dave mate so sorry you've gone. One of the nicest blokes I've ever met.' And a third card left outside the house added: 'Our hearts are filled with sorrow. Nothing can ever take away the love of a good friend and fond memories linger of the good times with you and your girls. 'To the girls thinking of you now your mom and dad are angles watching over you. RIP.'

And on Wednesday evening two gunmen posing as prospective clients, burst into his office and opened fire. 'He was shot five times and succumbed to his injuries on the way to hospital,' a policeman told Reuters. Hafeez had been in prison without being able to find a lawyer until Rehman agreed to represent him in February. 'Rightful end': An injured colleague of Mr Rehman arrives at hospital after the attack. A day after his death, an unsigned pamphlet was distributed in Multan saying Rehman met his 'rightful end' for trying to 'save someone who disrespected the Prophet Mohammed' Saying goodbye: Rehman began receiving threats from other lawyers as soon as he took on the case, according to the commission . Grief: Mourners pay their respects at Mr Rehman's funeral yesterday. he was described as a 'fearless human rights lawyer' who dedicated his life to 'helping the downtrodden' Blasphemy carries the death penalty in Pakistan but the accused are often lynched or languish for years in jail without trial because lawyers are too afraid to defend them. Rights groups say the laws are increasingly used to seize money or property. Judges have previously been attacked in Pakistan for acquitting blasphemy defendants and two politicians who discussed reforming the law were shot dead. The crime of blasphemy was sealed into Pakistani law under British rule but strengthened during the years of military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (pictured), who died in a plane crash in 1988. In recent years, however, the country - which is 96 per cent Muslim - has seen a surge in accusations of insulting Islam, says Islamabad-based think-tank, the Center for Research and Security Studies. But many analysts see the claims as score-settling or a front for property grabs, and in fact have nothing to do with Islam. If found guilty, defendants can expect the death penalty. The charges are hard to fight because the law does not define blasphemy so presenting the evidence can sometimes itself be considered a fresh infringement. It can also be very difficult to find a lawyer willing to defend those accused of the crime. Blasphemy carries the death penalty in .

On Thursday morning, an unsigned pamphlet was distributed in Multan saying Rehman met his 'rightful end' for trying to 'save someone who disrespected the Prophet Mohammed'. 'We warn all lawyers to be afraid of god and think twice before engaging in such acts,' the pamphlet said. Rehman worked for the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP). He frequently denounced the repression of Pakistan's dwindling religious minorities. 'He was a dedicated activist from the very beginning,' senior HRCP official Zaman Khan told The independent. 'All his life he was helping the downtrodden. He was fearless and never gave any time to the threats. He said he would live for the struggle and die for the struggle.' Rehman began receiving threats from other lawyers as soon as he took on the case, according to the commission. 'During arguments for acquittal of the accused, three persons addressed defense lawyer Rashid Rehman, in the judge's presence, and said: 'You will not come to court next time because you will not exist any more',' the commission said in April. HRCP chairwoman Zohra Yusuf said she was devastated.'We have lost four human rights defenders in the last three years. Others are under constant threat. The state does not even notice,' she said. At least 16 people are on death row in Pakistan for blasphemy and at least 20 are serving life sentences. Many others are in prison despite not having been convicted. At least 52 people accused of blasphemy have been lynched since 1990, according to a 2012 report from the Islamabad-based Center for Research and Security Studies think tank.

"By . Michael Zennie . A U.S. Army investigation found that Bowe Bergdahl had walked away from his post at least once before his capture - and that other soldiers in his unit knew he was a flight risk. The 2010 report, called an AR15-6, is still classified, but it appears to confirm allegations that the former prisoner of war violated military regulations - and that the Pentagon knew it all along. The revelation, attributed to anonymous sources by the Military Times, comes as the nation's top general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, acknowledged the growing cloud of suspicion hanging over Bergdahl. The Military Times report says that investigators who looked into the June 2009 capture of Bergdahl found that several soldiers from his unit said he had talked openly about wanting to leave the forward operating base where he was stationed. Scroll down for videos . AWOL? Bowe Bergdahl, pictured with pipe in mouth manning an observation post . months before his disappearance, left a note telling his fellow soldiers . that he was leaving to start a new life, did not want to fight for . America and did not believe in war . Trial? Bergdahl (in T-shirt)faces the threat of desertion charges, the Army . announced just days after Obama's national security advisor Susan Rice . said he served with 'honor and distinction' Penalty: . A former comrade of Bergdahl's (seated with Blackfoot Company, 1st . Battalion 501st infantry Regiment (Airborne) 25th Infantry Division in . Afghanistan) said he should face the firing squad for what he did . They found he may have left the base at least once before, as well. 'We have no indication that he intended to leave permanently,' an official told the Military Times. However, a different source described as a former senior military official, told the New York Times that Bergdahl left a startling note in his tent saying that he no longer supported the Army mission in Afghanistan and that he was leaving to start a new life. Even amid the mounting evidence that Bergdahl left his post, military law experts told the Military Times that it was unlikely Bergdahl would be court martialed and imprisoned. 'I don’t think they’ll do that in this case,' Eugene Fidell, the former president of the National . Institute of Military Justice, said. 'Unless something comes to light that suggests that he was a turncoat or joined the other side or assisted the other side in some way. … There is no public indication that any of those things are true in his case.' The military has a history of over-looking infractions committed by prisoners of war. However, in 2004, Charles Robert Jenkins was sentenced to 30 days in jail for his 1965 desertion in Korea. He was captured by the North Koreans and spent decades as a prisoner there before being released in 2002. Premeditated: Soldiers claim Bergdahl (pictured in proof of life video) planned his desertion. He sent belongings home, learned the language, did not breach the perimeter fence on the day he disappeared and would spend his time learning the local languages. He even told them he wanted to walk to China . Killed in the search: Staff Sergeant Clayton Bowen, 29, (left) and .

Matthew Michael Martinek, 20, (right) died after a rocket-propelled . grenade ambush on September 4, 2009 . There are a variety of offenses related to an absence without proper approval, and a number of potential actions could be taken by the military. He could be tried by court martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for desertion; he could be given a non-judicial punishment for a lesser charge, such as being away without leave. And he could be given credit for time already served while he was a prisoner. Lisa Schenck, a former military judge who is now a professor at George Washington University's law school, told US News and World Report that Bergdahl already have a charge sheet listing alleged crimes as the remnants of an earlier 2010 Pentagon investigation, where they reportedly found 'incontrovertible' evidence that he left the base voluntarily. She said that one of the possible punishments for abandoning one's post during a time of war is the death penalty. Others think that it is unlikely that he will be issued a death order, especially in light of the massive effort that the government went through to retrieve him. 'Death is still a lawful sentence for desertion in a time of war, I’m not suggesting that’s not in the realm of possibilities for a case like this... there could be significant punishment, significant confinement,' Victor Hansen, a former military prosecutor who teaches at the New England School of Law. In the past 150 years, there have only been two cases when a soldier has been executed for desertion, and the last time was in 1945. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Depsey suggested that the military would investigate Bergdahl's record. 'As . for the circumstances of his capture, when he is able to provide them, . we’ll learn the facts. Like any American, he is innocent until proven . guilty. Our Army’s leaders will not look away from misconduct if it . occurred. In the meantime, we will continue to care for him and his . family,' he wrote. He could, however, be quielty discharged from the Army for medical or other reasons, the Military Times reports. The . post was shared more than 1,000 times and has garnered more than 600 . comments, including many from people calling for Bergdahl to be . prosecuted. Bergdahl is currently recovering at a military hospital in Germany and is being interviewed by Army doctors and psychologists. An . Army spokesman told the Military Times that he did not have lawyer. 'I’m not going to speculate on whether he needs a lawyer. Let’s just get . him back,' said a spokesman. When he returns home, Bergdahl will be entitled to back pay for the five years he was in captivity. Bergdahl . was promoted in absentia two years after he went missing, being . promoted from private first class to sergeant in September 2011. It . was reported Monday that he was scheduled for a second promotion- to . staff sergeant- in June of this year if he was not found in time. President .

"By . Joel Christie . Health officials say the murder-suicide of a Canadian mother and her autistic son should serve as a wake-up call that drastic changes need to be made within the system. The bodies of 40-year-old Angie Robinson and her 16-year-old son Robert were found inside their home in Prince Rupert, British Colombia, on April 3, reported The Province. Robert was so autistic he could not speak and would often express his frustration by heat-butting walls and people and pushing and shoving his loving, 100-pound single mother. A suicide note left by the mom, coupled with her final Facebook post, showed she felt she could longer manage Robert and that Family Services could not provide adequate support. Murder-suicide: Angie Robinson (left), a single mom in Prince Rupert, British Colombia, is believed to have given her autistic son Robert (son) a fatal dose of the prescription drug Ativan before killing herself on April 3 . Tragic: Angie Robinson had pleaded for help with her autistic son Robert - whose episodes would often turn violent - but she was unable to receive any . A series of strainful incidents with saw Angie determine 'she had lost Robert', according to family, and so she pleaded with a social worker to find a long-term placement for her son. On April 2 she was informed a long-term placement wasn't possible. She took to Facebook at 11.56am that day and wrote: 'More, more, more needs to be done for our teens with special needs, they are neglected ... Canada needs more residential and respite care for families hoping to keep their children at home.' At 3.30pm, her sister, Michelle Watson, called, but Angie asked for her to call the following day. When Angie didn't answer any calls or texts on April, Michelle and her husband Ron went to her home. After knocking for 20 minutes without a response they called police. 'The officers broke down the door and then came out, and told us not to come inside,' Ron Watson told The Province. 'They told us that Robert was found resting peacefully in his bed.' Angie is believed to have given Robert a lethal dose of the sedative Ativan. Their deaths have rocked the family. 'Angie loved him more than anything on Earth,' Ron Watson said. 'The shock for us was that she took his life' However the signs had been there for a while. In early March, Robert smashed his thread through the rear window of Angie's pick up truck during an episode. Angie Robinson struggled to control her son Robert (right - in an earlier picture) and would take him on a 5km hike each day to relax his episodes . Another episode landed him in hospital, where he was given a steady stream of Ativan pills for two hours until he calmed down. The hospital released them, giving Angle about one months supply of the pill, which accounted to several hundred. It was then Angie felt she had 'lost' her son. 'We are not blaming anyone, but we are looking for more autism services in the North so that other families don't have to go through this'  Ron Watson said. 'This is devastating.' Karen Johnston, spokeswoman for the Ministry of Children and Family Development, said the ministry cannot comment on the case for privacy reasons. Single mom Angie Robinson, 40, left a suicide note saying she no longer felt able to look after her autistic son . The ministry provides $6,000 per year for families to assist with 'out-of-school intervention services' for autistic children aged six to 18. Inclusion B.C. executive director Faith Bodnar said the ministry significantly reduced funds available to families with autistic children several years ago, and in isolated communities 'accesses to resources can be much more limited'. 'I think, unfortunately, this tragic event speaks for itself,' Bodnar said. 'People don't do these things if they are well supported. This family was alone, marginalized and not taken care of by the MCFD.'","Angie Robinson and her son Robert were found dead inside their home in Prince Rupert, British Colombia, on April 3 .

"By . Joshua Gardner . Three people were found shot dead in the Dallas area on Saturday in what police are calling a murder-suicide at the hands of a bitter ex-girlfriend. Michelle Boyer, 45, was discovered dead in her car from a self-inflicted gun shot wound. She left behind a note that police say detailed the ghastly scene she'd left behind in nearby Murphy. Police found the gunned down, partially clothed bodies of Boyer's 40-year-old ex Jonathan Masin and another woman, 38-year-old Amy Picchiotti. Scroll down for video . A town in shock: Police in the quiet Dallas suburb of Murphy say their first murder in recent memory involved the slaying of Jonathan Masin, 40, and 38-year-old Amy Picchiotti at the hands of Masin's scorned ex-girlfriend . Boyer chose to kill herself while parked in front of the home of her ex-husband, reports WFAA. Neighbors of Masin's heard what they believed were gunshots around 6:30am Saturday. Later that morning, the father of one of the victims made a call to police for a welfare check at Masin's home, leading to the discovery of the bodies. 'Found in two separate parts of the home, they were partially clothed and barefooted,' said police in Murphy, where city manager James Fisher would later note that he couldn't remember a murder of any kind in the quiet town, much less such a sensational slaying. A few miles away in Dallas, Boyer's body was found in a parked car. She was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound from the same caliber weapon as the one that killed Masin and Picchiotti. She left a note behind that contained details of the murder scene. Police stopped short of naming a motive outright, 'however, it has been confirmed that Boyer is the ex-girlfriend of Masin and it is the breakup that led to this murder-suicide,' read a police news release.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The U.S. Justice Department has filed papers accusing Russian Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, pictured, as being the leader of the gang behind the software . The . dangerous cyber pandemic known as Gameover Zeus could have infected . thousands of American computers and be lying dormant gathering data, . experts say. The malware, . which the FBI estimates has hit between 500,000 and one million . computers worldwide, has resulted in users losing tens of millions of . dollars. Gameover Zeus, . which experts say is 'sophisticated' and capable of evading anti-virus . software, infects a user's machine when they open a PDF or click on a . link sent to them in an email. Once . it is set up on the computer, Gameover Zeus will intercept all . financial transactions and rewrite them, so that payments made by the . user will be redirected into other accounts. The . malware also has the power to disguise unapproved payments that are . made, meaning that thefts might have occurred even if accounts appear . normal. 'It keeps track of . balances; it automatically corrects the numbers on the balance. It's so . sophisticated that it hides its tacks,' said Nick Savvides, senior . principal systems engineer at software giant Symantec. The . malware has hit computer users around the world, with the most . incidents reported in the U.S. and Italy – 13 percent and 12 percent . respectively. Seven percent of incidents have occurred in the UK. But .

The Gameover Zeus malware has targeted computers in the U.S. with up to one million affected worldwide . Cryptolocker is malware run by the same gang behind Gameover Zeus and they are often installed on computers at the same time. The . Cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a . 'viable' victim for Gameover Zeus and the network cannot access their . financial details. Cryptolocker locks your computer, encrypts files and demands a ransom for them to be unlocked. The U.S. Government admitted that at least one police force has been forced to pay a $750 ransom to release sensitive files. The Gameover Zeus malware was shut down by an international police effort this week, spearheaded by the FBI and Symantec. This . is the third attempt to shut down the malware, which first emerged in . 2011, and the FBI is reporting that users have two weeks to clean up . their hard drives and install anti-virus software before the network . responsible for Gameover Zeus will be operational again. Gameover . Zeus has been so difficult to shut down because it uses peer-to-peer . software, meaning that even if the main server is shut down, infected . computers can continue to communicate with one another and continue . operating. Another reason is that once installed on a computer, Gameover Zeus has the ability to evade anti-virus software. Computers . are often concurrently infected with Gameover Zeus and a separate piece . of malware, Cryptolocker, and there is some evidence linking the two . pieces of malware back to an Eastern European network. The . Cryptolocker malware often comes into effect if the user is not a . 'viable' victim for Gameover Zeus and the network cannot access their . financial details.

In the worst cases, victims could lose access to their bank accounts which could be systematically drained . According . to Symantec data, three percent of people affected by the Cryptolocker . malware pay the ransom rather than lose their files and paying the . ransom seems to be the only way for users to gain access to their files . once they have been attacked.

But . the FBI has already spent years looking for Russian Evgeniy . Mikhailovich Bogachev who uses the online names ‘lucky12345’ and . ‘slavik’. The . 31-year-old is already wanted for his alleged involvement in a . ‘racketeering enterprise’ that installed malicious software known as . ‘Zeus’ on victims’ computers. The . software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal . identification numbers, and other information needed to log into online . banking accounts. The . FBI believes Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator . while others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and . phishing emails, which contained links to compromised websites. Victims . who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which . Bogachev and others allegedly used to steal money from the victims’ bank . accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009. Starting in September 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as Gameover Zeus (GOZ). It . is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer . infections, resulting in financial losses in the hundreds of millions of . dollars. On .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A couple in upstate New York have killed themselves in an apparent joint suicide by jumping in front of a freight train on Sunday. Earl and Mary Myatt were killed by an oncoming train on tracks near Verona just moments after calling their son and apologizing for what was about to happen. 'He called me at 1:35, and at 1:37, they were dead,' the couple's 30-year-old son Brad Myatt said. Died together: Earl and Mary Myatt, both 59, had been married for 42 years. Police said they are now investigating the deaths as murder-suicide as it is believed that Mary was too disabled to make a decision to end her life . 'He just said he loved me and he was sorry,' Brad told the Utica Observer-Dispatch. Police found a suicide note in Mr Myatt's car and surveillance footage indicates that they were purposefully waiting for the right moment. 'We have witnesses who said they heard a warning horn … but there is video that shows they stood right on the tracks waiting for it to come,' state trooper spokesman Jack Keller told the Utica Observer-Dispatch. Mr Keller said that is is not clear why they chose that particular point in the train's path, as Verona is about six miles away from their hometown of Oneida. He added that the investigation is still ongoing and they are talking to family and friends to get a better understanding of what happened leading up to their deaths. Troopers will also be staging a reconstruction of the crash to see if the train slowed at all before hitting the long-married couple. The stress of deteriorating health was weighing down heavily on the couple, who were both 59-years-old, as Mrs Myatt was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm in late January. She spent a month in intensive care and underwent several surgeries, the most recent only two weeks ago. Close: Brad Myatt (right) said that his father (left) had been stressed in the wake of Mary's brain aneurism and ensuing operations . Her two sons and husband visited her constantly but struggled to see her in pain as her motor functions and abilities were reduced to that of a toddler. Even in her final moments, when Mr Myatt put his wife on the phone with Brad, he said 'I'll see you soon' and he was unable to understand her response, which he said was common after the diagnosis. 'He was saddened by what she had been reduced to... He missed his wife,' Brad Myatt said. 'We’re devastated... but I want everyone to know that my father was a good man, and my mother was an angel who would do anything for anybody.' End scene: State police troopers said surveillance footage shows that Mr Myatt ignored a warning horn and looked to be purposefully waiting until the exact time that the train was approaching to get on the tracks . The couple met when they were 17 years old and had been married for 42 years at the time of their death. He rearranged his work schedule at the Mohawk Valley Community College bookstore so that he started at 3.30am and was able to finish earlier in the afternoon in order to spend more time with his ailing wife. 'We were spoiled in receiving two fantastic parents,' Brad told Syracuse.com. 'She was his world.'","Earl and Mary Myatt, both 59, had been married for 42 years before jumping to their deaths on Sunday .

"By . Damien Gayle . Dozens of people have died in Kenya after drinking a toxic batch of illicit moonshine thought to be laced with industrial alcohol. Many more victims are fighting for their lives in hospital and some have even gone blind after the bootleg liquor went on sale in four counties in the east African country. Reports on local television showed victims writhing in pain in hospitals in the eastern and central counties of Embu, Kitui and Kiambu. Poisoned: Sick drinkers lie in Embu hospital after consuming the brew which has killed more than 60 in Kenya. Authorities say that the illicit moonshine was laced with methanol, an industrial alcohol that is neurotoxic . A man in agony waits to be seen by doctors: As little as 10ml of pure methanol can destroy the optic nerve, rendering drinkers blind . Lethal brew: Many victims are fighting for their lives in hospital and some have even gone blind after the bootleg liquor went on sale in four counties in the east African country . David Kimaiyo, Kenya's police chief, said it seems likely all 61 of the known victims were poisoned by the same batch of homemade liquor. He said it was probably laced with methanol - a cheap industrial variety of alcohol added to give it more kick, but which is poisonous to the nervous system. As little as 10ml of pure methanol can destroy the optic nerve, rendering drinkers blind. Reports of deaths first began to emerge on Sunday night, said Mr Kimaiyo. In Kiambu County, where 11 people have died, local Police Commander James Mugera said authorities were looking out for more victims. Embu Police Commander William Okello said at least 24 people died while 77 were in hospital after consuming the brew. Police have arrested a woman there; her husband is also among the dead. John Mututho, chairman of the state-run National Authority for the Campaign Against Alcohol and Drug Abuse, echoed police claims that the spirits all probably originated from the same batch. Drinking dens selling illicit home brews from jerry cans are common in the back streets of many impoverished neighbourhoods in Kenya. Mr Mututho, a former MP, helped bring in an alcohol control law in 2010, but to little effect. 'One of the ladies who is now blind said they started drinking at 5 a.m.,' Mr Mututho told Citizen TV. 'There is no outlet in Kenya which is authorised to open at 5am In fact, the earliest it should be (is) 5pm.'

A nurse checks patients' drips: Methanol poisoning can be treated with ethanol or fomepizole . With more than half of Kenyans living below the poverty line, few can afford to buy legally sanctioned alcoholic drinks. Illicit brews are popular, but occasionally lead to deaths when unscrupulous traders lace them with methanol to boost profits. In June 2005, 45 people were killed from illegal alcohol laced with methanol to boost its strength. Five years earlier, about 130 people died from a toxic batch in Nairobi.","Kenyan police say that it is likely the same batch poisoned all the victims .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A bridegroom who raped a teenage girl on his wedding night while his pregnant wife slept in the next room was jailed for 18 years today. William Jordan carried out the sickening attack when he was 18 after tying the knot at Hammersmith town hall in west London. The newlywed couple had spent the night celebrating at a friend’s home with other friends and family before turning in. Jailed: William Jordan was sentenced to 18 years in jail for raping two girls in the 1970s . He had snuck out of the bed he was sharing with his wife and raped a 14-year-old girl. His victim was too terrified to tell anyone what had happened and blocked out the memory for years to come. Jordan, who is now 59, has finally been brought to justice 41 years after the attack, which took place on April 20, 1973. In 1977 Jordan began abusing another young girl when she came to babysit his two children once a month, the Old Bailey heard. When he and his wife went to the pub Jordan would sneak away and rape the 11-year-old at his home before going back ‘as though nothing had happened’. The attacks carried on for the next two years. The judge, Mr Recorder Oliver Sells, QC, branded Jordan a ‘devious, predatory abuser’ as he sentenced him to a total of 18 years imprisonment. The judge said: ‘On your wedding night after a ceremony at the town hall you and your new wife, who was heavily pregnant and only 16 years of age, retired for the night to the house of some friends. ‘During that night, your wedding night, you went into the room of the child and raped her forcefully. ‘She has blocked out that incident from her mind and was unable for good and powerful reasons from speaking about it and has for many, many years kept silent.’ He continued: ‘After the wedding in 1973 you and your wife had children. ‘As they grew up an 11-year-old girl came over to your house to babysit about once a month over a two-year period. ‘She already had a miserable home life, a violent father and uncaring mother. She told the jury that she loved your two children and being with them was for her a brief escape. ‘You knew all this and yet you abused your position of power. ‘When you and your wife went out to the public house you would pop back to your home and rape that young child before going back to the pub as though nothing had happened. ‘This state of affairs only ended when the child was taken into care.’ The judge added: ‘She told the jury there was no one she could tell and no one who would believe her. ‘If she had told what you did she would be beaten and treated even more badly. Ordeal: The judge praised the victims' dignity and courage in speaking out and giving testimony at the trial (picture posed by model) ‘Both these women’s childhoods were blighted and their lives remain affected to this day by your conduct.’He commended both the women for their courage in speaking out and ‘fighting their demons’. ‘They both endured decades of undeserved silence, shame and suffering,’ Judge Sells said. ‘You enjoyed decades of undeserved freedom, status in your family and the power of an abuser. ‘Finally they both in middle age found the courage to speak out. They gave their evidence in open court in full view with great dignity. ‘They fought their demons and gave a compelling account of what you had done to them.’ He added: ‘You were a devious, predatory abuser of children over a period of years.’ Judge Sells continued: ‘It’s clear the jury found their accounts moving. ‘I hope they [the victims] now feel the justice to which they are entitled has been done.’ The court heard Jordon was convicted of another sexual offence in 1980. Defence barrister Tim Starkey said he suffers from a number of health conditions including epilepsy. Jordan, from Hammersmith, denied the charges, but was convicted by a jury of three counts of rape. He will remain on the sex offenders register for life.","William Jordan raped a 14-year-old after marrying in a London town hall .

The website reports how neighbours said . the woman's mother had been ‘behaving strangely’ on the day of the . gruesome murder and that she could be seen collecting various items in . the house. Sources revealed that in the days before her death, Amunyoko's two brothers had been 'chased' from the property by their mother, who may have been suffering from a mental illness described as 'not severe'. The mother of Magdalena Nunyango Amunyoko is set to appear at Oshakati Magistrates' Court in Namibia . The neighbour said: ‘That woman has been acting strangely of late and that day (Friday), we saw her through the windows packing her TV sets and decoders but we just thought she was moving out of the house or something and we could not ask her because she had not spoken to us for some months.’ One of the suspect’s two sons is reported to have come to the family home and after becoming suspicious, searched the house – only to find his sister’s remains behind the property. Amunyoko was reportedly raised by her grandmother at their home village at Okakukaumbe-Okando in Omusati Region but she went to live with her mother when she graduated as a teacher.

"By . Chris Paine . Jon Whiteford, pictured, collected his mother's benefits for three years after she died . A man kept his dead mother in a freezer for three years while spending her social security money - and then killed himself as police unraveled the mystery. Police in Kentucky suspect Jon Whiteford dumped the body of his mother, Faye, who would have been 96 this year, at an empty house after he was forced to move out of the home they had shared. A detective found the body in the garden on April 23 and wrapped in plastic. The grim case began to unfold in February, when federal investigators contacted Sheriff Todd Wood for help in locating Faye Whiteford, a retired school teacher, and her son. The Social Security Administration was paying monthly benefits to Faye Whiteford, but she had not logged a medical claim in her name for about three years - an obvious red flag, given her age. Federal agents told sheriff's detectives that Whiteford's son had access to her finances. Jon Whiteford decided to continue drawing his mother's Social Security and retirement benefits, making the 'fateful decision' to hide her body in a freezer until he was forced to move out of their home, according to Wood's office. Detectives went to Whiteford's home in Science Hill, Somerset Hill, but it was empty. The Columbus Dispatch said in early March, police located the 59-year-old son when he went to the Social Security office in Somerset to apply for benefits in his name. Whiteford told police that his home had been repossessed and that he had been living in his car. He also confirmed that his mother was dead, but he refused to say how or when she died or tell them where her body was. Faye Whiteford, who would have turned 96 this year, was kept in a freezer and found wrapped in plastic . As police investigated, they learned that Jon Whiteford was staying at a house next door to where he had lived with his mother in Science Hill. A deputy went to the house on March 29 to talk to Whiteford again. As the deputy stood at the door, Whiteford pulled a pistol and killed himself, said Lt. detective Brett Whitaker. Police kept trying to find out what had happened to Faye Whiteford. They eventually received information suggesting that her son had been trying to rent a house in neighbouring Wayne County. On April 23, Whitaker went to that house, an older structure in need of repair in a rural area. Whitaker found a tied-up tarpaulin lying in the yard beside the driveway at the house, with Faye Whiteford's body inside. The body's identity was confirmed this week, state police said. The investigation indicated that Faye Whiteford had been bedridden for several years, and that her son was her primary caregiver and had control of her finances. She didn't have other close relatives nearby, Whitaker said. People who knew the family said Whiteford died of natural causes sometime in 2011.","Police find body of Jon Whiteford's mother, Faye, wrapped in plastic .

"By . Joel Christie . and Ashley Collman . A 52-year-old Michigan man convicted of the shooting murder of his sister and her husband in a crime of incestuous passion went on a one-hour rant about God and his innocence before being sentenced to two life sentences on Monday. Ryan Wyngarden rambled on about how he had been framed by police over the 1987 slayings, saying he will soon be 'vindicated' by the Lord and even called the judge a liar. But his protestations were not enough to convince the jury - who found him guilty of two counts of first-degree murder - or Ottawa County Circuit Judge Jon Hulsing, who said Wyngarden was a controlling, calculated killer before handing down the dual prison terms without the possibility of parole. 'You are a brutal, cold-blooded murderer,' Judge Husling said, according to M Live. Ryan Wyngarden cries during his appearance at Ottawa County Circuit Court in Grand Haven, Mich., while making a statement before his sentencing on Monday, April 21, 2014. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the 1987 killings of Gail and Rick Brink, his sister and brother-in-law . Ryan Wyngarden appears at Ottawa County Circuit Court in Grand Haven, Mich., for his sentencing on Monday . Ryan Wyngarden went on a rambling one-hour rant at his sentencing hearing in  last-ditch effort to show his innocence . 'You put two bullets in the face of your brother-in-law. 'This was a brutal execution. This was a brutal homicide.' Wyngarden shot and killed his sister Gail Brink and her husband Rick on November 21, 1987, with a .22-caliber revolver at the couple's rural Ransom Street home north of Holland. Rick Brink was shot while in his truck. His wife was shot while in bed. Prosecutors cited Wyngarden's sexual history with his sister as motivation for the murders. They said he was worried his sister would tell her husband about their teenage sexual encounters. The case remained cold for over a decade until detectives convinced Wyngarden's wife Pam to testify against her husband, telling the story about how he had tearfully confessed to her. At a hearing last year, Pam recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders, just three months after they first started dating. Combative: Wyngarden had to be warned several times not to talk out of order when he became argumentative during his trial last month . Suspect: Ryan Wyngarden, 52, argued with prosecutors in court on March 25 as they questioned him about the incestuous relationship he had with his sister . Crime of passion: Rick and Gail Brink were found murdered in their Park Township, Michigan home on November, 21 1987 . Case reopened: The Brink murders were a cold case for many years until Wyngarden's wife came forward, and told authorities that her husband confessed to the crimes . 'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, ""What's wrong?"" and he said, ""I shot and killed Rick and Gail"". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.' When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said. But in court this week, Wyngarden tried to convince the jury that those sexually-related incidents wouldn't have provided a motive for killing his sister. In his testimony, Wyngarden admitted to having three sexual experiences with Gail, but denied the two ever had intercourse. The first instance happened when Wyngarden was 12 and his sister was nine. He said they were naked and 'just playing around...comparing body parts' when their mom came into the room. 'There was nothing sexual about it,' he said. The next time the two had a sexual encounter was one or two years later when the siblings were smoking marijuana. 'We just groped on each other a little bit. There was no clothing that ever came off. That was pretty much that,' he said. The final instance happened when Wyngarden was 15 and again involved marijuana.Wyngarden described the encounter as 'consensual' and says the two touched genitals but it didn't escalate to sex. 'My sister did not lose her virginity to me,' he said. 'I wouldn't have killed my sister over this.' Having to talk about the sexual encounters caused Wyngarden to become antagonistic with the prosecutor, constantly talking out of turn. At one point the judge had to order the jury out of the court room so he could warn Wyngarden not to talk over the prosecutor. 'Mr. Wyngarden, you can’t argue with me,' the judge said. 'This isn’t going to end well for you with the jury.' It was also revealed in court this week that Wyngarden tried to convince his wife Pam not to testify in the trial after he was arrested for the murders last year. Secrets laid bare: Wife Pam Wyngarden cries as she takes the stand to testify against her husband on Tuesday, March 25, 2014 . Happier times: The Wyngarden couple pictured together before the startling revelations . He sent 29 letters to Pam in the span of six months while he was in jail waiting for arrival, sometimes threatening her with God's spite. 'I am beyond belief that Pam sticks to this lie, but I truly believe God's light will bring the truth' he wrote in one letter. Wyngarden's defense argued that the Brinks were victims in a case of a mistaken identity. The couple had recently moved into a home vacated by residents who had links to the narcotics trade and connections to a Detroit-area biker game. Short-lived marriage: Gail and Rick Brink had been married for only 18 months when they were found dead . Wyngarden suffered emotional highs and lows throughout the sentencing, crying at points and flaring up at others. At one point he quoted from the Bible, then said in a loud voice: 'Lord, I didn’t do this. You know I didn't do this. I just told the truth. I didn't kill my sister and you know it.' 'So, here I am, an innocent man, shackled … for no reason other than what Repper and Blakely suggested (to his wife).' He talked about the night his daughter, 'my little angel sent down from heaven', was conceived. He urged his children to be 'good citizens, don't cheat, lie, steal, be a good neighbor, be quick to forgive'. At several points, he wept. 'Innocent man, stripped of your family, stripped of your wife, because of a bunch of lies,' he said. Wyngarden's tirade only cemented opinions that he committed the killings, Assistant Ottawa County Prosecutor Lee Fisher said. 'He's definitely not in touch with reality,' he said. The conviction helps both families, he said. 'I think it means closure, and justice was done. 'They don't have to wonder anymore what happened to their brother and Gail.'","Ryan Wyngarden, 52, of Ottawa County, Michigan, went on a one hour rant about his innocence in court on Monday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Suncor employee has been mauled to death by a black bear at an oil sands site in Canada, as her helpless co-workers watched in horror. Lorna Weafer, 36, was dragged from her seven colleagues and brutally attacked yesterday while she was doing electrical work at the remote Fort McMurray, Alberta site. Her work mates, who weren't carrying bear spray, blasted air horns to scare the animal away, but couldn't save the instrument technician. 'People tried to stop it and do . everything they could,' union spokesman Scott Doherty told CBC News. 'Obviously, they are fairly horrified . at what they saw and witnessed.'

Tragic: A black bear dragged Lorna Weafer, 36 (pictured left and right) from her co-workers and mauled her to death on Wednesday afternoon . Responding police officers shot dead an aggressive bear prowling around the work site. CTV News reported tests are underway to determine whether it was the same bear that killed Weafer. 'There are a lot of people on these sites, so we had to take the safety of those people into account,' Ft. McMurray RCMP spokesman Cpl. George Cameron told Global News. 'That’s probably the main reason why the bear was shot. We didn’t want this unfortunate incident to happen again.' A wildlife officer investigating the tragic incident said the attack was 'predatory' and there were no 'non-natural attractants' at the remote site. Bear behavior expert Stephen Herrero said such attacks are 'exceedingly rare', with the last black bear attack in Alberta occurring about 13 years ago. 'Something in the bear says 'Maybe this is something I can capture kill and eat',' Herrero, from the University of Calgary, told Global News.

'This is an absolutely tragic event,' Suncor spokesperson Sneh Seetal said. 'We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families.' Seetal said workers are regularly trained on how to interact with wildlife. Union spokesman Scott Doherty said the union plans to conduct a full review into the incident, which is the third third work fatality in four months at the Suncor site. 'If there needs to be a revision or some additional procedures and policies in place to ensure the safety of workers from wildlife attacks, we are definitely going to do that,' he said.","Black bear mauled to death instrument technician Lorna Weafer yesterday .

"By . Sally Lee . Prosecutors have called for a life sentence for the man who bashed a 10-month-old baby to death during a burglary at a home in Bendigo on June 15, 2012. The Supreme Court was told 21-year-old Harley Hicks, of North Bendigo, hit Zayden Veal-Whitting more than 30 times in the face and head with a baton made of copper wire wrapped in tape. Prosecutor Michelle Williams said there was 'almost has no explanation' for the murder. Scroll down for video . Victim: 10-month-old Zayden Veal was found lying in blood-stained sheets in his cot. He died after suffering a heart attack and multiple injuries . Baby Zayden, who was murdered in 2012, pictured with his brother older Xavier . The killer: Harley Hicks was responsible for the murder of the innocent baby . 'We consider what he did was an extreme, extreme way to respond to any thought of self-preservation, to react in such a violent way,' she told the Victorian Supreme Court in Bendigo on Monday. Zayden's mother Casey Veal, who frantically tried to revive her baby after finding him in blood-stained sheets in his cot, said she and her older son Xavier 'both died that day'. 'I may stand before you alive and breathing but I'm but a shadow of my former self,' she wrote in a victim impact statement read to the court. Distressed mother, Casey Veal, frantically tried to revive her son . The house that was broken into by Hicks and where Zayden was murdered . Forensic police attended the crime scene in Bendigo . 'This also has denied Xavier the mother he once knew. 'Xavier lost not only his brother but his true mother.' Ms Williams told Justice Stephen Kaye the prosecution wanted a life sentence with a non-parole period. 'I will repeat that it is an evil killing without any rational explanation, so we will maintain our submission for a life sentence, however we say that it is appropriate for your honour to apply a minimum sentence.' She said a minimum term is consistent with sentences involving the murder of children including that of Robert Farquharson, who drowned his three sons in a car on Father's Day in 2005. Defence barrister David Gallowes agreed with the gravity of Hicks' crime but said his client's consumption of alcohol, marijuana and ice before it might have contributed to its ferocity.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . An Indian teenager sliced off his tongue with a blunt blade in an extreme act of devotion to his Hindu God. Lalmohan Soren, 17, was sitting at Mahedevgarha Temple, in Dugda, Jharkhand, when worshippers spotted blood splattered across the floor as they filled the temple for their morning prayers. Lalmohan's tongue was inside a bowl next to his feet with a note saying: ‘I have cut off my tongue and offered it to Lord Shiva. 'Please do not throw me out of the temple, I just want to sit here at the feet of the Lord’. Extreme act of devotion: Indian teenager Lalmohan Soren sliced off his tongue with a blunt blade in an attempt to earn the blessing of his God Lord Shiva at a Hindu temple in Dugda, Jharkhand . Horrific: Lalmohan Soren, 17, was sitting at Mahedevgarha Temple (above) when worshippers spotted blood splattered across the floor as they filled the temple for their morning prayers . The temple leader was informed and eventually he managed to persuade Lalmohan to go to hospital. Doctors tried stitching his tongue back together but failed and eventually Lalmohan was discharged after a few days. This area of India is infamous for its superstitious Santhal tribes who practice unusual rituals to please their Gods. Lalmohan is now at home recovering - unable to talk and feeding on a liquid diet - but proud of his actions. 'His future is up to the Gods': Lalmohan is now recovering at home with his family - unable to talk and feeding on a liquid diet - but proud of his actions . His family are both shocked but accepting of his actions. Mother Lalmuni Soren said: 'My son has been involved in religious practises since childhood. 'He takes a keen interest in rituals, but I never believed he’d one day severe his tongue to please the Gods. ‘I don’t know what will happen to him now, he’ll never be able talk properly again, so what future he will have is up to the Gods.' However, the mother-of-four was sure her son would be blessed. Doctors tried stitching his tongue (blurred out) back together but failed and eventually Lalmohan was discharged after a few days . She added: ‘My son has sacrificed his tongue to please the God so we’re sure the God will fulfil his wishes and give him a good life.’ Locals are surprised at the media attention Lalmohan's actions have attracted as this kind of ritual is normal in their community, saying 'there’s nothing new in it'. Manoj Sharma, a local resident, said: ‘The tribal people are very superstitious and have always practiced weird rituals. In 2011 a boy severed two of his fingers and offered it to the God at the same temple. 'This incident is nothing new to us but yes, it is bizarre to many other people.’","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Associated Press . The skull belonging to a Civil War soldier that was found at Gettysburg will not be auctioned off after protests from the National Park Service and the public. Instead the auction house has donated the remains to be buries with military honors. Estate Auction Co. of Hershey, Pennsylvania, had listed the skull for sale at auction Tuesday in Hagerstown, Maryland. The listing was removed from a public auction website and replaced by a statement saying the auction company was donating the skull to the Park Service. 'At the auction company's request, it remains as part of the catalog due to its historical value,' the statement said. Scroll down for video . This skull is believed to belong to a soldier who died at the Battle of Gettysburg 150 years ago. It had been listed for auction . Gettysburg National Military Park and the nonprofit Gettysburg Foundation said Tuesday in a news release that the remains had been donated to the foundation late Monday. After they are authenticated, they will be donated to the park 'for interment with full military honors in the Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg,' the announcement said. The park and foundation said auction organizers had been 'overwhelmed' by 'an unprecedented outcry from concerned citizens.' Auctioneer Tom Taylor told WHAG that he believed 'like the National Park Service told me, it should have a proper burial.' Gettysburg National Military Park superintendent Ed Clark said in a statement that officials were grateful for the opportunity 'to honor what is very likely an American veteran and have his final resting place recognized.' The remains will be buried with honors at Soldiers' National Cemetery at Gettysburg . The auction site said the remains were found in 1949 as a garden was being tilled on the Benner Farm in Gettysburg. Notarized and handwritten documents said the remains, along with 13 other artifacts, were found two miles north of a barn used as a field hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg, Taylor said. Gettysburg park spokeswoman Katie Lawhon said there are two Benner Farms in Gettysburg, and one was known to be a hospital during the war. She told the York Daily Record that in her two decades of working in Gettysburg, she had never heard of a soldier's remains being offered for sale. The Battle of Gettysburg, which raged from July 1 to July 3, 1863, claimed more American lives than any battle in American history. Nearly 8,000 Confederate and Union soldiers were killed and more than 46,000 wounded as the forces of General Robert E. Lee were driven back. It is considered to be the turning point of the war.","The skull was found near the historic battlefield on the site of a onetime field hospital from the 1863 battle .

"By . Michael Zennie . Before Dzhokar Tsarnaev made his final stand following the Boston Marathon bombings last year, the 19-year-old sent his mother one final email to tell her that he loved her. The message ended with: 'Inshallah (God willing) if I don't see you in this life I will see you in the akhira (the Islamic afterlife).' Prosecutors say the message is proof that the terrorism suspect did not intend to survive the violent crime spree that left his brother Tamerlan and an MIT police officer dead three days after the attacks. Dzhokar was captured in the evening of April 19 after he was found hiding in a boat docked on dry land in Watertown, Massachusetts, following a manhunt that locked down all of greater Boston. Saying goodbye: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sent a final email to his mother before his May 18 rampage in Boston that left his brother dead . The terror suspect told his mother Zubeidat Tsarnaeva: 'I'll see you in the afterlife' The revelation about the suspect's final email came out today in a court filing by prosecutors, who are fighting a motion from the defense team to throw out the evidence collected from his dorm room at the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth. Dzhokar's attorneys say the search was illegal because it was conducted without a warrant. However, prosecutors argue that Dzhokar had no expectation of privacy in part because he abandoned his dorm room and didn't expect to survive after he and his brother went on the run. The email contributes to this argument, they say. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, Dzhokar's mother, is living in Russia after she fled the US to avoid prosecution following a shoplifting arrest. Dzhokhar was taken alive after he was found in a boat in Watertown, Massachusetts . Friends and neighbors said she became increasingly radicalized in her Islamic beliefs during her time in the United States. She continues to defend her sons in public interviews, claiming that they were framed by the FBI. Dzhokar faces numerous federal terrorism and murder charges and could face the death penalty if convicted.","Dzhokar Tsarnaev sent an email to his mother before his April 18 rampage following the bombings .

The mother says she was bullied online, and that she received harassing phone calls at her home after being exposed on the social networking site. Claims: UC Medical Center in Cincinnati is accused of failing to protect private medical records after a patient claimed details of her STI treatment were posted online . A nurse and staff member at UC Medical Center, and the woman's ex-boyfriend Raphael Bradley, are named in the suit which is seeking $25,000 in damages. Her suit also accuses UC Medical Center of failing to supervise its employees properly, over claims that Bradley convinced Ryan Rawls and a third unidentified staff member to leak the private records. The alleged victim says she was called a 'hoe' and 'slut' after details of her treatment for a sexually transmitted disease were put on a members-only Facebook page. 'She was absolutely devastated. That is . the most private of private medical information that was posted on . Facebook and went out to a group on Facebook that had a huge . dissemination,' Mike Allen, her attorney, told WLWT.

I couldn’t work out how to do it at first.’ Beckham, 39, admitted he found the wildlife especially creepy, saying: ‘On this trip I was like, “Snakes, not a big fan of, spiders, also not a big fan of”.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A former Blue Angels commander tolerated inappropriate sexual comments and naked pictures in the cockpits of the team's planes during his time as its leader, the Navy said Tuesday. Capt. Gregory McWherter was found guilty of violating two articles under the military's code of justice during nonjudicial proceedings convened Monday in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The articles were failure to obey an order or regulation and conduct unbecoming of an officer by fostering a hostile command climate and failing to stop 'obvious and repeated instances of sexual harassment, condoning widespread lewd practices within the squadron and engaging in inappropriate and unprofessional discussions with his junior officers,' the Navy said in a statement. Punished: Capt. Greg McWherter, left, ex-commanding officer of the U.S. Navy flight demonstration squadron, the Blue Angels, received a letter of reprimand for allowing sexual harassment in the workplace during his time as leader of the flying team . Raunchy: The Navy said McWherer's command had explicit porn in aircraft cockpits; the painting of male genitalia on the roof of training facilities and homophobic humor on maps and itineraries . He will be given a letter of reprimand that will go in McWherter's permanent file and is widely seen as a career-ender in the service. The Navy said his command had explicit pornography, including photos of naked women, in aircraft cockpits; the painting of giant male genitalia in blue and gold on the roof of the center point trailer at the Blue Angels' winter training facilities in El Centro; and sexually charged, raunchy, and homophobic humor on maps and itineraries. Sophomoric: The Top Gun fighter pilot school graduate used the call sign 'Stiffy' and encouraged locked-room antics . According to the Navy's 63-page report obtained by Washington Post, newly hired pilots were hazed by being forced to wear 'foam penis' hats. Crew members also kept binoculars in the cockpits to help them spot scantily-clad women in air show crowds. The report stated McWherter, whose call sign was 'Stiffy,' encouraged a sex-obsessed environment more common in a fraternity house than a flight team. McWherter was relieved in April from his duty as executive officer of Naval Base Coronado in California amid the allegations during his second stint as the Blue Angels' leader from May 2011 to November 2012. The Navy said it did not find problems during his first stint as the flying team's commanding officer from 2008 to 2010. 'The investigation concluded that McWherter witnessed, condoned, and encouraged behavior that, while juvenile and sophomoric in the beginning, ultimately and in the aggregate, became destructive, toxic, and hostile,' the Navy said in a statement. The Navy said investigators found no evidence the behavior led to sexual assault. Harry Harris Jr., commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, ordered the investigation after a service member filed an official complaint with the Navy on March 24. The Blue Angels' mission is to publicly represent the best of Naval Aviation and Harris said 'the actions of Captain McWherter jeopardized that mission.' 'Commanding officers have an enduring obligation to maintain a proper work environment at all times and in all places and spaces; and they will be held accountable as appropriate when they fail,' Harris said. High-flying PR: The mission of the Blue Angels, seen here May 23 flying over U.S. Naval Academy graduation ceremony in Annapolis, Maryland, is to publicly represent the best of Naval Aviation . Ousted: McWherter was relieved in April from his post amid the allegations during his second stint as the Blue Angels' leader from May 2011 to November 2012 . Several junior personnel who served under McWherter received formal written counseling for their behavior, but McWherter was held accountable for the actions of those in his command, the Navy said. The Blue Angels are reviewing procedures, said Vice Adm. David Buss, commander, Naval Air Force Pacific, and its new commanding officer, Thomas Frosch, started implementing measures to clean up the workplace. McWherter also was president of the Tailhook Association for about eight months before he resigned amid the probe. The San Diego-based nonprofit aviator fraternity said it knew nothing of the allegations against McWherter. The group dealt with its own scandal in 1991 when Navy pilots at its Las Vegas convention were accused of sexually abusing female officers. McWherter, a graduate of the Citadel military college in South Carolina, served in the Mediterranean, Persian Gulf and western Pacific, and was an instructor at the famed Top Gun school.","Capt Gregory McWherter, graduate of Top Gun school, was relieved of his post in April amid misconduct allegations .

"By . Snejana Farberov . The wife of Minnesota State University football player Isaac Kolstad who was savagely beaten last month has given birth to their second child. Molly Kolstad, a registered nurse, welcomed into the world on Wednesday a baby girl at the Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato where her husband remains in critical condition. The 24-year-old linebacker suffered a fractured skull and traumatic brain injury in a May 11 fight in downtown Mankato that involved former Minnesota Gophers quarterback Philip Nelson. Victim: Isaac Kolstad, seen here with his wife and daughter, was listed as being in critical condition after he was allegedly beaten by Philip Nelson . Attack: Isaac Kolstad, pictured with his wife .

Happier times: Molly Kolstad, pictured in February pregnant with her and Isaac's second daughter . The Kolstads also have a 3-year-old daughter together. Hospital spokesman Kevin Burns told KTOE radio Thursday that both Molly Kolstad and her newborn daughter are doing well. Besides the new addition to their family, Molly and Isaac received some good news this week from the injured football player's doctors. In an online journal entry on the site CaringBridge.org, a family friend who has been giving updates on Kolstad's condition revealed Tuesday that Isaac was able to lift his left thumb on command. Later in the day, however, Kolstad's loved ones asked for prayers, saying that the player has been diagnosed with a deep vein thrombosis, raising concern that he might develop a pulmonary embolism – a potentially fatal condition where a blood clot becomes lodged in the heart or lungs. Rutgers University quarterback Philip . Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of . third-degree assault. Trevor Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts.

Mankato police used surveillance video to determine the identity of a man seen in a red shirt who allegedly punched Kolstad, the Mankato Department of Public Safety said last month. 'Mr. Shelley was the individual we were looking for in the red shirt,' Todd Martin, Mankato’s public safety director, told the Star Tribune. 'We contacted him and then went to his residence and made the arrest.' Shelley has multiple convictions, including driving on a suspended license and underage drinking and driving, the paper says. Suspect: Authorities expect to file charges against Trevor Shelley, pictured, in the assault against Isaac Kolstad . Former Minnesota quarterback Philip Nelson leaves the Blue Earth County jail with a towel on his head . Nelson posted $20,00 bail in his assault case stemming from a fight outside a bar that left another former football player in critical condition with head injuries, in Mankato, Minnesota . According to a criminal complaint cited by NJ.com, 20-year-old Nelson was angry because a bouncer at a bar had hit on his girlfriend and he is extremely protective of the young woman. Nelson's girlfriend told police that as they left the bar, they saw Mr Kolstad outside, the complaint says. The bouncer and Mr Kolstad are different people. Nelson and Mr Kolstad got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, according to a police officer who had seen surveillance tapes, the complaint says. Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that . a man came 'out of nowhere' and punched Mr Kolstad in . the head after he had left a bar in the early hours of Sunday. 'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.' Attack: Isaac Kolstad, pictured with his wife Molly, was a former linebacker celebrating his graduation on Saturday night with friends before the alleged assault took place . Rutgers quarterback Philip Nelson allegedly assaulted a former teammate from the University of Minnesota last month . She added that the sound of Mr Kolstad hitting the concrete was so loud because he didn't catch himself. Kolstad has bleeding of the brain, skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint. Kolstad's skull fracture was on the left side of his head where he was kicked. Mr Kolstad graduated in December 2013 with a degree in business management and works in sales at Fastenal, an industrial distribution company. His father, Blaine, told WCCO that his son had been out with friends on the night of May 11 celebrating his graduation when he was attacked in a busy downtown area. He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . General Motors says a 'pattern of incompetence and neglect' is to blame for a long-delayed recall on dangerously defective ignition switches which have been linked to the deaths of 13 drivers. Company CEO Mary Barra released the results of a 'deeply troubling' internal investigation on Thursday, which found that many employees who could have uncovered the problem didn't speak up. Barra has since fired 15 employees - including the ignition's designer - and has announced intentions to start a compensation fund for victims' families. Scroll Down for Video . Sorry: General Motors CEO Mary Barra says a 'pattern of incompetence and neglect' led to a long-delayed recall of faulty ignitions in their Chevy Cobalt . The fund will be administered by compensation expert Kenneth Feinberg, who handled the victims funds for September 11, the Boston Marathon bombing and BP oil spill. The fund will begin taking claims on August 1, but it's still unclear how much money will be involved. Paying back: Georgia nurse Brooke Melton is one of the 13 official victims of the faulty ignition. Barra also announced on Thursday intentions to set up a fund for victims' families, such as Melton's parents Ken and Beth Melton . Barra said the company would 'do the right things for those who were harmed' and 'everything in our power to make sure this never happens again.' Barra called the investigation, which . she ordered in March, 'brutally tough and deeply troubling.' It took GM . more than a decade to report the deadly switch failures to regulators . and the public, and to recall the cars. 'I . hate sharing this with you just as much as you hate hearing it,' Barra . told employees in a town hall meeting at GM's suburban Detroit technical . center. 'But I want you to hear it. I want you to remember it. I want . you to never forget it.' Barra then promised to 'fix the failures in our . system.' The crisis began . in February, when GM recalled 780,000 older-model Chevrolet Cobalt and . Pontiac G5 small cars because of defective ignition switches. GM soon . added the Saturn Ion and other small cars to the recall, which ballooned . to 2.6 million cars worldwide. The . switches in the cars can slip out of the 'run' position and shut down . the engine. That disables the power-assisted steering and brakes and can . cause drivers to lose control. It also disables the air bags. GM . reiterated Thursday that it only links 13 deaths to the problem, but . trial lawyers suing the company put the death toll closer to 60. Barra . said attorney Anton Valukas interviewed 230 employees and reviewed 41 . million documents to produce the report, which also makes . recommendations to avoid future safety problems. The government was . expected to release the report later Thursday. Barra . said the report found that the company was operating in 'silos,' and . individuals who could have helped uncover the problem didn't speak up. 'Because . of the actions of a few people, and the willingness of others in the . company to condone bureaucratic processes that avoided accountability, . we let these customers down,' Barra said. She again apologized to the . families of those who died. Bad machine: The faulty switches would cause the cars to slip out of the run position and shut down the engine, which led drivers to lose control of the vehicle. Above, consulting materials engineer Mark Hood holds up one of the ignitions in March 2014 . Last . month, GM paid a $35 million fine — the largest ever assessed by the . National Highway Traffic Safety Administration — for failing to report . the problem quickly to federal regulators. GM knew about problems with . the ignition switches as early as 2001, and in 2005 it told dealers to . tell owners to take excess items off their key chains so they wouldn't . drag down the ignition switch. In . 2006, GM engineer Ray DeGiorgio — who designed the switch — approved a . change in the switch design, but didn't inform the government or change . the corresponding part number. In subsequent years, that made it harder . for other GM engineers to figure out why older Cobalts performed worse . than newer ones. Barra confirmed Thursday that two employees placed on leave in April have been fired; DeGiorgio was one of those employees. GM . began repairing the cars in April, and had fixed 86,000 as of Thursday. But it has said it doesn't expect to fix them all until October. GM . says the cars are safe as long as customers only use the key and have no . extra items on their key chains. Impacts: Melton's crashed Chevy Cobalt is pictured above. It's still uncertain how much victims' families will be entitled to from the new GM fund. The company will begin accepting claims on August 1 . Disappointed: Barra said she was 'deeply troubled' by the reports findings. Pictured above at the Thursday announcement . Barra . named a new safety chief at GM in March and pledged to quickly work . through a backlog of potential recalls. As a result, the automaker has . recalled a record 15.8 million cars and trucks in North America so far . this year. The company took a . $1.3 billion charge in the first quarter to pay for the recalls. It . expects to take a $400 million recall-related charge in the second . quarter. The report doesn't . complete GM's recall saga. The automaker still faces a criminal . investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice — led by the same team . that recently reached a $1.2 billion settlement with Toyota over its . 2010 sudden acceleration recall. It also faces multiple lawsuits from . victims and from owners whose say their cars have lost value. Barra, who testified before House and Senate committees in April, will also likely be called back to Washington. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and . Technology Committee's consumer protection subcommittee, said she . intends to hold a hearing on the delayed recalls later this summer. 'I . won't be letting GM leadership, or federal regulators, escape . accountability for these tragedies,' she said in a statement. 'The . families of those affected deserve no less.'","On Thursday, company CEO Mary Barra held a press conference where she announced the findings of an internal investigation .

Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has accused the G7 leaders of 'cynicism without limit' for backing Ukraine's military operation against pro-Russian insurgents (file picture) Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has accused the G7 leaders of 'cynicism without limit' for backing Ukraine's military operation against pro-Russian insurgents. World leaders at a G7 summit in Brussels have condemned Russia for 'continuing violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine'. In a joint communique released at the summit yesterday, the leaders encouraged Ukraine to 'maintain a measured approach in pursuing operations to restore law and order.' 'The so-called G7 even talks about the measured actions of the Ukrainian army against its own people,' Medvedev told ministers, quoted by the Interfax news agency. 'This is cynicism without limit.' The G7 leaders had effectively expelled Russia from their annual gathering, which President Vladimir Putin had been due to to host in Sochi, following its annexation of Crimea. Leaders at the summit have called for Russia to 'stop the flow of weapons and militants across the border and to exercise its influence among armed separatists to lay down their weapons and renounce violence.' President Barack Obama yesterday accused Russia of reverting to the ‘dark tactics of the 20th century’ in Ukraine. In a blunt warning to President Putin, he added: ‘The days of empires and spheres of influence are over.’ Speaking at the celebration marking the 25th anniversary of Poland's first partially free election, Obama seeked to offer assurances to the country and its neighbours left nervous by Putin's annexation of Crimea and other threatening moves.

'After . investing so much blood and treasure to bring Europe together, we . refuse to allow the dark tactics of the 20th century to define the . 21st,' he said. Leaders at the G7 summit last night warned that they stood ready to impose damaging economic sanctions on Russia on top of the asset freezes and travel bans already in place. 'We stand ready to intensify targeted sanctions and to implement significant additional restrictive measures to impose further costs on Russia should events so require,' they said in the joint communique.

A topless activist from the Femen feminist group sits over a wax statue of Russian President Vladimir Putin after she hit it in the head . Femen, which began in Eastern Europe, is notorious for using nudity to promote their message of female emancipation and protest against governments and organisations with which they disagree. They famously confronted Putin and German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a trade fair in Hanover last year, while they have also protested at Paris Fashion Week and Germany's Next Top Model. It was reported last month that founder member and leader of FEMEN France, Inna Shevchenko, 23, had thrown open the doors of the organisation's Paris HQ to a British film crew.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . O.J. Simpson's lawyers resubmitted a Nevada Supreme Court appeal on Wednesday seeking a new trial on grounds that the imprisoned former football star was misled by his lawyer and didn't get a fair trial in his Las Vegas kidnapping and armed robbery case. The 102-page document asks the seven justices to reconsider whether Simpson's lead attorney at the time, Yale Galanter, had advance knowledge of the ill-fated September 2007 confrontation involving Simpson, several other men and two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas casino hotel. Evidence at trial 'tended to indicate that Galanter was involved in the alleged conspiracy,' current Simpson lawyers Patricia Palm, Ozzie Fumo and Tom Pitaro say in the appeal. O.J. Simpson's lawyers resubmitted a Nevada Supreme Court appeal on Wednesday seeking a new trial on grounds that the imprisoned former football star was misled by his lawyer . 'Galanter's personal interest in hiding his pre-incident involvement is sufficiently substantial to indicate the existence of an actual conflict.' Palm declined additional comment about the appeal, which was initially stalled by size and formatting issues after she submitted it May 21. Since last week, Palm double-spaced the document according to Chief Justice Mark Gibbon's instructions and re-filed it. The justices haven't decided if they will hold hearings on Simpson's latest appeal and didn't immediately set a date for a decision, court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said. Simpson's lawyer at the 2008 trial Yale Galanter, right, has defended his performance on his client's behalf and calls the claims a 'charade' The court is Nevada's only appellate bench and cases can take months or longer to decide. The high court in September 2010 rejected a previous appeal by Galanter on behalf of Simpson. The new effort alleges that Galanter had a conflict of interest that skewed his representation of Simpson in a trial also tainted by the sports, television and movie star's notoriety stemming from his acquittal in the June 1994 slayings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman in Los Angeles. The 20th anniversary of the slayings is next week. Simpson, now 66, is serving nine to 33 years at a Nevada state prison in Lovelock in the Las Vegas robbery case. He's not eligible for parole until late 2017. Galanter on Wednesday defended his performance on Simpson's behalf. The 20th anniversary of the slayings his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman is next week. O.J. Simpson was famously acquitted of the two murders in 1995 . The Miami-based lawyer pointed to Clark County District Court Judge Linda Marie Bell's ruling in November - after five days of hearings last May and several months reviewing the case record - that Simpson failed to demonstrate how Galanter's actions led to Simpson's conviction. Bell denied Simpson's request for release and a new trial. She said also that evidence was overwhelming that Simpson orchestrated the September 2007 armed kidnapping and robbery at the Palace Station hotel. 'Judge Bell saw through his and his lawyers' charade and kicked him to the curb,' Galanter said. Simpson continues to say he was trying to retrieve items that had been stolen from him after a 1997 civil case put him on the hook for a $33.5 million wrongful-death judgment. He testified last year that he thought he had a right to get his belongings back, and that he never knew any of the men with him were carrying guns. The NFL hall of famer didn't testify at trial in Las Vegas. He told Bell that Galanter advised him not to.","O.J.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Arrested: Murder suspect Nazira Maria Cross has been caught in Peru . A woman suspected of poisoning her husband in 2008 and burying his body on their Nevada ranch has been caught in Peru after six years on the run. Nazira Maria Cross was arrested at her home by Peruvian police on Wednesday morning, after the FBI received a tip off that the murder suspect had fled to the South American country. The 48-year-old professor is believed to have poisoned Michael Cross in California, before driving to Nevada to bury his body. Cross, who is originally from Costa RIca, is accused of fleeing the U.S. while authorities waited for autopsy results. In 2009, she was charged with first-degree murder over the death of the 55-year-old owner of two car dealerships. The . FBI claims that Cross poisoned her estranged husband in California in . July 2008, then drove his body to Lovelock, where they owned property, . to dispose of his body. After burying his body, Cross is accused of repeatedly driving over the grave. A year later the Nevada attorney-general . charged Cross and her two adult children with faking her death in South . America to obtain life insurance payouts. Her daughter was fined $1,000 and her son remains a fugitive, according to the Reno Gazette-Journal. In a 2012 civil case, a Reno judge ruled that Cross was a 'culpable actor' in her husband's death. Fugitive: Nazira Maria Cross, pictured in 2008, is accused of poisoning her husband before fleeing to Peru . Scam: Cross is also accused of trying to fake her own death to claim insurance payments . The couple had been married for eight years, but divorced in the January of the year Mr Cross was killed. They had met when he vacationed in Costa Rica. On the day he was poisoned, neighbors claimed Mr Cross's wife asked for help getting him into her car, and told them he was sick and was on his way to hospital. When the neighbors didn't hear back from Mr Cross, they called police who discovered his body on the ranch, according to Inside Costa Rica. Cross's case has been widely featured, and her wanted poster was distributed across the U.S. and internationally. The case was also featured on America's Most Wanted. The U.S. has made a request for Peru to extradite Cross to face prosecution.","Nazira Maria Cross fled the U.S. just before being charged with murder .

"By . Ashley Collman . Homeless: Imprisoned OJ Simpson has lost his Miami home in a foreclosure auction after getting behind on more than two years of mortgage payments . OJ Simpson won't have a place to call home when he's eligible for parole in three years. The former football star famous for his controversial acquittal in the 1994 murder of wife Nicole Brown Simpson, lost his Miami home on Tuesday in a private foreclosure auction. The 4,334-square-foot home with a swimming pool was sold for $655,000 to an as-yet-unidentified bidder, while 66-year-old Simpson is currently behind bars at a Nevada prison on a robbery conviction. 'He has been trying to do everything he can to win his release, and the idea was that he’d have a home to come back to,' Simpson's attorney Leonardo DaVinci Starke told the Miami Herald. 'We were hoping for the best, but it didn’t happen.' That price was $100,000 more than what Simpson paid for the home when he purchased it in September 2000, fleeing California after losing a civil suit. While Simpson was let off in the murder case of his wife and her friend Rob Goldman, he was ordered to pay Goldman's father Fred Goldman $33.5million in a judgement that found him liable for the waiter's death. Simpson moved to Florida because homesteads in the state can't be seized to pay for civil judgements. However, Simpson lost control of the home last year when he got behind on more than two years worth of mortgage payments. Simpson owes mortgage holder JP Morgan Chase more than $892,283 in back payments, principal fees, court costs and penalties. Highest bidder: The 4,334-square-foot home with a swimming pool was sold in a Tuesday auction to an unnamed bidder for $655,000. That's $100,000 more than what Simpson paid for the property in 2000 . Locked up: Simpson is currently behind bars in Nevada on a robbery conviction and won't be eligible for parole until 2017. Above, an aerial view of his Miami home . And that's not the only problem on Simpson's plate. His attorneys are currently fighting to get him an appeal in his 2008 robbery conviction. Simpson was found guilty of working with a group of armed men to steal sports memorabilia at the Palace Station hotel on September 13, 2007. He was originally sentenced to up to 33 years in prison, but his sentence was ultimately reduced last year when a judge granted parole on some of the charges. His new defense team is currently working to get him freed sooner with an appeal arguing that his former lawyer Yale Galanter was biased, since he had prior knowledge of the robbery. The appeal was submitted the Nevada Supreme Court on Wednesday, with his new defense team arguing that evidence at the trial 'tended to indicate that Galanter was involved in the alleged conspiracy.' The gloves don't fit: Simpson was famously acquitted of the 1994 murder of his wife Nicole Brown Simpson.

"By . Meghan Keneally . A Democratic congressional candidate in Arizona has changed his name to Cesar Chavez in an effort to elicit support from his largely Hispanic district. Chavez, whose birth name was Scott Fistler, has previously run in two other political campaigns in Arizona- both times as a Republican- but lost each time. So he took a different tact and the Arizona Capitol Times reports that he petitioned the state superior court to change his name to the same one as the famed civil rights activist this past November. Bending to the audience: Scott Fistler (pictured) changed his name in November to Cesar Chavez and has since changed his political alliance from Republican to Democratic as he runs for congressional office . In the official paperwork, 34-year-old Fistler wrote that he 'experienced many hardships because of my name'. Namesake: In his application, Fistler said that he 'experienced hardships because of his name' and did not mention the famed labor leader (pictured) After paying the required $319 fee, the name change was approved but that was the only form of reinvention that he launched ahead of his latest campaign. Fistler ran as a Republican write in candidate against Congressman Ed Pastor in 2012 and as a Republican city council candidate in Phoenix in 2013. But in February of this year, the newly-renamed Chavez filed his campaign registration as a Democrat in his attempt to replace 70-year-old Democratic Representative Pastor, who announced that he will not be seeking re-election this year. 'People want a name that they can feel comfortable with,' Chavez explained to the Arizona Republic. 'If you went out there running for office and your name was Bernie Madoff, you'd probably be screwed. 'It's almost as simple as saying Elvis Presley is running for president... You wouldn't forget it, would you?' Chavez's own personal history- as an unemployed military veteran with a Chihuahua named King- bears little resemblance to his namesake, who started as a farm worker and later became one of the most recognizable labor leaders in the country. He told the Arizona Republic that he views the two Hispanic candidates as his top competition in the race but feels that he has the edge, publicity wise, due to his name: so much so, that he has even stopped taking press requests for the time being. False advertising: The newly-named Chavez's website has pictures of crowds of Venezuelan supporters of Hugo Chavez on the background . 'There is just simply not enough Cesar Chavez to go around,' he told The Arizona Capitol Times. When that day comes, questions have to be screened and can only be five words long. His online campaign presence is not even his own, as the congressional campaign's website uses photos of hoards of Chavez supporters at an undated rally, but those individuals were showing their allegiance to Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and not the candidate in Arizona.","A man whose birth name was Scott Fistler is now running for Congress under his new name Cesar Chavez .

Griffin Furlong has had his college fund boosted by more than $91,000 by Thursday morning, as details spread of the 18-year-old's determination to succeed despite the odds. When he gave his valedictorian speech at . First Coast High School on Wednesday, Griffin told his classmates . 'giving up is not an option'. Scroll down for video . Inspiration: Homeless teenager Griffin Furlong gives his valedictorian speech on Wednesday after overcoming hardships to graduate with a 4.65 average . Generous: More than $88,000 has been donated to a college fund for Griffin, pictured second left with his brother Sean . Despite losing his mother to cancer when he was 6, and being raised in a series of homeless shelters, Griffin achieved a 4.65 grade average in high school. He puts his educational success down to a determination to make something of himself, telling the graduates: 'I perform the way I do in the classroom because I have everything to lose.' Before he . was selected as valedictorian at First Coast High School, few of . Griffin's teachers and classmates knew about his hard life. From . the age of seven, he and his brother, Sean have been moved to various . homeless shelters with their father, and often went hungry. 'Every single one of my peers thinks I live and have lived a normal, everyday life. Everyone thinks I try to get good grades because I’m smart. Not true,,,' Griffin said. 'I make the grades I do because I was once lost, and had nothing.' Moving: In his valedictorian speech Griffin told classmates to use their past as motivation . Focused: From a young age Griffin realized the only way he could change his life was to work hard at school . He concluded his speech by telling his classmates: 'Don’t dwell on the past, use it as . motivation for your future. 'It’s amazing what . you can do with your life when you have motivation, ambition and most . importantly, a purpose.' Griffin plans to study civil engineering at Florida State University where his brother, Sean, is due to graduate from this summer. He was able to secure grants to cover some living costs, but last month the teenager had still not heard back from applications to get help covering his tuition. A Go Fund Me page was set up on Griffin's behalf, and in just two weeks more than $90,000 had been raised for his college fund. 'Wow, this is truly a blessing! I can't even fathom how much this means to me and my family,' Griffin wrote on the page last week, as he thanked his many supporters. Next step: Griffin, pictured with Avery, wants to start a scholarship to help students in similar circumstances to his . Loss: When he was just six years old, Griffin's mother died from leukemia . The amount will cover costs for Griffin's degree at Florida State University, which charges students about $20,000 a year for tuition, accommodation, meals and books. But the teenager has said that he would also like to create a scholarship fund for other Florida students in similar circumstances to himself. According to Jacksonville.com, his school district has about 1,000 homeless students. Griffin's struggles began when his mother died from leukemia. One year later he moved into the first of several homeless shelters with his father and brother. 'I had to grow up really fast. I've seen things that kids wouldn't ever see in their lives,' he told Today. For a while the family had a rental home, but just before Griffin was due to sit his finals, the baseball fan found himself homeless again. He stayed with the family of his girlfriend, Avery, for a few weeks, before moving in with relatives. But despite his unsettled home life, Griffin still scored highly in his exams. Griffin, who wrote his motto 'Never Give Up' on the rim of his baseball caps each season, said he was driven to succeed in memory of his mother. Motivated: Griffin writes his motto, 'Never give up', inside the rim of his baseball caps each season to remind him of what he is trying to achieve . Support: When Griffin became homeless again just before his final exams the family of his girlfriend, Avery, let him stay at their house . 'I . know that she’s proud that I’ve never given up despite the . circumstances that I was facing. I know that she loves me. She gave my life purpose,' he said. His . unconventional upbringing sometimes left Griffin feeling cut off from . his peers. Because he was living in homeless shelters he couldn't have . friends over, and had to take a different bus to school. Ambitious: Griffin has never missed a day of school and is getting ready to start university . 'A lot of kids made fun of me, but I didn't let . that interfere with what I did in school. I had a plan - just make good . grades, and don't worry about anyone else but my family,' he said. The . youngster quickly realized that the only chance he had to improve his . life was to study hard, and despite his difficult home life, Griffin has . never missed a day of school. 'I knew I was going to be poor for the . rest of my life, so I thought if I could continue to do well in school, . eventually scholarships would be coming my way and I would be getting a . free education,' he said. The teenager left a lasting impression with his teachers, who praised his academic achievements and revealed that he had made the varsity baseball team every year. 'He is a remarkable kid and an excellent student,' Jennifer Stover, who taught Griffin and helped with his college applications, told NBC News. 'He’s an inspiration to everyone around him.' Many teachers and students at his school had no idea of the problems Griffin faced until he was named class valedictorian. 'I actually cried when I saw it on the news,' teacher Natalie Donald said. 'He’s made straight As across the board in my class, and he never once used his circumstances as a crutch to justify not being able to do anything.' Griffin's brother, Sean, is also proud of his younger brother. The pair formed a close bond and often had only each other to confide in. 'I couldn't tell my friends what I was going through,' Sean, 21, said. 'It was mainly just me . and Griffin, and we did everything together, baseball especially.. 'He's just a really tough individual. He's younger than me, but I still . look up to him,' he added.","Griffin Furlong graduated with 4.65 average despite an unsettled home life .

"By . Margot Peppers . With social media increasingly pervading our everyday lives, it's hardly surprising that couples are going to great lengths to make sure it doesn't ruin their relationships. A particularly popular new trend is the 'social media prenup' - a contract stipulating that couples cannot share incriminating photos or posts about one another, at the risk of having to fork out thousands of dollars. 'It’s a huge issue because we all know . this stuff, once it's out there, you can't shake it,' New York-based attorney Ann-Margaret Carrozza told ABC News. 'It . can be humiliating. It can be painful.  It's really no joke.' Take no risks: There's currently a rising trend in the 'social media prenup' - a contract stipulating that couples cannot share incriminating photos or posts about one another, at the risk of having to pay money . The most common clause, according to Ms Carrozza, states that couples can't post nude or embarrassing photos that might harm their significant other's reputation - whether it be on Facebook, Instagram or any other website. The penalty is usually monetary, with well-to-do couples in New York typically paying up to $50,000 each time they break the clause. While it may seem extreme to have a written contract rather than just a conversation about privacy, many couples say it makes it easier to deal with tricky situations in the future. That's exactly why Los Angeles-based relationship therapist Sheri Meyers decided to draw up a social media prenup between her and her boyfriend Jonathon Aslay, who works as a relationship coach. 'For me, it was about privacy, what is for us and what is for the world, so we needed that discussion,' explained Dr Meyers. 'What Jonathon and I do is he'll say, ""This is an SMP [social media prenup] moment. Is this OK [to post]? Is this crossing the line?"" It's two sentences, versus a paragraph or an hour [discussion]. It's not a big deal, anymore.' She added that it's not about a lack of trust between couples; it's about keeping things simple and clear-cut from the very beginning. The risk that an angry ex might resort to the disturbing phenomenon of 'revenge porn' is also a motivator for signing this type of prenup, says Dr Meyers. 'It's so easy, especially in anger, in ""ex anger,"" to post things on social media to get even' 'In this day and age, it's really important, almost mandatory, to not assume and to lay it out,' she explained. 'It's one thing when you're all lovely dovely. It's another thing when you're breaking up... It's so easy, especially in anger, in ""ex anger,"" to post things to get even.' Indeed, according to the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, more than 80per cent of U.S. divorce attorneys say that issues involving social networking are on the rise in divorce proceedings. Atlanta-based divorce attorney Randy Kessler says that social media clauses may not totally rectify the problem, but they do encourage couples to modify their behavior, especially after a break-up. 'I don't think they hurt, but what's interesting is they are untested. [But] it makes you not want to take the risk,' he said.","The typical social media clause states that couples can't post nude or embarrassing photos that might harm their significant other's reputation .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . A former French prime minister has angrily called on Britain to leave the European Union - to stop it dying. Michel Rocard said the UK had only joined the EU to help big business - and called on it to leave before it caused further damage. Mr Rocard also accused David Cameron of 'pretending' to want to leave - and of provoking a crisis in order to serve the interest of Britain’s banks. Former French Socialist Prime Minister Michel Rocard, being greeted here by the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at Number 10 in 1988, has called on Britain to regain its 'elegance' by quitting the EU . In a scathing article in the French newspaper Le Monde said: 'So leave, then, before you destroy everything.' The remarks by the 83-year-old Rocard comes amid growing anger of Mr Cameron's bid to block the former Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker from running the European Commission. Mr Junker is the lead candidate of the biggest group in the European Parliament - the Conservative European People's Party - which scopped the most seats in last week's European elections. Mr Cameron has publicly opposed the nomination of Mr Juncker, whose European People’s Party. France said before the election that the leading candidate of whichever party won the vote should be put forward for the job. The PM has dismissed a report in Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine that claimed he had threatened at an EU summit last week to bring forward a referendum on British membership of the EU if Mr Juncker became Commission president. The latest fall out between Europe and the UK threatens to turn nasty, the former French PM claimed. Former Socialist Prime Minister Michel Rocard spent 15 years in the European Parliament after leaving French politics . Princess Diana appeared to have charmed Mr Rocard on a visit in Paris in 1988 - but the former French PM said Britain had lost its esteem in the eyes of Europe . He said: 'Between you and us, the continental Europeans, there is a disagreement that is turning ugly. Europe is dying from it.' The Socialist Rocard has been a backer of closer European integration since the bloc’s founding in the decade after World War Two and spent 15 years as a member of European parliament after leaving French politics in 1997. He said Britain had lost the respect of its neighbours in Europe over its position on Europe. The former PM wrote: 'There was a time when being British was synonymous with elegance. Let us rebuild Europe. Regain your elegance and you will regain our esteem.' Britain – which joined the EU, then known as the European Economic Community, in 1973 after France’s General Charles de Gaulle had resisted a previous attempt to enter the bloc – has long been accused by some of the zone’s founder members of seeking to slow down European political union. Mr Cameron has vowed to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the union in 2017. Before the poll he has promised to 'renegotiate' the terms of Britain’s membership - by winning back powers from Brussels. Last week he accused the union of being 'too bossy'.","Socialist pro-European says UK only joined Europe to help banks .

"By . Associated Press . In the months after American forces invaded Iraq in 2003, Abdulla Mizead would look warily as soldiers carrying heavy weapons patrolled his neighborhood in Najaf. Normally, he would keep his distance. But one afternoon he approached some American troops stopped on a street after seeing them having a tough time communicating with an Iraqi man. The man had been trying to tell the Americans about detainees in a presidential palace who were trapped. The man, an engineer, had built the palace. Translator turned soldier Abdullah Mizead pictured in 2008 when he was working for War News Radio at Swarthmore College . 'That staff sergeant just goes nuts about it,' Mizead said. 'And, he (the Iraqi) is yelling at him, 'You need to come with me right now!' Mizead, 25 at the time, had learned English growing up around the world and stepped in to help translate. A few minutes later, he started to walk away and a sergeant asked him to wait. The soldiers needed a translator to replace a Kuwaiti who was returning home. Would he be interested? Unemployed at the time, translating seemed like an adventure, a chance for Mizead to see parts of Iraq he had never visited. He agreed and that encounter set him on an improbable course that has brought him full circle with the invading American forces who many Iraqis still blame for the ills plaguing the country: He is now a lieutenant in the U.S. Army at Fort Campbell. Born in Iraq, Mizead grew up internationally as the son of an Iraqi diplomat whose assignments took him to Mozambique; London, where he learned English; Washington; and Tanzania. Mizead and his family returned to Iraq in 1990, around the time President Saddam Hussein was invading neighboring Kuwait. A US contracted interpreter (not Mizead) speaks with an Iraqi woman . After graduating from high school in Iraq, Mizead earned a bachelor's degree and then a master's in English literature from the University of Baghdad, where he relished digging into the works of American literary greats like playwright Eugene O'Neill. Like for all Iraqis, the U.S.-led invasion upended daily life for Mizead's family. Overnight, American soldiers were patrolling major cities, and Mizead kept his distance — until the day he stepped in to translate. At first, Mizead had mixed feelings about helping American soldiers. As Shia Muslims, his family had been oppressed for years by the minority ruling Sunnis and Saddam Hussein — some of his father's cousins were killed during the failed 1991 Shia uprising — so anything to help topple that system seemed worthwhile. Still, like many Iraqis, he had grown up hearing propaganda about the evils of America. A month after he began translating for American troops, Mizead started working with the 1st Battalion, 187th infantry, a Fort Campbell-based unit known as the 'Rakkasans'— a term the unit ironically got from a Japanese translator after World War II who couldn't immediately come up with the word for airborne unit so used called them 'rakkasan,' or 'falling down umbrella men.' Over the course of three months, Mizread interpreted as troops moved north from Baghdad to Tikrit and Mosul. It was the adventure the man was hoping for when he first signed up, and the Iraqi native brought an expertise to the job that few others would have had. While working with an intelligence division in Tal Afar, west of Mosul, Mizead's family background came into play. When Mizead (not pictured) worked as a translator he would assist U.S. soldiers in translating and also in judging character . The area was filled with Shiite Turkmen who refused to speak to any of the Kurdish interpreters the Army had been using — a remnant of the long-standing animosity between Turks and Kurds in northern Iraq. Mizead noticed a picture of a Shiite saint hanging in the house of a village elder. 'I said 'You're Turkmen, right? Shiite Turkmen?' Mizead asked. 'And as soon as I told them I was from Najaf, my parents were from Najaf, they just loved me.' Working north of Baghdad, Mizead followed the soldiers into several towns and villages that backed Saddam's Baath party. Back at the battalion base, Mizead would always lay out for intelligence officers his impressions of people he interviewed while on a mission. 'This guy's faking it. This guy's hiding something,' Mizead recalled telling an officer. 'I'm just giving him my gut feeling.' As the military moved north, Mizead hoped to go to the Kurdistan region near the Turkish border — a place he had never been. However, the Army had other plans and headed west instead, and he never made it to Kurdistan. Ready for something new, Mizead took a job with National Public Radio, where he was 'the street guy.' 'I'd roam the streets of Baghdad, go into the provinces, talk to the people. I went to rural places that nobody had ever heard of, places nobody would ever cover,' Mizead said. One day, the horrors of war hit home. Mizead's father was kidnapped. Four men put pistols to the heads of Azer Mizead and another family member and forced them from the car. The men switched Azer Mizead to another car and fled. Later, they called Mizead's family asking for ransom. Mizead feared his father would be killed regardless of any ransom, but they had to try to save him. 'I don't want to live with the idea of him knowing we weren't going to pay the ransom,' Mizead recalled telling himself. 'I don't want him to die knowing his family abandoned him and were not willing to pay $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000.' The family scraped together the cash from savings and Mizead's earnings. Mizead declined to disclose how much the family put forward, but his employer at the time, NPR, put up $10,000 toward the ransom. The kidnappers guided Mizead by phone around Baghdad for about 45 minutes before he dropped the money at a dictated location. He never saw Azer Mizead again. 'I waited and waited and waited for nothing,' Mizead said. Now Mizead (not pictured) wears a US uniform while still maintaining a love for his home country of Iraq . Mizead took to searching for his father in the morgues. 'Every time I'd go there, it was like hell,' Mizead said. Soon after his father disappeared, a translator Mizead knew was killed by insurgents, and Mizead worried he could be next. The family decided to leave Iraq. Mizead applied for a student visa and got into Columbia University and arrived in early 2007 with his wife and two young children. While completing a master's degree in journalism and working for War News Radio at Swarthmore College, Mizead sometimes thought back with nostalgia on his time translating for the Army. He had enjoyed the camaraderie, adventure and sense of purpose. In 2010, he signed up. After bouncing around several military posts, including Fort Carson, Colorado, Mizead began working in intelligence for the 'Rakkasans.' Mizead saw familiar faces after being transferred to Fort Campbell. Many recognized him, as well. Seeing Mizead in uniform was 'fairly surreal,' said Lt. Col. Clint Cox, who was with the 3rd Battalion based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, during the initial invasion of Iraq. 'I knew that I knew who he was, but it took a minute.' Mizead, who remains an Iraqi citizen, today looks and acts every inch the soldier, and like many soldiers, he doesn't betray much. Not even about the profound decision to sign on with the invading Army he once eyed warily. One of the few times he softens is when he concedes he worries about relatives in Iraq. The country is mired in near-daily violence, and many Iraqis blame the U.S. military and President George W. Bush for the invasion that allowed ethnic tensions to come to the fore. Still, Mizead says family back home support his career path, and that someday he may return to help his homeland, much the way he has helped America. 'My family is still there,' he said. 'It is still where I'm from.'","Mizead, 25 at the time, knew English and stepped in to help translate one day when American soldiers were having trouble communicating .

"A Hong Kong man allegedly strangled his mistress and their two-year-old son before hiding their bodies under the bed in a rented apartment in south China for 14 years. Kan Wai-nam, 53, was arrested last month after cleaners discovered the bodies of his second family in a bag underneath the bed in the apartment in the Buji district of Shenzhen. Kan, who also had a wife and two children in Hong Kong, reportedly confessed to killing his mistress and their son in May 2000. Kan Wai-nam allegedly strangled his mistress and their two-year-old son before hiding their bodies under the bed in a rented apartment in south China for 14 years . He allegedly told police he strangled his mistress and their child while struggling with debts of hundreds of thousands of yuan and a gambling addiction, the South China Morning Post has reported, citing the Southern Metropolis Daily. He had reportedly committed to supplying a monthly allowance of 2,000 yuan to his Shenzhen family while also supporting his family in Hong Kong. The bodies were discovered after Kan asked his landlord to clean one of two adjacent top-floor flats he had been renting at the apartment block in Buji. He reportedly told his landlord one of the flats was being used for accommodation while the other was used as a utility room. The cleaner sent by the landlord mistakenly walked into the wrong flat where she discovered the bag containing the bodies. Rent . continued to be paid to the landlord while the mistress is understood . to have lost contact with rural family members and was not reported . missing, according to the Shanghaiist. Kan was arrested last month after returning to Shenzhen (file picture shows aerial view of Shenzhen) The Buji district of Shenzhen, known as 'Little Hong Kong', became a 'mistress village' in the 1980s and 1990s as workers and cross-border drivers kept girlfriends there, according to the South China Morning Post. Shenzhen sits immediately north of Hong Kong in Southern China's Guangdong Province. It was the first of China's Special Economic Zones, which has led to its rapid expansion, with the help of foreign investment, and is now southern mainland China's major financial centre. It also has very close business, trade and social links with Hong Kong. In December last year it was reported that smugglers dug a 'professional' concrete tunnel from Shenzhen into Hong Kong equipped with lights, vents, steel reinforcements and even rails to transport goods. The underground path had 'one end in a rented garage in Shenzhen and another in a thicket of reeds in Hong Kong, totally concealed', said a report posted on the official website china.com.cn.","Kan Wai-nam arrested last month after cleaners discovered bodies in a bag .

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . From getting lost on the Metro to badly chipping his tooth on a baguette to making miraculous mid-match recoveries from injury — strange things tend to happen to Andy Murray at the French Open. Nothing, however, could top the tale of the unexpected that would be reaching the final at the expense of Rafael Nadal, the man who has only ever lost one best-of-five-set match on clay out of 89 played. Without a head coach and largely scratching around for form prior to the event, Murray must defeat not only the eight-time champion, but also the opponent who has proved the most formidable obstacle to his ambitions at Grand Slams. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Mike Dickson preview the semi-finals in Paris . All set: Andy Murray plays a volley as he takes part in a practice session at Roland Garros on Thursday . Murray’s finest career achievements have come when the Spaniard has been out of the way, either through being absent with injury (the 2012 US Open and Olympics) or Wimbledon last year, when Nadal was upset in the first round. Ahead of Friday's semi-final, Wimbledon champion Murray was honest enough to admit: ‘I’d rather it was someone else than Rafa, but it’s a great opportunity for me to go out there and play a great match and see if I can beat him.’ There had been plenty of drama even prior to Wednesday night’s extraordinary late win over Gael  Monfils, with the marathon against Philipp Kohlschreiber and beating Fernando Verdasco despite letting slip 15 break points. That, coincidentally, was the number that he had when he met Nadal in the semi-finals here three years ago in going down in straight sets. It showed that he is easily capable of creating opportunities against the greatest ever clay court player. Braveheart: Murray lets out a roar after his quarter-final victory over Gael Monfils on Wednesday . Murray did so again three weeks ago when he led the Spaniard 4-2 in the decider of the Italian Open quarter-final: ‘I didn’t win but maybe if I had won a few more matches in the build-up it could have helped,’ he said. ‘I’m in a good position right now. I would have signed up for this. ‘The hunger is there. I believe 100 per cent I can beat Rafa and Novak (Djokovic), but on this  surface it’s harder for me than other courts because it’s not my best and they are two of the  greatest clay-court players. ‘It was hard for the two or three months after Wimbledon. As soon as I had the surgery and made that decision, motivation wasn’t an issue for these events. I had no days off for three months getting ready for the Australian Open. I didn’t need to do that. Close-run: Murray shakes hands with Rafael Nadal after their Italian Open quarter-final in Rome last month . ‘A lot of players have surgery and take three or four weeks off but I trained every single day to get ready to get myself in shape and I am seeing the benefits of doing that now.’ Murray needs a big win against one of his main rivals — he has not beaten a top-10 player since  Wimbledon and only Jo-Wilfried Tsonga from the top 20 — to authenticate the claim that he is properly back. As John McEnroe said on Thursday: ‘Playing Nadal in the semis — it’s “Now let’s see how far he is going to go here”.’ Words of wisdom: Nadal speaks with coach and uncle Toni (left) during a practice session in Paris on Thursday . Far from Ivan Lendl’s absence being a handicap, it is starting to look an advantage in some ways with Murray taking responsibility for himself in a sport which always boils down to self-reliance. His success of the past 10 days makes it far less likely that he  will bring a new coach in before Wimbledon. Murray and Nadal have the closest thing to a genuine friendship between the established stars of the men’s game, but theirs is also the most statistically one-sided rivalry with the Spaniard ahead 14-5. History suggests it is difficult to see that improving in the Scot’s favour on Friday. Respect: Murray lost to Nadal in three sets in their last semi-final clash at Roland Garros in 2011 . Ernests Gulbis plays Djokovic, making the tournament’s special guest appearance among the ‘Big Four’ in the semi-finals, and he has earned it. It helps that the 18th seed cares little for reputations, and his frank discourse on life and tennis after every match leaven the stolid fare generally served up by his peers. What will serve him best on Friday is his outstanding backhand among other things, and if Djokovic slips up in any way then the colourful Latvian is the kind of free spirit who will happily take advantage.

Executives from adidas invited them to a meeting where De Boer and players Siem de Jong, Daley Blind and Jasper Cillessen were shown shirts featuring 'typical Dutch imagery', including pancakes, tulips and bicycles. Another shirt idea featured psychedelic colours blended on the front and a large image of a lion's head. Unimpressed: Frank de Boer looks shocked at suggestions for Ajax's new adidas kit . Stereotype: Designs included this fetching number with Dutch tulips emblazoned on the front . Luckily for the Eredivisie giants it was all part of an elaborate prank. The shirt designs were certainly not what the players and manager expected and led to some interesting reactions. Cillessen said: 'It's too much for me,' before adding: 'I don't like it.' De Boer, meanwhile, sat slumped in his chair with a look of disbelief on his face before scratching his head and letting out an exasperated sigh. When the adidas executive left the room De Boer turned to former Ajax goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar and said: 'I have the feeling that we won't be taken seriously.' Prank: Another design showed bicycles and examples of famous Dutch architecture . Upset: Siem de Jong and Daley Blind both made their feelings known about the designs . He was then asked if there was anything positive that he did like about the new shirt, to which he answered bluntly: 'No.' In another meeting Blind motioned towards one of the shirts and told De Jong: 'This is really bad.' De Jong replied: 'Yeah, I agree. I am not wearing this. I really don't want to.' When the adidas executive eventually revealed the ruse and exposed a host of hidden cameras a look of relief was evident on the face of players and manager alike. At the end Cillessen added: 'I thought Van der Sar had gone crazy.' Exasperated: Jasper Cillessen was another Ajax player called in to discuss the strips .

Still a contracted to Queens Park Rangers - though not for long it would seem - Brazil's No 1 was a commanding presence throughout. Panama rarely troubled Cesar but he did pull off one spectacular save. After slipping on a terrible pitch at the Serra Dourada, Cesar recovered and made an acrobatic leap to tip a looping header over the bar.

Quiet: Oscar was overshadowed by Neymar and Brazil were better when Willian was introduced . Looked a little bit lost positionally and was completely overshadowed by the brilliant Neymar.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A former Crimewatch presenter has told a court that Rolf Harris should not be accused of lying after forgetting a game show appearance in the 1970s because she cannot recall being in the programme either. Sue Cook, 65, who appeared in the Star Games series a couple of times, said celebrities were ‘bussed in’ to a recreation area and the city or town was ‘immaterial’. The writer and broadcaster took to Twitter on Monday after seeing coverage of Harris’s indecent assault trial on Sky News. Scroll down for video . Sue Cook, 65, (left) who appeared in the Star Games series a couple of times, said veteran entertainer Rolf Harris, 84, (right) should not be accused of lying because she too had forgotten 'loads' of events she attended . Harris, 84, of Bray, Berkshire, had previously told the jury at London's Southwark Crown Court that he had never been to Cambridge until four years ago, but it later emerged that he had appeared in a Star Games show in the city in 1978. One alleged victim claimed that the entertainer had grabbed her bottom when she was waitressing at an event there in 1975, although prosecutors say she may have got the date wrong. Ms Cook said: ‘I said to my husband “Gosh, that’s not fair - I wouldn’t have remembered it was Cambridge either”. ‘I don’t think he can be accused of lying because I can’t remember it. I was a participant in that game show but I wouldn’t have known it was Cambridge either.’ She said she did not remember Harris having been in the same episode as her, and told the jury that, during her four decades in broadcasting, she had forgotten ‘loads’ of events she had been to. The BBC Radio 4 presenter said that, on one occasion, her mother-in-law gave her a DVD of an event at the Royal Opera House, and she assumed she had confused her with Sue Lawley. She told the court: ‘To my amazement it was me hosting a gala event at the Royal Opera House. ‘I have no memory whatsoever of doing it.’ Harris, 84, from Bray, Berkshire, arrived at Southwark Crown Court in London today accompanied by his daughter Bindi Harris (left) and his niece Jenny Harris (right). He denies 12 counts of indecent assault . Sue Cook (pictured with Nick Ross in 1984 while presenting Crimewatch) said she also could not remember appearing on Star Games in the 1970s . Harris had previously told the jury that he had never been to Cambridge until four years ago, but pictures later emerged (above) showing he had appeared in a Star Games show in the city in 1978 . In cross-examination by Sasha Wass QC, she admitted that she would not ‘swear blind’ under oath that she had not been somewhere for work. Ms Cook said she had appeared on the show three times, in episodes filmed in May 1979. Harris is standing trial for 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies. Count 1: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on girl aged 15 . Count 2: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 3: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 4: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 5: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 6: Indecent assault between 5/4/80 and 4/4/81 on same girl, 15 . Count 7: Indecent assault between 1/1/84 and 1/1/85 on same girl, then aged 19 . Count 8: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on second girl, aged 14 . Count 9: Indecent assault on same girl, 14 . Count 10: Indecent assault on 31/5/86 on same girl, 14 . Count 11: Indecent assault between 1/1/68 and 1/1/70 on third girl, aged 7-8 . Count 12: Indecent assault on fourth girl, 14, between 1/1/75 and 1/1/76 . The former television presenter denies all the counts . Earlier, the court heard from Harris’s former tour manager, Ken Jeacle, who said women fans would ‘rush up’ to the performer and put their arms around him. He would have to ‘extract’ the star from those situations to avoid fans getting too close, the court heard. Speaking via video-link from Australia, Mr Jeacle said: ‘Rolf Harris, as I observed, was a gentleman who was a very affectionate, warm, outgoing personality. His tendency to be demonstrative with outward affection is constant. ‘He has absolutely no problem whatsoever with giving somebody a warm embrace, he’s done it to me a million times. ‘His behaviour to other people has always been as a gentleman, as somebody whom I have been proud to be in the company of, and never at any time have I even perceived any sort of attitude or behaviour of any type which could be in any way questionable.’ He said that in the 1990s Harris told him ‘he didn’t feel as free and as joyful’ performing on stage, and he and his wife Alwen had both been ill, so his tours of South East Asia and Australia ended, with an 11-date reprisal in 2008 at Sydney Opera House. In cross-examination, he said claims that Harris had two extra-marital affairs were not his business. ‘Not only can I not speak (about it), I will not speak of that because it’s none of my concern what Rolf Harris’s private life was. I never even asked about it.’ Harris is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies. The trial continues.

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A council has admitted telling its traffic wardens ‘not to bother’ putting parking tickets on foreign cars. Parking chiefs at Sevenoaks District Council in Kent said they considered issuing tickets to illegally parked vehicles with foreign registration plates a ‘waste of resources. They claimed this is because it is 'impossible' for them to enforce penalty charges against the owners of such cars. Confession: Sevenoaks District Council (pictured) in Kent has admitted telling its traffic wardens 'not to bother' putting parking tickets on foreign cars. It said it was a 'waste of resources' issuing tickets to such vehicles . A council spokesman said: 'While . we strive to enforce all parking restrictions, the DVLA [Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency] has explicitly . told council not to ask for vehicle keeper request for foreign . registered vehicles. 'In practice this makes it impossible to enforce penalty charges notices issued against the owners of these vehicles.' The council admitted its policy following a complaint from local shopkeeper Nick Lawrence, who runs Regal Shoe Repairs in Sevenoaks. Mr Lawrence said he and at least five other shopkeepers had contacted the council to report a car with Polish number plates which had illegally parked in the town centre. Difficulty: Parking chiefs claim it is 'impossible' for them to enforce penalty charges against the owners of foreign-registered vehicles (file picture) He claimed the dark blue Volkswagen Golf had been parked on double yellow lines for nearly a month - and was causing problems for delivery lorries attempting to get to the shops. He added that the car had not yet received a parking ticket, but a customer of his was given a £60 fine ‘within minutes’ after parking her UK-registered car behind the vehicle last week. 'Last Friday, one of my customers pulled up on double yellows behind the Polish car and ran into my shop for a couple of minutes,' he told the Sevenoaks Chronicle. 'When she went back she was being given a parking ticket. I was outraged - My customer was there for a few minutes and the Polish car had been parked illegally for weeks and weeks. 'It’s discrimination against British drivers and I think it’s absolutely unbelievable.' Today, a DVLA spokesman confirmed that there would be ‘no point’ in British councils contacting the government-run agency about foreign-registered cars - as it doesn’t hold any details about . them. The spokesman said that, by law, foreign vehicles must be registered with the DVLA after being in the . country for six months. If the owner of a car did not declare . the vehicle being in Britain by then, it would be 'a matter for the police to enforce’, she said. 'The DVLA will only have a record of a foreign-registered car if the owner contacts us after six months,' she said. 'They are entitled to be in the country for six months, but after they it must legally be registered with the DVLA.' Steve Farmer, 31, from Sevenoaks, condemned the policy towards foreign vehicles as a 'total joke'. 'The . [Polish] car has been a right pain for the past month - it had parked on double . yellows outside shops which need the space for early morning deliveries,' he said. Complaint: The council admitted its policy following a complaint from local shopkeeper Nick Lawrence. He said a Polish-registered Volkswagen Golf had been illegally parked for nearly a month without a ticket (file picture) 'It’s . a total joke that if you have a foreign car you can park where you like . and not get a ticket, but if you’re in a British car you get clobbered . within a minute of parking.' Today, the Volkswagen Golf 'suddenly vanished' after Mr Lawrence confronted the owner of the illegally parked vehicle. Mr Lawrence said: 'I saw the guy and had a word . in his ear and he moved the car. 'He . won’t be back again, but he’s probably parked on double yellows . somewhere else in town safe in the knowledge he won’t be getting a . parking ticket.' The Sevenoaks District Council spokesman said they know who . the owner is and have written to him. 'We have written to the owner informing him that he is not . permitted to park in this location and advised him that he has a legal . duty to register the vehicle with the DVLA once it has been in this . country for six months,' he said. It is estimated that there are between 30,000 and 40,000 foreign-registered cars on Britain’s roads illegally.","Sevenoaks Council in Kent told wardens not to put tickets on foreign cars .

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Wales manager Chris Coleman believes star player Gareth Bale should follow the example of Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo in hardly missing a match for his country. The Champions League-winning winger withdrew from the squad to face Holland in a friendly on Wednesday with a leg muscle injury. It is not the first time the 24-year-old has pulled out and former Wales manager Terry Yorath on Sunday warned Coleman having Bale available for friendlies will become more difficult. Chilling: Real Madrid and Wales star Gareth Bale tweeted this picture with the message: 'Selamat Pagi Jakarta! Just got to the hotel, thanks for the great welcome at the airport!' Hard work: The Wales players train for their game with Holland at Swadlincote on Sunday . Meanwhile... Bale is in Jakarta on a promotional tour for Indonesian fans . But Coleman is confident he is not experiencing a repeat of what happened to a number of his predecessors in relation to Ryan Giggs. 'A lot was said about Ryan when he missed a lot of friendlies for us but I don't necessarily think that was his fault as there was a lot of pressure from Manchester United for him not to come and play,' the Wales boss told Press Association Sport. 'He was the new George Best, a wonderkid, a sensation, and Manchester United wanted to look after him. 'I think now the game has moved on a bit. Gareth Bale is one of the best players in the world and he is up there with Ronaldo, playing in the same team. 'Look how many caps Ronaldo has got for Portugal - over 100 - he never misses. If it is good enough for Ronaldo it is good enough for anyone. 'To be fair in my time 'Baley' has come even when he has been injured because he wants to be around the team and supporting the team. 'We have never had an issue with him because he has already played friendlies for us, he has missed one or two but he has also played one or two.' Wales star: Gareth Bale shouldn't be missing many games for Wales, according to boss Chris Coleman . Follow his lead: Cristiano Ronaldo has over 100 caps for Portugal, and barely misses a match . Coleman admits there is a balancing act to be done with Bale, who has won 47 caps, as what he does not want to do is alienate Real Madrid in the longer-term by over-working one of their prized assets. 'There are a lot of games for top-level players who are playing league, cup, Champions League and international games,' he added. 'Now and again they do need the rest but it is more the mental than the physical. 'I hope it doesn't come to the stage where we don't get Gareth for any friendlies. 'It is not something I have envisaged really. I hope he is the same in the future as he has been in the past. 'When he comes with us generally in friendlies he may play 45 minutes to an hour but we are mindful of sending him back in good condition - like all our players. 'If you take advantage and send players back who can't play at the weekend the next time you go calling their managers are like 'Well, you can't play them'. 'I've been there myself. We have a duty of care.' Rare appearance: Bale trains with team-mates ahead of a Macedonia qualifier last year . No 1: Ronaldo lead Portugal to the World Cup with a superb performance against Sweden in the play-off . Coleman stressed he was not just singling out Bale as he expected all his players to be available for every game where possible but such is the Real Madrid player's profile the focus inevitably falls on him. 'The gauntlet is thrown down to our lads to say ""Who is going to be the one to top 100 caps?"",' he added. 'If you look at the Serbians and Croatians and even England - Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole are up there - with 100-plus caps. 'You do that by putting yourself up for all the games, not just the nice juicy ones worth three points. Best of friend: The duo have built up a fine relationship at Real Madrid this season . Watching eye: Chris Coleman is preparing for a tricky friendly against Holland on Wednesday . 'If you represent your country you represent your country and it is a huge honour to do that. 'Portugal have been playing tournament football and we want to do that but to play tournament football you sacrifice your summer and it is a small sacrifice. 'You can have as many holidays when you retire as you like but your best days are your playing days, playing for your country is the best experience in my opinion.' Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen will captain the side for the first time against Holland.","Coleman tries not to criticise Bale in interview .
But says he has missed 'one or two games', which Ronaldo never does...

"By . Chris Brooke . Unleashing the full might of the justice system on a Lithuanian for the theft of two 10p plastic bags might, even in itself, have seemed a little heavy handed. But when the justice system then got into a muddle over the difference between a Lithuanian and a Latvian, the case descended into farce. The prosecution of Tadas Tarkutis, 26, for stealing two supermarket ‘bags for life’ has ended up costing taxpayers £5,000 – after a blunder in which the wrong translator was sent to court. Tadas Tarkutis, 26, was arrested after he swiped two 'bags for life', costing 10p each, from a Sainsbury's store in Scarborough, North Yorkshire . The Lithuanian national was arrested for the theft from Sainsbury’s on Wednesday last week and detained by police. But . when he went to court the following day, a Latvian-speaking interpreter . was accidentally sent instead of a  Lithuanian speaker and the hearing . had to be postponed. Tarkutis then spent a second night in custody . before returning to Scarborough Magistrates’ Court for another hearing, . after a translator who spoke the correct language had been found. A . court source commented afterwards: ‘It’s like someone somewhere had . just picked out a country that begins with “L”. It’s ridiculous.’ By this time the estimated bill for keeping Tarkutis in custody and dealing with his case had risen to around £3,000. He admitted stealing the bags from the supermarket in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. But . because he was in breach of a suspended sentence for a previous crime . he was jailed for six weeks – of which he will serve half – adding a . further £2,000 to the public’s bill for holding him in prison. He was not ordered to pay any contribution to court costs or for the stolen 10p bags. The trial of Tadas Tarkutis, 26, ended up costing £3,000 after the wrong translator was hired for his appearance at Scarborough Magistrates' Court (above) The . Crown Prosecution Service said the jail sentence validated its decision . to bring the case to court. Tarkutis’s previous offence, for which he . was given the suspended jail term, was not revealed but is believed to . be theft. After the case, . Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘Criminals must always . be brought to justice, but this seems a remarkable amount of taxpayers’ money to spend on a rather minor case. ‘Ordinary . people rightly expect justice, but they don’t expect it to cost over . the odds. Avoidable errors have only put the cost up more.’ After . Tarkutis – a Lithuanian national said to have been living in Birmingham . – was arrested for stealing the bags, officers summoned a Lithuanian . translator to make the 60-mile trip from Harrogate to Scarborough to . enable him to be questioned. The . interpreter spent around four hours with him before returning home. But . the same person was not available to translate for him in court the . following morning, and Capita TI, the translation services firm . contracted to provide interpreters for court cases, sent a . Latvian-speaking woman instead. Due . to a shortage of Latvian speakers, this interpreter made a 160-mile, . three-hour trip from Rugby in Warwickshire, only to discover she . couldn’t do the job. Magistrates realised what had happened and apologised, before advising the translator to ensure she still got paid. Tarkutis . spent another night in police custody, and when he was brought back to . court on Friday a Lithuanian interpreter had finally been found. Yesterday . a Capita spokesman blamed police for the blunder: ‘Capita Translation . and Interpreting supplied a Latvian interpreter on May 29 because the . police booked a Latvian interpreter. ‘When the magistrates’ court realised the error they informed us that a Lithuanian interpreter was required instead. ‘We therefore supplied a Lithuanian interpreter on May 30.’ A . North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘We will be working with Capita . to look into the full circumstances as to why the wrong interpreter . attended court.’ Official . figures released last month show the cost to the taxpayer of hiring . court interpreters under the outsourcing deal has almost doubled to . £15.5million in just one year. There . are around 11,000 foreign nationals in UK prisons – about 13 per cent . of the total population – and many require interpreters at court . hearings and appeals.","Tadas Tarkutis, 26, stole two 'bags for life' from Sainsbury's in Scarborough .

"By . Andrew Levy . When a severe storm threatened his boat on a dark winter’s night, Steve Kingston refused to abandon ship. Although council officials told him to get to safety, the captain feared his passenger ferry could be a danger to the public if she broke her moorings in the massive tidal surge while unattended. But the council saw things differently – and when Mr Kingston, 62, would not take their advice and leave the boat, they responded by calling the police, who pepper-sprayed the grandfather of three and handcuffed him before throwing him in a cell. Captain at the helm: Steve Kingston, 62, was pepper-sprayed and handcuffed by police when he refused to leave his boat . He is now demanding an apology after a charge of resisting arrest was dropped when a judge said police did not have ‘the power to force him off his boat’ and CCTV evidence showed he had not put up a fight. Mr Kingston did not want to comment yesterday because his official complaint is being reviewed by Norfolk Police. But his wife Gail, 53, said: ‘We’ve got a complaint in but it is not about money or anything like that. My husband just wants an apology.’ After the court case was dropped, Mr Kingston said: ‘I am still bewildered about how the whole situation came about. What should have been a simple passing of high water with my presence, just in case it was needed to attend to any problem that could have arisen, instead turned into an unnecessarily traumatic night. ‘The whole thing was instigated by people who don’t understand the river or marine situations. ‘All other . boats... at affected marinas up and down the country would have had . crew standing watch on them that night. You can’t separate a boat from . its owner. A boat without a person is a liability.’ Mr . Kingston has been operating West Lynn Ferry on the River Great Ouse . since 2000. His boat carries up to 15 passengers between the historic . centre of King’s Lynn and West Lynn, a route that has been in operation . since 1285. Ancient crossing: A ferry route over the River Great Ouse, pictured, has been operating since 1285 . He has also assisted with rescue operations on the river in the past at the request of emergency services. On the night of December 5 last year, a high tide combined with the worst storms Britain had seen in 60 years led to flooding at South Quay and Purfleet Quay in King’s Lynn and caused severe damage to eastern coastlines. Lifelong sailor Mr Kingston informed the council he planned to moor his ferry, which had no passengers on board, on the pontoon at South Quay. An official said he could use the pontoon but ordered him to leave the boat. When he refused, police arrived, incapacitating him with pepper spray before manhandling him off the boat. He was taken to a police station and put in a cell to await an interview. Afterwards, he made several appearances at West Norfolk Magistrates’ Court and a date had been set for his trial. Throughout the process he was refused legal aid, leaving him out of pocket. It was only in April, four months after his ordeal began, that district judge Peter Veits said: ‘I don’t think the police had the power to force him off his boat. They could have said, “If you want to stay, fine, but we are not responsible for your safety” and walked away.’ The Crown Prosecution Service dropped the case, saying there was ‘no longer a realistic prospect of conviction’. Mr Kingston, who lives in West Lynn, added at the time: ‘I was not aggressive or abusive to the three police officers and was within my legal rights to remain on my boat.’ A CPS spokesman said the case was dropped after CCTV footage of the incident was reviewed. Norfolk Police said: ‘We have received a complaint from Mr Kingston and an investigation is ongoing.’","Steve Kingston, 62, runs a river ferry company in King's Lynn, Norfolk .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Ten hospital workers have been suspended after an elderly woman died days after she was found with 'unexplained and serious injuries' on the ward. Tegwen Roderick, 88, was being treated at the Cwm Cynon Hospital in Mountain Ash, South Wales, when her injury was spotted. She was transferred to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, but died last week - six days after the injury was detected. Investigation: Ten staff at the Cwm Cynon Hospital in Mountain Ash, South Wales, have been suspended after Tegwen Roderick, 88, died days after she was found with 'unexplained and serious injuries' Four medical staff at the 128-bed Cwm Cynon Hospital were today helping police with a criminal investigation into the death, as workers were questioned over how Mrs Roderick was hurt. Mrs Roderick lived with husband John, 89, in the small village of Abercanaid near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. He was today being comforted by family at the smart terraced house in the village.'We won't be making any comment whatsoever,' said a family spokesman. Neighbours said Mrs Roderick had been in 'failing health' over recent months but was regularly seen in the village before being admitted to hospital. Her husband, who is also in poor health, was said to be 'devastated' by the tragedy. One neighbour who didn't want to be named said: 'It's very sad, she was not seriously ill when she went into hospital and now this has happened to her. 'She was a lovely lady - everyone here is very sad about what has happened.' Transfer: Mrs Roderick was transferred to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil (pictured), but died last week - six days after the injury was detected . Former mayor of Merthyr Tydfil Derek Games MBE paid tribute to Mrs Roderick who he had known for 60 years. 'Tegwen was a beautiful and gentle woman - everyone is shocked by what has happened. 'She was a schoolteacher many years ago and had suffered ill health over recent years. 'Tegwen and her husband John were devoted to each other - unfortunately they didn't have any children. 'They were a lovely couple and John was committed to her, looking after her when she became ill. 'I hadn't seen either of them for a few weeks but I will be going to see John now to pass on my sympathies.' Mr Games, 80, who lives in a neighbouring street in Abercanaid, added: 'All we know is that she was injured in hospital and the police are investigating. It could have been a fall or something more serious.' Cwm Taf University Health Board . confirmed that five nightshift workers have been suspended, along with . the five members of staff who took over the following morning as a . 'precautionary measure' following the incident on May 29. Neither . the hospital, nor South Wales Police would confirm if the staff members . had been nurses, nor give any detail as to the nature of the Ms . Roderick's injury. 'As part of routine patient care a patient at Ysbyty Cwm Cynon was identified as having an unexplained injury. 'As is always the case in such a situation, the Health Board initiated a multi-agency strategy meeting to be held to consider the circumstances. This took place the following day. 'Staff on duty at the time are in the process of being interviewed to assist the investigation and the family have been kept fully informed of the situation. 'The Health Board extends its heartfelt condolences to the family at this very sad and difficult time.' Mr Roderick is being supported by the health board and is being kept 'fully informed' of the investigation. A post mortem examination was due carried out yesterday to discover if she had died as a result of the injury she received in hospital. A police spokesman said: 'South Wales Police is continuing its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of 88 year-old Tegwen Roderick at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil on Wednesday, 4th June 2014. 'A post mortem into her death is currently under way. 'Ms Roderick, from Merthyr Tydfil, was transferred to Prince Charles hospital from Ysbyty Cwm Cynon with serious injuries which are being treated as unexplained. 'At this stage there is no confirmed link between the injuries and her death. 'Four people are assisting officers with their enquiries.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The United Kingdom is a nation divided by wealth, health and patriotism, a new study revealed today. From fertility and baby names to life expectancy and immigration, there are stark differences between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The new Compendium of UK Statistics draws together data from across the four nations of the UK, and reveals how life varies dramatically depending on where you live. The Office for National Statistics insisted the report is more than an interesting account of life in the UK. The Office for National Statistics released the Compendium of UK Statistics to reveal how life varies between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland . ‘It has been produced to facilitate comparisons and is intended to help support key decisions such as the forthcoming Scottish referendum on independence which is due to take place on 18 September 2014, the ONS said. It shows that while people in England generate the most wealth and have highest disposable income, they receive the least in spending on public services. England is also the most crowded nation, home to people with the highest life expectancy, highest fertility and the biggest appetite for drinking alcohol. By contrast Scotland has the highest employment rate and lowest household wealth and fertility least fertile. Scots are also the most patriotic and catch almost two thirds of the UK’s fish. Wales is home to more people born in the rest of the UK, has the highest rate of recycling, has the cheapest mortgages but the least disposable income. In Northern Ireland meanwhile, unemployment is highest and life expectancy lowest, but it received more in public money per head and has the cheapest houses. Here we take a look at the treasure trove of information and what it tells us about the state of the nation. The vast bulk of people in the UK live in England. Of the 63.7million people in the four nations in 2012, 84 per cent were in England, 8.3 per cent in Scotland, 4.8 per cent in Wales and just 2.9 per cent in Northern Ireland. Little wonder, then, that England is much more crowded than the rest of the country. There are 411 people per sq km in England, compared to just 146 in Wales, 134 in Northern Ireland and 68 in Scotland. A more detailed breakdown shows the difference between our cities and the countryside is even more stark. The most crowded area is Islington, north London where 14,206 people are squeezed into each sq km. The highest population density outside London is in Portsmouth, where each sq km has 5,118 jostling for space. Life could get lonely in the least populated areas, with just 26 people per sq km in Powys in Wales and 36 per sq km in Moyle in Northern Ireland. In the Scottish area of Highland and Eileen Siar there are just 9 people in each sq km, the lowest anywhere in the UK. Things could be about to get more crowded, at least in some areas. By 2037 the UK population is projected to rise by 15 per cent to 73.3million. While England expects population growth of around 0.6 per cent per year, Northern Ireland will grow by 0.4 per cent and Scotland and Wales just 0.3 per cent. In every part of the country the population is getting older. From 2012 to 2037 the number of pensioners will rise by 31 per cent, with the steepest annual rise expected in Northern Ireland 1.4 per cent. Wales is home to more people born in the rest of the UK – 21.8 per cent are from England, Scotland or Northern Ireland. While 84 per cent of the population lives in England, 87 per cent of immigrants live there, Just two per cent of the 498,000 immigrants in the UK live in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is the most fertile, with a fertility rate of 2.03 compared to 1.67 in Scotland. The names of the babies born in the different countries also vary. In 2012 the most popular names for boys and girls in England were Harry and Amelia, while in Wales they were Jack and Amelia. In both Scotland and Northern Ireland most boys were called Jack and most girls, Sophie. Ahead of the independence referendum, patriotism appears to be highest in Scotland. Some 83 per cent of people living there felt they had some Scottish national identity, compared to 70 per cent of people in England who has some English national identity and 66 per cent of the Welsh in Wales. England is the economic powerhouse of the UK, generating the most wealth per person. Yet it receives much less in spending on public services. Economic activity per head, known as Gross Value Added, is estimated at £21,295 across the UK. In England the figure is almost £700 higher, at £21,937, suggesting the economic output outstrips the rest of the country. In Scotland GVA is £20,013, Northern Ireland £16,217 and Wales just £15,401. Prodictivty is also highest in England, 1.5 per cent above the UK average, with Scotland 2.6 per cent below, Wales 14.8 per cent and Northern Ireland 17.2 per cent blow. However, public spending per person is almost in reverse to the wealth generated. In 2012-13, Northern Ireland had the highest state spending per head - £10,876, followed by Scotland £10,152 and Wales £9,709. Only England had a public spending per head (£8,529) which was lower than the UK average of £8,788. Scotland paid the most tax per person at £7,056 per household, Northern Ireland £5,647 and Wales £5,564. Figures were not available for England. In the first three months of 2014 employment was highest in Scotland at 73.5 per cent and lowest in Northern Ireland at 67.8 per cent. Levels of public sector employment also varies widely, with 27.9 per cent in state-funded jobs in Northern Ireland compared to just 17.4 per cent in England. Weekly earnings were highest in England at £520.50, followed by Scotland (£508.30), Wales (£472.30) and Northern Ireland which had the lowest earnings (£460.00). The new data reveals how the small things which mark big differences in the way we live our lives . The English drink more, the Welsh recycle more and Scots are better qualified. In 2012, 12 per cent of over-16s in England had drunk alcohol on five or more days in the last week, compared with 8 per cent in Wales and 9 per cent in Scotland. In 2010-12, England also had the highest male and female life expectancy at birth at 79.0 years for boys and 82.8 years for girls. Wales had the second highest life expectancy for males at 78.1 years, while life expectancy for females was 82.1 years. In Northern Ireland life expectancy at birth for females was also 82.1 years, while for males it was 77.7 years. Scotland had the lowest life expectancy at birth at 76.5 years for males and 80.7 years for females. On education, 17.2 per cent of people in Northern Ireland have no qualifications at all while in Scotland 29.4 have an NVQ level 4 or above. People in Wales seem to be the most environmentally friendly. The household recycling rate was 49 per cent in Wales (49 per cent), followed by England (43 per cent) Northern Ireland (40 per cent). Separate figures for Scotland show a rate of 40-41 per cent. Scotland is responsible for landing 60 per cent of all of the UK’s fish supplies, worth £457million. Average house prices are highest in England, worth £261,000 and lowest in Northern Ireland, £136,000. Rents are lowest in Northern Ireland, at £41 per week, but mortgage bills are lowest in Wales, at £101 per week. Families in England spend £491-a-week, more than £80 more than the £411.30 in Wales. Some 23 per cent of children live in low income households in Northern Ireland, compared to only 17 per cent in Scotland. England is home to 84 per cent of the UK’s cars and makes 91 per cent of the UK’s rail journeys.","Spotlight turned on life in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Scots will be able to buy fish and chips every day for 10 weeks with the money they save by voting 'No' to independence, the Government has claimed. Last week the Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander claimed there was a 'UK dividend' worth £1,400 for every Scot by staying in the union. Now the Scotland Office has released a list of 12 things that Scots will be able to buy with the cash - each illustrated using lego characters and published online. Scroll down for video . Scots will be able to eat fish and chips every day for 10 weeks if they vote 'No' to independence, according to the Government in London. But the SNP have rejected claims that there is a 'UK Dividend' of £1,400 for staying in the union . According to the Government, Scots will be able to 'scoff 280 hotdogs' at the Edinburgh Festival, drink more than 600 coffees or get a hair cut every month for three and a half years. The bizarre press release sparked ridicule online - with one person writing on Twitter that it was 'proof if any were needed that UK Govt takes Scots for mugs'. SNP MP Pete Wishart joked: 'They may take our lives but they'll never take our, err, lego.' It also threatens to overshadow a speech by the Business Secretary Vince Cable in Glasgow today. Mr Cable is expected to claim credit for economic growth in Scotland in a bid to convince voters to stay in the UK. He will say: 'Since May 2010, when the coalition came to power, unemployment has dropped by 40,000 - 54,000 lower than the peak in 2012 - and an extra . First Minister Alex Salmond claims independence would leave Scots £600 a year better off . 148,000 people are now in work. 'This hasn't happened by accident. The coalition has taken various steps to make the job market fairer, to improve opportunities and minimise exploitation. 'Our efforts apply to Scotland as they do to Wales, Northern Ireland and England.' His speech will focus on the business case for a vote against Scottish independence in the referendum this September. Leaving the UK would hold back efforts to raise living standards, he is expected to claim. 'To continue job creation, to raise living standards across the UK, we need balanced economic growth to maintain business confidence and to encourage investment,' he will say. 'I don't believe Scottish independence can sustain these conditions as effectively and efficiently as the UK.' But SNP Treasury spokesman Stewart Hosie said: 'Scotland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, richer per head than the UK, France and Japan. 'With a ""Yes"" vote we can make this wealth work for all the people and put Scotland first, in contrast to the Westminster system obsessed with London, which even the UK Government now admit harms Scotland's economy.' But according to the Government, Scots will be £1,400 worse off by walking away from the UK. The Scotland Office published its list on-line yesterday. The Government report claims: 'New financial analysis from HM Treasury shows that every one of us in Scotland will be £1400 better off every year staying part of the UK than we would be if we voted for independence. 'But how far does £1400 go? Here are 12 examples:' 1. An overseas holiday for two with cash leftover for sun cream. (Average cost: £680 per person for a 10-day jaunt.) 2. Pay for Christmas presents twice over, with some money left over to spend on Hogmanay celebrations. (Average spend on Christmas in Scotland: £610.) 3. Hop on the bus between Glasgow and Edinburgh (and back) 127 times. That’s the equivalent of a daily commute for more than 5 and half months. (Average cost: £11 for a return ticket.) 4. Scoff 280 hotdogs at the Edinburgh Festival. (Average cost: £5.) 5. Cover your family’s yearly shoe habit for about the next 6 years. (Average annual household spend on footwear in Scotland: £234.) 6. Fill up your fuel tank for the whole year with money leftover for an MOT and a few trips to the car wash. (Average household spend on petrol/diesel for personal transport in Scotland: £1123.20, average MOT costs: £29.65- £124.50.) 7. Watch Aberdeen play all season with two mates – with a few pies and Bovrils thrown in for good measure. (Average cost: £425 for one 2014/15 main stand season ticket.) 8. Experience 636 joyful caffeine highs. (Average cost: £2.20 for a medium cappuccino.) 9. Share a meal of fish and chips with your family every day for around 10 weeks, with a couple of portions of mushy peas thrown in. (Average cost of fish and chips in UK: £4.74 per portion, based on family of 4 sharing meal.) 10. Go for one haircut a month for over 3 and half years…you can go for significantly more if you’re a man! (Average spend for women per haircut: £29.99.) 11. Pay off your energy bills in full over the year. (Average household cost in Scotland: £1211.60 per year.) 12. And finally, you’ll still have enough left over for endless hugs with everyone to celebrate being in a United Kingdom.

"By . Liz Hull . Advances: Sales executive Anna Mazover endured unwelcome advances from her boss Darren Scott, including having her leg groped . Two female sales executives were groped and leered at by their married boss, who was ‘fixated’ with one of the women’s breasts, a tribunal has ruled. Darren Scott, 55, was obsessed with Diane Nicholl-Pierson’s breasts and regularly spoke to them instead of her face, an employment tribunal found. He also fondled her thigh and groped the leg of her colleague, Anna Mazover, 29, whom he falsely accused of being a part-time prostitute. Mr Scott made smutty comments to the women, both university graduates, about his sexual prowess and desirability. He also made unwelcome advances towards Miss Mazover, offering to buy her gifts from Harrods and Selfridges, and tried to persuade both women to dump their partners and go out with him instead. Last night the women – who are each in line for up to £25,000 compensation after the tribunal ruled they had been victims of sexual harassment – told the Daily Mail they felt ‘vindicated’ by the judgment. However, tribunal judge Dr Simon Auerbach said claims that he had asked the women for a threesome and bragged about bedding prostitutes and strippers and snorting cocaine were untrue. The panel also rejected the women’s allegations that Mr Scott had shown them images of scantily clad women on escort websites on his computer. The judge said the women, who earned £18,000-a-year plus potentially high commissions, exaggerated the allegations because they feared they were about to lose their jobs. The tribunal, sitting in central London, was told that the women made a formal complaint against Mr Scott two days after he warned them about their poor sales performance. Darren Scott told Anna Mazover, right, that their colleague Diane . Nicholl-Pierson, left, would not drown as 'she would just float because . of her boobs' Yesterday Miss Nicholl-Pierson, 24, . who has a new job but has been treated for depression, said: ‘We were . regularly embarrassed and humiliated at work by Darren Scott, it was . disgusting the way he treated us. 'He would stare at my breasts, making . remarks about them.’ The tribunal ruled that both women wrongly claimed that Mr Scott had invited both women to his £1.4 million penthouse for a threesome . Miss Mazover, who is working as a sales executive . for her father’s security business in her native Ukraine, added: ‘It was . his word against ours, but now people know he did sexually harass us.’ The . women began working at Entico Corporation Ltd, a Mayfair-based . publishing firm, in May last year. Miss Mazover told the tribunal that . on her first day Mr Scott said she had a ‘great body’, adding: ‘Have you . ever considered working in a strip club?’ She . claimed that the following day Mr Scott asked the pair of them to have . sex with him at his £1.4million penthouse in north London in return for a . promotion. Although he had . made some comment about Miss Mazover’s appearance being ‘good’, Mr Scott . did not refer to a ‘strip club,’ the tribunal found. The panel also . said that while he did ask the women to go and see his flat, he did not . ask them for a threesome. Recovering . alcoholic Mr Scott told the tribunal a threesome would be his ‘worst . nightmare’ because, even with Viagra, he was unable to have sex. However, . the panel upheld Miss Nicholl-Pierson’s claims that, almost immediately . after she started working for the firm, Mr Scott spoke to her breasts . rather than her face and made crude comments about them. The . panel partly upheld the women’s claims of sexual harassment and . victimisation, but rejected their sex and race discrimination claims. Michael McDonough, who represented the women, said he would be seeking ‘substantial damages’. ‘It . was a terrible ordeal for both women,’ he said. ‘There is some . disappointment that certain of their allegations were not proven but . that is more than balanced by the fact that sexually humiliating verbal . comments and actual sexual assaults were found proven.’ A spokesman for Entico said that Mr Scott was an independent contractor and no longer worked for the firm. The tribunal heard that Diana Nicholl-Pierson (left) and Anna Mazover (right) had joined Entico Corporation Ltd in Mayfair in May 2013 but were soon facing dismissal for poor performance .","Women complained of sexual harassment at Mayfair publishing company .

"By . Tara Brady . Deborah Poulton was three times over the alcohol limit when she was caught at the wheel with her daughter sat beside her . A mother who was swigging vodka at the wheel of a car with her baby daughter sat next to her was three times over the drink-drive limit, a court has heard. Deborah Poulton was pulled over by police after being reported by another driver for dangerous driving. Poulton’s car was spotted weaving across a road before mounting the kerb, narrowly missing a cyclist. When police stopped the 38-year-old, they found her 13-month-old daughter strapped into a car seat of the Fiat Seicento, the court was told. Poulton, from Poole, Dorset, was arrested after a roadside breath test revealed she had 103 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, three times the legal limit. The baby was picked up by her father. Poulton pleaded guilty to drink driving at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court and now faces a minimum 12-month driving ban, up to six months in prison and a fine of up to £5,000. A separate charge of being drunk in charge of a child was dropped. Heather Jackson, prosecuting, said that earlier the same day staff at a nearby Co-op store had reported Poulton for drunken behaviour. She said: 'She went to visit a friend during the day, then left her daughter with her friend to drive to the Co-op to buy cigarette papers and wine. 'In her car was a Lucozade bottle containing vodka from which she was drinking. The police received a call about her demeanour from the store - she had slurred speech. 'She returned to her friend’s address in the car and consumed the bottle of Lucozade and vodka. 'Poulton then left with her daughter in the car, almost crashing several times.' Poulton pleaded guilty to drink driving at Bournemouth Magistrates' Court and faces a driving ban . Mark Proctor, mitigating, said Poulton’s drinking had 'spiralled out of control' and that she hid alcohol in her car so her boyfriend did not know she had it. He said: 'She turned to alcohol as a means to deal with other issues in her life. 'She hadn’t felt under the influence of alcohol when she got into the car. 'She was very forthcoming in her interview with the police and very apologetic for her actions.' Poulton will be sentenced on June 10.","Deborah Poulton pulled over by police after being reported by another driver .

"By . Tara Brady . Rhiannon Brooker, 30, claimed Paul Fensome, 46, forced her to have sex with him on 11 occasions . A lying law graduate who falsely accused her boyfriend of rape so she would have an excuse for failing her legal exams is facing jail after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice. Rhiannon Brooker, 30, claimed Paul Fensome, 46, forced her to have sex with him on 11 occasions and faked injuries to suggest he beat her. The Birmingham law graduate even alleged Mr Fensome caused her to have a miscarriage by punching her in the stomach. During the eight-week trial at Bristol Crown Court, jurors were told Brooker falsified the allegations because her party lifestyle led her to fail her bar assessments. She is said to have told an exam committee that her performance suffered from 'extenuating circumstances'. Mr Fensome, a 6ft 8in tall heavy metal fan, was arrested, charged and held in custody for 36 days before police realised there was no evidence against him. Brooker, from Frampton Cotterell, South Gloucestershire, denied 20 charges of doing an act tending and intended to pervert the course of justice between May 2011 and January 2012. The charges related to 11 made-up claims of rape, eight assaults and one of false imprisonment. After nearly 21 hours of deliberations, the jury of 10 men and two women found Brooker guilty of 12 charges - related to five false rape claims, six assaults and one of false imprisonment. Jurors failed to reach verdicts on the other eight charges and were discharged by Judge Julian Lambert. The prosecution is not seeking a re-trial and Brooker, who was released on bail, will be sentenced on June 26. Prosecutor David Bartlett told the court: 'One of the reasons for her false allegations was that she was living an active social life in Bristol and not doing the work required to pass the assessments. 'So she falsified the allegations in order to give substance to her extenuating circumstances forms. The Birmingham law graduate even alleged Mr Fensome caused her to have a miscarriage by punching her . 'Her knowledge of criminal law and procedure derived from her law degree course in Birmingham and was likely to be greater than that of most rape complainants. 'The prosecution alleges that she knew that the course of justice was being perverted and intended to pervert the course of justice throughout that period. 'When discrepancies were revealed and put to Brooker, she continued to maintain her account in the face of evidence to the contrary. 'In addition, prior to her initial reports, Brooker was responsible for infliction of injuries upon herself which indicates the considered nature of these false complaints. 'After Mr Fensome had been charged, Brooker deleted text messages from her phone which would have pointed to his innocence.' The 30-year-old was a graduate from Birmingham University (pictured) before moving to Bristol . Mr Bartlett told the court that 'confident and outspoken' Brooker took a law degree at Birmingham City University before moving to Bristol in September 2010. She attended the University of the West of England to become a barrister by taking Bar vocational course qualifications. The court heard that shortly before Brooker moved to Bristol, she told colleagues at a store where she worked in Birmingham that Mr Fensome raped her. She then turned up to lectures in Bristol with facial injuries and bruising, telling students he attacked her because she wanted to break up with him. In May 2011, she told police he had attacked her, embellishing the story with claims of physical assault and false imprisonment. 'I believe that in some funny way I have . hit out against Paul as he was close to me - the nearest target of . those unresolved feelings of anger - and I regret the hurt that I’ve . caused him as a result' Rhiannon Brooker . She told a friend she was pregnant but six weeks later told them she had lost the baby because her boyfriend punched her in the ribs. Mr Fensome, a Birmingham railway signalman and self-confessed 'mosher' at heavy metal gigs, denied the assaults, describing them as a 'load of rubbish', and had 'cast-iron alibis' for the dates. Brooker did not wish to see him and when he gave his evidence she sat behind a screen in the dock.Mr Fensome told jurors: 'We had a loving relationship and the sexual relationship was the same. I’ve never hit another woman in my life. I didn’t force sex on her in any way.' Mr Bartlett told the court: 'Eventually the Crown dropped the numerous charges against Paul Fensome. 'Taken as a whole, the evidence showed that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. 'Expert opinion was obtained which suggested that those injuries of Brooker that were photographed were self-inflicted. 'Brooker seemed oblivious to the impact of the false allegations on Mr Fensome’s family, causing distress, disruption and expense. 'In addition, Brooker deceived other students and her tutors who committed time and emotional support to her cause. 'We suggest that the defendant has an inherent tendency to fabricate allegations and needs always to be the centre of attention. 'She has never lost that tendency or need, with disastrous consequences for herself and those around her.' The court heard Brooker sat the first four of her 12 assessments for the bar course and persuaded the extenuating circumstance committee to let her sit them all at a later date. She eventually withdrew the rape allegations, confirming they were false and admitted injuries seen by witnesses were self-inflicted. Railway signalman Mr Fensome, 46, had a brief romance with Brooker before they went own separate ways and he later met and married someone else. 'The impact has been absolutely massive on my family' Paul Fensome . He told a press conference yesterday: 'When I first heard about the accusations I was shocked. 'It was unbelievable. I was completely gobsmacked when they came to arrest me. 'They took me to our local police station and I was being questioned until midnight and I was then sent to Bristol for questioning. 'The impact has been absolutely massive on my family. 'My niece in particular took it rather hard because she was the one who introduced Rhiannon to our family. 'Everyone at work, my family members, friends that I haven't spoken to in a long time, all stuck behind me the whole time. 'I would like to thank the legal team that have worked with me - there has been a lot of travelling up to Birmingham for them so they have had to be away from their family.' Brooker told police: 'The allegations were not true and I am sorry I made them. I find it very difficult to understand why I said these things. 'I believe that in some funny way I have hit out against Paul as he was close to me - the nearest target of those unresolved feelings of anger - and I regret the hurt that I’ve caused him as a result. 'I am trying to work hard with these feelings and I understand that they have to be resolved and put behind me.' When detectives told her of the decision to drop the charges against Mr Fensome, she became tearful, the court heard. The following day she was found slumped against a tree by a river with a bottle of vodka and a strip of anti-depressants. Judge Lambert ordered the eight counts to which the jury were unable to reach verdicts to lie on file. Chief Superintendent Sarah Crew, Avon and Somerset Police's lead for rape and sexual offences, said: 'Rhiannon Brooker has proved herself to be a very calculating and manipulative woman whose allegations resulted in an innocent man being charged with serious offences and remanded in custody awaiting trial. 'Mr Fensome has been through a difficult and traumatic ordeal over the past three years and I would like to thank him for supporting these court proceedings. 'We will continue to offer him all the help and support he needs.'","Rhiannon Brooker claimed Paul Fensome forced her to have sex 11 times .

"By . Martin Robinson . Spared jailed: Helen Cartwright, 42, had sex with a schoolboy and had his baby but was given a suspended sentence . A 42-year-old mother who had sex with a 15-year-old has been spared jail after a judge was told she had given birth to the schoolboy's baby. Married Helen Cartwright slept with the teenager, who is 27 years her junior, after months of flirting and admitted to police she knew he was underage, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. Their relationship was initially 'hugging and kissing' before they had sex at her home in Dudley, West Midlands, last May. Cartwright, who already had two children, fell pregnant and gave birth to his baby, who is now five months old. They became a couple after he turned 16 and she left her husband. Yesterday she was sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years, after she admitted sexual activity with a child under 16 at Wolverhampton Crown Court. She was also given a two-year supervision order and placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for 10 years. Sentencing her Judge John Warner told Cartwright: 'You are not necessarily a sophisticated person and clearly gave no thought to the consequences. 'You should not have allowed things to continue as you did. 'There is clearly a significant difference in age but if this had happened two months later no crime would have been committed. 'I have thought long and hard about it, and in this case it may be appropriate to move outside the acceptable sentencing guidelines. Your relationship is now, for better or for worse, a legal one.' Prosecution: Wolverhampton Crown Court heard Cartwright knew the boy was underage and they had sex after months of flirting . The court heard the lad seduced Cartwright and had sex with her in her home where she lived with her husband and children. Prosecutor Ms Sati Ruck said: 'It was the boy who instigated the sexual relationship when he slept with the defendant in her own bed.' Cartwright was arrested after social services were contacted following a tip-off about her relationship with the boy. When questioned by officers, Cartwright admitted knowing the lad was underage. The court heard the pair stopped seeing each other when the police became involved but have rekindled their relationship and now have a child together. Ms Sharonjit Bahia, defending, said: 'She admitted her guilt in a police interview and made no attempt to hide her involvement.'","Helen Cartwright told police she knew he was underage when they had sex .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . By selling the Big Issue, vendors can register as self-employed and claim benefits, Iain Duncan Smith said (file picture) Selling the Big Issue is being used by poor eastern Europeans as a fast-track route to claiming benefits in Britain, Iain Duncan Smith has warned. Becoming a vendor of the magazine for homeless people allows people to register as self-employed, and claim working tax credits. The Work and Pensions Secretary said the loophole was being used ‘more and more’, with a warning that benefits tourism applied to those in work as well as the jobless. The government wants to tighten rules on when migrants can claim benefits after arriving in Britain. At the start of the year new rules were introduced banning claims for the first three months, but senior Tories want to go much further. Most of the focus has been on migrants claiming Jobseekers Allowance and other out-of-work benefits instead of moving to the UK for in search of a job. But speaking in Berlin, Mr Duncan Smith said there are growing concerns about the abuse of in-work benefits. Answering questions after delivering a speech on welfare reform, the Conservative Cabinet minister said there was a perception which has a ‘core element of truth’ that people arriving in the UK ‘find themselves drifting in and out of benefits’. He added: ‘A good example of that is the Big Issue, a magazine which is a brilliant idea by a brilliant individual who himself was homeless. It is wonderful. ‘But actually what is happening progressively, more and more, is people mostly from southern and eastern Europe have actually ended up being Big Issue sellers and they claim, as self-employed, immediately, tax credits,’ The Times reported. ‘So when we talk about benefits, they are not just out-of-work benefits, they are also in-work benefits that are being claimed. ‘Romanians have been claiming those for some time now, regardless of when they came in. We had a reasonable influx of Romanians long before we opened the doors on January 1. ‘They came in on the self-employment level and that is an issue that needs to be dealt with. So [when] I talk about benefit tourism in a sense, we are talking about in-work benefit tourism.’ The Work and Pensions Secretary said he wanted to tackle the perception of benefit tourism, including among those in work . The remarks followed a controversial speech in which he hit out at the European Commission for telling us ‘we will have to pay benefits to anyone who comes here from Europe, regardless of their circumstances’, and that doing otherwise is ‘akin to xenophobia’. He said the Government had already banned new migrants from claiming housing benefit and stopped them from getting unemployment or family support until they have been living in the UK for at least three months. Migrants without work are also now required to prove they can speak English and that they will be able to get a job in order to claim. But Mr Duncan Smith said Britain wanted to go further, and demanded ‘the right to say to migrants that we require a much longer record of commitment before you get benefits and shortening the duration of any benefit claim that is allowed’. However, in response to his claims about the Big Issue, the magazine insisted that the ‘problem is the government's and not one of [our] making’. ‘In the meantime, it is wrong to promote the idea that the Big Issue is doing anything nefarious or harmful in adding to a problem which is not of its making,’ a spokesman said. The Department for Work and Pensions said it was already taking action to deal with the Big Issue loophole, insisting claimants must earn a minimum £153-a-week.","Work and Pensions Secretary steps up row over benefits tourism .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Jailed: David Griffiths, 50, billed himself as 'Britain's answer to Steven Spielberg' to take £800,000 from would-be investors . A businessman who posed as 'Britain’s answer to Steven Spielberg' to trick animation companies into investing more than £800,000 has been jailed for three years. David Griffiths, 50, conned investors by pretending to be a multi-millionnaire owner of a successful production company with close links to animation giants Pixar. A court heard he used 'smoke and mirrors' to swindle victims into investing in seven children’s TV shows which he claimed had the potential to be 'successful global phenomenons'. But only one - called Boblins - was ever made, which turned out to be a flop when it aired in the UK in 2006. Other shows - called Odd Jobbers, Monster School, Galactic Circus, Ambers’ Animals, Inuit Adventures and - never made it to air. Birmingham Crown Court was told Griffiths claimed to be Britain’s answer to Steven Spielberg’s Dreamworks studios to dupe victims into investing heavily in the shows. He even lied to interested parties about having backing from McDonalds - who he said were interested in putting toy merchandise based on Boblins into Happy Meals. In January he went on trial accused of a string of a string of fraud charges alongside his business partner Simon Drew. Following a four-month trial a jury found Griffiths guilty of one count of fraud and three of procuring the execution of a valuable security. Drew, 49, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, was cleared of all charges. On Wednesday, Griffiths was jailed for three years by Judge Roderick Henderson who told him: 'You were carried away with the enthusiasm of your scheme and lost control with the result the businesses were developed at reckless speed. 'You told significant lies to potential investors with the result that they invested in your schemes when they otherwise might not.' Scam: Griffiths persuaded companies to invest in seven TV shows but only one was made. Boblins flopped in 2006. Odd Jobbers, Monster School, Galactic Circus, Ambers' Animals and Inuit Adventures never made it to air . The court heard Griffiths and Drew ran a company called InspireGLG Limited in Bewdley, Worcestershire. Over £6million was invested in the show Boblins which was also unsuccessful in Sweden, Norway, Canada and New Zealand. Almost £14million was paid out between 2004 and 2009 but many programmes never made it to air. Jurors were told by 2008 the company was in dire financial difficulty and the police were called in to investigate. Cleared: His business partner Simon Drew, 49, also stood trial but was cleared of all the fraud charges . Prosecutor Malcolm Morse previously told the jury Griffiths was the driving force behind the fraud and victims were induced by using figures relating to the success of Disney products or Thomas the Tank Engine. He said: 'You are being sold the notion that here in Bewdley, the West Midlands, is the answer to DreamWorks if you are just so lucky as to put your money in his care.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A scaffolding firm has been hit with a £5,000 fine after photographs emerged of a worker dangling his legs over the edge of one of its dangerous structures. JOS Scaffolding Ltd risked the lives of its workers and passers-by on a busy central London street by failing to secure boards on their five-storey platforms and not setting up safety rails. The London-based company was carrying out work on Tavistock Street in Aldwych, Central London - where pedestrians were so concerned they took pictures of the precariously-perched workers and sent them to safety authorities. Dangling: Health and safety authorities were sent this picture of a worker precariously perched on top of a five-storey-high scaffolding . When the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) received the images they investigated the company, and found the work was 'poorly planned' and that two of the workers were untrained. HSE said the pictures, take on June 20 last year, showed workers using unsecure and 'precariously balanced' boards to pass materials to higher levels. They also showed a worker sitting near the top of the five storey structure, casually dangling his legs over the side. JOS Scaffolding Limited, of Gray's Inn Road, London, was fined £5,000 and ordered to pay £734 in costs after pleading guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court to two breaches of the Work at Height Regulations 2005. After the hearing, HSE Inspector Andrew Verrall-Withers said: 'Scaffolding work is fraught with risk and can be extremely dangerous if it isn't carried out properly. 'The standards here were sorely lacking and the photographic evidence speaks for itself in terms of the risks taken. Concern: A member of the public took these photographs showing the scaffolding - which inspectors said was 'sorely lacking' in safety features . 'None of the missing measures, such as guard rails and secured boards and ladders, were difficult to provide, and there was no excuse. 'It isn't just the workers themselves who could end up getting seriously hurt or killed. 'People should be able to walk along a pavement without having to worry about a piece of scaffold slipping from the hands of an overhead worker. 'Thankfully nobody was injured, but that doesn't detract from JOS Scaffolding failing to ensure the work at height was properly planned, managed and executed in a safe manner. 'I would like to thank the concerned member of the public who brought the matter to our attention and who provided such clear visual evidence'.","JOS Scaffolding erected unsafe five-storey platforms last year in London .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A post-exams house party ended in chaos after 100 dancing students felt the floor collapse beneath their feet. Revellers at the rented student house in Fallowfield, Manchester, were plunged into the basement after the living room floor fell through under their combined weight. Guests described how 'everyone was screaming' as the floorboards caved in, throwing up clouds of dust. Scroll down for video . Sinking feeling: The students were suddenly plunged three feet below ground when the floor collapsed underneath them . Scene: After the house had been evacuated, broken floorboards and sinking furniture could be seen in the room . English student Ella Dix Nagra told student website The Tab: 'I was stood on the edge of the room next to the patio doors, and the floor heaved and started to crumble, and everyone started sliding down. 'As soon as this happened I tried to get out through the patio door but the floor lurched down again and then this dust cloud came up and I got some in my mouth and it was minging. 'Then everyone started to push forward to get out through the patio door and no one could actually get out. I got really squashed because I was right on the edge. Everyone was screaming just proper going it for trying to escape.' 'Everyone was screaming': One student described the chaos as party guests fell into the basement . Nobody was seriously hurt in the accident, though some students were cut and bruised and emergency services had to be called in. Local fire crews came to the scene and also searched the building in case anybody had not made it out after the collapse - though they quickly found that nobody was unaccounted for. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue said it was lucky nobody was badly hurt in the collapse - thought to have been caused by rotten timber. The basement in the house was only three . feet deep - unlike many of the surrounding properties - meaning . revellers avoided the 'far more serious' consequences of a further fall. Disaster selfie: English student Ella Dix Nagra, left, described the collapse, and also posted pictures of her wounded leg . Outside: The student house is in the Fallowfield area of Manchester . The spokesman told the BBC: 'We had to evacuate people and search the building to check that nobody was trapped. 'Other houses in the street had basements that were much deeper, so if it'd happened in another house, it could've been far more serious.' The house's landlord - who asked not to be named - added that there had never been a problem before during the 20 years he had owner the house. He also said a recent safety inspector found no problems, and that an 'unprecedented' number of people had been inside at the time.","Living room floor gave way at house in Fallowfield, Manchester .

"By . Darren Boyle . Montserrat Verdaguer i Clavera (pictured) dug a small hole with her hands in the 900-year-old cemetery to bury Tom Sharpe's ashes . The partner of comic author Tom Sharpe who died in Spain last year has driven his ashes 1,200 miles to a small Northumberland church for an impromptu burial service. His partner of ten years,  Montserrat Verdaguer i Clavera, left the Costa Brava with the author's ashes in the passenger seat  and travelling through Spain and France before boarding the Channel Tunnel to England. Ms Clavera dug a hole with her bare hands in St Aidan's cemetery, Thokrington before holding the unconventional service. She placed a cuban cigar, a pen as well as a bottle of whisky on the small mound. The author had written of his desire . to return to Thokrington as his father had been based at St Aidan's . Church and is buried in the cemetery. One . of the photographs brought by Ms Clavera to Northumberland was an image . of the writer as a chlid standing beside his father outside the church. The prolific author . had several of his novels adapted for film and television moved to Spain . in the mid 1990s where he befriended his partner and her late husband. After Ms Clavera's husband died, the widow moved in with Mr Sharpe. Ms Clavera discovered the writer's wish to return to Northumberland while looking through some papers after his death. Ms Clavera brought with her a photograph of Tom Sharpe as a child standing beside his father George, left, and another of him in later life, right . Tom Sharpe, left, wrote of his wish to be buried in Northumberland and during an unconventional ceremony his partner of ten years Montserrat Verdaguer i Clavera marked his final resting place with a bottle of whisky, a Cuban cigar, his favourite pen as well as a small plaque, right . Ms Clavera brought a photograph of the young Tom Sharpe taken by his father George in Thockrington, and placed it alongside a Cuban cigar, a bottle of Grouse whisky and the writer's favourite pen. She said: 'In this ancient church in Northumberland in which your father was buried, you will remain for eternity. In the middle of nowhere, in an empty place, surrounded by grass and sheep. Tom Sharpe, rest in peace forever.' She said she first met the author in 1994 when he bought a house in Spain. When her husband died a decade ago, she moved in with Mr Sharpe. 'He was a marvellous man. Very intelligent, very nice. Sometimes he had an explosion - he could get very cross about things. Then 10 or 15 minutes later he’d be fine.' Ms Clavera, right, met with Tom Sharpe's friend Charlie Harrison, left, for the unusual service in Thockrington, Northumberland . Ms Clavera . met Mr Sharpe's friend Charlie Harrison who had known the writer for . the past 25 years. Mr Harrison befriended the author when he was visiting the area. Ms Clavera drove 1,200 miles with an urn containing Tom Sharpe's ashes (pictured) from the Costa Brava to St Aidan's Churchyard in Throckrington, Northumberland . He said: 'I saw this chap looking confused. I went over to help. He said he was looking for Pasture House as his father had lived there. I asked: ""Are you Tom Sharpe? I saw you on the TV aweek ago."" We became good friends. 'Tom loved this area. His grandfather William was a stonemason for the Belsay estate. 'He would come back at every opportunity and had friends round this area. He was a wonderful guy, but I used to say he was a bit crazy. He had some funny ideas. He would have loved this.' The 900-year-old graveyard attached to . St Aidan's is also the final resting place of William Beveridge, who . wrote the report which led to the foundation of the welfare state and . female aviation pioneer Connie Leathart. Rev Michael Slade said he would like to know where the writer is buried 'to keep a record for posterity's sake'. However, Church authorities want to speak to Mr Sharpe's family about the unauthorised burial. Martin . Sheppard, spokesman for the Diocese of Newcastle said: 'There are rules . and regulations, traditions and customs around churchyards to keep them as they are. 'That’s why people want to be buried there, it’s a particular kind of place.' Mr Sheppard refused to say whether Mr Sharpe's ashes would have to be removed from the graveyard. He said: 'I don’t want to speculate on what might happen.' Several of Sharpe's novels were adapted for television and film such as WIlt (left) starring Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith and Porterhouse Blue (right) featuring David Jason .","Tom Sharpe's long-term partner drove 1,200 miles with the author's ashes .

"By . Katy Winter . The tradition of embarrassing fathers is alive and kicking in Britain today a survey has revealed. In fact British teenagers find their fathers so embarrassing that they stay an average of 6.7 metres away from them if they are out together in public, for fear of being seen by friends. But maybe the kids should be more grateful as it transpires that the average father also does 627 ‘dad miles’ every year on weekends, ferrying teens to and from parties and other social gatherings, often very late into the evening. British teens implement a 6.7m exclusion zone for fear of being seen by friends in public with their dads . One West London father of four, Jeremy Duncan, said that he had taken to answering the phone 'Duncan’s Taxis' after 10pm on Friday and Saturday nights in the certain knowledge that it would be a request for a lift from one of his teenage kids. Jeremy said: 'I have noticed that my teenage kids tend to keep their distance when we’re out and about. Fathers are still embarrassing their offspring in much the same manner as also . 'I don’t take it personally because I remember doing it myself from time to time, as we all do. 'Maybe Father’s Day should be the one day in the year when we agree a bit of a temporary truce and call a halt to No Dads Land in public.' In an attempt to show the lack of appreciation father's usually receive, another father lists a selection of texts from his teenage children which include such gems as: 'Eggs, bacon, butter, bread. Tx', 'Waiting on cod,' 'Is there a meal of sorts?,' and 'Any chance of a lift?'. Britain’s long-suffering fathers fall well behind their female counterparts in the thank you stakes as well. Market data from the UK Greeting Card Association reveals that 22 million Father’s Day cards were sent in 2013, less than half the number sent to mothers on Mother’s Day. Tim Fairs, director at Clinton’s, said: 'Father’s Day is the one day in the year devoted to dads. 'What we’re hoping is that kids will recognise that their dads have their hearts in the right place even if their behavior sometimes leaves a little to be desired. 'Mums, of course, are the biggest influence in most kids’ lives, but in many families dads are important ‘support staff’ that deserve a bit of thanks from time to time.' 1. No dancing . 2.

"By . Darren Boyle . Radcu Prutianu, pictured, stole £30,000 of designer goods from Boots on Oxford Street on his first night renovating the flagship London store . A builder helped himself to £30,000 of designer goods on his first shift when he was hired to renovate Boots on Oxford Street. Raducu Prutianu, 35, even stole steel partitions to sell for scrap metal, Southwark Crown Court heard. The court heard that Prutianu arrived in the UK five years ago from Romania with his wife and two daughters, turning to crime because he was 'at a low ebb'. But the judge Recorder Robert Rhodes QC, was unimpressed and jailed him for two years. He said: 'This was a substantial theft in breach of trust. 'It was the first night that you were working and had no direct relationship with the victim, in this case Boots. 'It was clear that you had carried out two trips - first to take the steel partitions and then stealing spectacles and aftershave valued at over £30,000. 'You were trusted by your employer to work that evening and you breached their trust deliberately.' Prutianu also has convictions for fraud after he conned tourists with street gambling games. On previous occasions he was given community orders and suspended sentences that he breached numerous times. Prutianu from Welling, Kent, pleaded guilty to a single count of theft.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A fraudster pretended to be the BBC 1 Bargain Hunt auctioneer so he could steal thousands of pounds from his bank account - despite looking nothing like him. Anthony Wolstencroft, 27, from Blackley, . Greater Manchester, walked into a Natwest bank in Prestwich, Greater Manchester and claimed to be Charles Hanson. Mr Hanson, 36, is a celebrity auctioneer who has presented Bargain Hunt for ten years and used to present The Antiques Road Trip. Anthony Wolstencroft, 27, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, pictured left, used fake documents to pretend he was antiques expert Charles Hanson, 36, pictured right, in a bid to steal £3,000 from his account . The court was told Wolstencroft used an 'excellent forgery' in his bid to obtain £3,000 from Mr Hanson's account in January this year. But his cover was blown when staff became suspicious of the nervous way in which Wolstencroft was acting during the transaction. Wolstencroft admitted fraud and possessing a fraudelent document but was spared a jail term. But he was told it was a 'very serious offence' and that he would go to prison if he did anything like that again. During the hearing at Bolton Crown Court, the court heard how the postal worker handed over a fake driving licence to staff at the bank. The licence contained Mr Hanson's genuine details, but featured a photo of Wolstencroft. Although the driving licence - which bore the details of Mr Hanson, above, but used Wolstencroft's photo - was described as 'excellent forgery', staff became suspicious of Wolstencroft when he acted nervously . The conman also handed over bank details of Mr Hanson’s business, Hanson Auctioneers, to the cashier. But prosecutor Andrew Smith said staff noticed that Wolstencroft appeared nervous and edgy. The cashier then grew suspicious when Wolstencroft nervously asked to withdraw 'only £3,000' from the account. When the cashier asked Wolstencroft to sign a withdrawal form, she alerted the manager to her suspicions and Wolstencroft fled the bank. Wolstencroft was given a 12-month community order at Bolton Crown Court after pleading guilty to fraud and possessing a fraudulent document at an earlier hearing . But police later matched a fingerprint on the form to Wolstencroft's prints. The court heard the fraudster told police when he was caught that he had met a man called Kevin at an open day for his employer TNT, who apparently owed Wolstencroft money. The man apparently told Wolstencroft that he could get the money back by withdrawing it from the bank using the fraudulent documents. During the hearing, Recorder Philip Curran also heard that Wolstencroft has a strong work ethic. He had recently increased the number of hours he worked at TNT so he can provide for his family, the court was told. The court also heard that Mr Hanson was informed about the fraud by police. The auctioneer last year overcame testicular cancer and also raised £29,000 for stillbirth charity Sands, by doing the Great North Run, after his son was stillborn. Wolstencroft was sentenced to a 12-month community order and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Recorder Curran said: 'This is a very serious offence. Don’t regard this as being a soft option. 'If you do anything like this again you will go to prison.'","Anthony Wolstencroft, 27, pretended to be antiques expert Charles Hanson .

Janet Southwell arrived on the island of Tioman today, saying she was staying positive in the hope that she will be the 'friendly face' he needs when he comes out of the jungle. His mother, Janet Southwell, arrived in Malaysia on Monday after Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak about the search effort . She told the BBC: 'I want to see the area for myself, absolutely, get a feel for where he's lost, where he's missing. 'I just want to be here when they find him. I think he will want to see a familiar face. 'I'm obviously very concerned. It's going to be a good outcome, so I just have to focus on that.' Speaking about the stress she has expeirenced since Gareth went missing, she added: 'I wouldn't wish any mother to go through this. 'This is an incredibly tense and stressful time... It is vital that the intense jungle search continues and we hope everyone can pray with us for Gareth's safe return.' Mr Huntley's brother Mark, 30, said: 'She is at base camp. She has spoken to officials on the ground. 'There are 103 people searching, with more potentially on the way. We have multiple helicopters and now there are speedboat crafts out searching. 'The key for us now is to remain positive. It could be that if we can keep people positive, it could make a difference. Everyone out there has been really good. 'If we can keep that going, then maybe the authorities will be kept positive and we will be able to keep their support. 'They have been very good and we would like more recruits to help with the search and to keep pushing this thing. 'Considering the situation, we are all positive. We know he is a very resourceful and intelligent person and if he can do anything to help himself, he will.

'There are many stories in the past of . people being in the jungle for a long time but they have come out . safely, maybe a bit hungry and physically not in good condition but they . are safe. 'We need people to go out there searching on the ground. He may be injured but he is capable of surviving.' He . said he might consider travelling to Malaysia at some point, adding: . 'Even though I am here (in Britain) looking after things, it somehow . does not feel like I am doing enough.' Last Friday a professional search team . was deployed on the island of Tioman, including ten paramilitary . commandos, five police officers, three guides with search dogs, a fire . and rescue team, two boats and a helicopter. Mr . Huntley left the headquarters of the Juara Turtle Project, where he was . working, on May 27 to hike through the jungle. He told staff he would . be back that afternoon but failed to return. The British Government has stepped up . attempts to find the 34-year-old, who is originally from the . Leeds-Bradford border, while Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has been . assured that 'all available search assets' are being used. Faith: Both Gareth's mother and girlfriend are hopeful that Gareth can be found . Mr Huntley's family have praised the 'fantastic' attempts to find the trained accountant. His younger brother, Mark, said the family are keeping positive as a result of efforts to find him. He said: 'We want to personally thank David Cameron and Philip Hammond for their reassurances. It is a very big positive for us. 'We are, of course, very grateful to the Malaysian people and the authorities for their work too. Everyone has been fantastic. 'We . are told that local people went out to look for Gareth as soon as he . was first described as missing - so without them there would not be a . search mission. 'What we need now is for that work to continue and to find my brother.' Last week Mrs Southwell explained that it was out of character for her son to go missing. 'He's got an . exploring nature, he's intelligent, and hopefully his ability to apply . himself will get him through this. 'He . was on a break from work, he was due to start a new job in Singapore . next week. It's totally out of character for him to go missing, he just . would not do it. He knows there are too many people who care and love . him.' Mr Huntley's girlfriend Kit Natariga arrived on the island yesterday. Miss . Natariga admitted time to find him was 'running out'. She told Sky . News: 'It's really tough coming onto the island, we're in a bit of a . helpless state. We cannot give up... time is running out.' She . said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who . would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions. A . Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'The Defence Secretary, . who is in Malaysia, has spoken to the Malaysian Defence Minister to . confirm that all available search assets are used to find Gareth . Huntley. 'He was assured that the Malaysian authorities would do all they could to locate him and had already deployed significant assets including dogs, boats and a helicopter. 'The Government will continue to work with the Malaysian authorities to ensure there is a comprehensive search.' Kit Natariga also headed to Tioman Island to join the search for her boyfriend Gareth (left) Fellow volunteer Charles . Fisher said a group went to search for him after he did not return from . the 'huge wilderness'. They . checked various different routes to the waterfall 6km away that he might . have taken, while a further search the next day also proved fruitless. Mr . Fisher added: 'Then the afternoon of the second day the police were . informed - they sent a couple of members of the police force along to . have a look but didn't go far or look very much - they were just sort of . assessing the situation. Last week Mrs Southwell explained that it was out of character for her son to go missing. 'He's got an exploring nature, he's intelligent, and hopefully his ability to apply himself will get him through this' 'Then . the next day, the 29th, a group of volunteers went out and looked then . came back again. Another group from the local community also went out as . well and went deep into the jungle. 'The police were no longer . physically looking at that point - I think they were arranging for a . search party but nothing happened that day. 'It's . a huge wilderness out there - a remote location. He could have taken a . wrong turn and just got lost in another valley - we just don't know.

"By . Mia De Graaf . It is one of the biggest processions in the British calendar - but for one member of yesterday's parade ahead of the State Opening of Parliament it was all too much. As the Queen made her way from Buckingham Palace to the House of Lords just after 11am, six-year-old cavalry horse Musaqaleh had other plans. The gelding, who joined the army's fleet . two years ago, bolted - hurling his rider into the path of Her Majesty's . bespoke new carriage just metres away. Bolted! Musaqaleh, a six-year-old gelding, threw his rider off and fled . his station outside Whitehall when the procession started for the State Opening of Parliament - just seconds before the Queen approached in her carriage. The rider wasn't injured and stood up and saluted the Queen as she passed . But incredibly, the unnamed trooper leaped to attention with his sword to salute the Queen as she passed. Meanwhile, his black charger cantered wildly towards Horse Guards Parade, trying to find a way out of the metal gates that cordoned off the public. Eventually, he came to a halt and four soldiers guided him back to his stable. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'Poor Musaqaleh just got spooked. It does ask quite a lot of them, these parades, particularly the young ones. 'Musaqaleh hasn't done many yet, he's only been with the army for two years. This parade had only been rehearsed once. You can see the (more experienced) ones which know what songs are coming next. Their ears prick forwards when they hear a song they like. 'But with the younger ones it is common for them to bound off. This week is big for them - they are doing 10 parades in as many days. It is a big ask.' Hold your horses! Musaqaleh, who is still new to parades, galloped towards Horse Guards Parade trying to find a way out of the metal gates that cordoned off the public. He eventually came to a halt and four soldiers guided him back to his stable . Unlike the drum horses, the blacks and greys are all named with a common letter for each year. An 'M-reg', Musaqaleh was named after a battle fought in Afghanistan in December 2007. Recruited in 2012, he underwent training to ignore the noise of London traffic and carry the weight of full ceremonial gear. The . Riding Master looks for animals that are no less than 16 hands high and . unbroken, with a good weight,  good attitude and no blemishes. They are then broken, ridden, and gradually trained with more and more ceremonial 'furniture' to build up their strength. It . is only when they appear to have accepted the sound of the Regimental . bands - and demonstrated this in a major parade - that a horse can 'pass . out' to join the Regiment proper. Procession: The Queen travelled to the House of Lords in the new Diamond Jubilee State Coach . Heavy duty: The parade was one of 10 in 10 days for the horses, who must calmly complete at least one major procession, not reacting to traffic or music, before they can 'pass out' into the Regiment proper .","Six-year-old gliding Musaqaleh bolted outside Whitehall during the parade ahead of the State Opening of Parliament .

"By . Leon Watson . A young woman has enraged animal lovers after she beheaded a kitten and posted the bloody pictures of it on China's equivalent of Twitter . Li Pingping, a former marketing consultant, killed and dismembered the pet on Friday night less than two weeks after she bought it. As the photos went viral on micro-blogging site Sina Weibo, Chinese . netizens unleashed a flurry of comments calling her 'insane' and 'out of her mind.' Former marketing consultant Li Pingping beheaded a kitten in her bathroom less than two weeks after she bought it . Li, who worked at Chengzi Culture Communication Company in Huizhou in southern China's Guangdong province, responded angrily. She said she had vented her anger on the cat, claiming that her family had been destroyed by an extra-marital affair by her father. She said people should 'back off' and stop judging her, fueling even more resentment. Li later deleted all her posts. Li eventually apologised in an open letter on Monday afternoon, in which she said she abused the cat under the influence of alcohol and domestic misfortune, and that she has been living in fear and guilt over the past few days. By Tuesday afternoon, the letter had drawn more than 60,000 comments, WantChinaTimes.com reported. Weibo user 'Mengmengdenaier' said that the woman apologised simply because she was scared of public criticism, rather than thinking what she did was wrong. 'What you did disqualifies you as a human being,' wrote another user with the screenname 'Laojiudehuanggua.' Some appeared to be more tolerant, saying that since the woman had apologized, they would stop criticising her. 'I just hope that the wrong way of venting emotions can be avoided in the future,' wrote Weibo user 'tubeGhost.'","Li Pingping killed pet less than two .

"By . Helen Roberts . A girl aged 17 has been hailed as the Elephant Whisperer in India and hopes to work with the animals after she finishes school - even though they killed her father. Nirmala Topno has been praised for being the only female in her area to handle as many as 17 wild elephants when they roam jungles and enter villages near Rourkela, eastern India. From an early age she began following her father Marino, 50, and a group of local men whenever herds of wild elephants roamed populated areas near their home. Scroll down for video . Mammoth courage: 17-year-old Nirmala Topno has become a celebrity in India, where she is hailed as an elephant whisperer. She refuses to give up even after the animals trampled her father Marino to death . Brave: Nirmala (left) with elephants inside the Palamau Tiger Reserve in Jharkhand, India. She was taught her trade by her father Mariano, 50 (right) - and continues even after he was killed by an angry herd in November . People have witnessed her amazing ability to communicate with the animals, and despite her tender age and tiny frame she pushes them back into the jungle. She became a celebrity in her country last year when she steered 11 wild elephants away on one occasion and a herd of 17 a couple of months later. She said: ‘No woman in my area has ever dared to do what I do – never mind a girl my age. 'Because of my courage, people have started calling me the Elephant Whisperer. They believe that I have a certain power that makes elephants listen to me.’ But last November, Nirmala watched as a herd of elephants she was trying to push back into the wild attacked her father and killed him on the spot. She refuses to let it beat her, and now the brave girl vows she will go on and work for the government to protect the animals when she finishes her studies. ‘I get nervous when I’m close to . elephants, but once I succeed and do my job I feel extremely happy,' she . said. 'I think I’m good at my job.’ While . teenagers in Britain go to the zoo to see elephants, Nirmala has grown . up with the constant threat of wild herds running into her village and . killing anything in their path. Nirmala (pictured) said: 'People believe that I have a certain power that makes elephants listen to me' Family career: Nirmala with her mother Salomi, 46, and younger brother Miltan. She wants to protect elephants . Nirmala watched her father go out with groups of men to push the elephants back into the jungle since she was a child. She said: ‘My father used to watch people abandon their homes when elephants were close. 'They would let the huge animals run over their houses and destroy everything. But my father didn’t want to run from them forever, he didn’t want to keep rebuilding our home. So he decided to fight them.’ He gathered together a group of willing men and they soon began to get a name for themselves and were called upon whenever there were wild elephants close to villages. When Nirmala was just 13, her father finally allowed her to accompany him and the group. She said: ‘The first time I . accompanied my father was after I begged him to take me with him. I’d . wanted to go with him for years but he always told me I was too young. But he finally agreed. 'I felt a bit nervous but as soon as I saw the wild elephants, my fear vanished and I started to work. ‘After that, whenever my father was asked to help I’d go too.’ Fearless: In August last year she even injured her foot while pushing elephants away from a cluster of homes . Wild: While most Britons only see elephants in zoo, those in Nirmala's village must live alongside them . Nirmala struggles to identify her special skills, but she explained she somehow manages to convince the animals to leave by her tone of voice, body language, a flame torch and looking at the animals directly in the eye. In August last year she even injured her foot while pushing a herd of elephants away from a cluster of homes. She was in hospital for weeks with a growing medical bill, which the government paid for her. But three months later, Nirmala and her father were called out again to help with a herd of wild elephants that had entered a field near a small village down the road. It would be their last mission together as father and daughter. Nirmala said: ‘I was in the school when the forest rangers called my dad asking for our help. 'Next minute the Principal came into class and said my family had called saying I was needed urgently.' Group: Nirmala with her father (to her left in a blue shirt) and other elephant-chasers when he was still alive . Mourning: Nirmala visiting her father's grave with her mother Salomi. She refuses to give up her unusual job . Nirmala travelled home as fast as she could, where her father was waiting for her. He explained that a herd of 17 elephants had entered a nearby community and they were needed. Nirmala added: ‘I changed my uniform; quickly grabbed some food and we took off. When we arrived they were in this huge field and the elephants were aggressive because locals had been pelting them with stones to make them leave.’ Nirmala and her father, who also worked as a daily labourer earning 5,000 Rupees a month (£50), quickly got to work. They split up trying to distract the elephants, encouraging them to move on. Nirmala added: ‘Next minute I heard . men shouting ""a man is dying"". I ran over but I saw my father lying on . the ground, a huge elephant over him. 'I don’t hate elephants, but I do get . sad when I think that my father died because of them. I just don’t . underestimate their power' - Nirmala Topno, 17 . 'It was really angry but I stayed firm. I told it go, I stared at it and then it turned and ran.' When Nirmala got to her father, it was too late. He was already dead. She said: ‘He wasn’t moving. I knew he was gone. I always prayed before going out to work with the elephants but God had a different plan that day. ‘I don’t hate elephants, but I do get sad when I think that my father died because of them. I just don’t underestimate their power.’ Nirmala and her family were given a cheque for two lakh (£2,000) as compensation for their loss and Nirmala’s mother Salomi, 40, was given a government job to help support her family. Out of respect for her father, Nirmala has now been promised a job with the government’s forest department as a guard to protect animals from poachers when she leaves school. ‘I know they’ve given me this promise of a job because of who my father was and what we could do together,' she said. 'If he were still here there would be no job, so it’s hard for me to feel happy. ‘But if my father was alive today he would have been very proud of my work. He would’ve liked that his daughter was making a name for herself. He’d be very happy for me.'","Nirmala Topno was trained by father Marino in villages near Rourkela, India .

Malaysian police refuse to rule out foul play in the case of missing British backpacker as his family anxiously await results from an autopsy that will determine whether the body recovered from a jungle pond is him. The body was found Wednesday lunchtime near a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where the 34-year-old had been working and seven days after he has last been seen.

'The cause of death is still undetermined, hence this case is still classified as sudden death at this stage, although we can’t rule out any possibilities of foul play,' Sharifuddin Ab Ghani, Pahang state police chief told The Telegraph. While a formal identification has yet to be made, police said there was little doubt that the body was that of Mr Huntley, for no other Caucasian males had been reported missing on the island or in fact throughout the entire country.

Last night police were investigating . two possibilities surrounding the tragic discovery - the death was . either accidental or Mr Huntley had met with foul play. Ms . Southwell who had travelled with her husband to Tioman island, off the . south-eastern coast of Malaysia, broke down in tears and ran to her . cabin a short distance away when news of the body’s discovery was broken . to her by Deputy Police Superintendent Johari Yahaya.

Police closed off the road leading to the sanctuary after the discovery . It was found early this morning near a kayak storage unit near the Juara Turtle Project where the 34-year-old had been working, according to local reports . In Malaysia the international pressure from Mr Huntley's family and friends, who had feared there was a lack of action in spite of the public response, has turned into efforts on the ground . His mother, Janet Southwell, arrived in Malaysia on Monday after Prime Minister David Cameron spoke to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak about the search effort . Gareth Huntley and his girlfriend Kit Natariga. She said her boyfriend was an experienced backpacker and adventurer who would take utmost care in ensuring he was prepared for excursions . Search . teams, made up of commandos, police and Fire and Rescue Department . specialists accompanied by sniffer dogs had spent days searching the . jungle for the missing Englishman. Earlier . yesterday their hopes of finding him had lifted when they announced . they had discovered ‘a trail’ - broken twigs and footprints - near the . waterfall that Mr Huntley had spoken of trekking to.

Questions . police are anxious to find answers to, according to senior officers, . surround the movements of Mr Huntley immediately after he announced to . others at the centre that he was setting off on the jungle trek to the . waterfall. With his body . being found within the confines of the conservation headquarters, . police are questioning whether he even managed to reach the start of the . jungle path before tragedy struck in some way. Police . investigations are also looking at the possibility that Mr Huntley did . reach the waterfall and plunged into the river on his return. A . further line of inquiry will be whether he went into the water further . upstream and his body was then carried to where it was found. Members of Malaysia's Fire and Rescue Team preparing to depart from the Tanjung Gemok Ferry Terminal for the search and rescue operation . Earlier this week Malaysian authorities insisted they were committed to finding the Briton who went missing on the popular resort island seven days ago, with an army helicopter sent to aid the search . Only ten hours ago a Facebook page set up to find Mr Huntley posted this message . A Facebook group was set up to raise awareness about Mr Huntley's disappearance. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'Malaysian police have confirmed that a body has been found on Tioman island in Malaysia. 'Foreign . Office consular staff on the ground are continuing to work closely with . the Malaysian authorities and are investigating with them as a matter . of urgency. 'We continue to provide support to the family of Gareth Huntley at this very difficult time.' A picture of Tioman Island - where the Briton was last seen . Tuesday May 27: Gareth Huntley, 34, from London, goes on a trek to visit a waterfall in Tioman Island, off the south eastern coast of Malaysia's mainland. He leaves in the morning and tells friends at the headquarters of a nearby charity project where he is volunteering that he will return by 2pm the same day. He fails to come back so a group goes out to search for him, checking various routes to the waterfall which is 6km away. Wednesday May 28: A further search also proves fruitless. According to fellow volunteer Charles Fisher the police are contacted in the afternoon. He says: 'They sent a couple of members of the police force along to have a look but didn't go far or look very much - they were just sort of assessing the situation.' Thursday May 29: A group of volunteers embark on another search, while a group from the local community also look for Mr Huntley deep into the jungle. The police are 'no longer physically looking', Mr Fisher says. 'I think they were arranging for a search party but nothing happened.' Friday May 30: Janet Southwell, Mr Huntley's mother, calls on the authorities to do more to search for him. She says: 'He has been missing for four days now, and as yet I have had no contact from any official agency advising me as to the progress of the search.' Saturday May 31: A friend of Mr Huntley, Kyle Neo Kai Fu, who lives locally, says: 'The idea that there is a proper professional search going on is laughable. There are five police, in one boat, and nobody is in control. 'The most likely scenario is that Gareth is injured in a ravine, with a broken leg - and we are running out of time.' Ms Southwell makes a direct plea to Prime Minister David Cameron, urging him to 'make one phone call to help my missing son'. Sunday June 1: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, who is in Malaysia, speaks to the country's defence minister. He is assured that the authorities will do all they can to find Mr Huntley and they have already deployed significant assets including dogs, boats and a helicopter. Mr Huntley's girlfriend, Kit Natariga, arrives on the island and warns that 'time is running out and we need action as soon as possible'. Monday June 2: Mr Huntley's mother also arrives on the island to support the search effort. She says she wants to see the area for herself and 'get a feel for where he's lost'. His brother, Mark, says there are 103 people searching, alongside several helicopters and speedboats. David Cameron speaks to Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak to thank him for the extensive efforts of the search teams. Wednesday June 4: Police searching for Mr Huntley find a body.

"By . Emma Glanfield . A bogus vet who ‘delighted in seeing animal innards’ has been jailed after cruelly inflicting excruciating pain on animals by carrying out botched operations. Jayson Wells, from Grimsby, Lincolnshire administered unknown medications to animals - leaving cats, dogs, rabbits and birds so ill they had to be put down. Wells, 30, had no proper training as a vet and had worked only as a herdsman - but conned owners into paying for his inept services all over the country. Jayson Wells, 30, from Grimbsy, Lincolnshire, had no proper training as a vet and had worked only as a herdsman - but conned owners into paying for his inept services all over the country. He was jailed for 19 months . Grimsby Crown Court heard how the fraudster, who has been jailed for 19 months, seemed to delight in seeing animal’s innards and recommended controversial treatments such as a syringe of syrup of figs to improve the pets’ health. Wells admitted two offences of causing unnecessary suffering to animals, three of fraud by pretending to be a fully qualified veterinary surgeon and another of practicing as a vet without a licence. Fraudster: Wells administered unknown medications to animals - leaving cats and dogs so ill they had to be put down . Edward Bindloss, prosecuting, said Wells started committing the offences within a week or so of being released from prison in August 2012 for similar offences. They included causing suffering to a pony which had to be put to sleep after a horrifically-bodged castration. He was originally given a six-month suspended prison sentence by Boston magistrates but he was later jailed for breaching the terms of the order. Wells had a sweatshirt with his name on it, business cards and he employed a woman who was supposedly a veterinary nurse - but he did not have any premises of his own. Mr Bindloss said: ‘In reality, he was not registered to practise as a vet. ‘He had no qualifications but he told her he wanted to expand into the field of domestic animals.’ In . September 2012, Wells became friendly with Mary Oglesbee, who at the . time had been running a small cat rescue scheme, called Under The Paw . Cat Rescue, since 2008. One cat, called Martha, was injected on several occasions by Wells after being examined. Martha was put to sleep by him in November 2012 after he claimed she was suffering from a stomach tumour. In . December that year, Wells offered to treat a Yorkshire terrier, owned . by Paul Whitelam, but told him the dog had liver failure and should be . put to sleep. Mr Whitelam . agreed and because he believed that Wells had done him and the dog a . good service, paid him £20 instead of the £10 fee requested. Mr . Whitelam later became aware of bad Facebook comments about Wells and . contacted the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, which had never . heard of the supposed vet. Wells cruelly inflicted excruciating pain on animals by carrying out botched operations and several had to be put down afterwards because it made them so ill. Two of the cats he unnecessarily injected later died (above) He . is believed to have contacted Miss Oglesbee because of a Facebook . campaign she started about the fraudster and he was caught after an . investigation by the RCVA. The . court heard that Wells also examined a pregnant cat, called Pumpkin, . owned by Amy Baker and gave it injections. He also gave injections to . kittens owned by Lisa Dove. Some of the pets later had to be put down. Miss Oglesbee believes, however, that Pumpkin survived its treatment from Wells. But, the injection of one of the cats . belonging to Miss Dove went wrong and the needle snapped or bent, . causing blood to spray out. The cat became very distressed and was ‘literally coughing up its guts’. Miss Dove believed the cat ‘must have suffered horribly’ before it died and said the sight would stay with her always. She claimed Wells later ‘seemed to delight in what he was doing’ in showing her the cat’s innards. Wells later gave a booster injection to one of Mrs Baker’s cats and he also told her to give it a full syringe of syrup of figs. Its condition did not improve and a proper vet told her the cat was suffering from organ failure. It was put down. Wells admitted two offences of causing unnecessary suffering to animals, three of fraud by pretending to be a fully qualified veterinary surgeon and another of practicing as a vet without a licence . Grimsby Crown Court (pictured) heard how the fraudster seemed to delight in seeing animal's innards and recommended controversial treatments such as a syringe of syrup of figs to improve their health . Wells also injected a cat belonging to Deborah Atkins, a friend of Mrs Baker, and later claimed it had ‘very aggressive’ leukaemia. He gave it injections but its health deteriorated and he said it would have to be put down. He injected it and the cat became more distressed before finally dying. Wells, who also admitted failing to attend a previous court hearing, was jailed for 19 months. He was also banned from owning or keeping animals for seven years.","Bogus vet Jayson Wells had no training and had only worked as a herdsman .

John Terry could be asked to replace Roy Keane as an ITV World Cup pundit if the Irishman quits for a job at Aston Villa. Chelsea captain Terry, who retired from international football in 2012, has been installed by bookmakers as the favourite to replace Keane. Neither camp would confirm any approach but the possibility of Terry working at the World Cup is intriguing. Brazil bound? John Terry could be heading to the World Cup as a pundit with ITV . On opposite sides: If ITV do sign Terry up then it would put him up against BBC's Rio Ferdinand . For starters, it would pitch him head-to-head against former England team-mate Rio Ferdinand, who is among the BBC pundits. The pair fell out after Terry was charged with racially abusing Rio’s brother Anton during a game against QPR and although he was cleared in court he was banned by the FA. As a former England captain, Terry has a chequered history with the World Cup. He lead a failed mutiny against Fabio Capello’s methods at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Popular: Roy Keane has earned rave reviews for his honest approach during ITV's coverage . Meanwhile, Keane is expected to be named as Paul Lambert’s No 2 at Villa once he returns from two Ireland friendlies in the USA next week. Keane’s decision to pull out of his role as an ITV pundit means he has more time to invest in a return to Premier League football. Lambert has been on the lookout for a new assistant since Ian Culverhouse was suspended in April. Persuading Keane to join him would be a coup. It had appeared Celtic would appoint the 42-year-old as their manager but it is understood a lack of transfer funds and the probable loss of England goalkeeper Fraser Forster swayed Keane’s mind. Lambert, 44, has been in discussions with Keane for a number of days, and both men share a deep loyalty to the methods of Brian Clough. Keane would be able to remain Ireland assistant if he took up the role on offer at Villa.","Chelsea skipper could be offered role as ITV World Cup pundit .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . England’s players have been losing up to two kilogrammes in weight in each training session during their World Cup preparations. Roy Hodgson has been keen to get his squad accustomed to the smouldering heat and humidity of Manaus, in the Amazon rainforest, where England start their campaign against Italy on Saturday week. First he took them to Portugal, where they trained in thermal layers and hats and gloves and then back to St George’s Park where players were sent into the special heat chambers, where the temperature can be carefully controlled as they work on exercise machines. Water break: Jordan Henderson takes a drink during the training session . 'We’ve been . really busy as well,' said goalkeeper Ben Foster. 'At St George’s Park . last week we were doing double sessions. We trained in the morning, had . lunch and then everybody would literally have to go and have a bit of a . sleep. 'It’s . been kind of like pre-season and then at night we were doing bike . sessions and heat chambers, where basically, you’re in a sauna on a . bike. We’ve been doing half-hour sessions in there and it’s brutal, . really hard work. No one’s grumbled or moaned about it, just got on with . it. 'When . we were in Portugal we wore under-armour, t-shirts, zip-up tops with . wet top over that. So it’s a lot of layers. When it was 22 degrees, the . lads were losing two kilos in sweat in every training session. Hot, hot heat: Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade Chamberlain take on fluids during the training session . Training in the heat: Roy Hodgson stands in front of a giant fan as England train . 'It’s . what goes with it. It’s trying to replicate the heat and humidity out . here.

Thirsty work: Frank Lampard drinks water during training . The running boys: England goalkeepers Ben Foster, Fraser Forster and Joe Hart warm up in Miami . As . they trained in Miami’s Sun Life Stadium ahead of Wednesday's friendly . against Ecuador, the backroom team pulled out large drinks tubs, . carefully labelled with the players’ names because they all have . individually tailored recovery drinks. Some . players will sweat more than others and in different ways, losing . different minerals, and this has been carefully monitored by a series of . tests taken since the squad first assembled two weeks ago. The . pitch-side temperature in Miami yesterday was 27 degrees at 10.15am and . there were four enormous propeller fans by the side of the pitch to . help players cool down as they took drinks breaks between exercises. The . game against Ecuador will kick-off at 3pm local time, so it is expected . to be warmer, but still not as warm and humid as it is likely to be . against Italy in Manaus.

John Lang confirmed technicians were on site and said: 'We have a . substation there, our engineers need to unlock it to let the fire . brigade in. 'We have heard no reports so far that the source of the . smoke came from there, but the investigators need to check everywhere in . the building. 'There is no suggestion at this time that it is an actual fire but the building has been evacuated as a caution. 'No injuries have been reported.' One of the Qatari owners of the Shard was reported evacuated from Europe's tallest skyscraper this morning after fire broke out in its basement, it was claimed. According to sources at the scene a high-ranking member of the Qatari family who owns the 1,004 feet tall building was in a meeting when the alarms sounded. It is not known if Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani was present. And it has turned intp a PR nightmare for the £3,250-a-night hotel based inside. Wealthy guests arriving at the newly opened five star Shangri-La hotel were left fuming after they were told to wait on the chilly plaza outside with no staff on hand to help. A spokesman for the building denied any member of the Qatari Royal family were in the building at the time and had to be evacuated along with over 900 people after the fire brigade was called just after 10.30am this morning. Firefighters from Soho, Dockhead, Old Kent Road, Shoreditch, Whitechapel and Lambeth fire stations are at the scene . Scotland Yard said no arrests had been made and inquiries on the cause of fire were ongoing . A man who did not want to be named said: 'The big man from Qatar was in the building having a meeting and they've just been evacuated. 'Apparently the basement was full of smoke and it was getting worse and worse. 'My friend works for the company and they were all in there for business. 'He had got us tickets to go up to the top, but we didn't get inside. 'We had just got off the train at London Bridge and we were marshalled out of the area and down St Thomas Street. A fire brigade spokesman said: 'We are investigating the source of smoke coming from the basement' 'The area was full of firemen, we must have seen at least 50 and dozens of engines.' Firefighters from Soho, Dockhead, Old Kent Road, Shoreditch, Whitechapel and Lambeth fire stations are at the scene. He said the presence of seven fire engines and around 50 firefighters was usual for that type of building. Scotland Yard said no arrests had been made and inquiries on the cause of fire were ongoing.

Miss Daswani has since accepted an apology from Selfridges. A spokesman for the department store said today: 'We deliver everywhere within the UK and in over 60 countries around the world from China and Australia to South Korea and Vietnam. 'When there is disparity between delivery and billing addresses or the submission of incorrect transaction details, we are unable to proceed with the order and the customer is alerted there is an issue, which was the case on this occasion. 'Although there was never a question of not being able to deliver the order to Brixton, the initial telephone communication to the customer was open to misinterpretation, for which we apologise as the intention was not to offend. 'The matter was resolved quickly and the bag was delivered Wednesday morning.' Brixton has undoubtedly come a long way since the dark days of the Brixton riots when for three days, battle raged across the inner-city London borough of Lambeth. The area has since become a favourite for trendy families and young professionals wanting to escape the inner city to an area of London with a multicultural suburban feel. Ben Kaye, a senior commercial agent at London estate agent Kinleigh Folkard & Hayward said the area has become so desirable that residential . property prices increased by 25 per cent  in 2013 alone - with further increases . predicted this year. He said: 'In 2001, the Borough of Lambeth had 64,682 registered voters. In 2013 this figure had risen to 284,000 which in itself speaks volumes about the changes to the area and local demographic seen over the past decade. 'Having lived in Oval, south London during this time, I’ve been lucky enough to witness the differences personally, and yet still the regeneration continues. 'Whereas in previous years Brixton was considered less desirable and more gritty than other surrounding areas, all that has changed and there is now a definite ambience and soul that surrounds and fills the entire area, making it increasingly sought after. 'Banksy deemed it worthy enough of an artwork in 2003 and more recently photographic exhibitions and other cultural displays are regulars on the high street.'","Leila Daswani, 22, bought the 'Henry’ gym bag - also owned by Harry Styles .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . Roy Hodgson has scheduled an unprecedented meeting with England fans in Florida as part of his pre-World Cup charm offensive. The manager is due to take part in a question-and-answer session in downtown Miami on Thursday despite his England team being just a week away from their first game against Italy. Grilling: Roy Hodgson will sit down with fans in Florida ahead of the World Cup . The willingness of Hodgson to engage with fans contrasts with the approach of his predecessors, who might have taken part in stage-managed sponsorship events in the UK but never on the road with a tournament beckoning. After a remarkably calm build-up to Brazil, Hodgson’s dilemma over whether to play the out-of-form Wayne Rooney in Manaus on June 14 will surely be a subject he is asked about. And fans will not countenance FA spin doctors deciding what questions can be put to Hodgson, with even a query about David Beckham being ruled out at the last Press briefing. ................................................................................................... Steve Peters, the sports psychiatrist with the England World Cup party, sat in on Roy Hodgson’s pre-match media conferences at The Grove last Thursday. But it would have been far more beneficial for him to witness Hodgson in interviews straight after games when the pressure on any manager is so much greater. ................................................................................................... Pele is not just cashing in on the World Cup. Legends 10, run by former Tottenham director Paul Kemsley, have bought the Brazil icon’s intellectual property rights and are doing as many deals as possible to take advantage of the 2016 Rio Olympics build-up. It will not be one of his bigger paydays but Pele has agreed to do an interview with Gary Lineker which the BBC football presenter is flying out to Brazil early to record. ................................................................................................... Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, who has promised to meet various anti-discrimination groups in the wake of his sexist email exchanges with TV rights lawyer Nick West, has started at the top. Scudamore had a meeting at the  Ritz last week with CONCACAF confederation chief Jeffrey Webb, who heads FIFA’s anti-discrimination task force. ................................................................................................... Former FA vice-chairman David Dein, one of football’s great networkers, is expected to help Greg Dyke implement his commission findings. FA chairman Dyke, who is likely to receive a negative reception to his B team proposals at the Football League conference this week, needs all the support he can get to ensure his recommendations aren’t kicked into the long grass. And Dein, a close contact of Dyke’s since they were both part of the Premier League formation group, is understood to have discussed how he could assist — having strong views himself on improving the England team. An official role for Dein has yet to be agreed. Helping hand: Ex-FA vice-chairman David Dein is expected to help Dyke implement his commission findings . Culture secretary Sajid Javid has shown little interest in sport since arriving at the DCMS. But that is not stopping him taking a trip to Brazil for England’s third group game against Costa Rica in Belo Horizonte on June 24.  Minister for Sport Helen Grant will be in Sao Paulo for the Uruguay match on June 19. FIFA snub to Cameron . The email files of disgraced former FIFA ExCo member Mohamed bin Hammam might not be the smoking gun that derails the 2022 Qatar World Cup, but they give more detail about England’s doomed 2018 bid. It is now clear that in the build-up to the Zurich election, Baroness Amos, Prince Andrew and David Cameron all failed to get time with Bin Hammam, whose vote they were courting. Meanwhile, just as the Premier League are considering a police complaint over secretary Rani Abraham acquiring chief executive  Richard Scudamore’s private emails so, it is understood, is Bin Hammam over how the  Sunday Times gained possession of his cache. Good luck message: Cameron visited England during their training session at St George's Park on Thursday . Sven Goran Eriksson, now coaching in China, jumped at every commercial opportunity during his time in charge of the England team. And the Swede has chosen the eve of the World Cup to launch his own red and white Italian wines for the Scandinavian market — named, unimaginatively, Sven.","England boss Hodgson has scheduled a meeting with England fans in Florida .

But Prandelli, who admits the game was decisive ahead of choosing his final squad for the tournament in Brazil, wielded the axe on the United States born star who will now miss out on his third straight international competition. Rossi's grandfather, Bruno Petrocelli, has been left fuming at the decision and let out his anger on Italian radio. He said: Two days ago Prandelli said many fine words, then 48 hours later he changed his mind.

Instead of Rossi, Italy have selected Mario Balotelli, Antonio Cassano, Alessio Cerci, Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne (Napoli) as their strikeforce as they now prepare for their opening group game against England on June 14.

"By . Paul Collins . Gary Lineker thinks Roy Hodgson should seriously consider dropping Wayne Rooney from England's starting line-up in Brazil. The former Barcelona and Tottenham striker, who scored 48 times in 80 appearances for England, said that Hodgson shouldn't be afraid to leave Rooney out of the side. Lineker, who tweeted a picture of him with Frank De Boer on a beach, wants Daniel Sturridge to play as the most advanced striker for England in Brazil. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney meeting Prince William . Smile for the camera: Gary Lineker tweeted this picture of him with Frank De Boer . Conundrum: Lineker thinks that Roy Hodgson shouldn't be afraid to leave Wayne Rooney out of the team . He said on Blahzil 2014: 'I think Sturridge gives us different options, He gives us a threat in behind the opposition which I think is very important. That's something that Rooney doesn't do as often. 'He (Rooney) is very good at coming off, creating space, turning, hitting shots hard and bringing other people into the game, but in terms of a threat in behind the opposition defence, that is Sturridge's territory.' But, while Lineker thinks the Liverpool striker should play up front, he admits that it could be difficult to find a place for Rooney to slot into. Royal appointment: Rooney and Daniel Sturridge met Prince William at Wembley last week . Strike: Sturridge gave England the lead against Peru with a stunning strike from the edge of the box . Make way: Rooney could be dropped in favour of other players such as Raheem Sterling . Lineker said: 'You’ve got the conundrum – if Sturridge is up top in the system, where do you play Rooney? Wayne can play anywhere. He can play on the right, he can play on the left, he can even play a forward midfield role. 'But the question then is, ""Have you better players in those particular positions than Wayne Rooney?"" We’ve got all sorts of options. You could have [Raheem] Sterling playing on one side, the possibility of [Adam] Lallana playing on either side, [Danny] Welbeck, of course, which has been favoured by Roy in his teams and you’d expect him to play on the left-hand side because he covers a lot of ground. 'It will be interesting to see which way Roy Hodgson goes. Or whether he sets back to that old way we played two years ago against Italy, with two lines of four, Rooney and someone else up top. So all sorts of possibilities. It will be fascinating to see which way he goes.'","Lineker says Daniel Sturridge should in most advanced role .

Flintoff played his first competitive cricket on Saturday since the last . day of the final Test of England’s triumphant 2009 Ashes series - and . was immediately among the wickets, albeit in lowlier surroundings. After . five long, painful years in which the 36-year-old former England . all-rounder thought he would never play again, he went back to the small . club where his career began, St Annes near Blackpool, for a warm-up . ahead of his professional return this week. He is expected to make a . big-stage comeback for Lancashire in Friday’s T20Blast fixture against . Yorkshire and the early signs are he still has something to offer. Flintoff . took three wickets for St Annes, one of them a spectacular caught and . bowled, as they played a lowly Northern Premier League match against . Penrith. He bowled 12 overs, with five maidens and a tally of three for . 26. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andrew Flintoff make his comeback for St Annes . Steaming in: Andrew Flintoff stepped up his comeback for St Annes on Saturday afternoon against Penrith . Eyes on the prize: The former England all-rounder looked lean as he turned out for his hometown club . With . the bat he had a shorter contribution, making two runs in his first two . balls and then getting caught on the boundary at long off as his lofted . drive headed for what otherwise would have been a six. Any . talk of a guarantee of success for ‘Freddie’ in his pro return needs to . come with a whopping caveat: this was leisurely stuff, played out on a . glorious late Spring afternoon in front of a crowd of around 250 people, . or five times the typical size at Vernon Road. But . the most important aspect of his performance was his body withstanding . the day’s action. He retired after those Ashes five summers ago with a . severe knee injury after chronic problems. In total he has had 12 . operations on his ankle and knee. Flintoff’s . first over on Saturday, in the ninth of the match as Penrith batted . first, began at 1.26pm. He moved gingerly at first, taking time to warm . up, but by the time of his sixth over and first wicket, he was stomping . something like old. Prior . to this game, his last ball in anger was at The Oval on 23 August 2009, . a day remembered for a Fifth Test and series win illuminated by . Flintoff taking Ricky Ponting’s wicket with a direct hit from his . fielding position at mid-off. All smiles: Flintoff is congratulated after taking a wicket in the sixth over of his first spell back . His first wicket here was a lesser scalp, that of Penrith’s 18-year-old Greg . Hall, caught behind. ‘When I found out Freddie was playing, I looked . forward to facing him,’ said Hall. ‘He was not too quick, he was . alright. He just pushed it through off the pitch, not as quick as we . have all seen him bowl before but you’d expect that as he is just coming . back.’ Flintoff’s . second wicket was a peach, taking Penrith’s pro Paul Hindmarch, caught . and bowled. Hindmarch had hammered his shot but Flintoff plucked it . cleanly from the air with his right hand. Watching . from the pavilion was the St Annes president, Brian Standing, 76, who . has known the Flintoff family for decades and recalls with wonder a . 14-year-old Flintoff hitting double centuries for the juniors and . playing for the first team at the same age. Long walk: Flintoff heads out to the middle to bat for St Annes . Shortlived: Freddie's stay in the middle didn't last as he was caught in the deep for two off three balls . ‘Good catch that,’ he deadpanned as HIndmarch went. ‘But then Freddie has got hands like buckets.’ ‘Sitting . nearby was Flintoff’s mum, Susan, who said only that she found her . son’s return ‘nerve-wracking.’ Dad Colin added: ‘It’s been great to see . him bowl again, and out on the field. I . wanted him to do well not just because we like watching him but I want . him to do well … To be honest I wasn’t expecting as many as 12 overs. Eight maybe, but then he’s always pushed himself.’ Susan’s . father, Flintoff’s granddad Harry Hargreaves, 85, was more loquacious. ‘It’s brilliant to see him playing out there today,’ he said. ‘He loves . playing. He’s really missed playing.’ Relaxed: The 36-year-old was decked out in his Lancashire attire as the team had a briefing beforehand . The . man himself said: ‘I always remember my days at St Annes. They have . good coaches and the current skipper Andy Kellett played in the same . side as me. ‘This is no stroll [today] … it’s the start I need, competitiveness.’ Brian . Standing was a proud man at close of play. ‘I knew Andrew as a . 14-year-old lad when he first started here. He was a cheeky little . bugger but he was a good lad and you could tell he had potential, he was . going to go all the way.’ ‘Andrew . got in at 14 and he didn’t look out of  place.

"By . Mark Wilson . This feels like a homecoming to Kenny Miller. His heart had long been set on a return to Rangers. Pretty much, it seems, from the moment he left in 2011. For all that longing, Miller could never have imagined what would happen to the club between his second and third spells as an employee. The bitter experience of administration and slumping to the foot of the league ladder has been followed by almost incessant turmoil off the field. Even now, with the club just one step short of climbing back into the top flight, uncertainty still lingers. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Kenny Miller's on rejoining Rangers for a third Ibrox spell . Homecoming: Kenny Miller has returned to Rangers after penning a one-year deal . The club’s board and a section of its support have spent the summer at loggerheads over season-ticket renewals, with the exact uptake yet to be made public. The financial situation is regarded by most as fragile yet that did not put off Miller in the slightest. Even at 34, he would not have been short of other options - but Rangers was the only interest he pursued. Insisting he did not seek any assurances over the club’s future, Miller’s only concern is what could happen on the field of play as Ally McCoist’s side seek to gain promotion from the Championship. ‘I’ve not sought anything,’ he said. ‘I’m here to play football. If things happen off the field then I’m sure I’ll have to deal with it like everybody else at the club when that happens, but hopefully it won’t. Goal machine: Miller has netted 67 times for Rangers during his first two spells . ‘Hopefully, we won’t get back to the situation we have found ourselves in before. For me, I wanted to come back to this club to play football, pull that jersey on and get out in that stadium in front of these fantastic fans again. I am fortunate enough to have that opportunity. ‘Any time I meet anyone and speak about Rangers it’s always, one,  am I coming back? And, two, they would like to see me back here. ‘The chat has always been about football and not what’s happened off the field or what’s going to happen off the field. ‘It’s all been about getting this club back to where it belongs, which is challenging at the top.’ Asked if the speculation about Rangers’ off-field health might dissuade other players, he added: ‘That’s every footballer’s prerogative but it was never an issue for me. I wanted to come back no matter what’s gone on. Feeling at home: Miller is back for a third spell at Ibrox . ‘I want to play for this football club and I’m just delighted that it’s done now. If anyone else has reservations then that’s up to them.’ For Miller, signing his contract earlier this week completed ‘a long, long process of trying to come back’, after previous possibilities were wrecked by a whole variety of circumstances. The question now is whether he will be the only Ibrox old boy to return this summer. McCoist is also thought to be keen on Kris Boyd, out of contract at Kilmarnock and attracting interest from both Aberdeen and Dundee United. It remains to be seen whether a deal for the 30-year-old can come to fruition, but Miller would be more than happy to renew their previous partnership. ‘I think Kris would excite everyone, when you see what he brought to the club in the four-and-a-half years he was here,’ said Miller. ‘He scored an incredible amount of goals. ‘That’s what he does. Last season he scored 22 league goals for a struggling Kilmarnock team, which is phenomenal. ‘I’ve spoken to Kris and I think that, if the opportunity was there, it’s something he would be interested in. ‘Personally, I’m just happy to be here and I’d like to thank the chief executive and the manager for giving me that chance. Back where he belongs: Miller has returned to Scotland from a spell in Canada with Vancouver Whitecaps . ‘Whoever comes in or whoever I’m asked to play alongside up front, I’ll be delighted to do it. Just pulling on that jersey again will be enough but if the big man comes back he will definitely be an asset for the club.’ Pulling on a darker blue shirt again remains unlikely. Miller retired from Scotland duty last year to concentrate on his club career with Vancouver Whitecaps and to limit the number of draining transatlantic flights. Those travel concerns are no longer present, but he feels Gordon Strachan has plenty of more youthful options to spearhead a push for Euro 2016 qualification. ‘You’re spot-on that my decision to stop playing for the national team was largely down to those flights,’ admitted Miller, capped 69 times. ‘It was hard for me to do that travelling and still perform at optimum levels for my country, and also to go back to Canada or the States and then be fully fit to play for my club the following Saturday. ‘That was really tough and, ultimately, it was a big part of my decision. Now that I’m back I’ve no thoughts about coming out of that retirement and making myself available for selection. ‘Scotland’s results in the last year have been excellent and I hope that we continue to make progress under Gordon Strachan. ‘We have a lot of fantastic younger boys available to play in my position and I’m sure we have more than enough to make sure that we’re challenging for a place at Euro 2016.’ His focus will, therefore, be on a demanding domestic challenge with Rangers pitched in alongside Hearts and Hibs in a second tier unlike any other in the past. Club before country: Miller has no plans to come out of retirement and add to his 69 caps for Scotland . Miller is confident that it will bring the best out of the existing Ibrox squad. How long it will take for the club to be restored to the top flight-winning force he once knew is a different question. ‘Who knows?’ said Miller. ‘The first aim this year is to win this league and get back into the top flight. ‘After that, we know what this club’s about - winning trophies. There is not going to be any thinking that we’ve got a couple of years to get back in contention. ‘We need to be challenging straight away, it’s as simple as that. That’s what the players will be looking to do. ‘How long it will take, who knows? But I know for a fact that if I am here next year and we are in the top flight, there’s no way I will be settling for second best.’","Scottish striker back in Glasgow after leaving for Bursaspor in 2011 .

'I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets. This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show,' he wrote. 'What Rolling Stone did was wrong. This guy is evil. This is the real Boston bomber. Not someone fluffed and buffed for the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.' Boston Magazine published a second set of Sgt Murphy's images in the September issue. They were released online today. Sgt Murphy, a 25-year veteran of the state police, has paid dearly for leaking his pictures. He was condemned by the U.S. Attorney prosecuting Tsarnaev. Heavily armed: Armored SWAT officers from local and state police teamed up with federal agents to approach the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was hiding out.

"By . Ossian Shine . England manager Roy Hodgson should wrap his talisman Steven Gerrard up in cotton wool because an injury to the 34-year-old captain would be disastrous for England's World Cup plans, says Glenn Hoddle. Hoddle, who coached England at the 1998 World Cup, said Hodgson must carefully manage the Liverpool midfielder's game time in friendlies before the team's opener against Italy in Manaus on June 14. 'Roy must have winced when his captain was hurt in an early tackle during the Peru game at Wembley, in the final warm-up game on home soil before heading off to Miami,' said Hoddle, England manager from 1996-1999. Left out: Glenn Hoddle believes England should not have started Steven Gerrard against Peru . Rested: Roy Hodgson eventually withdrew Gerrard from the action after 64 minutes had elapsed . 'Personally, I wouldn't have risked him for longer than a half, and in fact, wouldn't have even started with him. He needs to be wrapped up in cotton wool and protected like a National Treasure. 'Look at the major worry now circulating around Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. It's horrible for the player, horrible for the manager.' Arsenal winger Oxlade-Chamberlain injured his right knee against Ecuador in Miami on Wednesday and faces two weeks out. 'Now you can see why Roy didn't play Gerrard against Ecuador, such is his importance, especially because of the role he will perform in Brazil - an injury to the skipper would spell disaster for Roy's plans,' Hoddle said. Hoddle, in a column for British bookmaker William Hill, said Hodgson simply cannot risk not having his skipper lead England out against the Italians. 'Gerrard is as important to England as Andrea Pirlo is to Italy; both vastly experienced, and hugely influential in midfield, where the games will be won or lost. 'The worry for Roy and England going into this tournament is that there is no natural understudy to Gerrard. Frank Lampard is the nearest, but nowhere near as effective in his long range of passing as Gerrard, nor as robust.'

"By . Chris Waugh . Any mere mortal would cower at the thought of having to face the human wrecking ball that is Ma'a Nonu but Kyle Eastmond is relishing the challenge of stopping the All Black in Saturday's first Test at Eden Park. England's midfield defence will be tested mercilessly by Nonu and his New Zealand team-mates as they look to exploit a potential weakness in Stuart Lancaster's side. Eastmond will deputise at inside centre after Billy Twelvetrees failed to win his fitness battle and he will partner fourth choice fly-half Freddie Burns, who had a difficult season at Gloucester, in an inexperienced midfield.

The diminutive Eastmond, who has not played since April, will be winning only his third cap and Burns just his fourth. But Eastmond is ready for the assault that awaits when the series begins in Auckland. He said: 'I've been playing rugby now since I was seven years old. You have to make tackles, it's as simple as that.' 'It's an attitude thing that has to be shared by everyone, it's not an individual thing. 'New Zealand have some big guys, but we've put in a lot of homework throughout the team to give us the best opportunity against them. 'I'll try to offer exactly what I've done throughout my career - try to get on the ball and bring energy and spark to help out my team-mates.' Lancaster's choice at inside centre is limited due to Twelvetrees' injury, as well as Luther Burrell and Brad Barritt being unavailable after appearing in last Saturday's Aviva Premiership final. Headache: England head coach Stuart Lancaster has had to select his side from a much depleted squad . Wrecking ball: Ma'a Nonu (centre) and his All Black team-mates will look to exploit England's new midfield . And Eastmond himself fell out of favour at Bath and has been omitted from their matchday 23 since. The 24-year-old rugby league convert, who impressed during last summer's tour to Argentina, is fourth choice but is determined to grab the opportunity with both hands. 'We've put some good work in and I'm feeling all right. I've played a lot of games this season so match fitness is not something I have in mind at all,' Eastmond said. 'I'm confident I'll be okay with the match fitness. I've very excited. I've trained well and hard over the last couple of weeks.' Primed and ready: New Zealand train ahead of Saturday's first Test with England at Eden Park . Captain marvel: All Blacks captain Richie McCaw focuses in training ahead of the match with England . Eastmond has lost ground in England's pecking order this season with Twelvetrees and Burrell overtaking him, but he takes a measured view on his progress. 'I have to put it into perspective where I'm at. This is the end of my second season in rugby union,' he said. 'The players who have been playing in my position have been playing really well.

Police investigating the fatal shooting of a security guard in Sydney four years ago say they know who was responsible and they are close to making an arrest. Gary Allibon, a 59-year-old security guard, was shot in the back during the armed robbery of a cash delivery van in the Sydney CBD on June 7, 2010. Today, on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the crime, detectives from the Robbery and Serious Crime Squad's Strike Force Lorimer have announced they have made a number of important breakthroughs in the case. 'We believe we know who is responsible for this offence and we are very close to being able to charge those people with the offence,' Detective Superintendent Luke Moore told a press conference. Police have been able to forensically link a vehicle used in the shooting of Mr Allibon – a stolen Audie S8 sedan – and the non-fatal shooting of a man in Wentworthville in April 2009. They have also identified another two cars that were involved in the crime, a white BMW X5, which has not yet been located, and a silver 2004 BMW 5-Series sedan, which was stolen during a violent car-jacking in Maroubra in July 2009.

Mrs Allibon revealed that she met Gary, whom she described as 'a really nice guy' just six months after her previous partner had died, and they 'just gelled'. 'My husband was killed by someone who can only be described as a cold-blooded murderer,' she said. Mrs Allibon said that today was a particularly sad day in the lead up to the anniversary of Gary's death, which she will be marking tomorrow by having a mass said and then going to brunch with family. 'The murder of someone you love changes your life forever. I feel as empty today as I did the day of his death.' She added that there is never a day that goes past that she does not think of her husband and said that every time she sees a news report about a murder she is forced to relive her own loss. Detective Superintendent Moore said they still needed 'little pieces of information' before they could arrest the suspects and he called on the public to report any information they had about the crime to police so they could 'give Monica and her family the answers they deserve for the senseless death of Gary Allibon.' The crime occurred when Mr Allibon and another security guard were confronted by a group of armed men when they entered the foyer of a building on Sussex Street. Mr Allibon was shot in the back and the group stole some cash form the guards and fled in the silver Audi S8 sedan. Mr Allibon was treated at the scene before he was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital but died later. Detective Superintendent Moore called those involved in the crime 'well-organised' and 'cold-blooded' and said they were suspected of having links to known organised crime groups. Mr Allibon's widow, Monica, also addressed the press conference. She said she was happy with the progress police had made. She added that things had been 'difficult' and she was constantly reminded of her husband's death. Mrs Allibon added that knowing police were close to being able to arrest those responsible for her husband's death 'doesn't change my life, but it makes some difference to know that some justice has been served.' Detective Superintendent Luke Moore (left) spoke at a press conference about the developments in the investigation and Monica Allibon (right), spoke about the impact on her of the death of her husband . Mrs Allibon says that not a day goes by without her thinking about her former husband, who was killed four years ago .","Police announce breakthrough in investigation into fatal shooting in 2010 .

"By . Philip Quinn . Robbie Keane says he feels better now than he has in years — and admits it is all down to an  operation he should have had long ago. The Republic of Ireland skipper had surgery to tidy up his Achilles tendons last November, at the end of the MLS season, but says he wishes it had been done before the Euro 2012 finals. Keane checked in for international duty on Thursday night with a pep in his step and words of encouragement for Irish manager Martin O’Neill. Veteran: Robbie Keane is feeling back to his best again after an operation on his achilles . ‘This is the best I’ve felt in a long, long time,’ said Ireland’s record goal-scorer. ‘I wish I had it (the operation) done a couple of years ago. It’s a huge difference not just playing but just in general, just walking about and stuff. Waking up in the morning, it’s taken me five seconds to go to the toilet instead of 20 minutes,’ he joked. Keane hasn’t missed a game for LA Galaxy this season and his fine club form is a positive for Ireland ahead of the Euro qualifiers. Martin O’Neill plans to make four changes from . the team which drew Italy 0-0 in London on Saturday night for Ireland’s . first engagement with the World Cup outsiders from Central America. Rep of Ireland (probable v Costa Rica): . Forde; Kelly,  R Keogh, Pearce, Wilson; Pilkington, Whelan, Quinn, . McClean; Keane; Doyle. Keane has only played once under O’Neill, against Latvia last November, and is eager to land running against Costa Rica in Philadelphia later on Friday night. ‘Of course you miss it, you certainly do, but I knew what the case was. I was going to come in for the two games and I’m excited to be here,’ he said. With only five strikers in Europe ahead of him on the all-time international list, Keane retains his zest for goals. ‘It’s the same pressure as I’ve had since I was 17, so that will never change. I’m going to put pressure on myself more than probably you guys do,’ he said to the media. ‘My job is to score goals but listen, it doesn’t matter if I score goals or if it’s Shane (Long) or Wes (Hoolahan) or whoever it is among the other strikers. The important thing is winning games and certainly if we can score more goals than the opposition then we have a good chance.’ Ever-present: Keane hasn't missed a game for LA Galaxy so far this season . Goals have been in short supply for Ireland in Keane’s absence — just two in four games — but Keane isn’t perturbed by the dearth. ‘I know there’s been talk about that but as long as players are getting the opportunities to score, that’s always good. ‘We’ve got strikers in the squad who are quite capable of scoring. At the end you want to finish the chances, and if I can help to contribute towards that, then great.’ With Roy Keane keeping away from the media gaze, the younger Keane took centre stage in Manhattan. He didn’t flinch when asked about the recent Roy kerkuffle. ‘I heard the manager saying today that it’s done now, he’s here, we’ll move on. As a group, we’re delighted that he’s staying. Legendary: Keane is Ireland's all-time record goalscorer with 62 goals in 131 appearances to date . ‘He (Keane) has been good since he’s come in. We’ve enjoyed him being in the group,’ he said. O’Neill is uplifted by the arrival of his captain, especially with so many established players missing out. And O’Neill sees no sense of Keane’s enthusiasm diminishing after 132 caps spread over 16 years and is eager to keep him involved. ‘He has been a quality centre forward for some considerable length of time. Obviously, as he gets a wee bit older maybe he has to adjust his game in certain aspects. We will try to adjust ourselves to him. ‘He has just arrived so we have not formulated a plan just to accommodate him. He is easy and as long as he knows what his role is in the team, which he does, then the rest (is) straight forward.’ Accommodating: As Keane gets older, Ireland boss Martin O'Neill recognises he must adapt his playing style .","Robbie Keane has overcome injury problems after operation on Achilles .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Sarah Dean . A former Senior Australian of the Year accused of fraudulently claiming $9 million of taxpayers' money for one of the country's top indigenous schools will face trial in September. Jean Illingworth, the former principal of Djarragun College near Cairns, is accused of inflating student numbers to obtain a huge boost in extra government funding for the school. But supporters of the disgraced teacher, 66, are standing by her and have already helped raise $31,829 towards her legal fees for the trial. She will face one charge each of fraud and obtaining financial advantage by deception. Fired: Jean Illingworth, a former Queensland principal, is facing fraud charges after she allegedly bumped up enrolment numbers to secure extra funding. Here she is seen arriving at the Magistrates Court in Cairns, July 10, 2013 . Her backers have so far donated 40 per cent of the target amount reportedly needed to defend her against the fraud claims. During court proceedings last year, it was revealed Ms Illingworth was still paid $288,000 a year by the school, despite being stood down in March 2011. A trial date was set for September 22 during a pretrial hearing in the Cairns District Court on Thursday. Up to 70 witnesses, including 50 current and former school staff, will be called during the trial, which is expected to take up to five weeks. In trouble: The 66-year-old - pictured with a representative from her former lawyers, O'Reilly Stevens, last year - will face trial in September . The school: She was the former principal of Djarragun College, a top indigenous education centre, near Cairns . The court also heard Crown prosecutors had 17,000 documents, mainly enrolment and financial records, in their possession. About 200 of these will be presented at the trial. Prosecutors alleged Ms Illingworth enrolled children who never attended classes to gain extra funding. The former star of the local community worked at the college for about a decade. She was named the Queensland Senior Australian of the Year in 2009 for her work in transforming the once-dysfunctional college into a much admired model of success. Role model: Ms Illingworth was named Queensland's Senior Australian of the Year in 2009 . Aboriginal Australian lawyer Noel Pearson, who now runs the school, once described her as a 'true social entrepreneur'. The fundraising website 'Defend Jean' claims: 'Jean Illingworth worked tirelessly at Djarragun College for ten years, turning a small dysfunctional school into a flagship example of successful indigenous education.' It claims: 'The very least Jean deserves is a fair trial. The legal costs involved in achieving this are almost prohibitive.' Ms Illingworth's lawyers still have the option to apply for a judge-only trial or request jurors be polled to see if they are biased due to publicity surrounding the case. Before the trial takes place the case will go before the court again next month. The 66-year-old has been in custody in a Townsville women's prison for almost a year. She was released on bail after being charged early last year but was then taken into custody in July after allegedly contacting witnesses in the trial. A separate trial relating to these alleged offences - she has been charged with two counts of perverting the course of justice - may take place in November.

Sir Trevor Brooking will retire from his role as the FA's director of football development after the World Cup. The FA has announced that Brooking has decided to leave English football's governing body after 11 years in the role. During his time at the FA, Brooking has been a keen advocate of improving coaching and playing standards at grassroots level.

Brooking, who played 47 times for England, said: 'I believe now is the right time to step away from my full-time role at The FA and I feel extremely positive about the future of football development moving forward. 'Under the leadership and guidance of (director of elite development) Dan Ashworth and (Under-21s coach) Gareth Southgate, we have now put in place a strong, credible, elite structure to support the professional game.

"By . Leesa Smith . It was a spoof video featuring a woman who seeks out sex with asbestos workers which was meant to be funny. But unfortunately for manager Tim Pow, most of his colleagues at the Christchurch Earthquake (CERA) Recovery Authority failed to see the joke. It probably did not help that his email arrived shortly after the New Zealand organisation were criticised for not treating asbestos management seriously during the city's reconstruction. Scroll down for video . This video,  a spoof of a woman seeking to have sex with an asbestos removal worker, was sent to Earthquake Recovery Authority contractors in Christchurch, New Zealand . The woman says to her date that asbestos removal workers are braver than firemen or policemen because  'you know you're going to die of mesothelioma' Nor did Mr Pow's quip ‘Now who said asbestos was not the game to be in' endear him to his colleagues. New Zealand Demolition and Asbestos Association executive member Helina Stil said the email was 'pretty strange’. More... The British people's greatest day: Cynics will say it's time to move on. But today raise a glass to the sheer ingenuity, courage and bloody mindedness of Britons like Stan Hollis, who turned a potential disaster into awesome victory . Long-term effect of Vic mine smoke unknown . 'They think it's all funny and stuff like that, but actually it's not. It's detrimental to what we're trying to achieve as women, but it's also detrimental to the industry as a whole. 'Tim is a really, really nice guy but in this instance, the email was inappropriate.' Ms Stil said she was concerned that the email also appeared to make light of the fact asbestos was a highly dangerous substance. CERA residential red zone operations manager Tim Pow's message in the email with the video attached said: 'Now who said Asbestos was not the game to be in.' ‘I think it's actually very, very poor timing and very, very poor taste.' The video entitled Aspestos Girl was sent to about 40 CERA contractors by Mr Pow, who works as a residential red zone operations manager. It features a fictional woman who gets verbally and physically excited about being on date with an asbestos removal worker. ‘I kind of have a thing for asbestos removal workers,’ she said. ‘Some girls date firemen or policemen but you all are much braver because you know you’re going to die of mesothelioma.' She continues: ’I'm just asking you to come back to my house, sniff some sealant and remove my asbestos - you know, have sex - before you die of mesothelioma’. Mesothelioma is a rare fatal cancer of the lining of the lungs or abdominal cavity and can be caused by asbestos, a known carcinogen. The video was sent to about 40 Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority contractors by the company's residential red zone operations manager Mr Pow . Mr Pow's email containing the video has been labelled 'very inappropriate' and 'very poor taste' A Christchurch contractor, who did not want to be named, told stuff.co.nz that the video was ‘in very poor taste’ and had caused outrage among the recipients. CERA chief executive Roger Sutton said the email intended to give people a laugh ‘but in reality it was just dumb,’ he said. ‘The content has caused offence to some, and to anyone that has been offended, I apologise on behalf of CERA.’ CERA was a strong supporter of women working in the rebuild, and about half of its senior leaders were women, along with 64 per cent of its fixed-term and seconded staff, he said. The company also treated asbestos management ‘very seriously' and had strict requirements in place for contractors dealing with the substance at Crown-owned properties. Mr Sutton said CERA would be reminding staff of its policies and expectations for the use of work email. Christchurch has suffered a series of earthquakes with the most violent killing 181 people in February 2011. Three years on, the rebuild of the city will take at least another five years as gaps are expected to keep appearing throughout the city business district.

"By . Nik Simon . Follow @@Nik_Simon88 . All Blacks fly half Aaron Cruden believes there will be added spice to Saturday’s opening Test against England because of New Zealand’s humiliating defeat at Twickenham in 2012. Cruden's side had no answers in the 38-21 rout by England and the 25-year-old feels the result - their only defeat in 35 games - is still fresh in the mind of the Kiwi public. This summer's tour is England’s first visit to New Zealand since that famous encounter and Stuart Lancaster’s understrength side must be prepared to feel the full force of the All Blacks at Eden Park, where the hosts are bidding to defend a 20-year unbeaten record. Needle: New Zealand's Aaron Cruden believes there will be added spice to the opening Test against England . ‘Our supporters and our fans know who the last side to beat us were and they fully understand the threat this English side possess,’ Cruden told Sportsmail. ‘It’s massive for us; rugby is the number one sport in New Zealand. The media are saying this is an understrength English side, but we don’t see that as the case at all. When they pull on the English jersey we know they will do everything they can to get the result for their team.’ ‘We’ve got a pretty handy record at Eden Park but it’s something we don’t often talk about. It seems to be a bit of a fortress for us and hopefully that can continue.’ Cruden has taken over the No 10 jersey in place of New Zealand icon Dan Carter, who is playing no part in the three-Test Series following a sabbatical. The 25-year-old will line up against Freddie Burns and, while team-mate Brodie Retallick was unable to name one England player earlier in the week, Cruden has clearly been doing some homework on his opposite number. ‘Freddie made his debut against us a couple of years ago and I’ve watched a bit of his footage,’ said Cruden. ‘He’s a good player; he’s got a sound right-footed kicking game and he’s a really good organiser. We’ve got to be aware of the threat that he poses and try to shut him down as much as we can. Important cog in the machine: Cruden should prove to be integral for New Zealand at the weekend . England roar: Chris Ashton celebrates scoring a try during the 38-21 win two years ago . Eyes on the prize: Cruden will operate at fly half for the All Blacks in the place of Dan Carter at Eden Park . Know all about him: The hosts kept a close eye on Danny Cipriani while he was with the Melbourne Rebels . ‘We saw Danny Cipriani a little bit with his time at the Melbourne Rebels, but we don’t get to see as much of Freddie playing back in the UK. We just have to do our preparation and make sure we’re ready for whatever they throw at us.’ England coach Stuart Lancaster has had to turn to fringe players such as Burns, Rob Webber, James Haskell and Kyle Eastmond in the absence of regular starters from Saracens and Northampton. They will all be hoping to make their mark and, similarly, Cruden also sees Saturday’s Test as an opportunity to put up his hand for a run of games in the starting jersey. The 25-year-old edged out Beauden Barrett in selection and his long-term target is to challenge Carter to be first choice at next year’s Rugby World Cup. ‘You always want to be in that starting XV and I’m really excited and grateful to get the start this weekend,’ said Cruden. ‘For me it’s a case of understanding my role within the team and, whether I’m starting or on the bench, I just have to put my best foot forward and push my claim to get that starting jersey. ‘I looked up to Dan growing up a youngster and now to be able to rub shoulders, pick his brain and ask questions can only be beneficial for my game. The healthy competition that we have within the squad now really encourages you to keep getting better every day.’ Tough ask: Stuart Lancaster must cajole one of England's biggest performances in order to get anything .

"By . Australian Associated Press . and Ryan Lipman . Bali police have confirmed they searched a man at the scene of a drug bust that resulted in Sydney woman Leeza Ormsby being charged with drug possession - but let him go because he was not a suspect. The Australian man named Marco Mazzucco, a Sydney DJ and reportedly Ms Ormsby's ex-lover, turned up at the villa after police arrived, an officer confirmed. He has since left Bali. Ms Ormsby, 37, is on trial for drugs possession charges carrying a jail term of up to 12 years after being arrested with 'half of a joint' of marijuana. Scroll down for video . Behind bars: Leeza Ormsby in a holding cell, talking with her lawyer Ari Soenardi, before her drugs possession trial, in Denpasar, Bali on Thursday . The Australian resident was arrested at the scene of a drug bust in February after a police tip-off and Bali police have confirmed they searched her ex-lover Marco Mazzucco at the scene, but let him go because he was not a suspect . An Australian resident, Ms Ormsby does not plan to fight the charges but has maintained since the February sting that MDMA and hashish found in a Canggu villa did not belong to not her. But Indonesian police were also trying to link the New Zealand born woman to the other drugs found at the villa, including 132 grams of MDMA and 26 grams of hashish, while she remained in a cramped police cell for months. On Thursday, the police who arrested Ms Ormsby gave evidence at her trial. They described how they staked out the villa from 11pm the night before the bust, after being told the occupants, suspected of holding a 'drugs party' were not there. Police officer Cok Putra Sutrisna told the court Ms Ormsby, who was staying at another villa, arrived in the early morning by motorbike, looking dishevelled. Ms Ormsby appeared in Denpasar District Court on drug possession charges on Monday May 26, where she was charged with possessing, carrying and using a half-joint of marijuana . The 37-year-old was arrested on February 12 and has since been held in a cramped police cell . 'Her physical appearance looked messy with her hair uncombed,' he said. 'She looked like a drunk person.' Police officer Made Sudiarsa said they approached Ormsby as she was opening the villa door with a key. When they found the joint in her handbag, the former Paddington shop assistant admitted it was for her own use, the court heard. But when drugs were found in a cupboard drawer, Ms Ormsby claimed they were not hers. The drugs appeared to be 'a black chunk of something, a big capsule and four small capsules'. Brig Sudiarsa confirmed reports a man named Marco (Mazzucco), believed to be Ormsby's Australian ex-lover, then turned up. Ms Ormsby does not plan to fight charges of possessing a marijuana joint, but has maintained that MDMA and hashish found in a Canggu villa did not belong to not her . 'We then searched him and we found nothing, that's why he was released,' he told the court. After the raid, police promised to investigate the other people who had been at the villa, but they have all since left the holiday island. Instead, Ms Ormsby's lawyer Ari Soenardi said they kept his client in custody for three months without charges, trying to link her to the other drugs. She was finally charged in mid-May for only the three offences and denied having any knowledge about the other drugs seized from the scene. The villa where the large quantity of drugs had been found, was being rented by Sydney rock band frontman Azaria Byrne at the time of the tip-off, but Mr Byrne jetted off to Sydney the night before the stake-out. After the raid, police promised to investigate the other people who had been at the villa . Ms Ormsby had received the key to the villa from her former boyfriend, Mr Mazzucco, who denied involvement when being questioned by police and left Indonesia soon afterwards. Prosecutor Ni Putu Oka Ariani confirmed Ms Ormsby had admitted to smoking the joint police found in her bag. 'The defendant admitted that the joint was given to her by her friend named Robert, with the intention of using it together,' the prosecutor said. The chief of the three-judge panel, Parulian Saragih, asked Ms Ormsby whether she understood the charges and through an interpreter, the Rotorua-born woman said she did. Lawyer Ari Soenardi says his client won't fight the charges, but rather aim to receive a reduced sentence due to being a drug victim in need of rehabilitation. 'We will try to show the medical examination test results, which state that the defendant is a narcotics user, and hope for leniency later,' he told reporters outside court. Ms Ormsby will remain in custody in Kerobokan jail while the trial continues . The court heard that Ms Ormsby often uses hashish, marijuana and ketamine and has twice undergone therapy and rehabilitation for her drug addictions. Ms Ormsby was relaxed in court on Thursday, wearing a loose-fitting white shirt and carrying a fan that with the word 'paradise' on it. She told the court through a translator that she did not disagree with the police evidence. Mr Soenardi says he will ask the court to treat Ms Ormsby as a drug user and consider leniency when sentencing her. She remained quiet and calm at her court appearance on Monday, May 26, in contrast to her state when she was charged two weeks earlier. Then, she cried and called out to reporters: 'I want to go home.' Her flatmates in Sydney, where she was living, have told media that Ms Ormsby had not been working before she suddenly left for Bali, but had spoken of feeling stressed. The trial continues next week and Ms Ormsby will remain in custody in Kerobokan jail.

"By . Adam Duggan . A woman who smoked and kept watch as her boyfriend repeatedly punched an African migrant during a violent robbery has been jailed for 30 months. Jamiee Lee Haynes, 28, stood by as Timothy Williams attacked their victim, then helped steal his belongings which had fallen to the floor when he tried to run away at Wollongong Train Station last October . Just half an hour before the brutal incident, she had been at Wollongong police station to answer bail for offences including being armed with intent and common assault. CCTV in the station recorded her at the front desk. Williams, 26, was with her. Scroll down for video . Reporting for bail: Jamiee Lee Haynes at the front desk of Wollongong Police Station just half an hour before she helped her boyfriend Timothy Williams, who can be seen in the background, rob an African refugee in October last year . Arriving together: The couple arrived at Wollongong Police Station together, ahead of Ms Haynes presenting herself to police . The pair were arrested after police followed a trail of security camera footage, which proved that the attack was planned and that Haynes played a role in assisting Williams. They escaped with the Eritrean migrant's neck;ace, a bracelet, a pair of sunglasses, a set of headphones and $60 in cash. Officers were waiting for the pair at Wollongong Police Station the day after the attack, with Ms Haynes needing to report again. More...

'He tried to take this little boy... he just went in for the attack': Cafe owner tells of the moment alleged child-snatcher pounced as toddler sat beside his mother in busy shopping centre . Williams was jailed for nine years when he appeared in court on Thursday. In handing down a lesser sentence to Haynes, Judge Paul Conlon of the Wollongong District Court took into consideration her lesser role in the incident. He noted that she was unlikely to have known to what extent Williams was planning to injure their victim. The man, who had only been in Australia for five days, lost a tooth in the violent assault and required stitches in his left ear. It was hardly a warm welcome to the country for the refugee, who had relocated from his native Eritrea - one of the most violent countries in the world. Smack: The moment Timothy Williams first punched the African refugee last October at Wollongong railway station, NSW . Speaking at Mr Williams' sentencing on Thursday, Judge Paul Conlon said the shocking CCTV footage was a reliable account of what happened during the violent assault. 'A viewing of this footage is all that is needed to make an accurate assessment of the objective seriousness of this offence,' he said, the Illawarra Mercury reported. The Judge confirmed that the pair were waiting for their victim to reach the train station's pedestrian walkway. 'When the victim was stopped, it was also clear that there was a plan of action,' he said. He also revealed how Mr Williams attempted to downplay the attack while speaking to a court-appointed psychologist. 'He provides [the doctor] with a palpably false version of his confrontation and vicious assault on an unsuspecting victim,' Judge Conlon said. Mr Williams will be locked up for six years, back-dated to when he first came into custody at the time of the offence, and won't be eligible for parole until 2019. Ms Haynes was charged with aggravated robbery with wounding and was sentenced to 30 months behind bars, with a non-parole period of 15 months on Friday. Trickery: Mr Williams appears to chat with the man as he goes through his bag, while his blonde friend Jaimee Lee Haynes, 28, hangs around in the background as a lookout . Surprising: At the beginning of the CCTV video it appears that the two men are just chatting like friends but Mr Williams is actually demanding his victim's cash . Floored: The Illawarra man sets upon his victim without hesitation . Deceptive: It may look like Mr Williams is bending down to help the man on the floor but he is actually just moving him so he can hit him again . Getaway: Mr Williams eventually lets his victim run away from him . Strolling: The attacker calmly walks back to pick up the bag and the refugee's possessions from the floor and Ms Haynes rejoins him . The victim was a refugee from Eritrea, a country in the Horn of Africa that is bordered by Sudan to the west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the east. The man had only been in Australia - supposedly a safe nation - for five weeks when he was violently set upon. His home country, which has a poor human rights record, is now in a fragile state of peace after more than 30 years of fighting. However, thousands are now fleeing due to a forced labour program that is spawning human rights violations, according to a report last month that will be debated next month at the U.N. Human Rights Council. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR estimates that 2,000 people of Eritrea's 6 million population are fleeing every month. Their relatives are forced to pay fines of 50,000 nafka (about $3,607) for each family member who has left. Eritrea is a country in the Horn of Africa that is bordered by Sudan to the west, Ethiopia in the south, and Djibouti in the east . Most families can't afford the fine so a family member may be detained until the money is paid, or business licenses or property may be confiscated, the report said. The government began its program of national service, where people are put to work in reforestation, soil and water conservation and reconstruction, in 1995 but it has turned into an indefinite conscription, the report said. Eritrea emerged from its long war of independence in 1993 only to plunge once again into military conflict, first with Yemen and then with its old adversary, Ethiopia. The country is ruled by President Isaias Afewerki, who has been in office since independence in 1993. National elections have been scheduled and cancelled - they have ever been held since the country became independent. People who practice 'unregistered' religions, try to flee the nation, or escape military duty are arrested and put into prison. The religions that are allowed in the country are the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Eritrean Lutheran Church, and Sunnite Islam. All other religions are persecuted and freedom of worship is one of the top reasons thousands of Eritreans flee the country. Meanwhile, a 2011 UN report estimated that about 70 per cent of Eritreans cannot meet their food needs on their own. But the government insists Eritrea is self-sufficient in food and declines international food aid. Domestic and international human rights organisations are also not allowed to function in Eritrea.

Several state agencies pitched in to help on Tuesday, including contractors and firefighters who volunteered their time. They cut a large hole in the side of Sharon's house and then used their equipment to lift her from her bed and unto a trolley to remove her from the room and into the garden.

"By . Louise Cheer . Coins lost down the back of couches and rubbish dumps are costing the Royal Australian Mint $110 million to replace. According to the mint's chief executive officer, the 255 million coins it produces a year makes up for those that disappear. Scroll down for video . It costs the Royal Australian Mint 6 cents a year to produce a 5-cent coin . Ross MacDiarmid made his first appearance before a treasury estimates hearing this week in Canberra and told bemused senators that each Australian loses 10 coins every year. 'We do not have excess coins and, if there are mutilated coins coming back, they are relatively small in number throughout the year,' he said. 'Most of the coins that we provide are against coins that disappear down the back of chairs, down the back of car seats, into rubbish dumps and, in some cases, are taken overseas. 'Or they are sitting in people's drawers for long periods of time or in jars.' Every year, $110 million is spent to mint coins that are lost down the back of a couch and car seats, in rubbish dumps and taken overseas . Upon hearing this, NSW Senator Sam Dastyari said: 'That is the most interesting thing I have heard all day.' Mr MacDiarmid also revealed it cost the mint 6c to produce one 5c coin. He said the mint had submitted a proposal to review the range of coins it produced, which included the 5c piece. Ross MacDiarmid, the CEO of the Australian Mint, revealed the information while at a treasury estimates hearing . Though it may be practical to scrap the coin, Mr MacDiarmid said it would depend on reactions from consumers, banks and other stakeholders, in particular charities who use it as a way to raise money. 'The demand for coins is actually diminishing,' he said. 'What we do not know at this stage is to what degree and over what time frame. 'Some countries around the world are seeing flatlining; other countries are seeing it decline faster. 'In our case, we are seeing a decline, which is why I think this review process is perfectly timed.' Mr MacDiarmid said the drop in coin demand was because of technology advances in credit cards. Currently, there are 5 billion coins in circulation in Australia - which according to Mr MacDiarmid is not a lot compared to international standards. The CEO was appearing before the Economics Legislation Committee looking into the privatisation of the Royal Australian Mint.","The Mint makes 255 million coins a year, which make up for lost currency .

"By . James  Nye . and Meghan Keneally . A man who was driving his girlfriend home to Michigan from Arizona after she checked herself out of a mental health facility has said that the reason he kept driving for hours after he discovered she was dead in the passenger's seat was because 'I cared too much'. Ray Tomlinson, 62, had gone to pick up his girlfriend, who was exactly half his age, home after she finished a stay in a mental health facility and he brought his 93-year-old wheelchair-bound mother along for the journey. The girlfriend, who has not been identified by police as they try to contact her next of kin, had previously been homeless and had a history of drug abuse. It is not clear why exactly she was she was being treated for mental health issues in Arizona, but The Detroit Free Press reports that she signed herself out of the facility on May 28 and left with Tomlinson and his mother. Cross country: Ray Tomlinson carried on driving from Arizona to Michigan even after discovering his 31-year-old girlfriend had died in the passenger seat of his van . She had several prescriptions filled before she left, including one for 30 OxyContin, and her older boyfriend did not suspect anything was wrong after they made a stop for gas in Flagstaff, Arizona where she used the restroom. 'We're guessing she might have overdosed,' Warren Police Commissioner Jere Green said. Tomlinson and his elderly mother realized the woman had died as they passed through Oklahoma or Texas on Monday- just two of the states they passed through during their 1,700 mile journey. 'He says, ""I’m not stopping. I’ll get a hold of them when I get to Michigan,""' Warren Police Detective Sgt. Stephen Mills told The Detroit Free Press. After the stop in Flagstaff, someone at the mental health facility in Arizona called the woman's cellphone to check on her. 'It's a courtesy call,' Green said. 'He answers and said, ""She can't talk. ... She's dead.""' The . caller told Tomlinson to immediately contact police. He didn't and . later told investigators he was afraid police would arrest them and . seize his van. The facility filed a missing persons report and police contacted Tomlinson, who met them Tuesday. 'I was in total denial,' he said. When officers arrived Tuesday at Tomlinson's son's home in Warren, just north of Detroit, Tomlinson was weeping on the curb and his mother was in her wheelchair in the back of the van. The dead woman's corpse was in the front passenger seat wearing a seatbelt and sunglasses and Tomlinson told police he kept driving because based on Internet research he did on his phone, he thought he had 48 hours before he needed to take the woman to a morgue. 'She obviously had been dead for at least 24 hours in screeching heat,' Commissioner Green said. Tomlinson has not been arrested and the case is under investigation. Tragic: In this image muzzed by the Warren Police Department - the deceased lady is seen still sat in the passenger seat of Tomlinson's van . Tomlinson gave police explanations for his actions, 'which made sense to him,' Green said. But 'was he committing a crime or was it stupidity?' He said the woman was homeless when he first met her last year as she waited for her then boyfriend to be released from jail. He said he fell for her and helped her to get back on her feet - but she returned to Arizona several times to seek help. He said their relationship eventually blossomed into romance. 'I loved her very much,' Tomlinson said to The Detroit Free Press. Tomlinson said he didn't take her directly to hospital because he was in denial she had died and didn't want her to be left in a morgue thousands of miles away. 'I just lost a very close friend,' Tomlinson told the paper. When asked if he would have done things differently, he said, 'Yes.' Authorities are awaiting toxicology results from an autopsy performed on the body of the 31-year-old woman who died.","Ray Tomlinson, 62, realized his 31-year-old girlfriend had passed away during 1,700 mile journey from Arizona to Michigan .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Australian tech entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes has been forced to apologise after an employee said a software program was his girlfriend and listed some of her negative attributes. Mr Cannon-Brookes rose to prominence after he co-founded Atlassian, a $3.5 billion enterprise software company that develops products for project managers and software developers, in 2002. But after engineer Jonathan Doklovic described software program Maven as a 'demanding', 'complaining' and 'interupting' girlfriend, Mr Cannon-Brookes had to excuse his employee's comments, reported The Sydney Morning Herald. Maven: The negative comments about the software program were made during a presentation by engineer Jonathan Doklovic in Berlin on Wednesday . The remarks were made by Mr Doklovic during a presentation at Atlassian's two-day developer conference in Berlin on Wednesday and have cast a shadow over Silicon Valley. The 'demanding' software the engineer referred to is a program capable of standardising and simplifying projects built with software language Java. In his power point presentation, Mr Doklovic, who was hired by Mr Cannon-Brookes, said the software looks beautiful, complains a lot, demands, interrupts me when I'm working and doesn't play well with my other friends. He did not acknowledge that the Hebrew meaning of maven is someone who understands, based on accumulating knowledge and information. But the comments proved controversial and have seen intense backlash on social media including Twitter and also from the media. 'We are sorry': Entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes, pictured, wrote an apology in response to his employee's comments . The outrage triggered Mr Cannon-Brookes to make a written apology entitled On failing our values, our team, and our industry, on Atlassian blogs. 'Today one of our engineers delivered a presentation that contained inappropriate content at our AtlasCamp developer conference,' Mr Cannon-Brookes wrote. 'We are sorry for having allowed this offensive slide into an AtlasCamp presentation. The content does not reflect our company values – nor our personal values as co-founders and individuals. Quite simply, it’s not OK. 'Sexism is a difficult issue for the tech industry, and today we didn’t make it any better.' Mr Cannon-Brookes states that immediate action is being taken, but does not mention if Mr Doklovic will be fired for the incident. He also defended the employee in question. 'I know the engineer responsible well. I hired him. I know the slide does not reflect his values any more than it reflects Atlassian’s, and he is as deeply sorry as we are. It was an error in judgment, but one the company shares responsibility for making.' Backlash: People took to Twitter to express their anger of the comments . The apology goes onto to say Atlassian has failed as a team and together they will help the engineer learn from his mistake. Mr Cannon-Brookes concludes by saying Atlassian has strived to create a diverse team environment. 'Clearly today we let ourselves, our team and our industry down. We’ll continue striving, growing and learning,' he finished. The latest scandal is the first in a long line of sexist controversies, including a pitch by two Australians at last year's  TechCrunch start-up conference, where they outlined their idea for an app called 'Titstare', which 'takes photos of yourself staring at tits. Just days later Business Insider chief technology officer Pax Dickinson was fired after he defended the actions of the two Australians. Last month co-founder of GitHub, a coding website used by software developers globally, was forced to resign after he made errors of judgment in relation to accusations of sexual harassment by a female engineer who resigned. Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel also apologised after offensive emails about women from his time at university surfaced.","Mike Cannon-Brookes has said sorry for an employee's sexist comments .

"By . Bianca London . Ever turned up to meet a Tinder date and had to double take because your suitor looks nothing like their profile picture? You're not alone. A new survey has revealed that a . third of online daters are disappointed when they meet up with their date, with 21 per cent describing them as ‘unrecognisable’. That's a shame for the 48 per cent of Brits who have picked a dating partner purely on looks, only to endure an evening of boredom and awkward silences. Not quite what you expected? One in five online daters are 'unrecognisable' in the flesh compared to their pictures, reveals a new survey . However, this doesn't come as much of a surprise when a . quarter of Brits are using profile pictures that are over five years old. And as for those natural selfies, all is not what it . seems.

Women take five attempts on average to achieve the 'perfect selfie' - and a quarter use Instagram filters to boost their beauty . Their efforts may well be going to waste because 67 per cent of men consider selfies a ‘turn-off’ and are less likely to strike up a conversation when someone posts a selfie. In a wider setting, 87 per cent have even gone as far as to block people from their social media feeds as they're bored of seeing incessant selfies. However we’re not totally looks obsessed: 56 per cent of people would rather receive a compliment on their personality than on their looks, found the survey by LoveFlutter. Dr Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a Professor of Business Psychology at University College London, said: 'Dating has been trivialised by apps that focus too much on looks and too little on essential human qualities. Wit and personality can be sexier than looks and unlike looks determines long-term compatibility.' Research Psychologist Dr Andrea Kallias agrees. 'With the obsession of the selfie and digital narcissism, more and more focus is being placed on looks alone,' she says. 'We all want an attractive partner, of course, but what we need is someone who is psychologically compatible.' That's awkward!

"By . Louise Cheer . It took 10 people, a fibreglass boat and an excavator to cage two Queensland crocodiles - one of them 5m long -  so they could catch a flight to their new home at Dubai's largest shopping centre. After a 16-hour flight and two-hour layover in Singapore, Jock the croc and his girlfriend will take centre stage at The Dubai Mall's Dubai Aquarium and Discovery Centre. It's a far cry from their home at Koorana Crocodile Farm at Coowonga, near Rockhampton, where the pair have been together for 15 years. Jock the croc and his girlfriend took to the skies on Thursday en route to their new home at The Dubai Mall's Dubai Aquarium and Discovery Centre . Animal handlers started loading Jock - who is 40 years old and weighs 750kg - and his mate onto a Main Freight truck on Tuesday night and both were on their way by Wednesday morning, arriving in Brisbane about 7pm on the same day. They took flight about 2.30am on Thursday and will arrive 18 hours later. But the lovebirds did not travel alone. They had some race horses to keep them company. Koorana Crocodile Farm's Lillian Lever said her husband, two sons, four staff members, a Melbourne Aquarium vet, a Main Freight employee who built the cages, and the CEO of the Dubai Aquarium and Zoo were on hand to help with the mammoth effort. She said it took them six hours from the start of the caging process until the the final croc, Jock, was boxed. Ms Lever's sons had to stand in the boat and rope Jock in. '(We used) manpower to drag him over the mud into the cage and one excavator to lift the cage and take it to the transport cage,' she said. Without giving too much away, Main Freight perishables branch manager Justin Keir said the crocs were loaded into special built crates. Jock the croc pictured here with John Lever (green t-shirt), Paul Hamilton curator of Dubai Aquarium (navy t-shirt), and film crew from Dubai who spent a week at Koorana Crocodile Farm . The crocs were loaded up on the Koorana Crocodile Farm near Rockhampton and travelled to Brisbane on a Main Freight truck on Wednesday . 'We specialise in (animal transport) so asking about it is like asking the colonel about his 11 herbs and spices (at KFC),' he said. 'They were in crates that have a controlled atmosphere so they were able to be kept warm.' Despite having transported other unusual cargo, Mr Keir said this one was by far the most unique. 'We do a lot of penguins - we have a purpose built crates one for penguins - and snakes,' he said. 'The crocs would have to be at the top of the list of unusual things we’ve done.' Ms Lever's husband, John, told The Morning Bulletin this was the first time their crocodiles had been sent overseas. It also means a part of Central Queensland will be at the mall - about 12,000km away from Australia - that had more than 75 million visitors in 2013. Jock the croc is more than 5m long, weighs 750kg and is 40 years old - and still has 20 or 30 years of growth left in him . The saltwater crocodile and his girlfriend have been at Koorana together for about 15 years . Mr Lever said part of the sale of the crocs to the mall was to promote Koorana and the region. The offer came after the farm had a croc take up residence at the Melbourne Aquarium in 2013. Jock was caught after he was sighted in Chinaman's Creek in Cairns during the 1980s. Similar croc tales to Jock's capture are chronicled in Kissed by a Croc - Mr Lever's autobiography he co-authored with Jenny Lanyon. It was launched as an ABC book on June 1. Jock and his girlfriend will be renamed by their new owners.

"By . Tracey Cox . This week, scientists officially announced that our hair colour is completely unrelated to personality and intelligence. The genetic mechanism that controls blonde hair, for instance, doesn't alter the biology of any other part of the body or brain. Did anyone really think there was serious proof that all those blonde jokes were true? Probably not. Tracey says that going for a blonde colour could help a shy person become more confident . But this still won't stop us making assumptions based purely on hair colour. Because while it's true the colour of hair we're born with doesn't dictate how bright, flighty or flirty we are, the colour we choose to be speaks volumes about how we'd like to be seen. We know that if we've got dark hair, we'll be seen as more serious than someone who's blonde, who'll score high on sex appeal but not so great on intelligence or friendliness. If every redhead got a pound each time someone blamed an emotional outburst on their hair colour, most could retire by 40. Every time we reach for a bottle of hair dye or instruct our hairdresser to add streaks of sunshine or warm, winter lights, we're effectively tweaking our personality. Our hair colour changes how others see us and treat us - and how we feel about ourselves. When Times columnist and brunette Caitlin Moran pulled on a peroxide white wig for a fashion shoot last week, she not only felt 'dangerously splendid' she 'could already see that being blonde would change my life: that my hair would want to take me out to places and be noticed.' Tracey says that opting for a different hair colour can dramatically alter your life . Hair colour isn't like inheriting Mum's large hips or short legs. We don't have to shrug, say, 'Oh well, mousy brown it is' because there is something you can do about it. Many women don't accept what Mother Nature doled out (how many women over 21 do you know with virgin hair - hair that's never been coloured or highlighted?) If you've ever doubted how much hairstyle and colour influences personality, think back to the last fancy dress party you went to. You're guaranteed good gossip the next day because people behave out of character. When we change our hair colour, we take on the personality stereotype that goes with it. If you're shy or lacking in confidence, a switch from brunette to blonde could be just what you need to practice being a new, more adventurous you. Dramatic colour change is also fabulous for forcing people to look at you afresh. Fear you're not being taken seriously at work? Turn up as a brunette with a smart new suit on, and things might change. Want a jaded husband to see you anew or to turn a friend into a lover? Head for the hairdresser. There might not be a scrap of evidence to support the hair colour stereotypes but we'll all continue to use it to our advantage anyway!

"By . Sarah Dean . Twelve puppies found living in their own filth while locked inside an underground bunker have been rescued from a cruel puppy farm. Sought after breeds, including King Charles spaniels, labradors and German shepherds were kept three metres below ground in darkness with no fresh air, by a 43-year-old woman in Western Australia. 'The smell emanating from this is quite overpowering,' said an RSPCA rescuer as he lifted the lid of the bunker. Saved: 12 puppies were found locked up inside an underground bunker in countryside WA in January . Locked up: The dogs were kept in squalid conditions three metres below ground . Frantic: The puppies can be seen climbing up the walls in an RSPCA video. They look desperate to escape . Fifty dogs in total were saved from a hidden country side farm in South Doodlakine, on January 24, 2012. Katherine Lisa King had already been banned from owning an animal for a decade in 2004, so she moved her sick money making puppy farm underground in what is believed to be an attempt to avoid detection. The horrific animal cruelty was filmed in an RSPCA rescue video. The puppies can be seen yelping for help, as the small circular lid to their underground kennel is lifted. A frantic brown and white King Charles spaniel can be seen desperately trying to jump up towards the bunker's exit. They were found living on a floor littered with dirty old newspaper. A yellow bucket of brown food was placed against the wall. Many of the 50 dogs were sick with infections including ear mite and secondary infections resulting from failure to treat the conditions by taking the animals to a vet. Cruel: The dogs had no daylight and dirty old newspaper surrounded them . Infected: Many of the dogs were sick with ear mite and secondary infections resulting from failure to treat the conditions by taking the animals to a vet .

Amanda Swift of the RSPCA told Seven News: 'It was difficult for us to find, it was well hidden. The dogs were down there... we don't know for how long.' The puppies were to be sold at high prices in pet shops and online. Free: A white puppy is brought up to the sunlight after being kept in the bunker . Sad: 50 dogs in total were rescued from the appalling conditions on the farm . Inside: A photo taken from above the bunker gives a glimpse of the disgusting conditions the dogs were kept in .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Justin Bieber was plunged into a new racism row after a video clip emerged of him changing the lyrics of a song to joke about killing a ‘n*****’ and joining the Ku Klux Klan. The popstar was caught on camera at the age of 14, in a video which has just now been released by TMZ, changing the words of his song One Less Lonely Girl to sing 'one less lonely n*****' - and joking about joining white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. This latest controversy comes after Justin, 20, apologised 'for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable behaviour' on Monday after another video clip was revealed of him using the n-word five times. Scroll down for video (warning: explicit content) Making an escape: Justin Bieber jetted out of Mexico on Tuesday as a second video of him using racist terms emerged on TMZ . Justin's team told TMZ he 'wants this video out, because he wants to own what he did'. It apparently came about when Justin saw a comedian parodying his song online and he then copied the comedian. However, . TMZ reports he knew  'almost immediately it was a stupid thing to do' and confessed to mentor Usher and close pal Will Smith. Usher showed him old racist videos to educate him and Justin is said to have seen the error of his ways. What's more, TMZ reports that the Young Money Entertainment clan, which features the likes of 'Lil Wayne and Birdman – who Justin regularly hangs out with – are supporting the Never Say Never hitmaker. Mack Maine, President of Young Money, is quoted by the website as saying: 'Bieber does not have a slave mentality.  He treats his people with respect.' Meanwhile, . Justin has claimed that people have tried to extort him over the two . videos which have recently leaked but he 'says he will not be shaken . down anymore. He says he wants people to see the video and he wants to . accept responsibility.' Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Indeed, . the footage of Bieber telling a racist joke was made public on Sunday . after he refused to pay $1million to the person who had obtained it. The singer was held to ransom over the clip, TMZ has said, by a man who had copied it from a computer hard drive belonging to the singer. Sources . told the website that the 20-year-old's reps were contacted two months . ago by a lawyer, who represented a client who had worked on the star's . videos. TMZ states that the lawyer said he'd sell the video to . the media unless Bieber forked out $1million, which was quickly refused. The price was allegedly later dropped to $800,000 and then $500,000. But the seller was 'sent packing' by Bieber's representatives as they felt the video of him telling a racist joke 'was not that harmful' because he was only 15 when it was recorded. The news emerged on the same day that the hitmaker was spotted boarding a private jet, after a brief stay stay at a swanky villa in Mexico. Causing a stir: The news emerged as the hitmaker was spotted leaving a swanky villa in Mexico . 'I thought it was OK to repeat hurtful words and jokes': The 20-year-old, pictured in the clip, blamed his actions on ignorance, but he insisted he's learned his lesson . On Tuesday,  The Sun . shared the new clip which shows the Canadian singer, wearing a dog tag . and a dark blue shirt, changing the words to his 2009 song One Less . Lonely Girl in order to use the n-word. A . source told the newspaper: ‘Unfortunately this is the devastating . reality of how Justin has behaved and reveals his attitude toward such a . deeply emotive subject. ‘People . need to see this. Normal kids in society do not make these kind of . jokes. He is protected by a network of staff, but the camera doesn’t . lie.’ On Monday, the Mail reported how Bieber faced a backlash from his fans after the clip of him saying the n-word leaked on TMZ. Showing him the way: Usher took Justin aside and showed him some racist videos to help him understand why his behaviour was so terrible . In hiding: Bieber has holed up at this luxury Mexican villa while he waited for the race row to blow over, it has was revealed . Company: Pals including the R & B singer Khalil were with Bieber at the stunning poolside hideaway . It is . believed that both clips dating back to 2009 are from the same video. They will be seen as likely to prove particularly damaging to his career because of the help . he has received from African-American artists. The Canadian star is signed to RBMG . Records, the label owned by black singer-songwriter Usher Raymond, while . he has performed with a string of black singers and rappers including . Will.i.am, Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne. Bieber apologised for the clip this week, saying that when he was a child he did not realise how certain words could hurt, adding that he had learned from his mistakes. Apologised: The first video showed Bieber in 2009 telling a racist joke but he has apologised . He said: ‘As a kid, I didn't . understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought . it was okay to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realise at the . time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing . the ignorance. ‘Thanks to . friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologised . for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become . public I need to apologise again to all those I have offended. I'm very . sorry. ‘I take my . friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologise . for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable . mistake.

"By . Emma Innes . Women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a child with autism (file picture) Women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism, new research has revealed. The U.S. study supports previous research which has shown that taking SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy increases a woman’s risk of having a child with the developmental disability. Despite the link, researchers say the chances of a woman who takes SSRIs during pregnancy having a child with autism remain very low. For the latest study, researchers at Drexel University, in Philadelphia, analysed large population based registers of nearly 750,000 births in Denmark from 1997 through 2006. They found that about 1.5 per cent of children born to women who had taken an SSRI during pregnancy were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), compared to about 0.7 per cent of children born to an otherwise similar group of women not taking the medication. ‘We found a two-fold increased risk for ASD associated with in utero exposure to SSRIs compared to the unexposed reference group,’ said lead author Dr Nicole Gidaya. Dr Gidaya, added that ‘if the increased ASD risk we saw here is real, it is important to realise that the number of ASD cases that could be prevented by reducing SSRI exposure in pregnancy still represents only a small fraction of overall cases of ASD.’ The researchers also urged people to be cautious about the results as they say it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of the underlying condition and of the medication. ‘As we complete research in our attempts to understand autism’s causes we continue to realise that there are likely many genetic and non-genetic contributors,’ said Dr Craig Newschaffer, director of the A.J. Drexel Autism Institute and professor in Drexel’s School of Public Health, and the study’s senior author. ‘We must begin trying to map these multiple risk factors on to common pathways, so that these pathways can be a focus in our effort to prevent the impairment associated with ASD. 'Pathways involving the brain’s serotonin system are still one viable candidate.’ Some 1.5 per cent of children born to women who took SSRIs during pregnancy develop autism (file picture) The news comes just after another U.S. study suggested that mothers-to-be who take antidepressants may be three times more likely to have a baby boy with autism. Researchers from the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found boys were much more likely to develop autism when their mothers took antidepressants than girls were. They also found that the link between autism and SSRIs was particularly pronounced in children whose mothers took the drugs during the third trimester of their pregnancy.","Mothers-to-be who take SSRIs are twice as likely to have an autistic child .

"By . Scarlett Russell . A British woman has been scarred for life after a temporary henna tattoo left her with chemical burns. Emily Street, 21, from Southampton, now has permanent marks on her hand in the shape of the inking, which took place in Turkey. Now, she is calling for a ban to protect other holiday-makers. Ink for life: Emily Street, left, was left scarred for life on her left hand after having a henna tattoo whille on holiday in Bodrum, Turkey . Scarred: Emily Street is outraged  after a temporary henna tattoo left her with permanent scarring on her left hand, pictured here . Miss Street, who was on holiday with pals in Bodrum, Turkey, said: ‘I hate the way I’ve been scarred. ‘If I wanted a permanent tattoo I would have got one, I can’t believe this has happened. ‘It’s on my hand so it’s not as if I can hide it under clothes. ‘I am angry because it was supposed to be a bit of fun but it ruined my holiday.’ Miss Street was three days into her summer break last month when she decided to get a henna tattoo in a traditional design on her hand. She was inspired by the pop star Rihanna who has a similar marking on her right hand. Star quality: Emily's fake henna hand tattoo was inspired by singer Rhianna, pictured here, who has the inking on her right hand . Works of art: Rhianna's henna tattoos cover her right hand and inspired holidaymaker Emily Street to have a similar design, which left her with permanent scarring . ‘I really like Rihanna’s tattoo but I’d never get a permanent one because of my job,’ says Miss Street, a consultant for a cruise company. ‘So, I decided I’d treat myself to a henna one just for the holiday instead.’ When she saw a local man offering henna tattoos on the beach she decided to go ahead and paid the equivalent of £21. She picked the decorative hand design echoing Rihanna’s famous inking, but just five minutes into the treatment her hand began to itch. ‘First I asked him it was safe and he assured me it was 100 per cent safe,’ she says. ‘He seemed to have already done a few others so I felt comfortable. I had no idea there were any risks because I thought you could just wash them off. Happy holidays! Emily Street, right, with her friend on holiday in Bodrum, Turkey, before realising the temporary henna tattoo she got on her left hand would blister and scar . ‘He was still painting the henna on when it started to itch. I’d never had a henna tattoo before so assumed it was normal.’ Within 30 minutes the design was complete and the henna artist packed up and left, telling Miss Street to wash the paste off in 45 minutes. She followed his instructions but was horrified when, two hours later, white blisters started erupting over her hand. She says: ‘I was desperately trying to wash it off but it was so painful because more blisters were appearing. ‘They started oozing pus and I was terrified of infection.’ The hotel gave her bandages to wrap the wound but she was unable to enjoy the rest of her holiday as she had to avoid the pool and sunlight to minimise the risk of infection. When she returned home she went straight to her GP. He told her she had suffered chemical burns thanks to an ingredient in the henna and would be scarred for life. ‘I now know it’s common for street workers to add a hair dye chemical to black henna to make it stronger and that’s what burns the skin’, she says. ‘I would have gone to a proper salon if I had known the risks that why I want to share my story. ‘The pattern I’ve been scarred with makes it look like I’ve got some kind of skin disease. They shouldn’t be able to get away with it.’","Emily Street, 21 from Southampton had tattoo on holiday in Turkey .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Increasing numbers of iPhone and iPad users are being targeted by hackers who are remotely locking their devices and demanding ransom money in return. Ransomware attacks, in which criminals remotely gain access to a device and hold it hostage, aren’t new, but they have traditionally targeted laptops and PCs. In this latest mobile attack, the hackers are controlling gadgets by breaking into customers' iCloud accounts and remotely locking the devices using the Find My iPhone feature. The alleged ransomware attacks are thought to have originated in Australia, but reports have also been spotted worldwide. Hackers are accessing users' iCloud accounts, stock image pictured, to enable the Find My iPhone feature and remotely get access to any connected devices . Find My iPhone helps users locate and protect their  iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or Mac - if it’s ever lost or stolen. With . Find My iPhone set up on a device, it locates a device on a map, can play a sound to help users find their phone, use Lost Mode to lock and track it, or remotely delete all personal information. With . iOS 7 or later, Find My iPhone includes a feature called Activation . Lock, which is turned on automatically when Find My iPhone is switched on. Activation Lock makes it harder for anyone to use or sell an iPhone, . iPad, or iPod touch if it’s lost or stolen. With Activation Lock, the Apple ID and password are required before anyone can disable Find My iPhone, sign out of iCloud, or erase and reactivate the device. The attacks began last week in Australia, but customers from across the globe have reported the hack on official Apple support forums and tech sites. Based on these reports, criminals are hacking into iCloud accounts from a browser, before locating connected devices using the Find My iPhone feature. In some instances, customers have multiple Apple products including iPhones, iPads, iPods and Macs attached to the same account. The hackers, operating under the name 'Oleg Pliss', are then enabling Lock Mode to shut the devices down remotely. This feature lets people send messages to thieves, for example, letting them know that the phone has been locked. In this instance, hackers are personalising these messages to demand $100 in ransom money to release the devices. The hack only works on handsets that have the Find My iPhone feature switched on, and this is accessible in Settings. Apple told the MailOnline: ‘Apple takes security very seriously and iCloud was not compromised during this incident. The hack only works on handsets that have the Find My iPhone feature switched on, pictured left. Once the Find My iPhone feature is enabled via iCloud, the hackers, operating under the name 'Oleg Pliss' locate the device on a map before selecting Lost Mode, pictured right, and remotely locking the phone . Ransomware is a type of malware that infects a system and prevents the owner from getting access to it. Hackers then demand ransom money for the restriction to be removed. Some forms of ransomware encrypt files on the hard drive, while others lock the system. The malware is usually installed as a trojan, via a downloaded file or security flaw in a program or network. In June last year, security firm McAfee said it collected more than 250,000 unique samples of ransomware in the first quarter - double the number it obtained during the same period the year before. ‘Impacted users should change their Apple ID password as soon as possible and avoid using the same user name and password for multiple services. 'Any users who need additional help can contact AppleCare or visit their local Apple Retail Store.’ To change an Apple ID, go to appleid.apple.com and follow the steps to . reset the password. Users that have a passcode on their iOS devices can remove Lost Mode in Settings, using this PIN. Although the attacks began last week, they show no signs of stopping. They appear to be scam in which hackers are stealing details from other websites and using the same login details to access as many accounts as possible - including iCloud. It highlights, again, the need to have different login details for different accounts.","Attacks are thought to have originated in Australia and spread worldwide .

Last month Microsoft unveiled its new Skype Translator technology, which it claims can decode languages in real time. It means that during video calls, the speech recognition software will allow two callers from different countries to talk with ease. Microsoft first unveiled the technology two years ago. At the time, though, it was deemed too inaccurate to release to the general public. But a recent breakthrough by the Skype and Microsoft Translator teams in neural network-based speech recognition has reduced errors in speech recognition by more than 30 per cent. California-based developers Quest Visual announced the acquisition last month, but did not disclose how much the deal was worth. The app is so popular is was recently showcased by Apple in one of its TV adverts. 'With Word Lens, we've seen the beginnings of what's possible when we harness the power of mobile devices to 'see the world in your language,' the firm said said .

"By . Louise Cheer . Cigarette smoke lingering on the surfaces in the home are posing a serious health risk to babies and toddlers. Cancer Council Queensland released new research on Saturday showing third-hand smoke clinging on to furniture, carpets, walls and children's toys could cause cancer. Third-hand smoke occurs when more than 4,000 chemicals in second-hand smoke reacts to indoor air, remaining on surfaces months after a smoker has lit up. Cancer Council Queensland has found second-hand smoke that reacts with indoor air, dubbed third-hand smoke, is posing a health risk to children . The council's spokeswoman Katie Clift said the threat of third-hand smoke was proven and parents needed to be proactive in making their homes smoke-free. She said the smoke was damaging human DNA, which could potentially cause cancer. 'Chemicals from second-hand smoke stick to curtains, dust, clothing, toys and floors – and can remain in a home as third-hand smoke on surfaces for months after active smoking occurs,' she said. 'Babies and toddlers are at high risk from crawling, putting hands and toys into their mouths and potentially swallowing or inhaling compounds from third-hand smoke. Parents are urged to keep their homes smoke-free for their children who come in contact with the surfaces where third-hand smoke clings to . 'Third-hand smoke can be found in cars, units and homes – anywhere that smoking takes place in an enclosed space, and can even stick to the hair and skin of smokers.' Tobacco-related diseases claim the lives of 15,000 Australians a year despite it being the leading preventable cause of death.","Third-hand smoke is result of second-hand smoke reacting with indoor air .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Take off your helmet and put away your battleaxe - if you really want to live like a Viking you can now buy your own ship. The Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark, is now offering a number of Viking ships for sail, ranging from a ‘modest’ €33,000 (£27,000 and $72,000) to a slightly more expensive €400,000 (£325,000 and $545,000). The longboats are each individually crafted and allow you to experience the sea like the Norse warriors of old. Want to own a Viking ship? Now you can, thanks to a museum in Denmark, which is building authentic longboats (pictured) for anyone who wants to purchase one. They cost up to £325,000 ($545,000) and allow you to enjoy the same mode of transport used by the Vikings 1,000 years ago . The ships are meticulously built to mimic those used by the Vikings who inhabited Scandinavia from about 700 to 1100 AD. Skuldelev 6 . 40 feet (12 meters) long . Seven pairs of oars and sail . €250,000 - €400,000 (£200,000 - £325,000 and $340,000 - $545,000) The Large Gokstad . 33 feet (10 meters) long .

The open decks sometimes supported crews of up to 60 men, ready to plunder various unsuspecting towns before moving on to another target. The replica ships are built in the museum’s boatyard. According to the museum, the price depends on the production method requested. They say they can produce completely authentic longboats built in the same way Vikings would have done over a millennium ago. This includes ‘felling and preparing the timber from the forest, with tools that existed during the Viking area’ they write on their website. For example, the saw was not even invented during the Viking times, meaning they had to build their ships through other methods. However, the museum admits they use a combination of modern and Viking tools to make the ships while still retaining the ‘quality and appearance’ of a ship from the Viking Age. The boats are individually crafted using similar tools and methods employed by the vikings from 700 to 1100 AD. However, the museum admits that some modern tools are used in order to speed up the process slightly as, for example, the saw was not even invented in the time of the Vikings . Viking longboats were swift ships that allowed warriors to quickly mount attacks against coastal towns and villages, plundering what they could and then moving onto the next target before local forces had time to react, making Vikings adept pillagers of their era . ‘Vikings are popular like never before,’ said marketing director at Culture Nordic Anders Røge, reports the Copenhagen Post. ‘That’s why we have no doubt that an authentic Viking ship online will fulfil a childhood dream for private persons and companies - whether it's for a weekend cruise or a spectacular marketing statement.’ Culture Nordic is affiliated with the museum and committed to creating authentic items like this. 'Our philosophy is quite simple. Why buy a plastic sword, when you can . buy a hand crafted, authentic nordic sword for collectors or children – . at the same price?' says the company on their site.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You might think that selfies are only taken by preening teenagers, but they could be taken by hapless thieves too as front-facing smartphone cameras are also being used to fight crime. A San Francisco-based security firm has created a product that will email victims of smartphone theft a photo of the person who has snatched their phone. The photo, known as a ‘theftie’ will also be accompanied by a map of the device’s location, which could be useful if a thief has dumped a valuable device. A San Francisco-based security firm called Lookout has created a product (illustrated) that will send victims of smartphone theft a photo of the person who has snatched their phone. The photo, known as a 'theftie' will also be accompanied by a map of the device's location . Security firm Lookout has introduced Theft Alerts to its anti-theft smartphone product. They provide users with alerts when suspicious activity occurs on their iPhone or Android handset. Thieves often remove a SIM card and turn off a device after stealing it to prevent the owner from tracking it. So the Theft Alert service sends the victim an email with a photo of the thief and a map of the device's location within minutes, to give the victim the best chance of recovering their handset - and with it, private information. Actions that trigger an alert and talk a 'theftie' - a picture of the thief taken with the handset's front-facing camera, - include: entering an incorrect password, removing a SIM card, enabling airplane mode, turning the phone off and removing Lookout. The stolen phone’s camera will be triggered when a thief enters a wrong password, turns the device off or takes out the SIM card - accidentally taking a selfie, which is emailed to the phone's registered owner. Lookout, the company behind the idea, added the new 'Theft Alert' to its premium service, which is designed to be used on iPhones and Android handsets. ‘We are not providing this information for you to go out and find the device yourself,’ Lookout’s product manager Greg Lou said. ‘It is so you can give it to the police so they can find it for you.’ The premium version of Lookout costs $3 a month or $30 for the year and includes features such as backing up data, virus protection and finding lost phones. It is available on Android for £1.99 per month or £19.99 annually and iOS for £1.99 per month or £20.99 annually in the UK. The new capability will let users tell smartphones to send theft alerts if anyone botches a password or puts the device in 'airplane' mode to block network connections. These actions are commonly taken by smartphone thieves to stop an owner tracking their handset. Lookout added the new Theft Alert to its premium service (illustrated) which is designed to be used on iPhones and Android handsets and costs $3 a month or $30 a year. Other features offered include virus protection and ways to locate lost devices . On Android phones, such alerts will instruct front-facing cameras to take photos in the hope of capturing images of culprits. Emails (pictured) include maps of the location of stolen devices as well as 'thefties' if the stolen phone is an Android . The capability referred to by Lookout as taking a ‘theftie’ is not available on Apple devices because the operating system won't allow it, according to Mr Lou. Emails that include maps of the location of stolen devices are sent to owners. In the case of Android, the emails include copies of ‘thefties’ taken with front-facing cameras. Kevin Mahaffey, co-founder and CTO of Lookout, said: ‘From the day we started Lookout, we've dedicated ourselves to fighting smartphone theft. ‘Today, the problem has grown so large that nearly 70 per cent of phone theft victims never get their phone back.

"By . Rob Cooper . A family have been forced to live with a pair of doves who flew in through a window nested on their living room floor because they are a protected species and cannot be removed. David and Angela Blackburn said the birds set themselves up a home inside their four-bedroom property in Nelson, Blackburn, after flying in without them realising. The birds arrived with two eggs which have since hatched and they have now laid a second lot of eggs. We are family: David Blackburn, 57, is unable to remove the doves from his property because they are protected by law - even though they have covered it in their waste . Dove squatters: The birds that moved into Mr and Mrs Blackburn's property in Nelson, Lancashire, are protected by law and cannot be removed . By law the family are unable to touch the nest - even though the doves have covered their property in their waste and feathers. Mr Blackburn, 57, shares the home with Angela, 40 and step-daughter Emma, 18 and his son James, aged eight. He said: 'I’d been airing the spare room with the window wide open. 'Late in the afternoon I heard something and when I went in I was stunned to see the bird sat on top of two eggs which she had laid in an open metal tin. 'She looked at me as if to say ""who the hell are you?"". After that both her and the male bird took turns to incubate the eggs.' David took advice from the RSPB who said as there was no health and safety issue and the eggs were in a communal living area they could not be removed. A spokesman for RSPB, said: 'A nest is such as this is legally protected. It can’t be tampered with, damaged or removed and access can’t be blocked to it. 'There are certain exemptions such as interference with crops and Health and Safety issues. 'If this family believed there was such an issue they could seek recourse through Natural England to see if the nest could be removed.' David said: 'They’ve now become part of the family and are very tame. One of them even runs up my arm and sits on my shoulder. Nesting: The doves have laid two eggs and two chicks hatched. Since then, another two eggs have been laid . 'I think looking after them has been good and also educational for my son James, he feeds them wild bird seed and checks that they are okay. 'It’s funny but the doves arrived on our fifth wedding anniversary and one of the highlights of our big day was releasing a pair of white doves. 'It looks like they’re here to stay in the short term, we’re taking advice on cleaning procedures and we’ve been told that they should take a break from breeding soon.' Such is the family’s attachment to their feathered room-mates that James’ cub-scout group are being asked to give names to the expanding brood. A spokesman for the RSPB added: 'It’s an unusual case but feral doves and pigeons only need a few loose twigs on which to lay eggs. 'They’re not like other breeds which take weeks to build intricate and more sturdy nests.' Part of the family: The doves flew in through an open window and set up a nest so cannot be removed .","Doves flew into family home through an open window six weeks ago .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A lack of empathy is a common trait among psychopaths, but the complex nature of the emotion has baffled scientists for years. Now, researchers from Brazil have not only mapped the areas of the brain affected when we experience feelings of empathy - they’ve also found a way to increase it. Using a combination of brain scans and emotional feedback techniques, they were able to help participants focus on, and develop, feelings of affection and tenderness. Researchers from Brazil have mapped the areas of the brain affected when we experience feelings of empathy, pictured. Using these patterns, and a combination of brain scans and emotional feedback techniques, they were able to help participants develop feelings of affection and tenderness . It is the first time empathetic feelings across the whole brain have been identified using scans. Previous studies have only focused on single brain regions related to specific emotions. The Voigt-Kampff machine was originally referenced in Philip K Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. It later appeared, known as the Voight-Kampff machine, in the 1982 screen adpatation of the book, called Blade Runner. The Voight-Kampff is a fictional polygraph-style machine used in the book and film to determine if someone is human, or an android replicant. It measures reactions, including respiration, heart rate and eye movement, in response to emotionally provocative questions. It is an advanced form of lie detector that measures contractions of the iris muscle and the presence of invisible airborne particles emitted from the body. The machine is often called an empathy-detector because feelings of empathy separate humans from androids. In Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner, based on Philip K. Dick’s science fiction book Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', a similar empathy-detection device were used to measure tenderness or affection felt towards others. Called the Voight-Kampff machine, it was used to distinguish humans from replicants, or androids. To map empathetic feelings, the Brazilian team began by scanning the brains of 25 participants while asking them emotionally-charged questions. Each participant was asked to identify a memory that was important to them, in which they felt feelings of empathy. They were also asked to think of a time they felt proud, and to have ‘neutral’ thoughts without any emotion. Professor Jorge Moll, from the D'Or Institute for Research and Education in Rio De Janeiro, then used computer software to identify patterns in the brain activity linked to each of these emotions. In the 1982 film Blade Runner, based on Philip K. Dick's book Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', a similar empathy-detection device was used to measure tenderness or affection felt towards others. Called the Voight-Kampff machine, pictured with Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, it is used to distinguish humans from replicants . Empathy is the ability to understand or imagine the depth of another person's feelings. It differs from sympathy, which implies pity but felt without considering the other person's feelings. Empathy comes from the German term Einfühlung, meaning to 'feel . as one with'. It implies feeling with a person, rather than feeling sorry for a person. Once the software was trained to pick up on these patterns, the volunteers were asked to control and hold these thoughts and feelings. During tests, each participant was shown a blurry image. Moll then gave each person feedback about how strong their emotion was, based on the real-time brain scans and activity. The more successfully each participant held and developed their feelings of empathy, the clearer the image became. The people who were given feedback on their brain patterns were able to strengthen them, Moll’s team reports in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE. ‘This demonstrates that humans can voluntarily enhance brain signatures of tenderness and affection, unlocking new possibilities for promoting prosocial emotions and countering antisocial behavior,’ they wrote. Moll stressed that the technique needs further work before it can be used to help people with personality disorders and developmental conditions, such as autism. A follow-up experiment will also look at how the brains of psychopaths differ.","Brazilian researchers mapped the brains of 25 participants .

"By . Kate Lyons . Two men saved a toddler from an abduction after he was snatched from his mother while sitting with her in the middle of a Brisbane shopping centre. The three-year-old boy  was sitting with his mother and sibling at a café in the middle of the Lutwyche City shopping centre in Brisbane's north just before 1pm yesterday when a man approached the group and allegedly snatched the child. The mother and child let out a piercing scream and started yelling for help said witnesses. Scroll down for video . Police charged a 29-year-old man with attempting to abduct a three-year-old boy from a busy shopping centre in Brisbane as he sat at a cafe with his mother . Two men pursued the alleged offender and pinned him to the ground until police arrived at the scene . ‘It was random, he wasn’t from the shopping centre, he was just a random guy… He tried to take this little boy. He just went for the attack basically,' said Rita, who did not wish to give her surname, the manager of Valentino's Cafe, where the family were eating when the incident occurred. ‘[The boy’s mother] just screamed out, I think she said “My child”.’ Two men gave chase after hearing the mother's cries and pursued the man for about 30 metres before pinning him to the ground until police arrived. Witnesses told The Courier Mail that the man threw the child to the ground as he ran through the shopping centre. The boy was extremely distressed, screaming out when the incident occurred, said Brian Seo, the  owner of Sandwich City, which is next door to the cafe where the family were eating. 'The boy cried a lot, he couldn't stop for more than ten minutes,' Mr Seo told MailOnline. 'I was very shocked, I couldn't believe what I saw, the guy just looked perfectly normal, I will never understand what he was trying to do.' The mother and her two children were eating at Valentino's Cafe when a man 'just went for the attack', said the manager of the cafe . 'The public is not safe anymore': Brian Seo who owns a cafe next to the one the family were eating at says after the incident he no longer feels safe to bring his children into work . Mr Seo, who has three young children, aged four, two and six months, said he was terrified by the incident. 'People like me who have little children, I feel very scared, the public is not safe anymore. I can't believe it. Sometimes I bring my kids to work, but now I don't think I can.' Mr Seo said praised the two men who chased the alleged offender saying: 'It was the right thing to do.' 'I thank God the boy didn't get taken,' he said. Rita added: 'Thank God it happened here. We’re like a little village and everyone looks out for everyone else.' Simon Brooks, 45, gave chase to the man after he heard the woman's screams, though he was not one of the two men who captured and pinned the man to the ground. He told The Courier Mail that after the man had been stopped he was quite calm as they wait for police. 'He was actually very quiet He didn't say a word until much after when the police were there ... and there were a few of us standing around and he just said something obscene and that was it.' The mother and child were checked by ambulance officers at the scene. A 29-year-old man was charged with one count of child abduction last night and is due to appear before Brisbane Magistrate's Court today.

'This action was NOT sanctioned by the department, the use of the equipment was not approved and the individual firefighters involved behaved inappropriately and outside of the boundaries of department policy, procedures and standing orders.' Hoffman said no firefighters were injured in the incident. But Board of Fire Commissioners Chairman Sam Micklus told nj.com that the incident could easily have left someone dead.

Micklus lambasted the use of public equipment and water for the challenge. 'That's taxpayer money and equipment out the window,' he said. All the firefighters involved were volunteers and not paid members of the department, however. Discipline will range from a verbal reprimand to suspension. Hoffman insisted that most cold water challenge videos are harmless and bring attention and funds to important charities. 'This one just got out of control,' Hoffman said. 'And we're dealing with it.'","The stunt, by volunteer firefighters from Whitman Square Fire Company in Washington Township, New Jersey, was posted on YouTube on May 20 .

"By . Ian Parkes . Jenson Button already has his sights set on coming back with a bang at next month’s British Grand Prix. Despite booking what eventually turned out to be a third-placed finish at the season-opening race in Australia following Daniel Ricciardo’s disqualification, the year has been an uphill struggle for Button and McLaren. The team endured a wretched run of three consecutive races without a point in China, Bahrain and Spain before finally ending their drought last time out in Monaco. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Jenson Button take part in extraordinary car wash . On the up: Jenson Button was back amongst the points in Monaco two weeks ago . As Button concedes, there was 'a sense of relief' in removing that particular monkey from their back, although the veteran knows in finishing sixth, with team-mate Kevin Magnussen 10th, it was just a small step on the road to competitiveness. Button would like to believe there will be further improvement this weekend in Canada - the scene of one of his most spectacular triumphs in 2011 - before moving on to Austria’s return to the calendar, and then more importantly Silverstone. 'The points we scored in Monaco were okay, however the most important thing for us as a team was not how many points we picked up there but the progress,' said Button. 'I feel there is progress being made in the team. The way the car feels is good, and we are going in the right direction. 'It’s still going to take time. We’re not going to set the world alight in Canada this weekend, but hopefully there will be a bit more progression. 'Then we’ve Austria, then Silverstone where it would be nice to have a good package. I think we’ll have some good parts for there.' With Button out of contract at the end of the season, racing director Eric Boullier has hinted another could be in the pipeline given the 34-year-old’s crucial insight in the team’s time of need. Boullier said: 'Despite our current lack of pace, Jenson continues to be an absolutely fantastic ambassador for the team.

Whilst the result in Monaco was a welcome one for Boullier, the Frenchman is fully aware it was also far below what is expected of McLaren. 'Of course it wasn’t nice when we were not scoring any points,' said Boullier. 'But we need to get back to where we should be, which is the most important thing. 'Monaco is a special race, and it was good to be in the points there, but the target is to be in the points every race, and then the big points every race.'","Jenson Button finished third in opening race of the season in Australia .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . An British inventor has designed a new fridge that can keep live-saving vaccines cool for 35 days without power. The appliance is designed for use in the developing world where some remote areas have no electricity, power cuts can be frequent and vaccines are vital for healthy communities. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has donated a $1.4million (£836,000) to help fridge company Sure Chill further develop the potentially life-saving design. Scroll down for video . One cool idea: Inventor Ian Tansley (pictured left) developed the unique cooling technology . which uses water to keep supplies of vaccines cool in remote . medical centres (right). The Sure Chill fridges can keep its life-saving contents cool at a regular 4°C for up to 35 days - even if the temperature outside is as high as 43°C . At 4°C, water is at its heaviest and sinks. This explains why lakes can be frozen but fish can swim beneath the surface. The same concept is used to create the fridge that adapts its temperature naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature - a constant 4°C even without power. Water surrounds a Sure Chill refrigeration compartment. When the fridge is hooked up to a power source, the water cools and forms ice around the compartment to leave only water at four degrees cooling the contents. However, when the power is turned off, the water warms and rises while the ice melts, so that only water at 4°C remains, cooling the contents of the compartment. Ian Tansley of The Sure Chill Company, based in Snowdonia, North Wales, developed the unique cooling technology which uses water to keep supplies of vaccines cool in remote medical centres. ‘The devices will allow vaccines to be stored safely in challenging environments with no power and ambient temperatures as high as 43°C,’ he said. ‘Conventional refrigeration technologies can put vaccines at risk of either freezing or getting too warm.’ ‘Our technology ensures that vaccines reach children in the best condition possible and has the potential to save the lives of countless children across the world.’ At 4°C water sinks and this scientific fact inspired Mr Tansley to create the new refrigeration system that adapts its temperature naturally so it automatically cools to the optimum temperature - a constant 4°C  even without power. This temperature is perfect for storing food and vaccines. Changing lives: The $1.4million (£836,000) cash from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will enable the Welsh firm to start field trials in East and West Africa for the new coolers within the next year. Here, a different model is moved into place at a remote health centre . It works because water surrounds a Sure Chill refrigeration compartment. When the fridge is hooked up to a power source, the water cools and forms ice around the compartment to leave only water at 4°C, cooling the contents. However, when the power is turned off, the water warms and rises while the ice melts, so that still only water at 4°C remains cooling the contents of the compartment. The company said that its fridge has ‘its own internal and entirely natural energy store that maintains a completely steady temperature. The system can operate like this, without power, for days and weeks.’ The invention has received financial backing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to transform people’s lives who are living in poverty without access to adequate healthcare. The $1.4million (£836,000) cash injection will enable the Welsh firm to start field trials in East and West Africa for the new coolers within the next year. The firm already has 10-day vaccine refrigerators operating in over 30 countries - and is recognised by the World Health Organisation.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Crashing waves from storm swells may melt Antarctic sea ice far faster than previously believed. Researchers have found that large ocean waves can flow through ice packs for hundreds of miles before their force is weakened. Experiments . in Antarctica by a New Zealand-led team revealed these wave movements . are strong enough to break up the ice and trigger melting. Scroll down for video . Crashing waves from storm swells may melt Antarctic sea ice far faster than previously believed. Pictured, a  buoy to measure waves in Southern Ocean is lowered on to sea ice . Scientists . positioned sensors at difference distances from the edge of ice packs . and recorded what happened when strong waves roared over the surface. For smaller waves, less than 9.8 feet (3 metres) in height, the up and down movement caused by the waves quickly weakened. But for larger waves, the movement through the ice went on for up to 217 miles (350km). Hydrodynamics . scientist, Dr Alison Kohout, of the National Institute of Water and . Atmospheric Research (NIWA) in New Zealand, said increasing storminess . in the Southern Ocean could accelerate sea ice retreat in the future. On . right a wave sensor buoy sits on sea ice in the Southern Ocean. On the . left, Dr Alison Kohout with two of her wave sensors on the stern of the . Aurora Australis during the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem eXperiment . (SIPEX-II) voyage . Scientists positioned sensors at difference distances from the edge of ice packs and recorded what happened when strong waves roared over the surface . ‘Waves . propagating through the Marginal Ice Zone leave behind a wake of broken . ice floes, which are then more easily broken up and deformed by winds . and currents,’ she said. ‘This . mixing and churning eliminates the sea ice barrier between the air and . the ocean and increases heat exchange between the atmosphere and the . ocean.’ The . MIZ is a region of broken ice floes, hundreds of kilometres wide, that . forms at the boundary of the open ocean and the pack ice. Predicting the scale of ice breakup requires an understanding of how far waves move into it. ‘We . found that the retreat and expansion of the sea ice edge correlated . with significant wave height increases and decreases respectively,’ she . said. The Aurora Australis navigates sea ice in the Southern Ocean. Dr Kohout said that since the days of Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton, it has been known that waves play a role in breaking-up sea ice, but this role has not been well understood . ‘A two metre increase in significant wave height over a decade led to a two degree latitudinal retreat in ice extent.’ Dr . Kohout found that the largest increases in wave height occurred in the . Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, where regional sea ice retreat is well . documented. Similarly, the largest wave height decreases were in the Western Ross Sea, where sea ice has expanded. Dr . Kohout said that since the days of Antarctic explorer Ernest . Shackleton, it has been known that waves play a role in breaking-up sea . ice, but this role has not been well understood. ‘Our . results suggest that sea ice is vulnerable to changes in storminess. The southward shift in storm tracks over recent decades has resulted in . fewer cyclones at mid latitudes and more cyclones at higher latitudes,’ Dr Kohout said. ‘In . the future, wave heights are predicted to increase everywhere at the . sea-ice edge in the Arctic and Antarctica. So it is conceivable that . this will accelerate sea-ice retreat.’ The . Antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new . study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously . believed. The . study reveals that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during . eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a . rapid sea level rise. During . one period 14,600 years ago, melting glaciers released so many icebergs . into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft (2 metres) in just 100 years. The . results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in . Antarctic's and reflect predictions for the region's future. It . also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the West . Antarctic ice sheet has already begun and could be 'unstoppable.' The study was conducted by an international team including researchers from Germany, Canada, Hawaii, Lapland and Australia. Periods of rapid increase in iceberg-rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the Antarctic ice sheet. The . researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight . separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago, and continuing . until 9,000 years ago. Up until now, melting of Antarctic ice sheet wasn't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago.","This is particularly true of waves higher than 9.8ft (3 metres), study found .

(AP Photo/Ron Edmonds, File) First trip: President Barack Obama is seen here with Prince Charles, center, and former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, right, at the 65 anniversary D-Day celebration in 2009 . France's President Nicolas Sarkozy (second from left) speaks with U.S. President Barack Obama, as they walk in front of Britain's Prince Charles (left), Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper (third from left) and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown (second from right) at Colleville-sur-Mer cemetery  before a ceremony to mark the 65th anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 2009 . Before him, presidents acknowledged the D-Day invasion with words or statements, but none made a pilgrimage to the site, not even Dwight Eisenhower, who had been the Supreme Allied Commander who ordered the invasion. Here is a sampling of how presidents observed the key D-Day anniversaries. DWIGHT EISENHOWER, 10th anniversary, 1954 . Issued a statement that reflected the Cold War chasm of the day: 'We see peoples, once bitter enemies, burying their antagonisms and joining together to meet the problems of the postwar world. If all those nations which were members of the Grand Alliance have not maintained in time of peace the spirit of that wartime union, if some of the peoples who were our comrades-in-arms have been kept apart from us, that is cause for profound regret, but not for despair.' Eisenhower did go to Normandy after his presidency, for the 20th anniversary observance. Former President Bill Clinton was in Normandy in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of the invasion of France . Former President George W. Bush, whose father is a World War II hero, went to Normandy for the 60th anniversary commemoration in 2004 . LYNDON JOHNSON, 20th anniversary, 1964 . Johnson, in Washington pushing for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, delivered remarks to members of a D-Day delegation, headed by Gen. Omar Bradley: 'Your country remembers and will never forget, the resolve born on that D-Day, that, so long as we are able, and other men are willing to stand together, we shall not permit the light of freedom to be extinguished on any continent again. ... So let all the world know that when this nation has stood 2,000 years we shall not have forgotten the lands where our sons lie buried, nor the cause for which our sons died. Where we have commitments to the cause of freedom, we shall honor them — today, tomorrow and always.' RICHARD NIXON, 30th anniversary, 1974 . Nixon, in the throes of the Watergate investigation and with impeachment hearings underway, sent General Bradley once again to the ceremonies. Five years earlier, Nixon had issued a proclamation on the 25th anniversary calling the Normandy assault 'a historical landmark in the history of freedom.' He also met at the White House with former war correspondents who were on their way to France for the 25th anniversary observance.

RONALD REAGAN, 40TH anniversary, 1984 . Reagan spoke at the top of the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, the Atlantic Ocean spread behind him and with 62 gray-haired surviving Rangers seated before him. 'They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting, only 90 could still bear arms. 'Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there.' BILL CLINTON, 50th anniversary, 1994 . Clinton attended the 50th anniversary, delivering his remarks at the U.S. Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. His comments offer an ironic reference point to the Europe that Obama faces as he arrives in Normandy on Friday. 'Fifty years later, what a different world we live in. Germany, Japan and Italy, liberated by our victory, now stand among our closest allies and the staunchest defenders of freedom. Russia, decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and cold war, has been reborn in democracy. 'And as freedom rings from Prague to Kiev, the liberation of this continent is nearly complete. Now the question falls to our generation: How will we build upon the sacrifice of D-Day's heroes? Like the soldiers of Omaha Beach, we cannot stand still. We cannot stay safe by doing so. Avoiding today's problems would be our own generation's appeasements. For just as freedom has a price, it also has a purpose, and its name is progress.' American veteran Frederick Carrier reads the names of soldiers who died landing on Utah Beach at Saint Marie du Mont . GEORGE W. BUSH, 60th anniversary, 2004 . Bush went to Normandy in 2002 to observe Memorial Day. He returned for the 60th anniversary, speaking at the U.S. cemetery and accompanied by French President Jacques Chirac. 'All who are buried and named in this place are held in the loving memory of America. We pray in the peace of this cemetery that they have reached the far shore of God's mercy. And we still look with pride on the men of D-Day, on those who served and went on. It is a strange turn of history that called on young men from the prairie towns and city streets of America to cross an ocean and throw back the marching, mechanized evils of fascism.' BARACK OBAMA, 65th anniversary, 2009 . Obama recalled that his grandfather, a 26-year-old supply sergeant stationed near the English Channel, crossed the channel six weeks after D-Day and followed allied forces across France. 'At an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary. ... That is the story of Normandy — but also the story of America; of the Minutemen who gathered on a green in Lexington; of the Union boys from Maine who repelled a charge at Gettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at Inchon and Khe San; of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice.'","Reagan made the first Normandy memorial trip by a U.S. president in 1984, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of D-Day .

"By . Nick Mulvenney . Australia's squad departed for the World Cup on Wednesday and warned their attacking style can cause a shock or two in one of the toughest first round groups. The 27-man party, which will be winnowed down to the final 23 on Monday, were cheered by around a hundred fans at Sydney Airport before they embarked on their flight to Brazil. Coach Ange Postecoglou has selected an inexperienced squad with a smattering of players who will be playing in their third successive World Cup finals. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch the Australia squad depart from Sydney . Bon voyage: Australia's  World Cup squad depart for Brazil at Sydney International Airport on Wednesday . Spring in their step: Socceroos stars Tim Cahill (left) and Jason Davidson (right) depart with the team for Brazil . You're having a scarf: Cahill hands some memorabilia to a fan as the team leave for football's showpiece . Star man: Australia captain and Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak (centre) One of those is midfielder Mark Bresciano, who accepted that Socceroos success over the last decade had raised expectations in Australia even if, at 59th in the world, they will be the lowest ranked team in Brazil. 'It's always a dream going to World Cup, regardless of if it's your first or your third. I'm as excited as 2006,' he told a news conference at the airport. 'We've got a very tough group but we're going to go there and try and do our country proud, and do ourselves proud, and try and shock the world.' With world champions Spain, 2010 finalists the Netherlands and Chile in their first round group, anything other than defeat in all three matches would constitute a surprise.

On the mic: Jade sings for the Socceroos during the draw against South Africa in Sydney . Want to bet? Mark Bresciano (right) tipped Australia to surprise the world during his press conference . Postecoglou, who took over from Holger Osieck last October and set about overhauling the squad, has promised his team will not be looking to grind out results with dogged defence, however. 'If you go with that mentality of parking the bus, eventually you're going to lose the game because the game does go for 90 minutes and teams will eventually break you down,' said Bresciano. 'I think if we are going to have any chance to get a result, we have to attack and try and hurt them.' The 34-year-old former Empoli, Parma, Palermo and Lazio midfielder is one of Australia's injury concerns after a back problem forced him to miss Monday's 1-1 friendly draw with South Africa. Bresciano, who has scored 13 goals in 73 internationals, said he would be back in training in three or four days time and was confident he would be fully fit to face Chile in the opening match of Australia's campaign in Cuiaba on June 13. Bookmakers are offering in excess of 750-1 for Australia to win the tournament, odds which Bresciano thought made a wager worthwhile. 'Put a dollar on it,' he said, with a smile.","Australia squad flew to Brazil for World Cup 2014 on Wednesday morning .

"By . Helen Lawson . 'Generation rent' could lead to the Conservative Party losing crucial support as home ownership becomes a 'relic' of the 1980s, according to experts. The number of 25 to 34-year-olds with a home of their own has fallen from two million to 1.3million in only a decade, the latest figures from the 2011 census show. Levels of home ownership have slumped to just 64 per cent overall, its lowest since the mid-1980s when Margaret Thatcher declared that she wanted more people to be able to buy a house. The number of 25 to 34-year-olds who own their own home fell from 58 per cent to 40 per cent in the 2011 census . Only 40 per cent of young people owned their home in the 2011 survey of households compared with 58 per cent a decade earlier. Two million young adults rented their property compared with 1.5million in 2001. More than 8.3million of the overall population of England and Wales rent their homes - the highest number since 1961 as rising house prices outstrip incomes. Those renting from private landlords or letting agents were up 1.7million to 3.6million compared with the 2001 census, while those in social housing fell by about 100,000 to 4.1million. Nick Faith, of the think tank, Policy Exchange, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Research shows that private renters and people living in social housing are less likely to vote Tory. 'That is why the Government needs to have an honest conversation about the need to build more quality housing, especially in urban and suburban areas. That’s where younger people tend to want to live.' The Office for National Statistics said the new figures, the first to show how many in each age group are renters or homeowners, suggest a decline in the number of first time buyers. The age group with the highest number of homeowners was the 65 to 74-year-olds, where 76 per cent have bought the house they live in. Emma Stone, of the Joseph Rowntree . Foundation, told the newspaper that a million people in 'Generation . Rent' may not be able to buy their own homes until 2020. She . said: 'Margaret Thatcher’s vision for a property-owning democracy . increasingly looks like a relic from the 1980s — unless we address the . chronic shortage of homes to improve affordability and supply.' The breakdown of renters and homeowners came as it emerged that the average UK house price has risen to £168,941, with the London average at an all-time high of £318,214 - 5 per cent above the previous pre-credit crunch peak in 2007. House prices have seen their fastest . rise in almost three years, with a recovery experienced in ten out of 13 . areas of the country. Nationwide, which released the figures, said Government efforts to . kick-start the market, as well as a lack of available homes to choose . from, helped to bolster prices. Official figures last month showed the number of . grown-up children living at home, who are also known as the ‘boomerang . generation’, has jumped by 20 per cent since 1997. The . ONS estimates 1.8million men and 1.1million . women between the age of 20 and 34 are living with their parents. Homeless . charity Shelter told the Telegraph it would take 12 years for a young . family to save for deposit on their first home, double the time for a . child-free couples in their twenties. Over the past year, prices rose 1.9 per cent, pushing the country¿s average to £168,941 . Chief executive Campbell Robb said the Coalition had 'missed an opportunity' in this week's spending review to invest in more affordable housing across the country. He said: 'For successive governments, politicians have claimed that home ownership is a central theme, important for people and communities. 'The trouble is that the rhetoric and reality are further apart than they have ever been.'","Only 40 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds own their own home in census data .

David Luiz says he is leaving Chelsea with 'great sadness' after passing his medical and agreeing terms with Paris Saint-Germain ahead of his £50million transfer. The 27-year-old is set to become the world's most expensive defender, with the move beating the two previous highest fees - both paid by PSG, for Marquinhos and Thiago Silva.

Sportsmail's Lee Clayton and Alex Kay visited David Luiz's home in February 2013 to interview the Chelsea star and QPR goalkeeper Julio Cesar ahead of the England v Brazil friendly at Wembley. Chelsea confirmed the deal on the club’s website on Friday night before Luiz issued a statement expressing his sadness at leaving the Stamford Bridge outfit after almost four years. ‘Thanks Chelsea for the three and half years of great partnership,’ Luiz said. ‘I've made good friends, won many titles and those memories will last with me for ever. ‘I'd like to thank my team mates, all staff and all supporters (my geezers). ‘I'm leaving with great sadness but at the same time excited for the new challenge that lies ahead in this great club in a city that have always enchanted me. ‘It's a new stage, new challenge and together we will go even further. Allez Paris!’ PSG believe they are capturing one of the most stylish defensive players in the world and they are flexing their financial muscle again in what will be the first major transfer of a busy World Cup summer. The previous best deal received by an English club for a defender was when Rio Ferdinand left Leeds for Manchester United for £30m 12 years ago.

Horrific: The message on Facebook translates as 'Son, daddy loves you. Mummy cheated on me and must pay so she will die today'. Friends expressed their horror under the post. One wrote: 'What have you done?' According to police, Nascimento stabbed 23-year-old Juliana Moreira de Melo three times in the neck at their home in Senador Camará, West Rio on June 1. He then phoned a friend who took him to the local police station the following day where he confessed to the crime. Outraged friends of the couple said they tried to call the house several times after seeing the message on Facebook, believing that it was a hoax. They later discovered that Juliana had already died. Detectives said Franque confirmed he had written the message after claiming he had discovered his wife in bed with another man. The couple had been married for three years. The victim’s cousin Mayara Vinicius Melo, 18, said: 'Juliana was not having an affair but she had become really worried about Franque’s behaviour over the last few months. Horror: Franque do Nascimento Santos posted regularly on Facebook alongside his 23-year-old wife (right) 'She said he was acting strange and she was scared of him.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . The family of a schoolboy left brain damaged after an asthma attack have spoken out to warn others of the devastation the condition can cause. Geraint Richards,11, had lived with the 'routine' condition all his life with no previous complications. But his family's life was turned upside down after he suffered a near-fatal attack on the short walk home from school. Tragic: Geraint Richards has been left brain damaged after an asthma attack. His father Chris (pictured) says his son's condition was always 'well controlled' As a team at Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital later battled to bring his condition under control, the youngster suffered a panic attack before later going into cardiac arrest - during which a medical team battled for 14 minutes to revive him. The terrifying ordeal - which happened as his parents Chris and Julie could only watch helplessly - left the schoolboy from Tondu, near Bridgend, with debilitating injuries due to a lack of oxygen. Since the asthma attack on January 31, he has spent three weeks in intensive care at the University Hospital of Wales, a further week on the high dependency unit, and has been at the Noah's ArkChildren's Hospital in Cardiff ever since. His parents, who have barely left his bedside since he first fell ill, say their son faces a long road of rehabilitation and therapy. They have also had to come to terms with the fact their son - as they used to know him - has gone for good. Geraint's father Chris, 44, said: 'He has always suffered with asthma and it was under control. 'Well controlled': Geraint, 11, had lived with the 'routine' condition all his life with no previous complications and took his medication regularly . 'He was under a consultant and he was really pleased with him. In fact, the week before this happened we had discussed the possibility of him being discharged from his regular check-ups because we were worried about him missing school. 'The day it happened was just a normal day - he went to school . 'He rang my wife at about 1pm saying he felt a bit ill . She said she finished work at 2pm and, if he still felt ill, to call her and she would pick him up. 'She never heard from him, so presumed he was okay. But when school finished, he phoned to say he was feeling unwell, his chest was tight and that he'd run out of his inhlaer. 'The school is only a short walk from our home, but by the time my wife got to him in the car, he was practically sat on the floor struggling to breathe. 'She knew straight away it was bad, so she took him to the nearby surgery where she works.' Geraint was put on a nebuliser (a machine that delivers asthma drugs) but when it had little effect, he was rushed to hospital in Bridgend. Emergency: During the asthma attack, Geraint went into cardiac arrest. He was clinically dead for 14 minutes and his brain was starved of oxygen . His father added: 'They tried back-to-back nebulisers and an injection in to the vein, but nothing worked.' By 11.30pm, with his condition failing to improve, an intensive care team was called in to transfer him to Cardiff. But to his family's horror, he went into cardiac arrest and it took a further five hours to stabilise the youngster before he could be transferred. By then, then the attack had had life-changing consequences for Geraint. During a cardiac arrest, the blood supply to the vital organs - including the brain - stops. If oxygenated blood does not get to the brain, there will be neurological damage, which is what happened to Geraint. His father said: 'He's communicating by blinking and making noises, but we hope that one dayhe will get his speech back. 'The only way I can explain it is that he's the same boy with the same memories and sense of humour, but he's trapped in a body that he can't move and he can't talk.' Battle: Geraint's brain damage means he can now only communicate by blinking and making noises. HIs father Chris said: 'He's the same boy with the same memories and sense of humour, but he's trapped in a body that he can't move' A team of brain injury specialists from Tadworth, Nottingham, were due to assess the youngster this week and his parents and older sister Kayley, 18, are hopeful he will eventually regain some mobility and speech. But they are preparing themselves for a long and difficult road ahead. Mr Richards said: 'It's totally turned our lives upside down. Our daughter's been absolutely fantastic and is trying to be so strong, but we don't have any quality time with her. 'The worst bit is that it's so hard to believe that in this day and age that asthma can be so devastating. 'Geraint was just a normal boy who loved his sport, XBox and fishing. But then he was so close to dying. In fact, he was clinically dead for 14 minutes.' The family made the difficult decision to share their story in the same week as the National Review of Asthma Deaths claimed people in the UK are dying unnecessarily as a result of complacency on the part of both medical professionals and asthma sufferers. The study found the UK has some of the highest asthma death rates in Europe and the Richards family are determined to do all they can to improve understanding of the condition. Fight: Medics at Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital (pictured) had battled to bring Geraint's condition under control, but he continued to deteriorate . Mr Richards said: 'There definitely needs to be more awareness, especially among children.Children think they are bomb-proof. 'We've had times with Geraint where we'd say ""have you taken your pump [inhaler]?"" and he'd say ""yes"". 'We'd say ""are you sure?"" and then he'd take it. 'But he was generally really good with it, and this happened to him. On the day it happened he had done everything right, he'd taken his  medication as planned. 'People think it's so routine, but it can turn in an instant and once it gets so far you are in real trouble.'","Geraint Richards had lived with the 'routine' condition all his life .

"By . Katy Winter . A sea of vibrant colour enveloped the mythical Saraswati river at Allahabad as the crowds descended for the Kumbh Mela festival, among them, thousands of holy men and those young people hoping to be initiated into this ancient section of Indian society. The Kumbh Mela, the mass Hindu pilgrimage of faith in which Hindus gather to bathe in a sacred river, takes place every three years, switching between four cities, with last year’s event in Allahabad attracting more than 100 million pilgrims, making it the biggest gathering of humans in history. Now a stunning set of pictures taken by photographer Eric Lafforgue, has opened a rare window into the complex and often hidden world of the religion's holy men or Sadhus who attend the festival. A Naga Sadhu smokes cannibis to expand his mind during the Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, India last year . A young men becoming a Naga Sadhu in one of the thousands of ancient rituals that take place along the banks of the scared river Saraswati . A Sadhu spends his days blessing believers, who come and touch his feet as a sign of respect, and rubbing ceremonial ash on their foreheads . Sadhus must abandon all their material possessions and familial attachments, living a life of poverty housed in temples or caves, starting each day by bathing in cold water, and supported by donations by the devout . A Naga Sadhu with very long hair holds it above his head during the 55 day pilgrimage last year, which occurs every forth year at rotating locations . Recruits are shaven, their hair collected into a ball (right) and buried on the banks of the Ganges to symbolise renouncing of their past life . Last year's event in Allahabad which drew 100 million pilgrims, making it the biggest gathering of humans in history . At 3am in the mornign on the most important day for bathing in the Kambh Mela millions of pilgrims walk towards t he banks of the Ganges. The crowd must always be carefully managed to avoid stampedes . As well as a pilgrimage for the devoted, the Kumbha Mela provides an opportunity for young people to become a holy person and join the Sadhus; devoting their lives to achieving spiritual liberation - the final stage of life according to Hinduism. Those pictured with skulls are known as the Aghori; an intense type of Sadhu who venture far beyond austerity and make it their life's work to overcome taboos, whether by meditating over corpses or even, occasionally, eating human flesh. Others show their allegiance to Hinduism by wearing saffron-yellow longhis (tunics) if they happen to be a devotee of Shiva or yellow and white for Vishnu, and paint their faces with sacred scenes and symbols. Sadhus must abandon all their material possessions and familial attachments, living a life of poverty housed in temples or caves, starting each day by bathing in cold water, and supported by donations by the devout. Important: A pilgrim stands holding a pot of water taken from the Ganges River - one of the holiest places on the planet for people of the Hindu faith .

A Sacred Cow with five legs is displayed to the millions of pilgrims who attended the festival in Allahabad . Devotion: A man shows off his passion for his faith as he breaks into a spontaneous dance during the Kumbh Mela celebrations in Allahabad . Sacred: One of the most important parts of the festival for pilgrims is having the chance to take a dip in the sacred Ganges River . Their quest for spirituality is helped along by smoking cannabis; the scent of which hangs heavy over the Kumbh Mela celebrations as the Sadhus, who are widely respected throughout India, gear up for the the rituals which include bathing in the river. But not every Sadhu completes the same ritual: Hindu worship includes a wide variety of different devotions, depending on the origin of the Sadhu and the guru with whom they trained. While some adopt a life of solitary wandering, others live in communities. Others are known for particular practices, such as the Black Sadhu who, due to their association with the rituals of death are often feared and rumoured to eat human flesh. The fakir, meanwhile, engage in dramatic displays of devotion to their faith, performing feats of endurance such as holding their hand above their head, or standing on one foot for years at a time . At the Kumbh Mela, thousands of recruits undergo initiation to become Sadhus, staying up all night in prayer and group meditation by the banks of the sacred river. Chilly: Pilgrims continue to wander down to bathe in the river late into the night, although many choose to do so fully clothed . Washing: Although sacred, the Ganges is also used for everything from sourcing cooking water to washing saris such as these . Handy: Saris washed in the holy waters of the Ganges are then transferred to the roofs of considerably less sacred cars to dry . Prayer: A man prays as he takes a dip in the holy waters of the Ganges during the Kumbh Mela festival in Allahbad . A young 'black Sadhu' who takes care of cremations.

A Sadhu must begin everyday with a cold bathe before beginning the days chores . A sea of vibrant colour enveloped the mythical Saraswati river at Allahabad as the crowds descended, among them, thousands of holy men . An elephant with its tusks filed down, parades through the streets, ridden by three pilgrims who descended on Allahabad in last years Kumbh Mela . In their quest for liberation and religious illumination these holy men, who are revered throughout much of India, often engage in smoking cannabis or taking other drugs . Ahead of the celebrations, young Sadhu recruits are shaven and their hair rolled into a ball and buried on the banks of the Ganges to symbolise renouncing of their past life. Those who are already initiated spend the 55 days of the Kumbha Mela blessing believers who come to pray for money, health or for their sins to be cleansed. Visitors touch the Sadhu’s feet as a mark of resect and he blesses them, rubbing their foreheads with ceremonial ash, and recieving a donation from the pilgrims in return. To house the millions of visitors, vast temporary camps are erected and as a result, as photographer Eric Lafforgue reveals, in lots of people getting lost in the crowds. ‘All day, loudspeakers blare out names and descriptions of people separated from their friends and family,' he reveals.

"By . Lucy Crossley . Probe: Altaf Hussain, the leader of Pakistan's powerful Muttahida Qaumi Movement, (pictured in September 2010) has been arrested on suspicion of money laundering . Police have arrested one of Pakistan's most well-known and divisive politicians on suspicion of money-laundering, sparking fears of violence in his power base of Karachi where businesses closed early and residents rushed home. Altaf Hussain, the leader of Pakistan's powerful Muttahida Qaumi Movement, or MQM, was being quizzed by police this afternoon, as officers searched the house where he was arrested. Hussain, 60, has lived in self-imposed exile in Britain since 1992, believing that his life would be at risk were he to return, but he regularly addresses large gatherings in Pakistan by telephone link. He is known for his stirring speeches that can whip his followers into a frenzy, and news of his arrest sparked fears of violence in his home base of Karachi. The . Metropolitan police confirmed that a 60-year-old man had been arrested . earlier today when asked about Hussain, but refused to name him. 'Officers have this morning, Tuesday, June 3 arrested a 60-year-old man on suspicion of money laundering,' said a spokesman. 'The arrest took place at a residential address in north-west London. 'He has since been taken into custody at a central London police station and enquiries continue. 'Officers are at present searching the address.' Police officers were seen removing possible evidence from Hussain's large red brick gated home this afternoon. In 2010 another MQM politician, Imran Farooq, was stabbed to death in a daylight street attack in London. The slaying triggered riots in Karachi, where the party has its biggest base of support. Police are yet to charge any suspects over the killing. Hussain's arrest sent shockwaves through Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and economic hub. Investigation: Men believed to be police officers arrive at Hussain's home in north-west London . Immediately after news of his arrest aired on Pakistani television shopkeepers and other business owners closed up and headed home, worried that his arrest could spark a violent backlash. Mohammed Atiq Mir, chairman of the All Karachi Trade Association, said all markets in the city had closed. The British diplomatic mission in Karachi was temporarily closed, and the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad warned American citizens of the possibility of protests and unrest in the city. The embassy said it was cancelling appointments for visas and American citizen services at the Karachi consulate on Wednesday. Questioned: Hussain was being quizzed by police this afternoon, as officers searched the house where he was arrested . Pakistan Railways halted train service in Karachi and the rest of Sindh province for three hours. In the past, demonstrators in Karachi have torched railway cars. 'My wife informed me of the arrest of Altaf Hussain, and everybody in the bank wanted to go home as soon as possible,' said Tariq Ali, a banker in Karachi. Sobia Ahmed, who was waiting for her brother to pick her up, said her mother had called her and demanded she return home immediately. 'We are all aware of the history of this city,' Ms Ahmed said. 'After a major incident the city panics, and agitators rule the streets and roads.' Pakistani commuters are stuck in a traffic jam in Karachi today following the arrest of Altaf Hussain . Pakistani motorcyclists ride past a burning vehicle on a street in Karachi following the arrest of Altaf Hussain . Meanwhile angry protesters in Karachi have torched buses, rickshaws and a car following the arrest of Hussain. At least six buses, five auto-rickshaws and one car were destroyed, they said. A senior MQM official, Nadeem Nusrat, appealed for calm. 'We appeal to all the workers to control your emotions,' he said. However, despite the appeal there were . reports of scattered violence across the city, according to senior police officer Pir . Muhammed Shah, who said some vehicles had been burned and there . were reports of people firing guns into the air. Pakistani paramilitary soldiers patrol alongside a burning vehicle on a street in Karachi following the arrest of Altaf Hussain . Unrest: Pakistani motorcyclists ride past a burning vehicle on a street in Karachi . MQM condemned the violence and said in a statement that the people behind it were not related to the party. Authorities have beefed up security at various parts of the city and at diplomatic missions, Mr Shah said. Mr Nusrat said Hussain had been feeling unwell and was about to go to a hospital for medical tests when detectives arrived at his home with a search warrant. The MQM, formed in 1984, largely represents descendants of Urdu-speaking migrants from India who settled in Pakistan when it was created in 1947. The party portrays itself as a moderate and secular force. However, it has often been accused by competitors of using violence.

"By . Sam Webb . Ukraine's police and intelligence service accused Russia of staging a fatal shooting incident on Sunday in which pro-Moscow separatists were killed in the east of the country. 'Armed lawbreakers and saboteurs who are terrorising the local population around Slaviansk... have turned to cynical provocation,' the SBU security service said in a statement, describing the incident as a 'staged attack'. No group was present 'other than the saboteurs and crime figures, supported and armed by officers of Russia's GRU' military intelligence, the SBU added. The Ukrainian nationalist group Right Sector, blamed by separatists for the shooting, denied involvement and also accused Russian special forces. Russia has accused Ukraine of failing to protect civilians in the Russian-speaking east and has threatened to intervene on their behalf - as it did before annexing Crimea last month.

The Ukrainian Interior Ministry noted . that its police were unable to operate in Slaviansk since pro-Moscow . gunmen took over the town earlier this month.

Three separatists were . killed, two locals and a third as yet unidentified. Three were wounded. About a dozen attackers took off in two cars, carrying an unknown number . of dead and wounded. The Interior Ministry said none of its forces . had mounted an operation overnight around Slaviansk, which it described . as 'the most dangerous place in Ukraine, in view of the presence in the . town of foreign saboteurs and illegal armed groups'. 'At the same . time,' it added, 'One cannot but suspect the speed with which camera . crews from Russian TV stations appeared at the scene of the shooting, . and the obviously staged subject matter of news reports in the Russian . media.' It noted that the news was broken by media run by Dmitry . Kiselyov, a journalist who is close to Russian President Vladimir Putin . and who, the ministry noted, is the subject of visa bans imposed by the . United States and EU as part of sanctions aimed at punishing Russia for . annexing Crimea. In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said an unspecified number of innocent civilians were killed in the attack by armed men from 'Right Sector,' a far-right nationalist group which figured prominently in the overthrow of Moscow-backed president Viktor Yanukovich in February. 'Russia is indignant about this provocation by gunmen, which testifies to the lack of will on the part of the Kiev authorities to rein in and disarm nationalists and extremists,' the statement said. It said it was a source of surprise that the incident had happened after Russia, the European Union, the United States and Ukraine signed an April 17 accord in Geneva calling on people to desist from using violence or intimidation.

The breakthrough peace agreement is being ignored as armed pro-Russian separatists repeatedly refused to recognise its terms. The separatist leaders ridiculed the deal, which was brokered by the US, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union in Geneva. Branding Ukraine’s Western-backed interim government ‘illegal’, they insisted that they would not comply with its terms unless they were granted further concessions and guarantees.

"By . Louise Boyle . The youngest sister of Nicole Brown Simpson has opened up about her sister's brutal murder after 20 years and revealed the moment she knew that the man she called 'Uncle OJ' was responsible for her death. Tanya Brown, now 44, described how her family's lives were forever shattered on the morning of June 13, 1994, when they found out that Nicole, recently divorced from OJ Simpson, had been stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home along with her friend Ronald Goldman. She said the grief-stricken family watched on TV as her sister's bloodied corpse was loaded into a van to be taken to the morgue. Ms Brown said she held her mother's shaking hands as she wept: 'That's my kid.' Scroll down for video . Tanya Brown, the sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, said her family's lives were turned upside down following her siblings murder 20 years ago and the subsequent trial of Nicole's ex-husband OJ Simpson . OJ Simpson and his wife Nicole Brown Simpson, pictured in October 1993, eight months before she was stabbed to death outside her LA home along with friend Ronald Goldman . O.J. Simpson accompanying his children, Sydney, nine and Justin, six, as they leave the funeral services for his ex-wife, Nicole Simpson, June 16, 1994. A day later, he was charged with their mother's murder . Ms . Brown said that at first she did not suspect Simpson, the former . football player turned actor, whom she knew as a beloved brother-in-law. Simpson and Ms Brown married in 1985 and had two children Sydney and Justin. In 1989, the former football player pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson. They divorced in 1992. After her sister's death, Ms Brown said she was exposed to the . harrowing truth - that Simpson was a violent man who had mentally and physically abused her sister . for years. In the days following the murders, the net began to close on Simpson, now considered the prime suspect. On June 17, the day that Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police on murder charges, the . former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit . in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California. Tanya Brown revealed to People . that during this bizarre car chase, which was broadcast to millions on live TV across the major networks, her . father and elder sister Denise were on the phone trying to talk Simpson . out of killing himself as he rode along with a gun to his head. Ms . Brown told the magazine: 'What many people don't know is that he called . us during the chase and Denise and my dad tried to talk him down. '''Don't . do it, Juice!'' Daddy urged him, trying to get him to put the gun down . and pull over. ''Think of your two kids, Juice! Don't do it!''' Simpson finally surrendered to police and was jailed awaiting trial. The body of Nicole Brown Simpson is removed from the scene of her brutal murder in June 1994 . Ms Brown also revealed that a few days after he was put behind bars, Simpson called to speak to her. Simpson asked Tanya if she knew that he loved her sister and 'would have taken a bullet for her'. Conflicted about Simpson's role in her sister's brutal death, Tanya . tried to change the subject and told her former brother-in-law about her . friend's father who was dying of a brain aneurysm.

"By . Emma Innes . Former footballer Mark Bright said: 'Now we know that one in four black men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some time in his life, we owe it to ourselves and our loved ones to take responsibility for our health' One in four black men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime - double the figure for all men. Prostate Cancer UK said the calculation was based on genetic risk and the fact that black men did not always approach their GP with symptoms. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and over 40,000 are diagnosed with the disease every year in the UK. There are currently more than a quarter of a million men living with the disease or after the disease, and it kills more than 10,000 annually. When symptoms occur, they include a weak urine flow, needing to urinate more often, especially at night, and a feeling that the bladder has not emptied properly. Some men have difficulty starting to pass urine while others dribble after they have finished. Other men need to go to the toilet urgently. The chance of developing prostate cancer in a lifetime is one in eight for all men, rising to one in four for black men. Cordwell Thomas, who works with Britain's two million people from African and African Caribbean communities for the charity, said: ‘It's like Russian roulette but with only four players chancing the bullet. ‘This statistic is a wake-up call to black men about the unique danger they face - and we're warning them to act on it. ‘Fathers, brothers, partners, sons - with every fourth black man or boy in the UK destined to get this potentially fatal disease at some time, it's vital that everything possible is done to identify and catch aggressive cancers early.’ Mr Thomas said many health professionals were not even aware that black ancestry was a prostate cancer risk factor. ‘What's more, black guys often don't claim their rights to health care,’ he said. ‘They're not first in line to see the GP or to call our helpline to discuss concerns like erectile dysfunction or problems peeing. ‘With so many lives at risk, we all have to work together to ensure that black men wise up to the issue and those affected seek and receive appropriate healthcare.’ Prostate cancer (pictured) is the most common cancer in men and over 40,000 are diagnosed with the disease every year in the UK . He said men aged over 50 were entitled to an NHS prostate cancer test even if they had no symptoms. Former footballer and sports pundit, Mark Bright, said: ‘I'm a black man and I am over 50. ‘My risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer is significantly higher than that of a white man of the same age. ‘Now we know that one in four black men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some time in his life, we owe it to ourselves and our loved ones to take responsibility for our health and understand our risks. ‘If you're a black man and over 50, speak to your GP or call the Prostate Cancer UK helpline to find out about your risk and what you can do about it.’","Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men and 40,000 are diagnosed every year in the UK - 10,000 die of the disease every year .

"By . Louise Boyle . Kim Goldman has revealed that she had the opportunity to kill OJ Simpson a year after he was acquitted of her brother Ron Goldman's murder . The sister of Ron Goldman, who was brutally murdered along with OJ Simpson's ex-wife, has made the shocking revelation that she almost killed OJ Simpson in revenge. Kim Goldman revealed this week how she came within inches of taking out Simpson a year after he was found not guilty of stabbing to death her brother and Nicole Brown Simpson. Kim Goldman told the National Enquirer: 'In 1996, (Simpson) walked in front of me while I was driving my car. 'I thought ''I can kill him, right here, right now.'' I never thought ''avenger'' and ''assassin'' were words to describe me, but in that moment they were.' As she revved her car's engine and looked straight at Simpson, Ms Goldman's feelings of rage ebbed away. She said: 'I am not a killer, and he is. I have appropriate hatred toward the man who stabbed my brother in the hear and left him for dead!' The 43-year-old mother-of-one, who lives in Valencia, Caifornia, is the director of the nonprofit SCV Youth Project, which provides counseling and support for young people. Her e-book on the murder of her brother, Ronald was published on Tuesday. Her memoir, Can’t Forgive: My Twenty-Year Battle with O.J. Simpson, chronicles her decades-long legal pursuit of Simpson. In the book, Ms Goldman admits that she dreams about torturing Simpson. Simpon's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, a waiter, were stabbed to death outside her Brentwood home on June 12, 1994. In the days following the murders, the net began to close on Simpson, considered the prime suspect, after it emerged that his wife has suffered mental and physical abuse at his hands for years. On June 17, the day that Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police on murder charges, the . former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit . in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California. Simpson finally surrendered to police and was jailed awaiting trial. The internationally publicized trial of . O.J. Simpson lasted one year and was dubbed the 'trial of the century'. O.J. Simpson at his sensational murder trial in 1995 where he tried on a pair of gloves to show they don't fit after one was found at the crime scene . Nicole Brown, 35, was stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home 20 . years ago along with friend Ronald Goldman who was visiting her . Kim Goldman has released a book about her brother Ron's murder 20 years on . Ms Goldman writes in her memoir how she attended every day of Simpson's murder trial and the stress almost drove her to suicide. She said that only the thought of her father Fred, struggling with the weight of his own grief, pulled her back from the brink. In 1995, Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and Mr . Goldman. The 43-year-old said that watching Simpson go free left her feeling furious and betrayed. Ms Goldman, who at the time was dating First Lady Hillary Clinton's make-up artist, said that her boyfriend conveyed messages of support from the White House. She wrote in her book that Mrs Clinton passed messages of sympathy to her family and that when the Goldmans went to meet President Clinton, he said that was proud of how they had conducted themselves throughout the trial. Following the criminal trial, the Goldman and Brown families pursued Simpson in civil court for $33.5million in damages and won. The families have only see around 1 per cent of the money - but Ms Goldman says she will never stop trying to get the award from Simpson, not because they want to be rich but because she wants to leave him destitute. In 2008, Simpson was found guilty of . kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges in what he said was an . attempt to retrieve memorabilia and personal items from two sports . collectibles dealers in a casino hotel room. Ms Goldman said that this news left her rejoicing that Simpson's bad karma had finally caught up with him. Simpson . was sentenced to between nine to 33 years in Nevada state prison. Ms Goldman sent him a card when he was jailed which read: 'Congratulations on your new home. Hope you enjoy your new digs! From the Goldman family.' Simpson, now 66, was granted parole on some convictions last July however he must serve . at least four more years. His conviction came 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of his ex-wife and Mr Goldman's murders. Ms Goldman, who only refers to Simpson as 'The Killer' in her writing, says that her only relief now will come from his death. However she told SignalSCV that writing her book has brought with it a peace of sorts. 'Writing has been important to me in finding my voice and taking back control of my life,' she said. 'I wanted people to know the parts of me that are important and strong, rather than (the victim).'

"By . Sophie Borland . A businessman has become the first man to have his prostate removed after discovering he was carrying a faulty gene that raises the risk of cancer. The 53-year-old was told he had the rogue BRCA2 gene after taking part in a clinical trial at the Institute of Cancer Research in London. Last week Angelina Jolie revealed that she had had a double mastectomy after discovering that the BRCA1 gene gave her an 87 per cent risk of developing breast cancer. Scientists believe that other men who know they are carriers will choose to go down the same route (stock image) Both the BRCA2 and BRCA1 genes have long been known to increase the risk of breast and ovarian forms of the disease but recent research has also linked them to the prostate. The businessman, who has not been identified but is married with children and lives in London, has other family members who have suffered breast or prostate cancers. Although his prostate appeared to be perfectly healthy, he was anxious to have it removed to avoid the same fate. However, doctors were reluctant to operate because the procedure leaves men infertile and can cause permanent incontinence and sexual dysfunction. An MRI scan and a prostate-specific antigen test – which detects raised levels of a protein linked to cancer – also showed no sign of defects. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the UK, with over 40,000 new cases diagnosed every year. Prostate cancer usually develops slowly, so there may be no signs you have prostate cancer for many years. Symptoms . often only become apparent when your prostate is large enough to affect . the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the . penis). When this happens, . you may notice things like an increased need to urinate, straining while . urinating and a feeling your bladder has not fully emptied. However, . these signs do not mean you have prostate cancer. It is more likely . they are caused by something else, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia . (also known as BPH or prostate enlargement). NHS Choices . The doctors only agreed when a tissue sample taken from the gland showed microscopic malignant changes which could be the first indication of cancer. Professor Roger Kirby, the surgeon who carried out the procedure, said he would still have refused to do it had the patient not also had the faulty BRCA2 gene. The professor, one of the world’s leading prostate  surgeons, said he is expecting more healthy men to come forward if they discover they are carrying one of the faulty genes. ‘The relatively low level of cancerous cells we found in this man’s prostate before the operation would these days not normally prompt immediate surgery to remove the gland, but given what we now know about the nature of BRCA2, it was definitely the right thing to do for this patient,’ he said. ‘This patient is now absolutely fine. A number of these BRCA families have now been identified, and knowing you are a carrier is like having the sword of Damocles hanging over you. ‘You are living in a state of constant fear. I am sure more male BRCA carriers will now follow suit.’ About one in eight men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime and there are about 41,000 new cases in Britain each year. The . disease causes just under 10,500 deaths annually, but often it is so . slow-growing that patients die from another cause first. Angelina Jolie chose to have a double mastectomy as her chance of developing breast cancer was very high . Last month a study of more than 2,000 men by the Institute of Cancer Research found that men with defective BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes were a third more likely to be  diagnosed with late-stage prostate cancer. They were twice as likely to have an earlier form of the disease that had spread and tended to live half as long as men without the inherited faulty gene. Other studies claim affected men are up to four times at risk of cancer. Hollywood star Miss Jolie, 37, wrote an article in the New York Times last week explaining how she’d had both breasts removed to reassure her six children the illness wouldn’t claim her life. The Oscar-winning actress described the heartache of losing her mother Marcheline Bertrand at the age of 56 after fighting ovarian cancer for almost a decade.","Businessman had an increased risk of cancer through the BRCA2 gene .

Sleeping four to a makeshift bed, in a sparsely furnished room these pictures portray an image of home life that is alien to us in the affluent and relatively peaceful western world. But compared to some of their friends and loved ones, perhaps these youngsters count themselves as the lucky ones. For they have escaped the bloody civil war that has raged in Syria for more than two years and claimed the lives of an estimated 93,000. They are among an estimated 1.6million who have crossed borders into Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and Egypt to escape the terrible violence that has ripped their lives apart.

Charity Save The Children has . released these haunting images taken by award winning photographer Moises Saman and a report describing how injured and . dehydrated adults and children have been dying at the side of the road . while trying to make their escape from the country. The release of the report coincides . with World Refugee Day and the charity hopes they will raise the profile . of the plight faced by Syrian children and their families. Some of the most graphic reports . released by the charity include a 12 year-old boy – whose mother had . been shot - being left to bleed to death with insect-eaten shrapnel . wounds as the group he was with were forced to abandon him and run for . their lives.

He said: 'Hundreds of people were injured on the road, but we couldn't take them all, we had to leave them there. 'People died on the journey, and when . they did, we could not even bury them because the ground was too hard . to dig a hole in. So instead we collected stones to cover their bodies.'

The number of people in need of . refugee assistance from Syria has increased on average by close to a . third each month for the past year. Were that trend to continue, Syria . would be emptied of civilians by as early as April 2014. Save the Children CEO Justin Forsyth . said: 'The horrific stories we’ve gathered from refugees over the past . few days show how children are bearing the brunt of the Syrian conflict. 'Children in Syria are being killed, . tortured, recruited as soldiers and abused in horrifying numbers. Children are being separated from their parents, and some are dying . alone at the roadside from their wounds. 'Meanwhile conditions are proving too . much for the weakest and most vulnerable babies. Millions of children . are beyond the reach of humanitarian aid and have no option but to flee. 'Over half of all Syrian refugees are . children and behind the frankly terrifying statistics of civilians . fleeing their country are millions of individual tragedies.

Peaceful: These two young Syrian children manage to find a safe place to sleep despite their family not having a proper home to call their own . Keeping warm: Faysal, six, is pictured waking up inside his family's tent a settlement in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon . 'Ultimately the only solution to this . crisis is an end to the violence in Syria, but in the meantime, we . urgently need to be able to reach those trapped inside Syria. Unless we . can, I am afraid we will hear more horrifying stories of children forced . into ever more desperate circumstances.' Children inside Syria are especially . vulnerable to the worst atrocities of the crisis. Those who manage to . escape often lack access to schools and safe places to play and are . frequently living in cramped, overcrowded conditions. As well as working with refugee . communities in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, Save the Children is working . across Syria to bring vital humanitarian aid to the most vulnerable . communities.

"By . Emma Reynolds . A search and destroy mission off the coast of Australia is continuing after a surfer died when he was bitten in half by a Great White shark. The operation was started at the weekend following the death of 24-year-old Ben Linden on Saturday. Yesterday, Western Australia called on the federal government to lift a ban on hunting Great Whites after the fifth death in its waters within a year. Fisheries Minister Norman Moore said the spate of attacks was 'cause for great alarm' following Mr Ben Linden's death. Scroll down for video . Tribute: Family and friends held a beach and sea memorial for 24-year-old surfer Ben Linden . Dangerous waters: There have been numerous shark attacks on the western coast of Australia . Mr Moore said it was time to reassess . population numbers and plans to write to the federal government about . the great white's protected status. Mr Linden was killed by the 15-foot-long great white near remote Wedge Island, 100 miles north of Perth. Divers Dave Richards and Nathan Podmore were also attacked by a shark when they went spearfishing off the western coast of Australia at the weekend. The episodes have cemented the west coast's reputation as the world's deadliest shark attack zone, according to The Independent. Mr Linden's girlfriend of eight years, Alana Noakes, left a moving tribute on the cabinet maker’s Facebook page, recalling how he was ‘the most amazing man’ who ‘lit up the lives of all who knew him.’ Jet skiier Matt Holmes, 23, said he was towing a surfing friend along when he saw the attack. 'I . just took my mate straight to the shore and went straight out and there . was just blood everywhere and a massive, massive white shark circling . the body. ‘By the time I got out there half of him had been taken. ‘I tried to lean off the side and . pull him on the back, but as I did that the shark came back and nudged . the jet ski to try to knock me off. ‘When I came back the second time, he took the rest of him. ‘I just thought about his family and if he had kids. I just wanted to get him to shore. I gave it everything I had.’ In Australia as a whole, an average of one person a year is killed by sharks. But Martin Garwood, a senior aquarist at the Sydney Aquarium, said the spike in attacks is probably the result of human population growth and the increasing popularity of water sports in isolated locations, rather than a rise in shark numbers. Deadly: Mr Podmore pokes his spear gun in the direction of the shark as its eye glistens in the water . The government's response to the latest attack was condemned by Janita Enevoldsen of the Wilderness Society, who said: 'We need to really understand them [the sharks], and not resort to the Neanderthal reaction of a hunt and kill.' Mr Moore agreed that more research was needed to plot the sharks' migration and feeding habits. An acoustic tagging programme introduced by the WA government last year - the first of its kind in the world - has revealed that they sometimes linger for months off the west coast. He said: 'We have allocated some A$14m [£9.2m] … to get a better understanding of the great white sharks and the reasons why fatalities are occurring. I wonder if research might tell us that there are now much greater numbers of great whites than ever before.' Mr Linden's remains have not been found, despite police and volunteers scouring local beaches.

"By . John Hall . Belief: Mr Justice Peter Jackson (pictured) ruled the parents were not to blame for their daughter's death and 'deserved to be believed' A father accused of suffocating his baby daughter by rolling onto her as they slept can be reunited with her twin after a judge ruled that the sister should not be removed by social services. The 'intelligent' middle class father came under suspicion following the death of his 16-week-old daughter last year, with Lancashire County Council leading the case against him. His dead daughter's identical twin sister was temporarily removed from the family home but following an in-depth inquiry, Mr Justice Peter Jackson has now cleared him of all blame. Lancashire County Council pointed the finger at the father after social workers highlighted the fact that the twins' older sister - identified in court only as 'K' - had been taken to hospital with a serious head injury in 2011. They argued that the father and the children's mother 'knew more than they were saying' about how 'K' suffered a fractured skull. However, . following an in-depth inquiry, Mr Justice Peter Jackson ruled that the . parents were not responsible either for K's injury or the death of her . little sister - identified as 'L'. The judge ordered that both 'K', now aged three, and the surviving twin be restored to their parents' care. Describing the couple as 'very close, intelligent, hard-working and aspirational', the judge said they were of good character and 'deserved to be believed'. Social workers claimed that 'L' 'probably died as a result of her father lying on her when he was sleeping on the same sofa'. It was suggested that the father had covered up the baby girl's 'accidental suffocation' by placing her in her rocker after her death. The mother accepted that the twins' sleeping arrangements on the night of 'L''s death was 'not the greatest idea'. But the couple otherwise disputed every part of the council's case during an eight-day High Court hearing. Accused: The 'intelligent' middle class father came under suspicion following the death of his 16-week-old daughter last year, with Lancashire County Council (headquarters pictured) leading the case against him . The judge said a postmortem had recorded the cause of 'L''s death as 'unascertained'. He accepted that the parents' account of what happened could not be 'accepted without question' and 'acknowledged the possibility that they have put their heads together to cover up a case of overlaying'. However, he ruled: 'For the father to have placed 'L' in her rocker, knowing that she was moribund, and then gone to bed would be extremely out of character. There is no reliable evidence that he did this. 'My conclusion is that we simply do not know when or why 'L' died. Nor has it been proved that either of the parents knows. 'A finding against the parents would be based on speculation or suspicion, which would be impermissible and wrong.' 'The sleeping arrangements that were made for such small babies were obviously unwise, but that does not cross the threshold for intervention.' The council insisted that one or both of the parents knew how 'K' was injured but that they were intent on 'concealing' the truth. However, the judge said: 'With some hesitation I find that the parents' account of events can be accepted. 'I cannot conclude that it is more probable than not that they are concealing a known incident.' The judge concluded: ""I therefore find that the grounds for making care orders do not exist. 'In consequence, the children will return to the care of their parents.'","'Intelligent' father came under suspicion after 16-week-old daughter's death .

"By . Catherine Fegan . 'Suffering': John McAreavey, pictured with Michaela on their wedding day, cried in court as closing statements were made during her murder trial . The widower of a bride who was murdered on their honeymoon broke down into tears as a lawyer hit back at 'grotesque theories' put forward by the defence of her alleged killers. John McAreavey and Michaela Harte had been married only 12 days when she was found strangled in the bathtub of their luxury hotel on the paradise island of Mauritius. Two hotel employees are accused of murdering 27-year-old Mrs McAreavey when she returned to the couple’s room at the exclusive beachside complex and caught them stealing. Lawyers defending former hotel workers Avinash Treebhoowoon and Sandip Moneea had drawn the jury’s attention to a sex guide in the couple’s room and made references to sado-masochism. However, it later turned out that this was a free insert in a popular women’s magazine. Michaela’s’s widower Mr McAreavey sat bent over, looking at the floor, as prosecutor Medhi Manrakhan told jurors these were ‘insulting’ innuendos that had been raised and cynically dropped by the defence. As the murder trial in the Supreme Court drew towards its close after 30 days, the strain became too much for the young widower. At one point during the prosecution’s 90-minute closing speech, he appeared to discreetly wipe away tears, his head shielded from the view of the jurors by the bench in front. Mr Manrakhan told the court: ‘The person who has suffered the most on all of this, as if he hasn’t suffered enough after the death of the love of his life, Michaela, is John McAreavey, . ‘I am duty-bound to speak about the manner in which fingers have been constantly pointed at John McAreavey in the most unbefitting manner.’ He said several ‘grotesque theories’ had been aired, including questions about erotic asphyxiation and the possible use of a belt found among the McAreaveys’ possessions. John McAreavey pictured at the Port Louis court: He and Michaela Harte had been married only 12 days when she was found strangled . Witness: Mr McAreavey arrives at court to give evidence at the trial in the island's capital, Port Louis . Accused: Avinash Treebhoowoon (left) and Sandip Moneea (right) are standing trial for Michaela's murder . Accused: Flanked by police officers, Avinash Treebhoowon, 30, (right) and Sandip Mooneea, 42, arrive at Court. They are accused of murdering Mrs McAreavey when she returned to the room at the exclusive beachside complex and caught them stealing . Mr Manrakhan also referred to the ‘infamous’ CCTV footage that the defence had implied showed John and Michaela arguing at the hotel reception shortly before the killing. However, police later came to court with proof the couple in the video were German holidaymakers. All the defence theories were fortunately ‘short-lived’ and had been abandoned ‘one after the other’ when it became clear they were unfounded, Mr Manrakhan told the Supreme Court in Port Louis. He contrasted their behaviour with the straightforward way Mr McAreavey, a Down GAA player, had given his testimony. ‘He came all the way from Ireland with his family to seek justice for the wrongful murder of his wife,’ he said. ‘He came and told us about how they met… about the fairytale wedding, about the house they had bought together and never got to share and John told us that his life ended when her life ended.’ The defence’s case could only have confused the jury and was ‘very insulting to John and his family and to the memory of Michaela’, Mr Manrakhan added. Mr McAreavey kept his head bowed for most of the speech. Michaela’s brother Mark Harte looked down helplessly at the young widower as he was forced to relive the darkest moments of the trial. It was only when Mr Manrakhan finished his address ten minutes later that Mr McAreavey finally sat back upright, taking a deep breath and appearing to compose himself. Happier times: Michaela and John with her father Mickey Harte, left, Bishop John McAreavey and the groom's father Brendan McAreavey at their  wedding at St Malachy's . The lawyer, who described the trial as the most taxing and challenging of his career, had told the nine jurors the evidence could leave them in no doubt that the two accused were responsible for the killing. The prosecution case is that when Michaela went to get a biscuit to go with her tea, she interrupted the two men stealing from her room and was strangled. ‘This was a robbery that turned into a brutal murder,’ he said. ‘It would have been easier for the two accused to beg forgiveness from Michaela and to walk away. The worst that could have happened would have been the loss of their jobs. But they decided to murder her. This shows that they both possess killing instincts and have no respect for human life.’ Michaela, the daughter of Tyrone Gaelic football boss Mickey Harte, was found strangled in her room in January last year. Moneea, 43, a former floor supervisor from Petit Raffray, and Treebhoowoon, 32, a former room attendant from Plaine des Roches, deny murdering the 27-year-old. Michaela’s brother and the McAreaveys – John, his sister Claire and father Brendan – had remained out  of court on the day details from the post-mortem report were revealed. Yesterday was the first day they heard the graphic details of the injuries she sustained at the hands of her killer. Her brother dropped his head and hid from view as the court heard of Michaela’s desperate attempts to fight for her life. Earlier, Mr Manrakhan said the police deserved praise rather than criticism for ‘solving the case in record time’. Referring to the defence’s contention that officers ‘bungled’ the inquiry, he said that it was not for the jury to adjudicate on the police. Treebhoowoon’s lawyers had argued that his confession to the murder had been extracted by torture. Nightmare in paradise: The couple's room at Legends Hotel in Grand Gaube, Mauritius . Luxury holiday: A view of the swimming pool at the five-star Legends Hotel in Mauritius, where the newlywed couple were staying . On trial: A sobbing Treebhoowoon pictured arriving at court earlier in the trial. He pleaded not guilty to the killing . However, Mr Manrakhan said that this had been disproved and that the accused had ‘come before you and regurgitated a concocted and rehearsed story’. Evidence from three doctors who examined him in January last year ‘confirmed that the allegations of police brutality were totally unfounded’, the lawyer said. He also reminded the jurors that Ravi Rutnah, who was acting for Mr Treebhoowoon, had withdrawn from the trial early on and had never come back to support his claim that his client was abused. Previously, the court heard Treebhoowoon had given a statement saying he and Moneea were both in the couple’s room stealing when Michaela walked in and that Moneea had killed her. Moneea’s lawyers had claimed he was on the phone to his sister at the time of the killing but the prosecutor questioned why he had waited 18 months to give this explanation and said the call did not appear in any  of the statements from the time. The defence’s theories about the McAreavey’s belt had been disproved by the chief police medical officer. Dr Sudesh Gungadin had told the trial: ‘I am 100 per cent sure. No belt could have been used.’ Mr Manrakhan said the fact there was no DNA or fingerprints from the accused in the couple’s room did not mean the men had not been there. He said expert witness Susan Woodroffe had explained that DNA samples can dissolve in water. He told jurors to trust the testimony of Raj Theekoy, a former colleague of Treebhoowoon and Moneea, who told police he saw the pair coming from the direction of Michaela and John’s room at the time of the murder. He said Theekoy was a ‘trusted witness’ with ‘no reason to lie’. Summing up, Mr Manrakhan said: ‘Members of the jury, there are no politics to truth. There is right and there is wrong. I have no doubt whatsoever that when you consider the evidence, objectively and dispassionately, that you will reach the right decision – that the two accused are guilty as charged.’ The McAreaveys and Mr Harte sat in solemn silence as the court emptied. The group appeared drained as they later made their way out past waiting cameramen and reporters. After nearly 50 testimonies, the last witness was called on Thursday. The defence will deliver closing statements on Monday and a verdict is expected next week.","Michaela McAreavey, 27, found dead in bathtub of Mauritius hotel room .

"By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren . Accused: Daniel St. Hubert allegedly stabbed 2 children and could be charged in further attacks . A convict accused of stabbing a six-year-old boy to death and leaving his seven-year-old friend fighting for her life was stopped by police for public urination earlier this week - but then let go. Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was caught urinating on Wednesday just blocks from the Boulevard Houses in East New York, where he allegedly murdered P.J. Avitto and attacked Mikayla Capers in an elevator. He claimed that he didn't know it was illegal and, after showing proper ID, he was released with a summons, the New York Daily News reported. But just hours later he was arrested for the stabbings after police patrolled the area around his mother's home in Queens - and now he is being eyed in yet another grisly crime, police said. St. Hubert appears on surveillance video near the subway stop where a homeless man was stabbed on a platform early on Wednesday morning, said police spokesman Stephen Davis. Witnesses to the seemingly random attack also described the suspect using an 8-to-10-inch knife with a brown handle similar to one recovered on St. Hubert when he was arrested, Davis said. The 52-year-old homeless man is recovering in a hospital and is likely to survive his injuries. Perp walk: Daniel St. Hubert, center, is led from the 90th precinct by police, Thursday, June 5, 2014, in New York . Victims: Six-year-old P.J. Avitto, left, was stabbed to death in an elevator in his housing block on Sunday, while seven-year-old Mikayla Capers was left in critical condition. St. Hubert has been arrested in the attack . Killed: 18-year-old Tanya Grant-Copeland, pictured, was stabbed on Friday four blocks from where the children were attacked but police are still investigating whether St Hubert could be responsible . St. Hubert is also suspected of stabbing to death 18-year-old Tanaya Copeland on Friday four blocks from where the attack of the young children happened, police said. Yet more forensic testing at that scene needs to be conducted, Davis said. A similar knife was recovered at the scene of Copeland's slaying. Investigators are now reviewing all city stabbings that occurred since St. Hubert was released from prison on May 23, after he finished a five-year sentence for attempted murder and assault. St. Hubert was being held in a Williamsburg, Brooklyn precinct on Thursday and unavailable for comment. It wasn't immediately clear if he had made any statements or had asked for an attorney. Media frenzy: Reporters and photographers crowd the sidewalk for even just a glimpse of the man accused of the horrific stabbings . Plea: Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce appealed for help tracking down the stabbing suspect hours before he was arrested on Wednesday . Meanwhile, the father of Prince Joshua Avitto, the six-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed, said on Thursday that if he saw the suspect, he'd ask him, 'What made you do this to a little baby?' 'I'm at a loss for words,' Prince's father, Nicholas Avitto, told Fox 5 News. 'The bottom line is he got out and this tragedy took place after he was released from jail.' St. Hubert was picked up just after 8pm on Wednesday by detectives who had been tracking him, police said. He was identified by forensic evidence recovered on the knife at the scene of Sunday's elevator stabbing, police said. At a Wednesday evening press conference attended by the mayor, officials said investigators believed St. Hubert had no car and may have been riding the subways. Missed: A boy looks at a memorial outside the Boulevard Houses in East New York on Wednesday . Davis said St. Hubert, who has an extensive criminal history, had previously been arrested on disorderly conduct charges for taking up two seats on the subway and other infractions. St. Hubert hasn't yet been officially charged but murder and assault charges are likely coming, said Davis. St. Hubert didn't put up any resistance during his arrest, though he has a record of assaulting both a police and correction officer, and was angrily ranting to himself in a holding cell late on Wednesday night, Davis said. It wasn't immediately clear what he was ranting about or if he has a history of mental illness, Davis said.","Daniel St Hubert, 27, has been arrested in connection with the death of PJ Avitto, 6, and the attack on Mikayla Capers, 7, last week .

"By . Rosemarie Lentini . A high school gym teacher's alleged year-long sexual affair with a 16-year-old student was exposed when she flew into a jealous rage because he was taking another girl to prom. Joy Morsi, a 39-year-old teacher at Grover Cleveland . High School in Queens, New York, allegedly had sex with the wrestler in the school gym and basement, and sent him raunchy selfies and emails. The Long Island mother, whose husband also teaches at the school, was arrested on Monday and charged with third-degree rape. Scroll down for video . Accused: Married gym teacher Joy Morsi (pictured left and right) has been accused of raping a 16-year-old student at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens . Charged: Married teacher Joy Morsi (seated) is accused of raping a teenage wrestler at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York, where her husband works as a science teacher (pictured) The illegal relationship began in June last year when Morsi offered to help the student lose weight, prosecutors said in court today. On June 10, Morsi allegedly lured the unidentified student into a 'secluded closet' where she exposed herself to him, prosecutor Taylor Piscionere said according to  New York Daily News. She also allegedly sent the student emails asking if he was a virgin, along with saucy text messages. The court heard the pair had sex all over the school from June to July last year, and continued to meet for sex outside of school. Prosecutors said the victim reported Morsi to authorities about two weeks ago after she became jealous that he was taking a girl to prom. In court today, Morsi pleaded not guilty to numerous counts of third-degree rape, a criminal sexual act in the third degree and one count of endangering the welfare of a child. As the student turned 17 during the nearly year-long dalliance, subsequent alleged encounters are considered legal. Morsi, described by some students as 'a hard-working teacher' did not comment as she left court. If convicted, she faces four years behind bars. Scene: Joy Morsi, 39, a gym teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Ridgewood, Queens (pictured) allegedly had a year-long sexual relationship with a 16-year-old male student . City Department of Education officials told New York Daily News that Morsi was 'immediately removed' from the classroom when she was reported. 'We find these claims disturbing and reprehensible and she will remain reassigned — far from any student and the school — pending a criminal investigation,' deputy press secretary Marcus Liem said. 'We will work closely with the school to ensure they are given any needed support.' Meanwhile students at the school said rumors had long circulated about the alleged affair. 'We had a feeling that something was going on,' ninth-grader Josie Gonzalez told New York Daily News. 'They would always be together around the school.' Eyewitness News ABC7 reported that the Department of Education is now looking into Morsi's interactions with other students. Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said the case was 'particularly disturbing' because the encounters occurred at school. 'Schools should be safe havens for children. Instead, this defendant is accused of sexually preying upon one of her students during rendezvous all over the school.'","Joy Morsi is a gym teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in Queens, New York .

"By . Darren Boyle . A Syrian election branded as a farce by opponents of President Bashar al-Assad is planned for tomorrow despite the ongoing civil war. In theory, 15 million people are entitled to vote but polling stations are only being opened in areas loyal to the current regime. This comes as Government forces have discovered secret tunnels used by rebels to move explosives and arms in advance of tomorrow's election. Pro-government forces today discovered a series of tunnels dug by rebels in advance of tomorrow's planned election . Rebels dug tunnels and blasted holes in buildings in the eastern outskirts of Damascus where they were preparing to attack government forces . The tunnels allowed rebels to move unseen below ground and away from fighter bombers and helicopters patrolling the area . Pro-regime newspaper Al-Watan said: 'Military and security forces are on maximum alert to ensure the security of Syrians who wish to vote.' The regime claims that more than 9,000 polling stations are being protected although there are claims that rebel forces may target electors queuing to cast their ballots. On Monday, ten people were killed in Haraqui when a truck bomb exploded in the village which is loyal to the current regime. In Aleppo, which has been the scene of intense fighting, 50 people, including nine children, were killed in mortar attacks believed to have been fired by rebels, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Syrian army believes that he tunnels would have been used in a major operation tomorrow attacking voters trying to cast their ballots in the election . Some of the trenches discovered by Syrian soldiers are more than eight feet deep . A Syrian army soldier secures the entrance to one of the tunnels in Jobar, in the eastern suburbs of Damascus . Syria has been ruled for the past 50 years by the Baath party, who are supporting al-Assad. Opponents to the current regime have been banned from running for election. As a result, rebel forces have called on Syrians to boycott the poll. Al-Assad's Information Minister Omran al-Zohbi said: 'The presidential election is a genuine occasion for all Syrians to express... their personal opinion, in a totally transparent way.' Large posters featuring President Bashar al-Assad have been erected in areas loyal to the regime such as Damascus in advance of tomorrow's election . However, in areas such as Aleppo, the Syrian regime are launching airstrikes on opposition areas. Almost 2,000 people - a quarter of the population - have been killed in the heavy fighting . In one such airstrike, this building in Aleppo was destroyed by fighter-bombers earlier today . Assad faces two opponents for president, Maher al-Hajjar and Hassan al-Nuri, although neither is widely known in Syria. Opponents have branded the poll a 'blood election' as an estimated 162,000 people have been killed during the conflict. One civil servant living in Damascus said he had no choice when it came to casting his ballot: 'I have to, because there is a voting station in the building where I work. I can't escape.' Peaceful opposition to the al-Assad regime started in March 2011 with Arab Spring-inspired street protests. But following a brutal crackdown, the situation deteriorated into a full-scale civil war. Thousands of foreign fighters have travelled to Syria to join the insurgency. Among those involved in the fighting are large numbers of hard-line jihadists. The election is being monitored by observers from North Korea, Brazil, Russia and Iran. Rebels used basements of adjoining buildings as a subterranean highway for moving between strategic locations . A Syrian soldier armed with a Kalashnikov AK47 equipped with a sniper scope guards the area being searched by his comrades . Rebels placed mirror in sections of their tunnels so they could monitor whether pro-regime forces were approaching . Rebel forces have used tunnels to place explosives under government-held strong points using methods first developed during the First World War on the Western Front . A pro-government newspaper has said that the regime has launched a major security operation in advance of tomorrow's poll . Election observers from North Korea, Iran, Russia and Brazil have arrived in Syria to monitor the poll, which has been branded as a farce by opponents .","15 million Syrians are entitled to vote in tomorrow's presidential election despite the continuing civil war .

"By . Damien Gayle . A popular mayor in Bolivia is facing possible legal action after groping two women, and forcing a kiss on a third, while on camera at official events. In the most recent incident, Percy Fernandez, Mayor of Santa Cruz, puts his hand on the thigh of a broadcast journalist seated next to him. There's a brief struggle as the reporter tries to remove the 75-year-old mayor's hand from her leg, before she manages to yank it away and places it on his own thigh. Scroll down for video . Brazen: Santa Cruz Mayor Percy Fernandez grabs the thigh of journalist Mercedes Guzman as he speaks during a public event in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. He has been forced to apologise but still faces a legal complaint . Humiliating: In an admirable display of professionalism, Ms Guzman managed to keep smiling as she struggled to remove the 75-year-old mayor's hand from her leg, before yanking it away and placing it on his own thigh . It is the latest episode in a string of inappropriate behaviour, which has included patting a city councillor's bottom as she made a speech, and forcing a kiss on the lips of an engineer at a bridge opening. Opposition legislator Marcela Revollo Fernandez has filed a complaint in La Paz, the Bolivian capital, accusing Mayor Fernandez of 'sexual harassment, sexual violence, and discrimination.' As she filed the complaint, Ms Revollo was quoted by CNN as saying: 'We consider this an expression of violence against all Bolivian women, considering that the mayor's actions have happened before.' Inappropriate behaviour: Mr Fernandez was previously caught on camera stroking the president of the Santa Cruz city council's bottom as she made a speech at a public event in front of news crews and a big audience . Relentless: She was forced to hold his hand in an effort to get him to stop touching her. He promptly kissed it and began rubbing her knuckles with his thumb, before again reaching for her behind . It is not known if prosecutors will call on Mayor Fernandez to answer the charges, which carry a potential punishment of up to four years in prison. The complaint came shortly before he appeared on television last week to express 'anguish for this mess that's been created.' He said he had not intended to offend journalist Mercedes Guzman, 'nor have I done so.' He did not specifically apologise for touching her. Journalists' leader Lupe Cajias . Several legislators, journalists' organizations and women's rights activists denounced the 75-year-old mayor and Ms Guzman's husband, Marco Antonio Espindola, threatened to bring a legal complaint of his own if the mayor did not apologise. 'Even the schoolmates of my son in primary school heard about this event and my adolescent son had to put up with uncomfortable questions at his school,' said Mr Espindola. 'It shamed my family.' Lupe Cajias, president of the La Paz Association of Journalists, also criticised Mayor Fernandez. She told CNN: 'On one hand, I think it reflects the arrogance of power; and on the other hand, a lack of control of (the mayor's) own actions. 'The two things are probably related. If you think there's no boundaries because you're above good and evil, then you can grab a journalist's leg or talk with double-meaning in front of the camera without shame.' Unwanted attention: In this screengrab from an August 2010 video report, Mayor Fernandez grabs an engineer during a bridge inspection event in Santa Cruz and forces a lengthy kiss on her lips . The blunt-spoken Fernandez has run into controversy before for his treatment of women.

She was forced to hold his hand in an effort to get him to stop touching her. He promptly kissed it and began rubbing her knuckles with his thumb, before again reaching for her behind. At another event, he planted a lengthy kiss on a seemingly unwilling female engineer.

To welcome the summer in, and thanks perhaps to the recent rise in popularity of the 'butt selfie', one New York spa has started offering a facial specifically for your hind quarters. The 'Shiney Hiney Facial' costs $65 for a 30 minute treatment at the Brooklyn-based Skin By Molly, and involves a microdermabrasion-like exfoliation along with a peel and a steam. 'Hey, skin is skin, I got no judgment,' says owner Molly Lamb to Brokelyn. 'Acne can flare up anywhere.' Bare that booty: A New York salon has pioneered the 'Shiney Hiney Facial', a 30 minute treatment devoted to clearing butt acne and prepping your behind for summer (stock image) 'Most people with facial acne will develop acne on other parts of their body as well, including the buttocks,' medial aesthetician Giselle Curcio writes on her blog, TheskinY On Skin, also mentioning exfoliation as being a good treatment. And you only have to do a quick scour of online forums to see how surprisingly common a case of butt acne is, one message board featuring this gem from a concerned husband: 'My wife would kill me if she knew I was posting this but ever since I can remember she has ALWAYS broke out on her BUTT.'

"By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren . A woman watched her boyfriend rape and shout names at the lifeless body of a student she had brought over to be a sex offering, she has revealed in her court testimony. Kathryn McDonough resumed testimony on Wednesday in the murder trial of ex-boyfriend Seth . Mazzaglia, who is charged with killing Elizabeth 'Lizzi' Marriott at his . Dover, New Hampshire apartment in October 2012. After being rebuffed twice by the 19-year-old University of New Hampshire student, Mazzaglia crept up behind her as she watched a movie with McDonough and quickly incapacitated her with a rope before raping her, McDonough told the court. Afterwards he ordered her to hold the white rope - which he and McDonough had used in their sex games - around the already-motionless girl's neck, she said, and she did as she was told. Emotional: Kathryn McDonough, 20, broke down . crying during testimony in the murder trial of her ex-boyfriend, who she . says strangled and raped her co-worker in 2012. She said she watched as . he did it . Breakdown: The judge called a break when McDonough's sobs became uncontrollable during the trial . McDonough is serving a . prison sentence for lying to investigators about the teen's . disappearance. On Tuesday, she testified how she had lured Marriott, her co-worker, to the apartment with the promise of watching a movie or playing a video game. In reality, McDonough testified, she was offering Marriott as a sex partner for Mazzaglia, who was angry that McDonough had left him alone for 12 days. Mazzaglia sent her a text message at 10:26 p.m. asking, 'We painting tonight?' - a coded reference to having sex with Marriott. She replied: 'Your decision, I guess. If you have a plan. Nervous.' 'I didn't really know what he wanted to do,' McDonough testified. After a game of strip poker, Mazzaglia suggested to Marriott that she kiss McDonough. On trial: Seth Mazzaglia is escorted out of the court room for a break on Wednesday after the testimony . When Marriott said no, saying she was in a committed relationship, he said he wanted the college student to watch McDonough and Mazzaglia have sex. Marriott again refused. McDonough, who previously told the jury about the couple's sadomasochistic relationship, testified that Mazzaglia was unaccustomed to hearing 'no'. 'That's when he moved up behind her and he pulled the rope up over her head and he strangled her,' she said. 'She let out a quick noise and she sort of stopped. Her arms curled up against her chest and her eyes were closed.' Mazzaglia was wearing gloves and had a soft, white cotton rope the couple used in bondage sex. After Mazzaglia strangled Marriott, McDonough went into the bathroom. When she returned to the main part of the studio apartment, she saw Mazzaglia raping Marriott and calling her names - her motionless body prone on the floor. Then Mazzaglia went into the bathroom and told McDonough to hold the rope around Marriott's neck. McDonough said she laid the rope loosely over Marriott's neck. 'Her mouth opened a tiny bit,' McDonough testified. 'I only noticed because I was so close to her.' Accused: Seth Mazzaglia, left, allegedly raped and killed Lizzi Marriott, right, when she rebuffed his advances . She testified, voice quavering, that she checked for a pulse and found none. Neither she nor Mazzaglia called police or an ambulance. Marriott's father, Bob Marriott, sat in the front row, his shoulders heaving with silent sobs as McDonough testified in a monotone about his daughter's last minutes. As prosecutors projected a timeline of events on a screen, McDonough started sobbing. The judge called a break and she was escorted from the courtroom, still sobbing and trembling. On Tuesday, she had explained she had taken Marriott to their apartment because Mazzaglia had demanded she find him a sex partner as punishment for leaving him alone for 12 days while she went to camp. McDonough . said he had brutally sodomized her a month earlier as 'punishment' for . failing to find him a sex 'slave' so she was willing to 'try and please . him' however she could. 'I . think it would be fitting if the first thing you saw me do when you got . back is pleasure one of your friends until they died of orgasms and only . then turned my brutal attention to you,' Mazzaglia allegedly wrote in a . text message he sent to McDonough. Missed: Marriott, pictured left and right with her parents, had gone to McDonough's house to watch a movie . She added that Mazzaglia wanted her to recruit Marriott as the slave because of her physique and personality, SeaCoastOnline reported. McDonough, 20, is the key witness against her ex and lawyers on both sides cast her differently. Prosecutors . portray her as the sexual submissive, dominated in all aspects of their . relationship by a man 10 years older than her, but Mazzaglia's lawyers . say she was the dominatrix, a woman obsessed with finding another woman . to dominate, and it was Mazzaglia who was her sexual slave. Marriott had transferred to the . University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine . biology. She was a commuter student, living with her aunt and uncle in . Chester during the week and returning home to Westborough most weekends. Marriott had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts. On . the night she died, Marriot text messaged Atwood minutes before 9pm to . let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a movie. Atwood . testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new . friends. The text message was Marriott's last communication. Sick: McDonough, pictured as she is escorted out of the courtroom during the morning break in her former boyfriend's trial, told the court that she watched as the 19-year-old was strangled with a rope . Atwood said became worried the next morning when she had not heard from Marriott and contacted her parents. Mazzaglia . told investigators he and McDonough had used Marriott's 2001 Mazda to . take her body to Peirce Island in Portsmouth, where they threw it and . her cellphone into the Piscataqua River. The . pair then drove Marriott's car to UNH, left it in a student lot and . discarded her belongings in trash bins, authorities allege. McDonough is serving a 1-1/2 to three-year sentence for conspiracy and hindering prosecution. Defense . attorney Joachim Barth told jurors during his opening statement that . McDonough bargained her concocted story of what happened that night in . exchange for time off her sentence, and that testifying against . Mazzaglia is part of her plea deal.","Kathryn McDonough, 20, testified how she watched Seth Mazzaglia, 31, strangle Lizzi Marriott with a rope in 2012 and then rape her body .

"By . Peter Campbell . The boss of energy giant E.ON will keep his £500,000 annual bonus despite the firm receiving a record fine for mis-selling to hundreds of thousands of customers. The German-owned company faces a bill of up to £21million after industry regulator Ofgem discovered ‘large scale mis-selling’ over three years. Some 465,000 customers lost out after they switched to the supplier based on false promises by aggressive salesmen about how much they could save. Penalty: E.ON has been made to pay a record £12million to elderly and disabled customers after it mis-sold energy deals for more than three years. The fine was a nominal £1 so that funds did not go to the Treasury . Yesterday, the firm was fined a record . £12million and told to pay compensation. But in what one MP has called . an ‘extraordinary’ twist, British chief executive Dr Tony Cocker refused . to resign – and will only see his annual bonus cut by a quarter. Despite . the scandal, the company said last night he will still receive a bonus . of £510,232, giving him a total pay package worth almost £950,000 for . last year. He has been chief executive since 2011. Critics branded the decision ‘unjustifiable and indefensible’. Those who could be in line for a payout will be contacted in two groups. The . first group, 333,000 people receiving the Warm Home Discount, will . automatically be given £35 each. These are mostly pensioners and the . disabled. The second group . is 465,000 people to whom deals may have been mis-sold, and will also . include some people on the Warm Home Discount. They will be sent a letter by E.ON in the near future outlining how to work out whether they are affected and how to claim. Anyone with concerns, even if they were not in these two groups, should ring the dedicated hotline on 0800 0568497. The . revelation that Dr Cocker will keep his bonus is particularly . surprising because Ofgem singled out management for criticism. In its . report, it said bosses ‘did not do enough to identify issues or act when . problems were discovered’. Despite . this, none of E.ON’s British board directors have lost their jobs, the . company confirmed. It has also emerged that E.ON’s mis-selling took . place during a period when it was telling customers it had overhauled . its sales practices. In . January 2012, the company embarked on a six month ‘Reset’ programme to . improve its relationship with customers. But the process failed to stop . widespread mis-selling across the group. Now . E.ON will have to pay up to £8million to 333,000 elderly and vulnerable . customers. This is the equivalent of around £35 each. The . overall bill includes the cost of administering the compensation . scheme. The energy giant will also write to all of the customers who . could have been mis-sold to, which totals 465,000. The first letters are . expected to arrive on Monday and these eligible customers are set to . receive around £67 per household. Anyone who signed up to E.ON between . June 2010 and December 2013 could be entitled to compensation. E.ON said . bonuses for directors involved in overseeing the sales were cut by up . to 50 per cent. Mis-sold: It is thought tens of thousands of customers were affected by the practices (file photo) E.ON chief executive Tony Cocker: 'It is unacceptable that we may have been unclear with customers' It added . that Dr Cocker’s bonus has been reduced by 26 per cent, from £687,200 in . 2012. It is understood some of the staff involved in mis-selling have . left the firm since but none are at board level. Yesterday, . Dr Cocker said that the mis-selling was ‘completely unacceptable’ and . insisted there was ‘no organised attempt to mislead’. But he refused to . resign. He added: ‘We are really sorry and want to make it absolutely . clear that we are putting this right.’ Five . of Britain’s largest power suppliers – E.ON, EDF, Npower, ScottishPower . and SSE – have been fined for mis-selling. Only British Gas has not . been caught up in the scandal. E.ON’s fine is the largest of any of the . suppliers. Graham Stringer, a . Labour MP who sits on the energy select committee, said: ‘It is . extraordinary that they are still going to give him an enormous bonus. This is a reward for failure, but it is also more than that. It is . symptomatic of a culture where people do not accept any responsibility . for their actions. The people at the top of our energy companies are . scratching each other’s backs and the consumers pay the price for that.’ His . Labour colleague on the committee, John Robertson, said: ‘It just . beggars belief that a company that has ripped people off and been found . out doing it would give anyone a bonus.’ Shadow . energy minister Tom Greatrex said: ‘E.ON’s chief executive claims to . have taken responsibility… but he will still be receiving 75 per cent of . his bonus. ‘That will strike many as unjustifiable and indefensible.’","Supplier agrees record £12million payout to 333,000 pensioners and disabled .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Michigan police are under investigation after photos and videos allegedly showing officers harassing and humiliating African-American men surfaced. The pictures and footage were alleged to have been shared between members of Grosse Pointe Park police and their families. They were released on a blog written by a former Detroit Free Press reporter on Thursday, who says he received them from an anonymous source. An officer has been suspended after claiming responsibility of the videos that show black men being told to sing and make animal noises . Steve Neavling wrote in his Motor City Muckraker blog that most of the videos appeared to have come from patrol cars, and that African-Americans were ordered to sing or 'dance like a chimp' He also published an image of a man riding in a trailer, that an officer allegedly forwarded to others in a text that read: 'Got to love the coloreds'. According to the Huffington Post, Neavling had access to more footage, but said he wasn't willing to make it public because of its 'humiliating nature'. Several officers are alleged to have been involved in the demeaning videos, but the blog named only Mike Najm as an officer who may have taken some of the images and videos. According to the Huffington Post, Officer Najm's ex-wife may have distributed the material. Grosse Pointe Park Captain David Loch had been skeptical of the claims at first, saying that the Najms had been through a contentious divorce. But when he was shown more of the films and images, including footage of Office Najm allegedly telling a man with learning disabilities to sing, he ordered an internal investigation. Other Grosse Pointe Park officers will undergo sensitivity training after the videos caused outrage . This image was allegedly circulated with the text message: 'Got to love the coloreds' Neavling reached out for comment from Officer Najm but didn't receive a response. The police said they opened an internal investigation after viewing the video clips and photo. A spokesman added: 'The Grosse Pointe Park Public Safety Department does not tolerate unprofessional conduct by its officers when interacting with any citizen they may come in contact with.'","Internal investigation over conduct of Grosse Pointe Park officers .

"By . Ian Drury . Bullying and campaigns of abuse were ‘endemic’ in a secretive police union which ‘cynically exploited’ the Plebgate scandal, a damning report reveals today. Hardline members of the Police Federation ‘disgracefully’ hounded senior officers, threatened dissenting staff with the sack and used ‘guerrilla’ tactics to halt government plans to shake-up pay and conditions, it says. Federation chairmen and politicians - including Home Secretary Theresa May - routinely suffered ‘personalised’ attacks from militant officials determined to scupper sweeping reforms. Hardline members of the Police Federation, pictured, 'disgracefully' hounded senior officers, threatened dissenting staff with the sack and used 'guerrilla' tactics to halt government plans to shake-up pay and conditions, the report says . Important business was discussed ‘aggressively, in public, at 10 o’clock at night after a considerable amount of alcohol had been consumed’, a whistleblower told the Home Affairs Select Committee. The cross-party panel of MPs also criticises the Federation for ‘unnecessarily’ stashing £70million of members’ money - including some in hidden so-called ‘No.2 accounts’ held by local branches - and hand back £120 each police officers. And the committee warns if the notorious organisation - effectively a union - fails to reform, it would be ‘derelict’ of the Government not to introduce tough new laws. Police Minister Damian Green has already fired a shot across the bows of the organisation - representing 125,000 rank-and-file officers - by ordering it to act ‘in the interests both of the police and the public’ to avoid legislation. The scathing report comes ahead of the Federation’s annual conference in Bournemouth next week. Members will vote on a package of reforms recommended in an independent review by ex-Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington. The Federation is still reeling from the fallout from Plebgate which led to the resignation of Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell, its political campaigning and the Mail’s revelations about ‘extravagant’ credit card spending and off-shore accounts. A survey of rank-and-file officers found almost 75 per cent thought the Federation did a ‘poor job’ speaking up for members and 91 per cent said it ‘should change’. Federation chairmen and politicians - including Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured,  - routinely suffered 'personalised' attacks from militant officials determined to scupper sweeping reforms . The 23-page report said the Federation had treated successive national chairmen - including outgoing Steve Williams and Paul McKeever, who died last year - ‘quite disgracefully’. They endured ‘persistent attempts to undermine and destabilise... by bullying and personal attacks’. In a letter written to the Federation’s 30-strong top committee, Mr Williams wrote that he had ‘continually been criticised, ridiculed and verbally ridiculed... and my integrity questioned’ over his stance on the Normington Review. He added: ‘Whilst accepting emotions are running high in the advent of inevitable change, at times I have genuinely felt that I have been gratuitously and cruelly bullied and humiliated.’ The report said chairmen trying to implement reforms became ‘enmired in interminable, internecine power-struggles which would not have been out of place in a medieval court.’ MPs also attacked the Federation’s decision to appoint a controversial public relations firm run by former radio ‘shock jock’ Jon Gaunt - the son of a policeman- as a ‘serious error of judgment’. The organisation secretly paid £10,000-a-month for advice on using ‘guerrilla tactics’ against the Government weeks before the Plebgate scandal. The hostile media strategy called for a military-style ‘blitzkrieg’ to halt radical change. In September 2012, then chief whip Mr Mitchell and a policeman clashed at the gates of Downing Street. Mr Mitchell was accused of calling police officers ‘f****** plebs’ - something he has always vehemently denied. He has insisted the row was hijacked by Federation officials for political ends. Keith Vaz, the committee's Labour chairman, said: 'We were shocked by the scale of bullying that we found at the Federation's headquarters' Earlier this month, Mr Gaunt admitted he saw the Plebgate affair as an ‘absolutely fantastic’ opportunity to promote the police agenda. But the strategy backfired because three officers who called for Mr Mitchell’s resignation following the incident have been sacked and a fourth, PC Keith Wallis, 53, was jailed for misconduct after admitting lying about witnessing the row. Branding the contract with Mr Gaunt ‘inappropriate’, the committee said he had ‘damaged, rather than enhance’ the organisation’s reputation. It said: ‘Mr Gaunt cynically sought to exploit the Plebgate incident as part of a manipulative media strategy which included what he described as “blitzkrieg” and “guerrilla” tactics. This entire episode does the Federation no credit at all.’ The report follows a string of revelations by the Mail on accusations of bullying and lavish spending by the Federation. Concerns were raised over significant amounts of money put through on corporate Mastercard credit cards, with some four-figure bills believed to have come after a conference organised by the Scottish Police Federation last November. Officials were also accused of bullying at the Federation’s plush £26million headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey, which was built in 2007 and boasts a 55-room hotel with a bar, swimming pool and 11 two-bedroom grace-and-favour apartments. Keith Vaz, the committee’s Labour chairman, said: ‘We were shocked by the scale of bullying that we found at the Federation’s headquarters. It rivals any popular soap opera. ‘It is disgraceful that any chairman should have been hounded out for championing long-overdue reforms.’ He added: ‘Our police service is the best in the world but its reputation has been extensively damaged by the federation suffering a sustained period of self-inflicted harm.’","Hardline members of Police Fed 'disgracefully hounded senior officers'

"By . Mia De Graaf . This is the moment a soldier ran across live rails into the path of an oncoming train to rescue a woman who fell on the tracks. Billy McPhail, 26, was standing on the opposite platform at Strood station when he saw the pensioner run for a train and slip. He leaped down and ran 100 yards to the other side - narrowly missing a passing service. Scroll down for video . Courageous: Billy McPhail, 26, ran across live electrical tracks to save a woman who fell as she ran for a train . Rush: The paratrooper scrambled to lift the woman, known only as Barbara and believed to be in her sixties, as the 6.05am service hurtled towards the platform at Strood station in Kent . Incredibly, the paratrooper reached the woman, lifted her on to the platform and jumped up moments before the 6.05am train, hurtling towards them, slammed to a brake just yards away. Mr McPhail, who was travelling home to Essex last Thursday after visiting friends in Kent, said: 'I was on the opposite platform 200 yards . away and I saw the lady fall down in between the tracks and then heard . the train horn coming. 'I was just thinking, ""if I don’t get her off the tracks then she will die"". 'Everyone was screaming and shouting but I was not really thinking about what I was doing. 'I jumped down and ran across the track - I only just missed a train coming from the other direction. 'I just jumped down to save her as the train was coming into the station. It was very close. 'My . dad said I was an idiot to risk my life but I would like to think if I . was ever in an accident then someone would jump in and rescue me.' Warning: A commuter is captured trying to flag down the train, which halted yards away from the scene . Success: Finally, as the train still approaches, Mr McPhail manages to lift the woman onto the platform . Support: Mr McPhail (wearing blue jeans) can be seen looking after the woman, who broke her ankle in the fall . Captured on the incoming train's camera, commuters can be seen rushing along the platform to flag it down and looking back with concern as it approaches. Crowds gathered around the woman, known only as Barbara and thought to be in her sixties, when she was pulled onto the platform. She was then taken to hospital with a broken ankle. Mr McPhail explained: 'I am really not a hero, I just acted on instinct. 'I just didn’t think of the dangers. 'I saw her ankle bent the wrong way, so I knew she was hurt and I couldn’t move her on my own. 'I called to another guy to help, he jumped down and other people ran along the platform to try and flag down the train. Just passing: Mr McPhail had been travelling back to Essex after visiting friends in Kent last Thursday . 'Luckily, it managed to stop a few yards away from us at the end of the platform.' The woman is now believed to be recovering in hospital after an operation on her broken ankle. Rail operator Southeastern Trains has now launched full investigation into the incident. A spokesman for the company congratulated Mr McPhail on his bravery but warned of the dangers of jumping onto live railway tracks. He said: 'What Mr McPhail did was commendable - he took it upon himself to save this woman’s life. 'However Strood Station has a live electrical line and our advice is usually in the event of an emergency to contact station staff and they will call the signallers to cut power to the line. 'However Mr McPhail acted on instinct and, without any regard for his own safety, saved this woman’s life.'

"By . Paul Donnelley . Scotland Yard swooped on Dover yesterday and arrested two men returning from Syria on suspicion of terror offences. The men, aged 26 and 44, were held at around 11pm by the Metropolitan Police Force’s Counter Terrorism Command. The duo were taken into custody as they landed at the Kent port on a ferry from Calais. Members of the Free Syrian Army: Scotland Yard believes that the two men they have arrested have been involved in terrorist activity in the Middle East country . Syrian rebels take position during clashes with government forces in Idlib, north Syria . The pair are facing questions at a police station in south London and two addresses in west London and one in Hertfordshire are being searched as part of the investigation. It is believed that one line of inquiry is whether they had travelled to or had links with terrorist activities in Syria. Hundreds of would-be British jihadists have gone to the war-torn Middle Eastern state to join fighting there, and UK authorities recently launched a campaign to encourage Muslim women to inform on relatives they suspect of planning to travel there. Syrian citizens stand near a burning truck that was destroyed by two cars bombs, at Jaramana, in Damascus, Syria . A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘They were travelling from Calais into the country. It is believed to be Syrian related. ‘On Tuesday 3 June, at approximately 11pm, officers from SO15 Counter Terrorism Command arrested two men aged 26 and 44 at Dover on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000. ‘They are currently in custody at south London police station. ‘Officers are searching two addresses in west London and an address in Hertfordshire as part of the investigation under Schedule 5.’ In a separate case two other men were arrested last week at Heathrow Airport on suspicion of terrorism linked to Syria. One – a 19-year-old – was held last Saturday on suspicion of preparing for acts of terrorism while the other – a 20-year-old – in an unrelated case, was arrested for allegedly sending money or property overseas to assist terrorism in Syria. The arrests come in the wake of plans by the government to charge British subjects and residents with terrorist offences when they return home under new laws to limit the threat of attack in the UK. The Prime Minister David Cameron and his deputy Nick Clegg said that they wanted to ensure ‘peace of mind for all that live here’ as they unveiled a raft of new laws in the Queen’s Speech aimed at criminal gangs, people traffickers and child abusers. The new laws would allow people suspected of committing terror offences overseas to be prosecuted in the UK as if the offences had occurred on British soil. The government warned Syria is now a 'breeding ground for terrorists’ after senior Whitehall officials said jihadists returning from fighting in the bloody civil war pose the biggest risk to UK security since 9/11. Government sources suggest around 2,000 Europeans fighting in Syria, including at least 200 already known to the British security services. It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad.

"By . Lydia Warren . On trial: Cody Legebokoff, 24, allegedly killed 3 women and a teenager between 2009 and 2010 . An alleged serial killer told Canadian authorities who had pulled over his vehicle that he was covered in blood because he had just clubbed a deer to death, it has emerged. But Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers knew there was more to the story when they stopped Cody Legebokoff, 24, for speeding on a rural road near Prince George, British Columbia. He is now on trial for the murders of Loren Leslie, 15, Jill Stuchenko, 35, Cynthia Maas, 35, and Natasha Montgomery, 23, who all died in 2009 or 2010. Legebokoff had allegedly just killed Leslie, whom he met after they chatted online, when he was pulled over on a quiet stretch of highway on November 27, 2010, the National Post reported. RCMP Constable Aaron Kehler, who was just a rookie at the time, had spotted the truck speeding through a forest and thought it was strange when the vehicle didn't slow down when it hit the highway. He guessed that the driver was speeding so signaled for him to stop and waited for another officer, K.P. Sidhu, to meet him. The two constables had been about to meet to exchange a lost purse. When they approached the vehicle, Legebokoff had blood smears on his face and chin, blood on his legs and a pool of . blood on the driver's mat. But it was an open beer can that allowed the constables to conduct a thorough search of the truck under the Liquor Control Licence Act, the Post reported. Loss: Loren Leslie, 15, was found killed near to a rural road where Legebokoff was pulled over by suspicious police officers in November 2010. They found him with blood on his face and legs . Inside they found a multi-tool and a wrench covered in blood. Legebokoff claimed that he had been poaching - but the constable asked why the items were covered in blood. 'He said they took turns clubbing it [the alleged deer] to death,' Kehler told the court. When Kehler asked Legebokoff if he did much poaching, he replied: 'Yeah, I'm a redneck. That’s what we do for fun.' Inside the vehicle, they also allegedly found a monkey backpack on the passenger seat, a wallet containing a children's hospital card with Leslie's name on and bottles of drinks favored by teen girls. 'I told him I was looking for the truth of what was going on,' Kehler told the court. Victims: Leslie, left, was his youngest alleged victim at age 15. After her body was discovered, Legebokoff, was allegedly connected by DNA evidence to the death of 35-year-old mother Cynthia Maas, right . Killed: He also allegedly killed 35-year-old Jill Stuchenko, left, and Natasha Montgomery, 23, right. Montgomery's body has never been found but her DNA was allegedly found on items in Legebokoff's apartment . 'From the things I've learned, people who enjoy killing animals, taking turns clubbing a deer - I said that sometimes they could turn out to be serial killers.' Mr. Legebokoff was arrested under the Wildlife Act for poaching but Kehler . also requested a conservation officer to check the area for signs of . poaching - and Leslie's body was found.

"By . James Rush . Burnis Hurd, 44, of Richmond, California, is accused of attacking an 11-year-old student on a school bus because he believed the boy was bullying his 9-year-old son . A father has been accused of attacking and threatening to kill an 11-year-old boy who he believed had been bullying his autistic son. Burnis Hurd, 44, is said to have followed his son onto a school bus in the Bay Area suburb of Richmond, California, before the nine-year-old pointed out the boy who he said had been bullying him. 'The father grabbed the 11-year old by the hair, pulled hard and raised the child out of his seat, then shoved him on the side of the bus where the window meets the wall,' Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan told CBS San Francisco. Gagan said Hurd also threatened to kill the student during the incident on Friday, May 30. Hurd has now been charged with child abuse and corporal injury to a child. He remained in jail on Monday on $50,000 bond, according to The Daily Caller. Both of the students reportedly attend a special education programme at a school in Richmond. Last month it was reported children as young as kindergarten-age could face misdemeanor charges for bullying under a proposed law advancing in the Southern California city of Carson. The Carson City Council gave preliminary approval early in May to an ordinance aimed at persons, including other youths, who cause anyone from kindergarten to age 25 to feel terrorized, harassed or threatened with no legitimate purpose. The legislation, which would have made Carson the first city in California to criminalize bullying, was however narrowly voted down by the city council by 3-2 on May 20, according to myfoxla.com. The legislation would have meant first-time offenders could have been ticketed for an infraction and fined $100. A second infraction would have cost $200, and a third-time offense could have brought a criminal misdemeanor charge. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

"By . Ryan Gorman . An Australian publisher and her two American business partners are locked in a bitter dispute over the royalties to the ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ trilogy. Jennifer Pedroza, of Arlington, Texas, is suing Amanda Hayward for tens of millions of dollars in profits and Christa Beebe is seeking thousands in lost wages the pair accused Hayward of taking even after she swore on her daughter’s life she would not con them. Pedroza was a partner and Beebe an employee at The Writer’s Coffee Shop, which owns the U.S. publishing rights to the erotic thriller penned by E.L. James. They filed their suit last week in Tarrant County District Court. Duped?: Jennifer Pedroza (left) and Christa Beebe (right) claim they were swindled out of millions by Amanda Hayward . Hayward, an Australian national, founded the company in Australia but ran it out of Texas, even appearing on Dallas television shows to promote the trilogy at one point, according to lawyer Mike Farris, who is representing the plaintiffs in their suit. Pedroza claims her 25 per cent stake in the joint venture entitles her to at least $20million, by Farris’ estimates of the amount of royalties paid to James, of which TWCS is entitled to half. ‘By November of 2013, three royalty payments should have been made by Random House… for at least $95 million,’ the suit claims. Hayward is instead accused of having publisher Random House, which distributed the book in the U.S., send the windfall to an account of hers in Australia, and claiming financial problems in the States while buying herself a mansion in a tony Sydney suburb. ‘Because of her chicanery, all payments flowed to her,’ the suit contends. The accused: The lawsuit claims Amanda Hayward wrongfully dissolved the partnership and fired both women . The accused swindler is said in the lawsuit, a copy of which has been reviewed by MailOnline, to have talked the two women into signing services agreement contracts that included ‘termination without cause’ clauses. This, the lawsuit asserts, was an underhanded and illegal attempt to convert the partnership into a sole proprietorship owned only by Hayward. The collective was initially founded by Hayward, Pedroza and two others after the women met online through literature fan pages as a way for mothers to have their novels published, according to Ferris. It was launched a virtual publishing company in October 2010, making all of its novels available as e-books. The women are said to have stumbled upon E.L. James’ trilogy through those message boards as well, because they had published previous works of hers. No one expected ’50 Shades’ to achieve such success. When Beebe, a school teacher by trade, brought up her concern about the clause with Hayward and said told her she had to either stay with TWCS of accept a teaching position – Hayward guaranteed her a job for the entire 2013-2014 school year. Best seller: E.L. James trilogy was a massive success, and the first book is currently being made into a moive . That guarantee came in a March 21, 2013 email from Hayward to Beebe. ‘I guarantee your job until next September,’ wrote Hayward. ‘Love ya.’ Both Beebe and Pedroza were canned November 1, 2013. Their terminations were announced in an email that called their firings a ‘very sad decision.’ The reason given was a lack of money. But just one year earlier, Hayward had bought a $5million mansion, and tens of millions of dollars were being paid to TWCS by Random House. The lavish home has a gym, tennis court, pool and various other luxuries, according to a previous sale listing posted online. Pedroza was never given her 25 per cent share of those profits, and Beebe lost her guaranteed $5,000 a month from working the job she was previously guaranteed. An interview given to a Fort Worth newspaper about the ordeal ended up with Hayward serving them a cease and desist order. Both women declined to speak to MailOnline through Ferris, citing the order. Hayward declined to speak through a TWCS spokesperson. The plaintiffs are seeking equitable relief and damamges from funds already paid, as well as to have Random House deposit further royalties into a kind of escrow account held by the court to ensure they are distributed fairly. Both James and Random House are not expected to have involvement in the case. The first book in the erotic trilogy is currently being made into a movie.","Jennifer Pedroza and Christa Beebe claim Amanda Hayward conned them out of millions combined .

"By . James  Nye . and Daily Mail Reporter . The frantic cries of the Florida mother mauled by a 200-pound black bear over the weekend can be heard in the background of a 911 call as her distressed son phones for help. Teri Frana's harrowing screams ring out as her teenage son tells a Seminole County Sheriff's dispatcher that, 'I need help in my house, a bear attacked my mom'. The dramatic recording was released on Tuesday afternoon following Frana's terrifying encounter with five bears in her garage which left her needing 30 staples in her scalp and 10 stitches to her forehead. Scroll Down for Video and to listen to audio . Scary: Terri Frana broke down in tears during an interview on Monday and on Wednesday the 911 call her husband and son made was released by authorities . Jaws: The mother showed the cameras how the bear launched its jaws around her head and clamped them down . During the course of the call, the victim's husband, Frank Frana, calmly takes over the phone from his son. 'She's awake. She's breathing. She's just traumatized. She's breathing and she's bleeding hard,' he said according to the Orlando Sentinel. 'Do you have an ambulance dispatched?' Frana thought the bear was trying to drag her into the woods and since the incident Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission have shot dead seven bears around her home. Frank Frana talks to the media on Sunday outside the Lake Mary, Florida home along with his son. The 911 call they both made was released on Wednesday . In an interview on Monday, the terrified mother said that the bears reacted too fast for her when she stepped outside and as she was mauled she pleaded for help, screaming, 'Please, my kids need me.' Frana, told NBC's Today show that the frightening encounter has left her very shaken. 'I can't close my eyes and not think about it, see it, feel it, but that will go away in time and I'm here,’ said Frana. 'I'm here for my kids.' Frana said she stepped outside to get her children, who had been playing on their bikes when she was charged by the bears. 'I saw this large bear charging at me,’ she said to the Today show. 'She opened her jaw and clamped down onto my head, and I could just hear her teeth marks going through my scalp.' Clamped: Frana needed staples to her head after she was attacked by a bear outside her own home on Saturday . Wounds: Frana showed the cameras how lucky she was to escape crippling injury after the bear mauling on Saturday . Frana revealed she could only think about her family during the bloody attack. 'I said, ‘Please, my kids need me,' she recalled. Amazingly, Frana managed to escape the attack and drag herself inside her home where she was found by her eldest son, Drew, 15, who called 911. Despite living in the neighborhood for 10 years, Frana feels that she and her family obviously became complacent about the threat posed by black bears. 'Unfortunately, we just got too comfortable with them being around,’ she said. Indeed, the number of reports of people coming into contact with black bears in central Florida have more than doubled from just under a thousand in 2009 to more than 2,200 last year. The house in Lake Mary, Florida where a woman was mauled by a black bear on Saturday night . Frana's husband, Frank, said that he was just lucky to still have his wife with him after the attack. 'One of the bears stood up, knocked her down and started to maul her,' Frank Frana, the woman's husband, said according to MyFoxOrlando.com. 'The bear actually had my wife's head in its mouth and started to drag her towards the woods.' Mrs. Frana was mauled and clawed but managed to escape, running back into her house to get her husband. They called 911 and she was taken to hospital with wounds to her head, face, legs and torso. The attack in Lake Mary, Florida, just north of Orlando, happened just 10 miles from another bear mauling where a woman was jumped upon whilst walking her dogs home. Officials say the mother of four received bite marks to her shoulders, arms and upper thigh. Doctors also placed some 30 staples in her head and 10 stitches to cover up other lacerations. The attack happened inside the Carisbrooke subdivision at a home on Brackenhurst Place on Saturday night. The Florida woman was set upon by five bears (this image is stock) as she went to check on her trash . Seminole County Sheriff Lt. Pete Brenenstuhl said that the woman was set upon by five bears ‘of various sizes’, suggesting it was a family of the animals. He said the bears pounced on her the moment they saw her and ‘dragged her from inside the garage out into her driveway’. Florida Fish and Wildlife officials are looking for the 200-pound black bear who attacked Mrs. Frana. Several traps have been placed in the neighborhood in hopes of catching the bear. Wildlife officials are also out with tranquilizers, but say most bears are trapped at night. On Sunday, officials shot a bear that was aggressive toward them in the area where the attack happened, Bay News9 reported. They shot the bear at close range because it came up to them. Three other bears were captured and euthanized, while two more ran away. Wildlife officials said that at this time of year bears were more likely to be scavenging for food and that residents should be on the lookout. In December, Susan Chalfant suffered serious head injuries after a bear ‘came out of nowhere’ and jumped on her as she walked with her dogs in Longwood. It was the worst bear attack ever recorded in Florida and left the 54-year-old covered in blood and with facial injuries that were so bad a neighbor hardly recognized her. Equipment is brought in near a Lake Mary, Florida home where a black bear mauled a woman Saturday night . She later told wildlife investigators: ‘That bear was trying to kill me. It just kept coming’. In January two Scottish tourists were attacked by a bear whilst on holiday in California after they walked straight past the animal oblivious to its presence. Bob and Irene McKeown did not see the black bear as they exited their daughter’s house even though it was just 10ft away from them. It followed them to their car where it clawed Mr McKeown who had just put his wife in the vehicle. Wildlife officials said that the animal could have been looking for food. Urban sprawl has meant that towns are taking up ever more of the land where bears live - and their numbers are increasing too. In the 1970s an estimated 300 wild black bears were in Florida but that number stood at 3,000 in 2002, the most recent survey. Researchers believe there could be as many as 5,000 now.","The 911 call made by Teri Frana's son after she was attacked by bears in the family garage has been released .

"By . Pat Hagan . Drinking four cups of coffee a day almost halves the risk of deadly mouth cancer . Drinking four cups of coffee a day almost halves the risk of deadly mouth cancer, according to new research. The latest study shows downing the beverage every day has a powerful protective effect against tumours that form in the mouth and throat. The association held true regardless of how often the person drank alcohol or smoked. Scientists found decaffeinated coffee also reduced the risk, although to a lesser extent, while drinking tea did nothing to prevent the disease. The latest findings, by a team of researchers from the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia, suggest it may not be caffeine that protects against the formation of malignant growths in and around the mouth. Instead, they said, it's likely to be due to some of the hundreds of other naturally-occurring antioxidant chemicals found in coffee. The results back up a similar study published two years ago by a different team of researchers, who found four cups a day slashed cancer risk by 39 per cent. British consumers guzzle their way through an estimated 70 million cups of coffee a day. The popular drink has already been linked with reducing the chances of getting bowel cancer, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. However, drinking too much may increase heart rate and blood pressure and pregnant women are advised to limit their intake because of concerns that excess coffee may increase their chances of having small babies. More than 6,000 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with mouth cancer and the disease kills around 1,600 annually. Smoking and excessive drinking are major risk factors. To see if coffee offered any protection, researchers studied nearly one million men and women who signed up to the Cancer Prevention Study II, which started in the US back in 1982. The protective effect is likely to be due to some of the hundreds of  naturally-occurring antioxidant chemicals found in coffee . They identified 868 volunteers who had died from cancer of the mouth or pharynx - the cavity between the nose and mouth - over a 30 year period. When they studied patients' dietary habits and compared them with others who stayed cancer free during the same period, they found drinking caffeinated coffee in reasonably large quantities appeared to have a potent effect. Those downing more than four cups a day were 49 per cent less likely to suffer tumours than others who drank little or no coffee. Decaffeinated coffee also showed some protection, but the numbers involved were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, the researchers said. Tea lovers, on the other hand, got no protection against mouth cancers from their favourite beverage. In a report on the findings, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, the researchers said it was likely that coffee's multitude of health-boosting ingredients shielded the body against the formation of tumours. 'Coffee contains multiple biologically active compounds that may help to lower the risk of developing and dying from cancer,' they said. 'In animal and cell cultures, no single anti-cancer mechanism has been identified but rather many pathways appear to be involved, depending upon the specific compound and anatomic site.'","Naturally occurring antioxidants in coffee may have a protective effect, say the U.S. researchers .

"By . Hugo Gye . Medical experts have called for a permanent ban on selling cigarettes to anyone born in this century in a bid to eradicate smoking from Britain entirely. The radical plan would see the age limit for buying tobacco - currently set at 18 - rise every year until the last cigarette smokers died out, at which point smoking would be illegal for everyone. Doctors have asked the powerful British Medical Association to lobby the Government for a ban on tobacco sales to people born after the year 2000. Smoking kills more than 100,000 people a year in the UK by causing diseases such as lung cancer and emphesyma, according to the NHS. Crackdown: Doctors have called for a permanent ban on selling cigarettes to anyone born after the year 2000 . While rates of cigarette smoking have been falling in Britain for decades, around 20 per cent of people still smoke despite anti-tobacco measures such as the ban on smoking inside. At the BMA's public health conference in London last week, doctors urged the Government to bring in draconian measures which will stop young people smoking in the first place. 'Humanity has never developed anything more deadly than the cigarette,' said Tim Crocker-Buqué, a registrar working in Tower Hamlets. 'The combination of its addictive power and devastating health effects combined with historical social norms and powerful advertising campaigns killed 100million people in the 20th century. 'The continuing epidemic is predicted to kill hundreds of millions more over the 21st century.' Plea: The calls were led by Dr Tim Crocker-Buqué, a registrar from East Londo . He cited statistics showing that 80 per cent of smokers start when they are teenagers, and that someone who starts smoking aged 15 is three times as likely to die of a related cancer than smokers who start in their 20s. 'This is a highly addictive product that kills 50 per cent of the users and it is so patently over the balance of harm that we must now work to prevent the next generation from falling into the nicotine trap,' Dr Crocker-Buqué added. 'I do not want our children smoking and nor should anybody else. If they haven't already started, then let's keep them smoke free for life.' Senior doctor Mark Temple agreed, . saying: 'If we prevent access to a group that is growing older through . time then gradually we will stop easy access to tobacco products.' Currently . retailers are barred from selling cigarettes or other tobacco products . to anyone under the age of 18, with fines of up to £2,500 for anyone . caught selling to children, enforced by local trading standards . agencies. If the . proposed legislation came into effect, the existing ban would be . replaced by a prohibition on selling tobacco to anyone born on or after . January 1, 2000. However, . public health expert Iain Kennedy suggested that the policy would prove . unworkable and claimed it was 'nonsensical' to target one age group . rather than embarking on wider anti-tobacco efforts. Controversy: One famous case of tobacco companies' wrongdoing was dramatised in the 1999 Hollywood film The Insider, starring Russell Crowe . The BMA conference also heard calls for local councils in Britain to withdraw all their investments from funds connected to tobacco companies. Taavi Tillmann said that local authorities' pension funds had more than £1billion invested in smoking-related funds, despite their duty to improve the health of their constituents. He added: 'This obviously creates a gross conflict of interest if ever there was one, whereby practitioners have to choose in a methodological fashion between maximising the health of their population on the one hand against maximising their income on retirement on the other hand.' The tobacco industry is immensely profitable but has long been controversial thanks to repeated allegations of wrongdoing such as deliberately marketing cigarettes to children. One of the most high-profile cases, when tobacco firm Brown & Williamson allegedly worked to make their cigarettes more addictive, was exposed by whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand and later dramatised in 1999 Hollywood hit The Insider, starring Russell Crowe.","Experts call on the BMA to lobby Government for a total ban .

He was one of the most iconic characters from the American Old West era and was a contemporary of Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickok.

Although unremarkable to look at, the gun became one of Cody's favourite firearms and was among the few he still owned at the time of his death aged 70 in 1917 from kidney failure. Cody, who earned his nickname hunting buffalo as a young man, was known for his generosity and although he owned many guns during his successful career he gave most of them away. He bought the gun at Hartley and Graham in New York while on extended stay with his theatre troupe.

High worth: The pistol is being auctioned with a starting price of $37,500 . Lock what else is for sale: The key to the City of Manchester presented to Buffalo Bill .

The key to Manchester which was presented to Cody in 1887 following a five-month stay in the city while on tour is also up for sale. Cody had taken his Wild West show to England that year to celebrate the Jubilee year of Queen Victoria, also performing in London and Birmingham. One side of the key is engraved ‘Presented to Buffalo Bill Cody 1887’ while the other side reads ‘From the city of Manchester England’. Bidding starts at $3,200 (£1,900). Tom Slater, head of Americana at Heritage Auctions, said: ‘Buffalo Bill had dozens of guns over the years but he was a very generous man and gave a lot of them away. ‘He only held on to a handful of his most prized guns and this was one of them. ‘Buffalo Bill used this gun during his famous Wild West show which travelled all over the US and even to continental Europe. ‘He was one of the most famous characters of the American Old West era and so the sale of this gun is hugely significant. ‘Barely a handful of his unembellished handguns are known in public or private collections. ‘He chose to keep hold of the gun as it was one of his favorites and it remained in his family for a long time so the provenance is exceptional. ‘The fact that it is being sold alongside other Cody memorabilia such as the key to the city of Manchester makes it a very special sale.’ The auction will take place in Dallas, Texas, on June 14.","The legendary showman bought the six-shooter revolver in 1883 .
