"Britain now manufactures more than it did in the late 1970s, shattering the idea that as a nation we do not make anything any more. Output last year was 10 per cent higher than in 1978, a new study by the Office for National Statistics said. However, the proportion of people working in manufacturing has fallen sharply, down from 25 per cent 35 years ago to just 8 per cent now. A new study by the Office for National Statistics reveals manufacturing output has risen since 1978, but the workforce has shrunk . Productivity in manufacturing has also risen sharply since 1948, much faster than the service sector . The number of jobs in manufacturing has fallen by 61.2 per cent between 1979 and 2013, the report showed . The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said workers in the sector were significantly better skilled and more experienced, even though only 8 per cent of UK jobs are now in manufacturing, compared with 25 per cent in 1978. Perceptions that manufacturing is disappearing from this country are 'wide of the mark', said the ONS. Productivity has grown by 2.8 per cent a year since 1948 despite the fall in jobs, which has partly been caused by outsourcing. The textile industry suffered an 80 per cent fall in jobs between 1979 and 2013, compared to a cut of 40 per cent in wood and paper. Joe Grice, chief economist at the ONS, said: 'The manufacturing industry has changed markedly over the past 60 years. 'It is becoming more productive, despite a steady fall in the number of people employed and broadly stable capital stock, and economic downturns in the 1970s, early 1990s, and notably 2008-9. 'There are several factors at work: a better quality and more skilled workforce; a shift from the production of low to high productivity goods; an improvement in the information technology base; more investment in research and development and a more integrated global economy. 'Exporting firms generally are associated with higher productivity and foreign-owned firms in the UK generally experience higher productivity than domestic firms.' The US is the biggest importer of British-made goods, worth £32billion-a-year . The North West is responsible for the biggest slice of manufacturing output, with London and Northern Ireland the lowest . The report revealed how the US is the biggest importer of British-made goods, worth £32billion-a-year. Other big markets include Germany (£24.7billion), France (£15.6billion) and China (9.7billion). Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'A strong manufacturing sector is vital to a balanced economic recovery. This report shows that recent pessimism about manufacturing has been misplaced: across British industry, more cars are rolling off the production line, British-made engines are keeping planes in the air and manufacturing is coming back from abroad. 'Our industrial strategy is paying dividends by giving business the confidence to invest and pave the way to recovery. We will continue to support businesses to secure more highly skilled jobs and a stronger economy.' Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said: 'This analysis shows us exactly why UK manufacturing must be at the centre of a better-balanced economy. 'Its declining share of employment and output is only a small part of the story as industry generates skilled jobs, productivity growth and the innovation and investment that can help to boost UK competitiveness. 'While this is a story of the past, the right business environment for manufacturing and a focus on rebalancing will ensure the sector continues to have a positive impact on the UK economy.'","Manufacturing industry has risen by around 2.8% a year since 1948 .

"Mario Balotelli isn't missed by AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi. The controversial striker departed the San Siro for Liverpool this summer in a £16million deal and has so far failed to find his shooting boots at Anfield. And Rossoneri head honcho Berlusconi believes his side are better off without the new Kop star - whom he brands a 'rotten apple'.

Milan are sitting in fifth place in Serie A after a dreadful campaign last season which saw the former giants languishing in eighth. However, Berlusconi believes his side can get back to the winning ways that saw them as one of the continent's premier clubs - targeting a home Champions League final in 2016. Fernando Torres is one of many champions among the base of the AC Milan squad, says Berlusconi . 'Our goal is to return to Europe. We want to build a winning side,' said Berlusconi. 'I think there are cycles in football, with years of success, then breaks, then back to winning. But the fans should rest assured - the team is already competitive and we'll soon be leaders in Europe again. 'The 2016 Champions League final is in Milan. Why shouldn't we dream of being there?'

"A Russian female punk bank band jailed for singing protests songs against president Vladimir Putin are to be freed later today after going on hunger strike, their lawyer has claimed. The three members of Pussy Riot were jailed for hooliganism after bursting into a cathedral in masks and staging a performance criticising the church's support of Putin. They also stood on top of a wall in Red Square in Moscow with speakers blaring out anti-Putin lyrics. The rock trio - two of whom have young children - were held without bail while their case was prepared. The move sparked protests by their supporters around their world. Band members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, Yekaterina Samutsevich and Maria Alekhina went on hunger strike last earlier this month amid concerns that the case was being prepared so that their defence team was at a disadvantage. Scroll down for video . Pussy Riot behind bars: Band members Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, left, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, right, pictured earlier this month await their fate after going on hunger strike . Custody: The third member of the punk trio Maria Alyokhina is handcuffed before a court appearance last week. Lawyers claim they are being treated unfairly . But a lawyer for the women said today that the women will be freed at a scheduled hearing. 'I have information from the most reliable source that the girls will be freed,' Pussy Riot lawyer Nikolai Polozov said, according to Interfax. Earlier he tweeted: 'Tomorrow after the hearing at the court on Pussy Riot something sensational awaits.' Pussy Riot supporter Alina Oraztsova tweeted: 'Lawyers for Pussy Riot said they received a call from the presidential administration and tomorrow they will free Pussy Riot.' The developments raised hopes among supporters that the feminist trio's fight for justice could have turned a corner. The young women are charged with hooliganism by an organised group, an offence with a maximum jail term of seven years. It is an exceptionally harsh charge for holding an unsanctioned protest. Jail: Ms Tolokonnikova displays her handcuffs after going on hunger strike. The group are now expected to be freed on bail before their trial after a series of protests in their support . Still smiling: Miss Tolokonnikova laughs in handcuffs despite facing up to seven years in prison over the protests songs in which she was involved . Support: Miss Alyokhina, left, and Miss Tolokonnikova, right, have been the subject of protests around the world calling for them to be freed . Miss Tolokonnikova sits in the prison cell as the group awaits charges for hooliganism by an organised group over staging anti-Putin performances . Controversial: Miss Tolokonnikova is guarded in the cage. She was part of the band that burst into a cathedral to perform protests songs . The radical group previously sang raucous anthems against Putin's government in public places. Its members wore brightly coloured balaclavas to conceal their faces and they used nicknames. In February, they climbed into an area reserved for priests in the central Church of Christ the Saviour and began singing a song criticising the Russian Orthodox Church's close ties to the Kremlin, before being dragged away by guards. Their rendition of a punk prayer called 'Holy Mother, throw Putin out!' was a protest against the church's support of Putin in the presidential election he won in March. The offence prompted Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill to hold an open-air prayer service with thousands of worshippers gathering outside the building as he said they had desecrated holy relics kept there. Rights groups including Amnesty International previously called for the 'immediate release' of the band members. Pussy Riot perform their controversial protest song in bright masks at the central Church of Christ the Saviour. They were angry at the church's support of Putin . More than 100 of Russia's best known actors, directors and musicians called for the women's release in an open letter last month, saying they presented no 'real danger' to society and that the criminal case against them compromised the Russian judicial system. Supporters include Dmitry Bykov and one of Russia's most popular actresses Chulpan Khamatova, who publicly supported Putin in his campaign for reelection to the Kremlin. 'I just want the girls to go home to their children,' she said in televised comments. It girl television presenter turned activist Ksenia Sobchak, whose apartment was recently raided as part of a probe into an opposition protest, on Twitter called the extended detention 'a terrible injustice'. 'Criminals walk free, no one bothers with them, while they have to take revenge for an anti-Putin song!' wrote opposition lawmaker Gennady Gudkov on Twitter. A female fan with a message of support for Pussy Riot scrawled across her chest pickets a Moscow court earlier this week. A string of Russian celebrities have also spoken out in favour of the punk band . Supporters Pussy Riot sit locked inside a mock defendant's cage outside the court in Moscow where the woman appeared. There are strong anti-Putin feelings in Russia after recent elections . Demonstration: Prison guards watch the men outside the court as the case continues to attract publicity. The women involved face a maximum of seven years in prison . Earlier this month a court extended by a month the detention of band - sparking more anger at their treatment. Police said they detained around 20 people outside Moscow's Tagansky district court after supporters sang couplets of the group's song and a pro-Kremlin youth group held placards saying 'Heretics, know the law!'. Those detained including several Russian Orthodox activists. Several protesters had smeared cosmetic masks on their faces, in protest at a new law forbidding people at rallies from wearing masks. The women, initially arrested in early March, had their pre-trial detention extended until July 24, adding a month to a previous extension. 'We are not enemies of the Christian faith... We will never plead guilty of the charges we are charged with,' singer Tolokonnikova, 22, said at an earlier hearing. Prosecutors have argued the women could commit fresh crimes or attempt to flee justice if they were not held behind bars before their trial, now expected to be held in August.

"Prepare to howl. The biggest and brightest full moon of the year graces the sky today as our celestial neighbor swings closer to Earth than usual. The supermoon will appear 14 percent larger and 30 per cent brighter than normal - the outcome of a cosmic quirk as the moon orbits within about 222,000 miles (357,000 kilometers) of our planet. Some viewers may think the shining orb looks more dazzling, but it's actually an optical illusion. The glowing disc is simply larger on the horizon next to trees and buildings. But don't worry if you missed it. The supermoon's effect should still linger until at least Tuesday. The supermoon sets over the Statue of Liberty, N.Y. A full moon rises behind the Jefferson Memorial in Washington D.C. The moon is seen in its waxing gibbous stage as it rises over Lower Manhattan, including One World Trade Center, center, seen from The Heights neighborhood of Jersey City, N.J. The word supermoon was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle, according to USA Today. Nolle used the term to describe a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is at or near its closest approach to Earth. While this supermoon, which rose in the east yesterday, is spectacular, an even larger one is expected on September 28, 2015. And the largest supermoon until 2034 will roll in on November 14, 2016.

"A transgender woman has had more than 100 black-market injections to achieve her 60-inch bum - despite her friends dying due to similar operations. Tatiana Williams, 42, has spent £60,000 sculpting her body over the past 20 years - including injections that have filled each bum cheek with a incredible 8lb of silicone. She said that similar high-risk illegal operations have maimed and killed a number of her friends, but that she has no regrets over her extensive plastic surgery. Scroll down for video . Worth the risk: Tatiana Williams, 42, has has spent £60,000 sculpting her body over the past 20 years - including injections that have filled each bum cheek with a incredible 8lb of silicone . Ms Williams, who lives in Miami, Florida, has had breast enhancements, chin implants, facial fillers and laser surgery - all without visiting a licensed surgeon. She said: 'Going to the black market is a big risk. People can die from these injections.' 'I've seen people eaten up by the silicone. I've seen them turn black-and-blue and not being able to walk anymore. 'I've seen people have their whole breast taken off. I've seen everything. 'It's cheaper on the black market and people are willing to take the risks to achieve the beauty. 'I'm one of the lucky ones and I knock on wood everyday thanking God that he brought me through.' Illegal silicone injections often use non-surgical silicone - sometimes bought from hardware stores - that can lead to severe infections that result in deformations, amputations and even death. But Ms Williams said that many people take the risk to follow in the footsteps of curvy celebrities. She said: 'I love Kim Kardashian's body - it's beautiful. She's exactly what a woman should be. 'When it comes to me and celebrities, a lot of people compare me to Nicki Minaj. Extensive surgeries: As well as silicone injections, Ms Williams, pictured with Dr Constantino Mendieta, has had breast enhancements, chin implants, facial fillers and laser treatment . 'It makes me laugh because I'm thinking, 'I had a** before I even knew of Nicki or before she was even around'. 'Maybe Nicki's actually got an a** like me.' Ms Williams, who was born Cory Williams, said she has always lived an unorthodox lifestyle but that her family have been supportive from the beginning. She knew she was attracted to men from a young age before deciding to start living as a woman in her late teens. She said: 'My childhood was loving and respectful and so I was able to grow up into a positive and productive individual. 'I didn't have the same hang-ups as some of the people in the transgender community who were ostracised by family members. Significant change: Ms Williams said that the risk of black-market surgeries has been worth it in order to achieve a curvier figure like those of celebrities Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj . 'My family let me be who I wanted to be, so it gave me the opportunity to produce a beautiful woman with no hang-ups, mentally.' Ms Williams first began her transition with hormone therapy, which helped her develop hips, breasts and a more feminine appearance. But determined to be a 'body goddess', she was soon tempted by the quick-fix promises of backstreet surgery. She said: 'It's pretty much word of mouth. People will go up to someone and say, ""I like your body, where did you get it done?"" 'It's really not hard to find. If you get into the right area, you'll pretty much find someone who is doing it. Supported: Ms Williams (pictured aged 14, left, and aged 16, right), who was born Cory Williams, said she has always lived an unorthodox lifestyle but that her family have been supportive from the beginning . 'I don't have a single friend who hasn't had something done. 'I've had countless surgeries. I got my injections done by three people. I won't say their names, but I went to Guadalajara in Mexico for some procedures and the rest were done here in Miami, Florida.' Ms Williams saved up for breast enhancements, chin implants, facial fillers and laser surgery. But most of her money was spent on injections into her buttocks, which she would pay for every few months. She said: 'Before the surgery my butt was about 25 inches - now it is more like 60 inches. 'It's hard to say how many injections I had - after a while you start to lose count. 'But I would have to say it must be something in the region of over a hundred...at least.' Happiest she has ever been: Ms Williams said that she has accepted she may one day pay a price for her curves but, for now, is determined to enjoy the life it has given her . Ms Williams said that she was once hospitalised for two weeks when a backstreet surgeon punctured her lung with a needle during a breast enhancement. She now claims to live a life of luxury with her body attracting enough admirers to allow her to become a 'kept woman'. She said: 'With a body like this, you pretty much get whatever you want. Men tend to put me up on a pedestal and treat me like a queen. 'I'm not in a relationship but If I find the right man I'll go with it. But it's not that important to me.' Despite having her pick of the men, Tatiana is often hurt by the frosty reception she gets from 'natural women' who are eager to dismiss her beauty. 'A lot of them can't accept a beautiful transgender woman,' she said. 'If you are a transvestite, a drag-queen or someone's that's playing around, they will receive you better. But if you're able to stand next to them and look just like them - or better - then it's different. 'It takes a strong woman to stand next to a transsexual woman like myself and not feel intimidated.' In demand: Ms Williams claimed that her surgeries mean that her body attracts enough admirers that she can live a life of luxury as a 'kept woman', but said that 'natural women' find her beauty intimidating . One of Ms Williams' friends, Valencia Santiago, 39, said that others are now getting surgery to emulate Ms Williams' figure. She said: 'There is so much botched-up work going on out there. They want to copy Tatiana's look but end up looking rippled, dragging and sagging - it's ridiculous.' Ms Williams has recently been assessed by leading plastic surgeon Dr Constantino Mendieta, who admits he is 'stunned' that she has had no issues with her black-market booty. He said: 'Tatiana's shape is relatively good if you like the very, very big buttock look. 'She must have had three or four thousand cc's of product, that's about 8 pounds, into each buttock. 'To me that's unbelievable. I have no clue how she has not had a problem. 'She falls into the one or two per cent of people who have not had problems yet. Lucky: Plastic surgeon Dr Constantino Mendieta, pictured with Ms Williams, said that she has been very fortunate not to have suffered any medical complications as a result of her surgeries . 'But the question is, what happens further down the road?' When issues do flare up Dr Mendieta said that it usually begins with discolouration of the skin near the injection point. This can then become inflamed, with itching and hardening. When the fat cells start to die, ulcers begin forming in the tissue. This can result in complete disfigurement as the filler spreads through the body. Dr Mendieta said many victims end up 'medical cripples' and often it is too late to help them as the non-surgical silicone spreads throughout the body - rather than stay contained like an implant. Coveted: Ms Williams' friend Valencia Santiago, 39, pictured together, said that others are now getting surgery - often illegal - in order to emulate Ms Williams' figure . He added: 'Even though Tatiana has not had any issues up to this point, I would urge people never, ever use these injections in your body. You are playing Russian Roulette.' Ms Williams said that she has accepted she may one day pay a price for her curves but, for now, is determined to enjoy the life it has given her. She said: 'It's been 20 plus years now and I'll accept whatever comes of it in the future,' she said. 'I don't recommend people copy what I did - but I'm a risk taker and it has been a success. 'I'm in the body I have created and enjoying the lifestyle it has afforded me. 'I have no regrets about being the beautiful woman I am.'","Tatiana Williams has spent £60,000 on illegal surgeries over past 20 years .

"The murder trial of a jealous lover who killed nursing student Michelle Le begins on Monday, authorities have said. Giselle Esteban, 28, is charged with murdering Miss Le because she blamed her for destroying a relationship with her ex-boyfriend and father of her child. Miss Le was reported missing in May 2011 after she failed to return from a break during her shift at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Hayward, California. On trial: Giselle Esteban, 28, is facing murder charges over the death of nursing student Michelle Le in California last year . After a four-month intensive search operation, the San Francisco student was found in a makeshift grave in a canyon. Le's decomposing body was found in remote wasteland on September 17, 2011. Esteban, 28, who knew Miss Le from high school, was charged with Miss Le's murder on September 8, 2011 based on DNA evidence and the discovery of threatening text messages. Esteban’s texts all stemmed from jealousy that Miss Le was having an affair with her ex-boyfriend, the prosecution said. Scott Marasigan, who has a child with Esteban, continually denied any affair with Miss Le, but Esteban never believed him. He said Esteban became ‘so enraged that she began essentially to hunt down Michelle'. The 28-year-old has been brought to trial quickly as the prosecution skipped the preliminary hearing and presented their evidence to a criminal grand jury last December who indicted Esteban on a murder charge. Hunted: Michelle Le was missing for four months before her decomposing body was found in a makeshift grave in wasteland . Marasigan is believed to have dated Esteban, having a daughter with the woman in 2005, before they broke up. He was given full custody of their daughter in 2010. He then went on to date Miss Le although they didn't have a sexual relationship. However Esteban was furious that Marasigan and Miss Le continued to be friends, according to prosecutors. It is alleged that she stalked Miss Le to her place of work then hunted her down to kill her. Esteban sent messages to Marasigan, telling him that Miss Le ‘dug her own grave’ and ‘would not be around much longer'. She reportedly followed Miss Le to . the medical facility and attacked her in the parking lot before throwing . her body in her car and dumping her in a valley. It . is unclear how the nursing student died but there was blood found in . the back of Miss Le's own car which suggested that she was bleeding . heavily. Devastated family: Michael Le (left) Michelle's brother and cousin Krystine Dinh (right) at a news conference in September after Esteban was arrested . Miss Le's white Honda SUV was later seen driving out of the garage by video surveillance later that evening. The vehicle was found abandoned a few blocks away and it was unclear whether the student was driving it or not. Police believe an assault happened at the hospital’s car park as CCTV shows Esteban at the scene before and after Miss Le’s disappearance. Detectives said they found traces of Miss Le’s blood inside her SUV, as well as on one of Esteban’s shoes during a search of Esteban’s home. Marasigan described the mother of his child as manipulative and volatile, saying at times she had been institutionalized with manic depression and bipolar disorder.  Her behavior became so erratic in the days before Miss Le's death that Marasigan filed a restraining order. Esteban had a second child last November but her ex-boyfriend said he is not the father. The murder trial is expected to last one month.","Giselle Esteban, 28, charged with murder in California .

Gandhi gave many of the items to a close friend in 1924 when he was living at Palm Bun at Juhu in Maharashtra, India. They have been passed down the friend's family over the years who have now decided to sell the collection. The collection is now going under the hammer at auctioneers Mullock’s in Ludlow, Shropshire. Iconic: A shawl which was hand-woven by thread Gandhi spun himself on a charkha and frequently worn by peace activist . Pictorial maxim: Gandhi's carved three wise monkeys which depict speak no evil, hear no evil, see no evil . Richard Westwood-Brookes, the expert from Mullock’s, said: 'There is a huge collection of Gandhi material in the sale. 'It includes his leather sandals which really are iconic and were given to a friend in 1924. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi - more commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism in British-ruled India. Employing non-violent civil disobedience, Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for non-violence, civil rights and freedom across the world. The son of a senior government official, Gandhi was born in October 1869 and raised in a Bania community in coastal Gujarat, before training in law in London. He assumed leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921 and led nationwide campaigns for easing poverty, expanding women's rights, building religious and ethnic amity, increasing economic self-reliance, and above all for achieving Swaraj—the independence of India from British domination. He was assassinated on 30 January 1948 by Nathuram Godse who thought Gandhi was too sympathetic to India's Muslims. 'They are not in the best condition, but that doesn’t really matter to serious collectors. 'We have grown a reputation for selling items of Indian origin in recent years, and buyers come from around the world. 'Items that belonged to Gandhi are accorded great significance and status by many people in India and beyond. 'They are treated often has holy relics and the market is growing, particularly in the US, as well as in India. 'Other items in the sale in include many photographs and even his prayer beads. 'Among the photographs is one showing him in a smart suit and carrying a hat from when he worked in the legal profession - as far removed from his usual image as it is possible to get.' Not only are the sandals part of the famous image of the Gandhi, along with his spectacles and loin cloth, but they have spawned a phrase. ‘Gandhi’s flip-flop’ entered the lexicon to describe a dry mouth the night after drinking heavily. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi - known as Mahatma Gandhi - was the leader of Indian nationalism and was famous for using non-violent civil disobedience. He lived modestly and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn he had hand spun on a charkha.

"When Boston bombing survivor Rebekah DiMartino awoke this morning to see part of her left leg had been amputated, she was ecstatic. 'There is not an ounce of sadness anywhere in my heart,' the 27-year-old wrote on Facebook. 'What has been anticipated and stressed about since April 2013 is over and I am moving on to the next chapter.' The married mother-of-one had the lower part of her left leg amputated at Memorial Hermann Katy Hospital near Houston, Texas on Monday after doctors struggled to save it for 18 months. After the successful operation, she shared a selfie of her grinning beside her son Noah, seven. Recovering: Boston Bombing victim Rebekah DiMartino (left) woke up from surgery on Monday after having part of her left leg removed. After she woke up, she snapped a photo with her seven-year-old son, Noah . Fighter: On Tuesday, she shared an image showing her left leg, which was amputated below the knee . On Tuesday, she shared her excitement with her supporters on her Facebook page. 'Last night I didn't sleep a wink but it wasn't because of nerves,' she wrote. 'Instead it was from the excitement of thinking about all the goals I have for myself going forward. 'Life has never promised to be easy but guess what? That's ok. Because when we find that silver lining in the toughest of places, it always seems to be worth it. 'And sometimes that may mean making tough decisions to get rid of what is holding us back. But I'm here to tell you that when that happens...the possibilities are endless.' She was also upbeat before the surgery, hosting a 'left leg last supper' on Sunday and bidding the troublesome limb a farewell with a lengthy farewell message. DiMartino was with her son  and then-boyfriend, Pete DiMartino, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring  270. Still smiling: DiMartino, pictured with her husband Pete (right) and other family members before her surgery . Injuries: Ahead of the surgery, she shared this image, left, showing her saying goodbye to the leg. Since the bombing, she has undergone 17 operations, including having pins put in her leg, right . Saying goodbye: She posted this farewell note to her left leg on her Facebook page on Sunday . All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg. In a bid to save the limb, she underwent 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, but she also suffered a serious bone infection. Although she has been confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time since the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year. Still, even a boot has not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'. 'The fact that I was given a second chance at life that day is something that I will never again take for granted,' DiMartino told NBC. 'If I have to lose my leg in that process, so be it, because I'm still here.' She said her seven-year-old son has long been upset about her potentially losing her leg, but last week, after asking her a lot of questions about her operation, that changed. 'With the biggest smile on his face he shouted 'that's so cool! I'm gonna have a part robot mom!'' she wrote on her Facebook page. Staying strong: The couple are pictured together before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch before a Red Sox game at Fenway Park in May. She has spent much time in a wheelchair or on bedrest . Excitement: She said that her seven-year-old son Noah, pictured, is excited to have a 'part robot mom' Her doctors say they are hopeful that she could be taking her first steps in three months. 'I think that with that kind of attitude and drive that she'll actually do very, very well,' Dr. Bill McGarvey said. 'If we can get rid of the pain for her, I have no doubt that she's going to be successful.' Rebekah is now hoping to compete in next year's Boston Marathon and to complete a triathlon, she told NBC. 'I've never been a runner, an outdoors person, but now I want to climb mountains, I want to run marathons,' she said. 'I still have a lot of living left to do.' She is also now starting to do motivational speaking and has moved to Richmond, Texas with her son and new husband. 'Monday is the day that my new life begins,' she wrote. 'And I am SO excited to see what it holds.'","Rebekah DiMartino, a married mother, has undergone 17 operations since the April 2013 blast and continues to be in excruciating pain .

"Talk about bad timing. On the same day Secretary of State John Kerry held up a new United Nations climate change report as evidence of global warming, a record-breaking storm hit his home state of Massachusetts, which he was visiting that day for a funeral and a football game. The local temperature fell to 36 degrees that morning and snow and wind blasted the state. 'The bottom line is that our planet is warming due to human actions, the damage is already visible, and the challenge requires ambitious, decisive and immediate action,' Kerry said in a statement on Sunday responding to  the release of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change review. A casually clad John Kerry, right, enters the stadium of the New England Patriots with team owner Robert Kraft, left, before Sunday's game between the Patriots and the Denver Broncos. Kerry sat with Kraft in his indoor box while regular Patriot fans suffered through 20 degree weather in order to see their team play . As the statement was released, temperatures were dropping in New England and snow began to blanket the north east, leading to the most snow fall on record for Nov. 2 in the Bay State in 120 years. Later in the day the snow dissipated and just rain and sleet came down throughout the afternoon, the Boston Globe reports. Still, enough snow fell that the field of the New England Patriots had to be cleaned off ahead of their early evening football game, which Kerry attended with Patriots owner Robert Kraft and watched from a cozy seat in Kraft's indoor box, as CNS News pointed out. Outdoors, average Patriots fans braved the 40 degree weather and 13 mile an hour winds that made the temperature feel like a chilly 32 degrees Fahrenheit to see their team play. Temperatures crept back up into the low 50s today today, Weather Channel data shows. The UN's latest climate change report follows claims by Weather Channel founder John Coleman that man-made global warming is not real. In an open letter last week to the Intergovernmental Panel, Coleman said, 'I have studied this topic seriously for years. It has become a political and environment agenda item, but the science is not valid.' Warming has not occurred for a decade and a half, Coleman said. 'There is no significant man-made global warming at this time, there has been none in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future.' The Weather Channel immediately disavowed Coleman and trumpeted its own views that 'strong evidence' points to an increase in temperatures globally as the result of human activity. 'The science is really clear, and I don't like our brand being associated with something that's not scientifically based,' Weather Channel CEO David Kenny told CNN. Besides, Kenny said, Coleman hasn't been affiliated with the organization he founded for thirty years. Secretary of State Kerry was in his home state on Sunday to attend the funeral of former Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. A record-breaking snow storm hit Massachusetts that day just as Kerry released a statement sounding the alarm on global warming . On Sunday Coleman assailed Kenny on CNN and pointed out that unlike the current CEO of his former company he is a scientist who bases his arguments on fact. He also pooh poohed Reliable Sources host Brian Stelter, whose show he appeared on, for labeling him a climate 'denier' when he is merely a 'skeptic.' 'CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming,' he said, and claims 'that it is a consensus.' 'Well there is no consensus in science. Science isn’t a vote. Science is about facts,' he told Stelter. Coleman lamented the fact that climate change had become politicized and a major part of the Democratic Party's platform. 'But he science is on my side,' he said, triumphantly. He later told CNN viewers, ‘Hello, everybody! There is no global warming!' Democrat Kerry said on Sunday that not only is the climate warming, the world is on its way to 'a large scale disaster.' 'The longer we are stuck in a debate over ideology and politics, the more the costs of inaction grow and grow,' the Obama official said in an official government statement. 'Those who choose to ignore or dispute the science so clearly laid out in this report do so at great risk for all of us and for our kids and grandkids,' he continued. The UN report warned 'the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, and sea level has risen.' 'It is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer, and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions,' it went on to say. Kerry, who has equated the importance of acting to slow down global climate change with the necessity of ending terrorism, proclaimed on Sunday that 'greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are higher than ever, and we're seeing more and more extreme weather and climate events.' That includes storms, heat waves and downpours, he said. And 'it's not a coincidence.' 'With this report, we have yet another round of authoritative, peer-reviewed science to prove it,' he asserted.","A record-breaking storm hit his home state of Massachusetts, which he was visiting that day for a funeral and a football game .

"She may be head of state but the Queen, it seems, is as impatient as any excited great-grandmother-to-be. Speaking for the entire nation yesterday, she urged the Duchess of Cambridge’s baby to ‘hurry up’. And she revealed she was keen for a quick arrival because ‘I’m going on holiday soon’. Watch video of the comments below... Thrilled: Fay Batey is the bold schoolgirl who asked the Queen the frank question: 'Would you like the baby to be a boy or a girl?' To which the Queen, pictured smiling in Cumbria today, admitted she would like the royal baby to 'hurry up' before she goes off on holiday to Balmoral . Magic moment: Fay Batey, 10, (with her back to the camera) asks the . Queen her question - whether she would like the Royal baby to be a boy or a . girl . The 87-year-old, who will leave . Buckingham Palace next week to spend the summer at Balmoral in Scotland, . made her unprecedented off-the-cuff comments on a trip to Lake . Windermere in Cumbria. During a walkabout she met . ten-year-old schoolgirl Fay Batey, who summoned up the courage to ask . her: ‘Do you want Kate’s baby to be a boy or a girl?’ The Queen replied instantly: ‘I don’t think I mind.’ Then, after a short pause, she said: . ‘I would very much like it to arrive because I’m going on holiday . soon... I wish it would hurry up.’ Turning to move on, she added with a laugh: ‘No sign yet!’ Her comment to Fay, a pupil at Wiggonby CofE School, near Wigton, Cumbria, drew laughter from the watching crowds. But it will have done nothing to cheer . the dozens of reporters and camera crews gathered outside the Lindo . Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London, who have been . waiting for up to two weeks in blistering heat for the baby to arrive. Delighted: Fay said she felt excited but a bit nervous before asking the question. She said she thought the Queen was 'really pretty' Visit: Queen Elizabeth II talks to school children from Wiggonby Church of England School, and one of their pupils asked about the future king or queen . Anticipation: Press have been camped outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, for days waiting for the arrival of the royal baby . Kensington Palace has always refused . to reveal the duchess’s due date, although Kate let slip during an . engagement earlier this year that the future third in line to the throne . was expected in ‘mid July’. Early reports had suggested July 13 or 15 as the likely date, but these have come and gone without incident. Kate is now overdue. This will be of . little concern to her doctors, however, who are unlikely to consider . inducing labour until she is at least a week overdue. For the time being she and her . temporarily off-duty husband Prince William are staying with her . parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, at their £4.8million mansion in . Berkshire to escape the city heat. Majestic: The Queen walks with businessman Bill Bewley on the bank of Lake Windermere in the sunny Lake District today . On board: Her majesty stood on the deck of the Teal Windermere Lake Cruise ship, at Bowness in Cumbria today . Attire: The Queen was wearing a Stewart Parvin outfit of a green and blue with a hat by Rachel Trevor-Morgan, while her daughter Anne wore bright yellow . Aides are confident that even if the . duchess’s contractions start while she is in the country, they can get . her into London with a police escort in less than an hour. Speaking about her encounter with the . Queen yesterday, Fay said: ‘We were talking about it on the journey down . and it [the baby] was the question everybody wanted to know. So I . decided to ask. ‘When I saw the Queen approaching, I felt excited but a bit nervous. She was really pretty. ‘I thought the Queen’s reply was a good one. After all, she wouldn’t want to have a baby while she was on holiday.’ Her sister Ella, 11, said: ‘The Queen had a really friendly atmosphere around her. She was very polite and kind.’ Mystery: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do not know if they are having a boy or a girl, which is now believed to be overdue . The girls have been learning about the . Royal Family at school, where teachers have taught them about the . significance of the royal baby, who may be the first female heir in . history to automatically succeed to the throne by right. Fay and Ella live in Wigton with their . seven-year-old brother and their parents Lynne, 38, who is about to . take over the family post office business, and Steven, 40, who owns a . mechanical company. Mrs Batey said last night: ‘We are all . delighted about Fay and Ella meeting the Queen. They have been giddy . with excitement all week. ‘We discussed it the night before, and we asked the girls what they would say if they had the chance to meet the Queen. ‘Fay did say that she would like to . know if the Queen would prefer the child to be a boy or a girl. But it . was very much a jokey conversation, we didn’t think for one minute that . she would come into such close proximity.’ Having fun: An animated Queen to local residents as she travels on the Teal cruise boat on a glorious day in Cumbria .

"Chins are the new boobs according to latest plastic surgery figures. Chin implants - coined 'chinplants' - are becoming the fastest growing cosmetic surgery trend, according . to statistics released by the American Society of Plastic . Surgeons (ASPS) and grew more than breast augmentation, Botox and liposuction combined in 2011. Experts suggest the trend has been prompted by increased use of video conferencing in the workplace which causes employees to focus on their facial appearance. Growing trend: This patient underwent a chin implant, rhinoplasty, and neck liposuction to change the shape of her face - pictures courtesy of Dr. Sherman, a plastic surgeon based in San Diego . Overall more than 20,000 procedures were carried out in the U.S. in 2011, the . largest increase was seen in patients aged 40 plus, but their was also a sharp rise in patients in their twenties. The two most popular options include a mentoplasty, which decreases the size of a chin which 'juts out' or is perceived as being too large and maxillofacial corrective surgery which actually alters the jaw position. The plastic surgery web site RealSelf.com revealed the average cost of a chin implant in the U.S. as $4,671 (£2,950) while the largest UK cosmetic surgery provider, Transform, states a starting price of £4,290. Before surgery - which can take up to four hours in some cases - patients are usually given a local anaesthetic.to numb the area and a silicone implant is inserted under the chin to give a stronger, more defined jawline. 'I do a lot of video chats and noticed that my double chin was very pronounced. It really, really bothered me,' said software manager Lizette Stephens . In many cases the patient can return home the same day, with soreness and swelling lasting for around 2 weeks. Commenting on the latest findings ASPS president Dr Malcolm Roth said: 'The chin and jawline are among the first areas to show signs of aging. 'People are considering chin augmentation as a way to restore their youthful look just like a facelift or eyelid surgery. 'We also know that as more people see . themselves on video chat technology, they may notice that their jawline . is not as sharp as they want it to be.' Lizette Stephens, a . manager at a software company, opted for a chin plant as new . telecommunication technologies made her increasingly conscious of her . double chin. She said: 'I do a lot of video chats . and I'm in a lot of photos and noticed that my double chin was very . pronounced. It really, really bothered me. 'I wanted to do something about it to get a more profound profile and more definition in my chin area.' Overall: 20,680 (+ 71 per cent) Women: 10,087 (+ 66 per cent) Men: 10,593 (+ 76 per cent) 20-29 years: 2,750 (+ 68 per cent) 30-39 years: 2,587 (+ 69 per cent) 40-54 years: 5,075 (+ 77 per cent) 55 and over: 8,459 (+ 70 per cent) SOURCE: American Society of Plastic . Surgeons (ASPS) She received a chin implant from Dr Darrick Antell, an ASPS Member Surgeon based in New York. Dr Antell, who has studied the . profiles of many chief executives, said: 'We know that chief executives . tend to be tall, attractive, good-looking people. 'We now know that these people . also tend to have a stronger chin. 'As a result, people subconsciously . associate a stronger chin with more authority, self-confidence and . trustworthiness.' Other cosmetic procedures that saw . an increase in popularity in the U.S. last year included lip augmentation . (up 49 per cent), cheek implants (up 47 per cent), laser skin . resurfacing (up nine per cent), soft tissue fillers (up seven per cent) and facelifts (up five per cent). According to the Enterprise Business Video Forecast: 2011-16 video conferencing is becoming one of the fastest growing IT markets in the world and by 2016 the industry will be worth £2.3bn. Orders for telepresence have already been signed by a number of global organisations, including HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline and News Corporation, whose executives are using the technology as a replacement for travelling to face-to-face meetings. Richard Thurston, Ovum analyst and author of the report, commented: 'Enterprises are seizing the huge opportunity that video conferencing offers them to cut costs and improve productivity by reducing business travel. 'They are starting to use video conferencing much more frequently because of ongoing economic concerns, continued efforts to reduce their carbon footprint, enhancements in video technology and price reductions that are improving the business case.' Despite chin implants taking off in the U.S., in the UK the procedure is still relatively rare. A spokesperson from UK cosmetic surgery provider, Transform, said: ‘Chin implants are still relatively rare in the UK, although they’ve been available to clients for more than 10 years. 'Over the past 18 months to two years we’ve seen a steady increase in the number of those opting for the procedure, but we’re around three years behind the U.S. so we expect a similar pattern to gradually emerge.'","20,680 chin augmentations carried out in the U.S. in 2011 .

"The average American is 20 pounds heavier today then they were in the 1990s, a new report shows. The poll by annual Gallup Health and Healthcare Survey found that American men, on average, say they weigh 196 pounds and women say they weigh 160 pounds. Both figures are nearly 20 pounds higher than the average that men and women reported 20 years ago. Overweight: The average American is 20 pounds heavier today then they were in the 1990s, a new report shows (file photo) As Americans' actual weight has increased, so has their ideal weight. For men, it is now 181 pounds (up from 177 pounds), and for women, it is now 138 pounds (up from 137), according to the report. Researchers say this means that not only do men and women report that they weigh more today versus 20 years ago, but they are also getting further away from their ideal weight. Comparing the self-reports of actual and ideal weights, the average man weighs 15 pounds more than his ideal today, compared with nine pounds in 1990. The average woman weighs 22 pounds more than her ideal today, compared with 13 pounds in 1990. The current figures for men and women are the highest Gallup has measured to date. Getting fatter: The poll found that American men, on average, say they weigh 196 pounds - nearly 20 pounds heavier than reported in 1990 . These results are based on Gallup's annual Health and Healthcare survey, conducted Nov. 3-6. Gallup has asked Americans to say how much they weigh yearly since 2001 and in 1990 and 1999. The survey concluded that 64 per cent of men and 68 per cent of women in America are currently over their ideal weight. In a separate daily polling, Gallup and . Healthways track Americans' found that 62 per cent of Americans were . either overweight or obese in the third quarter of this year. Expanding waistlines: The poll found that average American women say they weigh 160 pounds -  nearly 20 pounds higher than 20 years ago . However, this figure far exceeds the percentage of Americans who personally describe themselves as overweight - just 39 per cent - with the majority (56 per cent)  saying their weight is 'about right,' as previous polls in the past 20 years have also shown. Researchers say the disconnect between the percentage who are over their ideal weight and the percentage who say they are overweight may come from Americans' own reluctance to describe themselves using such a term. Additionally, Gallup's data found that roughly one in four Americans are between one and 10 pounds over their ideal weight, many of whom may be more inclined to view their weight as 'about right' than as 'overweight'. Results for this Gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted between November 3 and 6 with a random sample of 1,012 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all U.S. states, selected using random sampling.","62% of Americans are either overweight or obese .
Yet, over 50% believe their weight is 'about right'"
"The asteroids would cause catastrophic damage, on a city-sized scale or larger. Research from the University of Southhampton has identified the countries most likely to be worst hit. They have identified for the first time those which will suffer catastrophic loss of life or be so crippled it will be almost impossible for them to recover. Nasa's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer has sampled 107 'potentially hazardous' asteroids near Earth - 330ft wide or larger - to make estimates about how many are out there - and the figure is a terrifying 47,000.

The top 10 countries most likely to be affected are, in in no particular order: . The PHAs - potentially hazardous asteroids - have the closest orbits to Earth's, coming within five million miles  and they are big enough to survive passing through Earth's atmosphere and cause damage on a regional, or greater, scale.The new results come from the asteroid-hunting portion of the WISE mission, called NEOWISE. The project sampled 107 PHAs to make predictions about the entire population as a whole. Findings indicate there are roughly 4,700 PHAs, plus or minus 1,500, with diameters larger than 330 feet . So far, an estimated 20 to 30 percent of these objects have been found. Scientists have also drawn up a league table of the countries which will be worst affected in the event of an asteroid strike. They have identified for the first time those which will suffer catastrophic loss of life or be so crippled it will be almost impossible for them to recover. The list has been compiled by researchers from the University of Southampton using software called called NEOimpactor, short for NASA's ‘NEO’ or Near Earth Object programme. Overall the top ten countries most at risk are: China, Indonesia, India, Japan, the U.S, the Philippines, Italy, the U.K, Brazil and Nigeria.'The NEOWISE analysis shows us we've made a good start at finding those objects that truly represent an impact hazard to Earth,' said Lindley Johnson, program executive for the Near-Earth Object Observation Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'But we've many more to find, and it will take a concerted effort during the next couple of decades to find all of them that could do serious damage or be a mission destination in the future.' 'The NEOWISE analysis shows us we've made a good start at finding those objects that truly represent an impact hazard to Earth,' said Lindley Johnson, program executive for the Near-Earth Object Observation Program at NASA Headquarters in Washington . The PHAs - potentially hazardous asteroids - have the closest orbits to Earth's, coming within five million miles  and they are big enough to survive passing through Earth's atmosphere and cause damage on a regional, or greater, scale . The new analysis also suggests that about twice as many PHAs as previously thought are likely to reside in 'lower incination' orbits, which are more aligned with the plane of Earth's orbit. Asteroids with lower-inclination orbits would be more likely to encounter Earth. They would also be easier to reach. The results therefore suggest more near-Earth objects might be available for future robotic or human missions.Amy Mainzer  at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 'Everything we can learn about these objects helps us understand their origins and fate. Our team was surprised to find the overabundance of low-inclination PHAs. Because they will tend to make more close approaches to Earth, these targets can provide the best opportunities for the next generation of human and robotic exploration.'The discovery that many PHAs tend to be bright says something about their composition; they are more likely to be either stony, like granite, or metallic. This type of information is important in assessing the space rocks' potential hazards to Earth. The composition of the bodies would affect how quickly they might burn up in our atmosphere if an encounter were to take place.The NEOWISE results have been accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal.The WISE spacecraft scanned the sky twice in infrared light before entering hibernation mode in early 2011. It catalogued hundreds of millions of objects, including super-luminous galaxies, stellar nurseries and closer-to-home asteroids. The NEOWISE project snapped images of about 600 near-Earth asteroids, about 135 of which were new discoveries.","10 countries likely to be worst affected identified .

"Joshua R. Hensler, social media manager at US Airways, calls himself a 'web alchemist' and 'aggressive engineer of perception' on his LinkedIn profile. His boasts will be taken in a very different light today as he emerged as a manager at the US Airways social media team behind what has been branded the 'worst tweet of all time'. An employee sparked a firestorm on Twitter yesterday after an extremely graphic picture of a woman engaged in a sex act with a model Boeing 777 was tweeted to a customer who complained about her Spring Break flight - and to its 418,000 followers. Scroll down for video . 'Web alchemist' and 'aggressive engineer of perception': Joshua R. Hensler, the social media manager at US Airways has apparently called the employee responsible a 'giant a**hole' Graphic: US Airways has apologized after their official Twitter account tweeted an extremely inappropriate photo (which MailOnline has blanked over) on Monday afternoon . It quickly became one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter - a dream for any social media manager. But for Hensler it wasn't the 'perception engineering' he had in mind. While it is not yet known which employee was behind the monumental error, Hensler apparently had some choice words for him or her. Reacting today in the only way he would - on social media - he posted on Facebook: 'Whenever someone says: ""I'm sorry, it's just who I am."" What they really mean is: ""I am a giant a**hole and have no plans of improving myself as a human""'. He has since deleted the message from his public profile. This was hours after he posted, in a huge understatement: 'I've seen better days'. Hensler, who works out of the airline's headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, was unavailable for comment. But a spokesman for USAirways' partner American Airlines said Hensler had no involvement with the incident and was not managing the team. The spokesman claimed the Facebook messages were unrelated. The 30-year-old, who says on Facebook he is in an open relationship, went to Westminster College in Pennsylvania, and boasts on his LinkedIn profile that he is the 'Captain of Crunch Time' and his responsibilities include being part of the Crisis and Communications Response Team. Those skills will be sorely needed now. Choice words: Hensler reacts, appropriately on Facebook, to the monumental error that has attracted all the wrong sort of attention to US Airways . Captain of Crunch Time: Hensler talks the language of the internet on his LinkedIn profile . US Airways has had to profusely apologize for the mistake which has spawned a torrent of puns mocking the airline online. Today, the airline said it will not fire the employee, adding that it was an 'honest mistake' and and an 'attempt to flag the tweet as inappropriate'. 'We captured it, flagged it as inappropriate,' a spokesman for the airline said. 'We are in the midst of reviewing our processes but for the most part we have an understanding of what happened and how to ensure how it won't happen in the future.' It all started when the image was initally posted to the USAirways Twitter stream by a user. It was flagged as inappropriate by the team that manages their Twitter account. But then a young woman, Alex, tweeted directly to US Airways early on Monday morning that her flight to Portland had been delayed - demanding 'free stuff' because her vacation was off to a bad start. In reply, the airlines official Twitter account replied, 'We don’t like to hear this, Alex.  Please provide feedback to our Customer Relations team here,' and attached the explicit photograph of the nude woman out to its followers 'by accident'. US Airways said: 'We apologize for an . inappropriate image recently shared as a link in one of our responses. We’ve removed the tweet and are investigating.' The . tweet was deleted but spent 22 minutes online - enough time to cause a . frenzy of sharing among incredulous users of the social media app. Incredulous: The public's reaction to US Airways staggering tweet ranged from humor to sympathy for whoever was responsible .

"Two Florida hunters have captured a 765lb alligator with their bare hands after spending several months tracking it down. Keith Kelley and Kelly Sziy, both from Jacksonville, successfully lured the 13ft-long creature, nicknamed 'Lumpy', with bait at St John's River in the early hours of last Sunday. With just 'a rope, a few hooks and their strength', they waded into the water, before pouncing on the alligator and dragging it on to the shore. They later killed it to use for processed meat. Scroll down for video . A big catch: Keith Kelley and Kelly Sziy, both from Jacksonville, Florida, have captured a 765lb alligator with their bare hands after spending several months tracking it down. Above, the pose with the dead creature . Hunters: The pair successfully lured the 13ft-long creature, nicknamed 'Lumpy', with bait at St Johns River in the early hours of last Sunday. They then caught it using just 'a rope, a few hooks and their strength' On Thursday, Mr Kelley said he was delighted that he and Mr Sziy had finally captured 'Lumpy' following months of tracking the beast at the spot in St John's County. 'He got close enough to where I guess he couldn't withstand the bait. Finally, it was just his night,' he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. '[I] put some leather gloves on and I told Kelly, ""we're going to have to get him by hand and that's all it is to it. Hang on"".' Following the capture near Riverdale, where alligators are as common as crocodiles are in the Northern Territory, Mr Kelley and Mr Sziy took 'Lumpy' to Alligator Farm to be measured. Watch the full CBS WJAX-TV report here. Proud: Mr Sziy is pictured posing with the alligator, which was later killed and used for processed meat . Enormous: On Thursday, Mr Kelley said he was delighted that he and Mr Sziy (both picture) had finally captured 'Lumpy' following months of tracking the alligator at the picturesque spot in St John's County . Unsurprisingly, the enormous animal broke the scales at 765lb and a staggering 13 feet long, according to ActionNewsJax.com. 'Usually when people say they've seen a large alligator, it's usually around 11 feet or so,' said Jim Barlington, the facility's curator of reptiles. 'So, 13 feet, close to 13 1/2 feet is definitely rare.' Mr Kelley and Mr Sziy later killed the alligator, before posing for a series of photos and uploading them to Facebook. The creature's head will now be mounted on Mr Kelley's wall.

Unsurprisingly, the enormous animal broke the scales at 765lb and a staggering 13 feet long . Scene: The alligator was caught at St Johns River (pictured) in St John's County, near Jacksonville . Officials at Florida Fish and Wildlife are currently investigating whether the alligator is the largest in the state to have been captured by hand. In the meantime, Mr Kelley said he and Mr Sziy are 'looking forward to their next large and lumpy catch. 'I don't know if there's another one out there, but we'll definitely be looking,' he said.","Keith Kelley and Kelly Sziy lured the alligator with bait at St John's River .

"These stunning photographs look like the ultimate holiday snaps of idyllic tropical destinations. But in fact, the images were not even taken outside - they were crafted in a studio using props including nuts, chocolate and jelly bean. Artist Matthew Albanese spent up to 700 hours on each fake landscape, making them into lifelike depictions of scenes such as a desert island, a lightning storm and a brook at sunset. Tropical: But this photograph does not show a real landscape, and was made from turkey feathers and cooking sugar . Coral reef: This work, 'How to Breathe Underwater', uses clever lighting to appear as if it were made under the sea . Scary: 'Box of Lightning' has a black plexiglass background and is backlit to create the lightning effect . One piece even appears to show an underwater coral reef - but the marine ambience was created with lighting and innovative materials. To make the piece he used walnuts, candle wax, wire, glitter, peanut shells, dead starfish, compressed moss, jellybeans, coated seashells, toothpaste, clay, figs, feathers, cotton earbuds and chocolates. The surface of the ocean is actually a vinyl shower curtain over suspended plexiglass, while the piece's underwater glow comes from fake fog and a video projector. The 30-year-old from Englewood, New Jersey has been making his deceptive artworks for the past three years. Naturalistic: 'New Life 1' was made from ostrich feathers, a painted paper background and even chocolate for the mud . Turbulent: 'New Life 2' depicts the same scene but in stormy weather, showing the artist's versatility . Countryside: 'Willow Study 1' sewing thread, sticks, wood and feathers, with fake moss and dip-dyed cotton for the grass . Mystery: Even at close up, it can be hard to work out what Mr Albanese's works are really made of . 'I'm trying to change people's perspectives of small objects by creating something big with them,' Mr Albanese said. For the storm depicted in 'Box of Lightning', the artist etched lightning bolts into a backlit slab of black plexiglass, allowing the light to pass through. 'I became very interested in creating an illusion of light - so I created light boxes and modifiers,' he said. 'I set the scene to depict how it would look in nature - the lighting bolts serve as the only source of light in the entire image.' Hard at work: Mr Albanese finesses cotton clouds which fill the sky in his work 'Paradise' Craftsman: The base for 'Paradise' was made out of caramelised sugar which resembles the ocean . Elaborate: Each miniature piece takes up to 700 hours to create - all for the sake of a single photograph . Technical: The artist has been producing his unique creations for the past three years . Mr Albanese has been fascinated by miniature movie sets since childhood, and when he was a student at the State University of New York at Purchase he made table-top dioramas. For 'New Life 1' and 'New Life 2', he created a willow tree from hand-dyed ostrich feathers, painted parchment paper water, chocolate mud, wire, cotton, coffee, synthetic potting moss and raffia ribbon. 'A mistake with something when making one set can actually lead to new discoveries and new ideas on how to use the materials I find,' he said. 'So mistakes can actually create entirely new sets. 'I'm always looking at materials and seeing what I could do differently with them.' Innovation: Mr Albanese etched lightning bolts into a sheet of black plexiglass to light up one of his works . Set: Mr Albanese, 30, works out of his studio set up in his living room in Englewood, New Jersey . 'Paradise' took four months to complete, and is comprised of spray-painted turkey feathers for the palm trees, and cooked sugar on top of tin foil for the water. His 'Willow Study 1' was created from sewing thread, sticks, wood and hand dyed ostrich plumes. The grass in the set was made of faux potting moss and dip dyed cotton. Mr Albanese has completed about 30 sets in total and is releasing his new book, Strange Worlds, in October. Careful: Delicate objects such as the willow tree made from ostrich feathers in 'New Life 1' require a deft touch . Different angle: Looking at 'New Life 2' side on clearly shows that it is a product of artificial creation . Misleading: The underwater effects in some works are created by clever use of the camera and lights .","Matthew Albanese, 30, constructs miniature tropical scenes using everyday household objects .

"A local businessman has become involved in a bitter dispute with his realtor after he claims he almost moved into a property built ontop of a notorious child-sex and murder den. Nir Golan had placed his deposit down and was packed and ready to move to the seaside town of Seabrook, near Houston, when he discovered his home was built on the site locals call 'Murder Mansion'. Indeed, Golan claims that his realtor dropped the leasing price so low he couldn't refuse it, but now is battling to get his money back because he thinks the home might be haunted. Murder mansion: This is the property at the center of a lease dispute in Texas - which was on the site of a previous home which saw a gruesome killing . 'A lot of people say there's shadows of children,' said Golan to KHOU. 'People say that they wouldn't come to my house as a guest.' The horrifying past of the property the home was built on dates back to 1984 and Texan millionaire Bill List, who built a massive mansion on the site. He would pick up young teenage boys and house them in exchange for sexual favors. However, one night, the children rebelled and shot and killed List. Afterwards, the home was torn down and the property was subdivided. But, Golan's realtor neglected to mention any of the terrible history. 'I said let me tell you something. If you paid me money, I would not move there. It's against my religion. You cannot force me to move there,' said Golan to KHOU. Disputed: Nir Golan wants his money back because he doesn't want to live in a property he feels may be haunted . Huge: This is mansion millionaire Bill List built in 1984 which he used to sexually abuse young teenage boys  - who one day turned against him . Golan claims it does not matter where the murders take place, just that they did on the land. 'There was a murder, but the murder wasn't in this house. It was on the property. And I'm trying to explain to him to me it doesn’t matter. A property is your front yard, your backyard,' said Golan. A neighbor and former HOA president told KHOU that everyone knows the story of the Murder Mansion. 'It was 30 years ago. I mean it didn’t bother me to the point, I mean, I was gonna buy the old murder mansion and redevelop it. So you know people die all the time,' said Larry Neu. Wealthy: List's enormous mansion featured an indoor swmimming pool and a two story glass wall overlooking the water feature . Interior and movie: The mansion was enormous inside with its own garden and the gruesome killing had its own movie made (right) Dining room: List would reportedly cruise Houston looking for young teen boys and bring them back to his sprawling mansion and offer them board and drugs in exchange for sex before they ganged up and killed him . While the homeowner had agree to terminate the lease, they will not return the deposit - a decision that infuriates Golan. Golan tells KHOU he is planning to sue to get his money back but a lawyer said he is on shaky ground. 'That law in Texas is clear. There is not a duty to disclose in most circumstances. And on the issue of religion, there is no duty of the seller to be a mind reader and guess the religious objections a renter could have,' said Gerald Treece, a professor at the South Texas College of Law.","Texas man Nir Golan is involved in dispute with his realtor after he agreed to lease a home built on the site of a notorious murder .

"As the most fouled player in the Premier League, you might expect Eden Hazard to be bored of having his legs taken away from under him. But the Belgian winger, doesn't seem to mind, saying he is used to being kicked by opponents, and it spurs him on to be a better player. Hazard has suffered 102 fouls so far this season, in League and Champions League games, but the Chelsea star claims it actually makes him happy when opponents target him, and he has learned not to react. Eden Hazard, the Premier League's most fouled player, endures another tough tackle against Burnley . Hazard has been on the receiving end of a foul over 100 times already this season, the most in England . The Belgian winger insists being kicked by opponents spurs him on to do better, rather than making him angry . 'I don’t see the point in reacting,' Hazard told the Independent. 'True, it’s a human response but it is the way I have been brought up. I have been used to taking the knocks. The more I take, the happier I am. 'It always makes me want to outdo them but in a football way and I don’t want to make their life a misery by kicking them. I want to hurt the opponent but in terms of the football. The one time Hazard did respond, it was a ball-boy on the receiving end, with the 24-year-old dismissed in controversial fashion. The 24-year-old has only had one red card in his Chelsea career, when kicked a ball boy against Swansea . Hazard controls the ball in training ahead of the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham on Sunday . 'That [Swansea red card] was the only one,' he added. It’s true that I don’t normally get red cards. I am still young. Maybe with age it will come. Maybe I will become more aggressive but I hope not.' Hazard has been in scintaliting form this season, overcoming the knocks to score 13 goals already this season, and create plenty more, something he attributes to manager Jose Mourinho's guidance. 'It’s true we do have a special relationship,' continued Hazard, who will hope to inspire Chelsea to success at Wembley on Sunday in the Capital One cup final. Hazard (fourth right) praised Jose Mourinho for instilling a team mentality at Chelsea this season . The Chelsea manager has a 'special relationship' with his star player, and lets him express himself . 'What is good about him as a coach is that he lets us play. He lets me play. He is not always on at me and I really appreciate that. 'If it isn’t good he says so, if it is good he says so. He is always direct. But I don’t think he has changed me. He has taught me to become more professional and to be better on the pitch. 'I don’t think I have changed my mentality. You can’t change that. I am who I am.

"The adorable moment a bottlenose dolphin gave birth at a Chicago zoo has been caught on camera, showing the touching moment the mother helped her baby swim to the surface to take her first breath. Brookfield Zoo's latest arrival was born at about 11am on Friday last week, two hours after her 26-year-old mother showed signs of being in labor. The video shows Allie twisting through the water while another member of the pod keeps a close watch as the baby is born tail first. Scroll down for video: .

New arrival: A bottlenose dolphin at Brookfield Zoo has given birth to a female calf . Healthy: The 3ft long, 40lb calf was born at the zoo on August 2 . 'We are encouraged right now with the . behavior we are seeing from both Allie and the calf,' Rita Stacey, . of Chicago Zoological Society, said. 'However, we remain cautiously optimistic as the first 30 days are extremely critical in the calf’s life.' Since becoming pregnant 12 months ago, Allie the dolphin has been monitored closely and had regular ultrasounds to check on the unborn calf's progress. During her labor the dolphin was kept company by another female at the zoo, Tapeko, who has had several calves in the past and is due to have another later this year. Labor: The 26-year-old dolphin was helped with the birth by her aquarium companion . Helpless: The calf is helped by her mother, Allie, to reach the surface so she can breathe . Feeding time: The calf nurses from her mother, who will supply milk for about 18 months . The zoo has closed off its dolphin exhibit while the new mother and calf settle into a routine. When they are first born, calves must be helped to the surface to breathe, and feed regularly from their mothers. It will be a while before the new addition makes her first public debut, but Sondra Katzen told the Chicago Tribune: 'We’re definitely excited.' When she is a little older the calf, which has not yet been named, will join her mother and the other bottlenose dolphins in the Brookfield Zoo Seven Seas exhibit.

"Researchers have resurrected a 700 year old virus they discovered in caribou poo. The team say their would shows the potential for bringing back other viruses to study their biology and work out how to beat them. The new viruses are hundreds of years old, and one of them probably infected plants the caribous ate. 700 year old frozen Caribou excrement: A careful examination  turned up two never-before-seen viruses which researchers were able to resurrect . The authors isolated the complete genome of a DNA virus from a 700-year-old ice core layer that was distantly related to plant and fungi-infecting viruses, and a partial viral RNA genome that was related to an insect-infecting cripavirus. Using a reverse genetics approach, the authors reconstituted the genome of the DNA virus to confirm whether the virus might infect plants. Introduced it to Nicotiana benthamiana, a close relative of tobacco, where it successfully infected both new leaves and leaves inoculated with the virus . The findings prove viruses can survive for surprisingly long periods of time in a cold environment, according to Eric Delwart, a researcher at Blood Systems Research Institute in San Francisco. His team analyzed the viral genetic material contained in a core drilled through layers of accumulated caribou feces up to 4,000 years old in an ice patch in Canada’s Selwyn Mountains. Caribou congregate on ice patches to escape insects and summer heat, and deposit feces containing partially digested plant material. The authors isolated the complete genome of a DNA virus from a 700-year-old ice core layer that was distantly related to plant and fungi-infecting viruses, and a partial viral RNA genome that was related to an insect-infecting cripavirus. The appearance of the viral material in the fecal samples suggests that the viruses may have originated in plants eaten by the caribou or flying insects attracted to the material. Using a reverse genetics approach, the authors reconstituted the genome of the DNA virus to confirm whether the virus might infect plants. They then introduced it to Nicotiana benthamiana, a close relative of tobacco, where it successfully infected both new leaves and leaves inoculated with the virus . Caribou congregate on ice patches to escape insects and summer heat, and deposit feces containing partially digested plant material. Plants inoculated with the ancient viral DNA displayed evidence of infection including replication of viral DNA in inoculated and newly emerging leaves. According to the authors, cryogenically preserved environmental samples may preserve ancient viral genetic material for present day study. 'Our finding indicates that cryogenically preserved materials can be repositories of ancient viral nucleic acids, which in turn allow molecular genetics to regenerate viruses to study their biology,' the team wrote. Using reverse genetics, the team reconstituted the DNA virus, which replicated and systemically spread in a model plant species. 'Knowledge of ancient viruses is limited due to their low concentration and poor preservation in ancient specimens. 'Using a viral particle-associated nucleic acid enrichment approach, we genetically characterized one complete DNA and one partial RNA viral genome from a 700-y-old fecal sample preserved in ice. 'Using reverse genetics, we reconstituted the DNA virus, which replicated and systemically spread in a model plant species. 'Under constant freezing conditions, encapsidated viral nucleic acids may therefore be preserved for centuries. ' As Arctic ice melts faster with climate change, it could release ancient viral particles into the environment—some of which could remain infectious, the team warns.","New viruses are hundreds of years old, and one of them probably infected plants the caribou ate .

"When it comes to our sex lives it seems that, for many of us, the most action we're getting is a poke on Facebook. A new survey from condom brand Durex has revealed that British lovers are allowing technology to get in the way of their sex lives. In a poll of 2000 men and women over 15 per cent of women and 17 per cent of men admitted to answering their phone or reading a text message during sex, a figure that rises in the capital to 20 per cent. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Some 40 per cent of us agree that technology is getting in the way of our relationship . Some of us have even admitted to side lining our lovers in favour of social networks, with a shocking five per cent saying they had even checked Facebook while making love. Men are twice as likely to make the social media faux pas as women with eight per cent of men admitting to checking a social network compared to just four per cent of women. It appears that our infatuation with our tech could be damaging our real life relationships. Some 30 per cent of respondents said that their partner had been distracted by some sort of tech device whilst they were getting intimate, nearly three in ten believing that it gets in the way of their sex life and 40 per cent agreeing or strongly agreeing that it has a negative effect on their relationship. A further 60 per cent also admitted that they actually spend more time using technology while in bed with their partner than having sex. This problem of third wheeling laptops and gooseberry iPads is something that, unsurprisingly, is affecting the younger generation more than their older counterparts. Over half of 18-24 year olds believe that technology is adversely affecting their relationship compared with only a quarter of over 55s. Sex and Relationship expert, Susan . Quilliam, said: 'Many people find love through dating websites or social . media - but it's a worrying trend that many are also feeling gradually . ousted in their relationships in favour of interaction online.' As a call to action, Durex is . releasing a short film which follows the stories of several couples who, . like most of us, have become seduced by the lure of a screen and . encourages people to make the most of Earth Hour by reconnecting whilst . the lights are off. Earth . Hour is an annual event organised by charity, WWF to encourage people . around the world to turn off their lights for one hour to celebrate . their commitment to the planet. Durex is celebrating the annual event by encouraging people to not only turn off all lights on 29 . March but to also switch off their tech, and use the opportunity to . reconnect with each other whilst the lights are off. As part of Earth Hour on 29 March, Durex is encouraging us to turn our tech off and turn our partners on . Susan goes on to say: 'There is, of course, a great place for technology in our lives but habitual use and reliance on our gadgets can lead to bad habits in relationships.  Durex’s film is a great reminder that we need to take time out to get up close and intimate with our lovers, and reconnect with their needs face-to-face.' Ukonwa Ojo, Global Marketing Manager at Durex said:  'Durex believes nothing should get in the way of great sex but our growing obsession with phones, laptops, TVs and Tablets isn’t bringing us closer together, it’s pushing us apart. 'So, this Earth Hour let’s log off and switch off; use it as an excuse to swap our laptops for some loving and ditch our phones to enjoy some foreplay. Let’s turn off to turn on!'

"Cyclist Lance Armstrong is being sued by Sunday Times for the return of damages it paid him in 2006 . Lance Armstrong is being sued by The Sunday Times for more than £1million after it lost a libel action to the disgraced cyclist for printing doping claims now known to be true. The Sunday Times paid Armstrong £300,000 in 2006 to settle a case after it reprinted claims from a book alleging that Armstrong had taken performance-enhancing drugs. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency concluded this year that Armstrong ran a doping programme on his teams and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned from cycling for life. The shamed cyclist immediately fell from grace – losing endorsement deals and he even formally cut ties with cancer Charity Livestrong. The Sunday Times announced in an article in its latest edition that it has issued legal papers against Armstrong. 'It is clear that the proceedings were baseless and fraudulent,' the paper said in a letter to Armstrong's lawyers. 'Your representations that you had never taken performance enhancing drugs were deliberately false.' The paper, which is owned by Rupert . Murdoch's News Corp., said its total claim against Armstrong is 'likely . to exceed' £1million pounds ($1.6 million). This year Armstrong was banned for life and stripped of all results . since August 1998, including his seven successive Tour wins when the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency released a massive report detailing allegations of . widespread doping by Armstrong and his teams. The . document ordered 14 years of his career results erased - including . the Tour titles. It contained sworn statements from 26 witnesses, . including 11 former teammates. The Sunday Times, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., said its total claim against Armstrong is 'likely to exceed' £1million pounds . 2010May - Armstrong's former US Postal team-mate Floyd Landis launches allegations against the Texan. 2011May - Forced to deny claims made by former team-mate Tyler Hamilton that they took performance-enhancing drugs together. 2012February - An investigation into alleged doping by Armstrong is dropped by federal prosecutors. June - United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) confirm they will file formal doping charges. July - Armstrong files lawsuit against USADA accusing them of 'corrupt inducements' to other cyclists to testify against him. August 20 - Armstrong's legal action dismissed. August 24 - Armstrong announces he will not fight doping charges filed against him. October 10 - USADA claim 11 of Armstrong's former team-mates have testified against him. October 18 - Six companies cancel their sponsorship deals with Armstrong . October 22 - Cycling's world governing body, the UCI confirms it has ratified USADA's decision to ban Armstrong from cycling for life and to strip him of his seven Tour de France titles for doping offences. October 26 - The UCI confirms Armstrong's Tour titles will not be awarded to other riders. December - Sunday Times demands more than £1million from Lance Armstrong after they lost a libel action to him in 2006 for printing doping claims. The 41-year-old Armstrong, who overcame life-threatening testicular . cancer, retired from cycling a year ago. He announced in August that he . would no longer fight the doping allegations that have dogged him for . years. In October he was ordered to pay back all the cycling prize money he won while using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong is now set to lose at . least £30million in sponsorship deals over the next five years after a . string of companies followed Nike's decision to ditch the disgraced . cyclist. Bike sponsor Trek . Bicycles and helmet sponsor Giro are among the glut of companies who have distanced . themselves from the cyclist. Technology retailer Radioshack also decided to have . nothing more to do with the 41-year-old as did food maker Honey Stringer . and health club franchise 24HR Fitness. Energy drink manufacturer FRS said Armstrong had been 'on its board for several years but had resigned.' Just two hours after Nike said it was terminating its contracting with the star Anheuser-Busch followed suit.

"A 21-year-old man who 'admitted to killing his girlfriend' in the early hours of Saturday morning has been charged with second-degree murder. Though Clayton S. Whittemore, 21, allegedly confessed to police that he killed his girlfriend on her school campus at the College at Brockport in upstate New York, he is pleading not guilty. Alexandra Kogut suffered 'extensive trauma to the upper body', according to the campus chief of police. Brutal death: Alexandra Kogut was murdered by her boyfriend Clayton Whittemore in her NY college dorm room, a court has found . Young life: Kogut was found in her dorm room after having suffered extensive trauma . Caught: Clayton Whittemore (left) pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, but was found guilty . Press Connects reports that Whittemore is not a student at the school, which is a part of the State University of New York system, but his girlfriend was. Her body was found in her room inside McLean Hall on campus. The Utica Observer Dispatch says that the young woman's time of death is being placed between 1.30am and 2am and police only found her body after her mother called the university concerned about her daughter's well-being shortly after the alleged murder. The mother said that she became concerned when her daughter would not pick up her phone. Whittemore was found by state patrols at 4am at a highway rest stop over 100 miles away in Dewitt, New York outside of Rochester. Dewitt is about halfway between the College at Brockport and the American-Canadian border at Niagara Falls. Kogut’s heartbroken family yesterday described the young student as 'a bright, beautiful young woman who was thrilled to be beginning her college education'. The school send an email to students informing them of the death early Saturday and updated their website as the case unfolded. Happiness: Miss Kogut (bottom left) was found in her dorm room after the brutal attack at the school in upstate New York . On the run: Though he apparently confessed to police when they found him, that happened at a highway rest stop more than 100 miles away from the dorm room where the young woman's body was found . School shock: Whittemore is not enrolled at SUNY Brockport, but his girlfriend was a student at the school . While they wrote that the victim's death occurred 'under suspicious circumstances', they wrote that 'there is no reason to believe that any other members of the campus community are endangered in any way.' Whittemore lives in neighboring New Hartford and was a promising hockey star during high school. He was featured as an 'Athlete of the Week' by WKTV Utica in 2010. He is being held under the custody of the Monroe County Sheriff and has yet to be issued bail. 'It's tragic when anyone loses their life,' campus police chief Robert Kehoe told ABC affiliate WHAM. 'When a young lady who's a college student and apparently in a safe environment, is brutally murdered as this young lady was, it's certainly a tragedy for her family and friends and the entire Brockport college community.'","Victim's boyfriend Clayton Whittemore arrested for second-degree murder .

"The Plebgate cabinet minister had a history of arguing with police - and once called an officer 'a little s***', according to court papers. MP Andrew Mitchell is suing the owner of a newspaper which alleged he called officers ‘plebs’ during a now-infamous argument at the gates of Downing Street in central London in September 2012. But media firm News Group Newspapers claims in papers filed at the High Court that the 58-year-old former international development secretary had a seven-year history of rude and abusive behaviour. Scroll down for video . Legal fight: MP Andrew Mitchell (pictured) is suing the owner of The Sun after it alleged he labelled officers 'plebs' during an argument at the gates of Downing Street in central London in September 2012 . It even alleges he called an officer a ‘little s***’ when asked to stop while approaching a barrier at a Palace of Westminster entrance in 2005, reported Independent on Sunday journalist Jamie Merrill. Mr Mitchell allegedly told the officer: ‘I’m a Member of Parliament and I’m too important to stop for you’. The officer stated in response that he ‘didn’t care’ who Mr Mitchell was. However the MP is said to have then replied to the officer: ‘Stop being so aggressive, you little s***.’ More than 12 incidents from 2005 to 2012 have been claimed to have occurred in the court papers, including one where Mr Mitchell could not produce the correct identification to enter Downing Street. Argument: CCTV shows the exchange between Mr Mitchell and police officers at the Downing Street gates . He also would not allow his car to be searched when arriving at the Palace of Westminster on one occasion, according to today’s newspaper report. Assistance: Mr Mitchell twice relied on fellow Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith (pictured) to help him gain entry to Downing Street, it is claimed . The court papers also claim that Mr Mitchell twice relied on fellow Conservative MP Iain Duncan Smith to help him gain entry to Downing Street after confrontations with police officers. He also allegedly said while in Kenya three years ago that he ‘should be treated like royalty’ – and embarked on a ‘foul-mouthed tirade’ over the actions of his police protection officers. It comes after the Metropolitan Police published documents earlier this month summarising an inquiry into the aftermath of the incident, which resulted in four police officers being sacked. And it released new CCTV footage of the heated disagreement involving Mr Mitchell. In the incident, Mr Mitchell has denied he used the word 'pleb' - but apologised for swearing. He announced his resignation in October 2012. The report also unearthed details of his previous altercations with police in Downing Street. A former head of security and business continuity at No 10 said there were two incidents dating back to 2011 when the Tory MP swore about not being allowed through a rear entrance. The case between Mr Mitchell and News Group Newspapers - owner of The Sun newspaper - is due before the High Court in November. Mr Mitchell’s lawyer, Graham Atkins, told The Independent On Sunday: ‘Mr Mitchell’s amended reply is shortly to be filed at court and this responds to each allegation in detail.’","Andrew Mitchell is suing media group after it said he called officers 'plebs'

"Animal-rights campaigners have criticised Instagram for allowing users to sell unwanted pets and exotic animals online. Some people even use the photo-sharing website to sell animals for slaughter as sacrifices at religious rituals. Thousands of household pets such as puppies, kittens and rabbits are sold through Instagram posts with the hashtag #forsale. Sale: This is one of thousands of live animals being offered for sale via photo-sharing app Instagram . Advertising: Some users have effectively turned their accounts into streams of classified ads for animals . Users can also browse through a selection of exotic animals requiring specialist care such as snakes, horses and turtles. The adverts come in the form of photographs of the animals on sale, with details written in the captions, and can be read online through a computer or via Instagram's smartphone and tablet apps. Searching for #forsale brings up more than 1million offerings - most are innocuous items such as clothes, shoes and jewellery, but many are live animals. Instagram users in the Middle East run accounts selling animals such as sheep which are intended to be slaughtered. An account based in Kuwait boasts: 'We have them all, sacrificial and carcasses of all ages. We will bring them to you for all events and birthdays.' Exploitation: Campaigners have urged Instagram to crack down on postings like this one . Slaughter: These sheep are being offered for sacrifice by an Instagram user based in Kuwait . Animal Aid is now calling on the social media site, which is owned by Facebook, to ban this 'careless slave trading' of animals. 'This is a shocking situation to see animals being bred for money and traded like commodities,' the charity's director Andrew Tyler said. 'And this will only lead to suffering and more abuse towards animals. 'Animals are being manufactured and traded as products and this will encourage people to breed carelessly. 'The easier you make it to buy and sell animals online, the more casual and callous an approach people will take. We live in an age where people see animals as disposable and it's not right.

"The birth of a child is one of the most significant moments in a family's life. Many are fortunate enough to experience this in the comfort of a hospital, before driving home with nothing but a table-load of presents and sleepless nights to worry about. For this family from Ladakh, Northern India, the situation was quite different, as they were forced to travel on foot for 45 miles to get to the nearest hospital. A different world: As there is no doctor or hospital facility in the village where the family live, they were forced to travel on foot down river Chadar, at an altitude of 11,123ft, for nine days - and then make the same journey back when the baby was born . Latest addition: The newborn baby is wrapped up warm for the nine-day journey back to their home town in Ladakh, Northern India . Long journey: Another member of the family carries the newborn's older sibling as they make their way up the frozen river, walking for eight hours a day . It took them nine days to get to their destination, Lingshed, the nearest town with a hospital, after which they had to return the same way they came - up a frozen mountain river in temperatures of -35C. A photographer encountered the family during their nine-day journey home with their newborn baby in a basket, carrying a young child. The frozen river Chadar is at an altitude of 11,123 ft,and the family walked for eight hours-a-day over the frozen river often up to their knees in bitingly cold water. The family were forced to carry both provisions and children, and camped in mountain caves at night as they trekked back to their home town. The photos were captured by photographer Tim Vollmer from Iceland who was trekking up the Chadar with his friends when he spotted the weather-beaten family. No other option: The family had to bring food, blankets and other provisions on their backs or on sleds and camped out in caves at night before continuing their gruelling walk in the morning . Tough trek: The family were sometimes forced to wade through icy water and snow after the cold weather blocked the roads from Ladakh to the hospital in Lingshed . Keeping warm: A cave in the mountainside serves as shelter for the night as the family gathers around a fire in the freezing cold night . Tim said: ‘One day we met then this family with the little son and newborn, I was amazed what it is normal for someone to go through to get a child! ‘For me its just incredible, how easy and how much help we get in the western world to give birth in comparison - when you saw this little child and baby, how cold they have been, what they have to do.’ ‘The Zanskar River is big and fast flowing. For most if its length between Chillimg and the Zanskar Valley the River is confined within a steep canyon. ‘Walking over the frozen river and very cold rushing water just a few inches below your feet is terrifying. ‘Travelling from Leh, the capital of Ladakh to Lingshed takes four to five days under the best conditions and the long winter snow closes the roads and passes entirely for six months annually. ‘The local people use the river to carry goods for their livelihood and sometimes people die during the dangerous trip.’ As one: Family members brought larger sleds to be able to provide some relief for the mother as she recovers from giving birth . Travelling from Leh, the capital of Ladakh to Lingshed, where the hospital is takes around five days in the summer, but during the winder, snow closes the roads and mountain passes and the frozen river is the only way out .","Family in Northern India forced to walk 45 miles to the nearest hospital in -35C .

However, HMRC officials disagree, and they are now understood to be sending out notices to investors which demand payment by December 29 . Last night, Sky Sports commentator Gower said he had not had such a notice. A spokesman for Beckham said the former England captain had not received a letter either, but added the star always paid his taxes in full. Mr Mitchell, a former Chief Whip, failed to return calls.

"Meet the Brisbane-based drummer who rocks out on an incredible one of a kind drumset with 26 drums, 34 cymbals and 18 foot pedals, valued at $75,000. Grant Collins, 45, uses the 80 piece drumset to compose his one man solo performances, describing his works sound like his 'very own orchestra'. The master drummer uses both his hands and feet to play different parts, bringing out multiple voices from within the drumset to create an orchestral affect in his compositions. Scroll down for video . Grant Collins who uses a one of a kind $75,000 drum kit that includes 26 drums, 34 cymbals and 18 foot pedals . Known for his One Man Percussion Orchestra, the show has seen him go global with tours and sell-out concerts through Europe, USA, Australia and Asia . After being told by his music teacher at the age of 10 that he was too old to start a career in drumming, Grant picked up a pair of sticks in his late teens and followed his passion, which led to his first paid professional gig on his 20th birthday in 1989. One gig was all it took and Grant decided to quit his job and degree in computer programming to pursue his love of music and a life as a professional musician. Grant has since traveled the world with his One Man Percussion Orchestra, with sell-out concerts through Europe, USA, Australia and Asia. He also teaches children in schools both here and overseas. 'I love sharing my passion for drums with kids and showing them how much fun drumming can be regardless of age or skill level,' he said. Grant picked up a pair of sticks in his late teens and followed his passion, which led to his first paid professional gig on his 20th birthday in 1989 . During his school workshops, Grant shows students the techniques of drumming, by performing works from his solo repertoire and getting them involved in a very practical way. 'You're never too old to start an instrument and you don't have to do it at a professional level to enjoy it,' he said. 'If you have the love and passion, you can easily pick up a guitar for example and play three chords, it all goes from there.' Grant graduated on Thursday with a Doctorate of Musical Arts from the Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University and is hoping to use his doctorate award to share his passion of drumming at a university level. His broad influences come from a vast array of styles including jazz, country, rock, Latin and classical music's, just to name a few. Grant graduated on Thursday with a Doctorate of Musical Arts from the Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University and is hoping to use his doctorate award to share his passion of drumming at a university level . Despite all of his musical achievements, Grant said his biggest accomplishment by far is being a parent with his wife Jen to their 11-month-old son, Jax . Grant uses all four limbs when he plays and he sees the drumset as capable of more than just an accommpanying instrument for a rock band. Through his hard work, practice, passion and successful solo concerts around the globe, Grant has changed the stereotypical views on drumming. 'There are so many misconceptions about the drums, but they have incredible potential to captivate audiences on a world stage as a contemporary solo instrument,' he said. 'Not everyone has had an opportunity to experience or understand the concept of solo drumming and the different sounds that can be generated from the instrument'. Grant's passion lies in pushing the boundaries of solo performance on the drumset and creating ground breaking compositional works. Grant uses the 80 piece drum set to compose his one man solo performances, describing his works sound like his 'very own orchestra' After being told he was 'too old' to drum at the age of 10 by his music teacher, the 45-year-old is now described as a 'master drummer' Grant is currently writing educational books about music and drumming, and plans to get back into shows and concerts next year.","Grant Collins uses the 80 piece drumset to compose his one man solo performances .

"Primary school children have been banned from playing a new break time game they called 'the raping game'. The playground activity had been named after a violent video game which depicts violent sexual assaults on a mother and two daughters. More than a dozen boys, some as young as nine, were caught playing the 'the raping game' at Stanford Junior School in Brighton, East Sussex. The school confirmed it had been taking place and headteacher Gina Hutchins said she had spoken to children about the vile name. It has now been called 'the survival game' following the head's intervention. Shock: Pupils have been banned from playing 'the raping game' - a playground activity that Stanford Junior School in Brighton (pictured) has stepped in to stop . Mrs Hutchins said: 'As soon as we found out that this inappropriate word was being used, we spoke to the children concerned and they now no longer use it.' The game has been played mainly by boys in Year 5 at the school for the past two to three weeks. It involves one person being 'on' who has to catch others until only one is left uncaught and that person is the winner. About 13 boys, aged nine and ten, played the game in the school playground but have since changed the title. One concerned parent said: 'I was horrified that my son had learnt that word. 'He is only nine. Thankfully he did not know what it meant but it was that horrible thought he might use it elsewhere. 'Most people assume children learn these words at home.' The parent added she did not blame the school saying it is almost impossible to stop children bringing words into the playground. They commended the headteacher for her swift actions in taking decisive action and stamping out the use of the word. It is unsure what video game led to the naming of the game, but several on the market contain scenes of rape. One game called Rapelay sees the main character try to rape a mother and two daughters.","The head at Stanford Junior School in Brighton has been forced to step in .

"Harrowing tales: A diary has been recovered which belonged to Hilter confidant Alfred Rosenberg . A  long-lost diary belonging to a confidant of Adolf Hitler has been recovered, it was revealed today. The 400 pages belonged to Alfred Rosenberg, a high-ranking Nazi who played a central role in the extermination of millions of Jews and others during World War Two. A preliminary government assessment says that the diary could offer new insight into meetings Rosenberg had with Hitler and other top Nazi leaders, including Heinrich Himmler and Herman Goering. It also includes details about the . German occupation of the Soviet Union, including plans for mass killings . of Jews and other Eastern Europeans. 'The . documentation is of considerable importance for the study of the Nazi . era, including the history of the Holocaust,' according to the . assessment, prepared by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in . Washington. 'A . cursory content analysis indicates that the material sheds new light on a . number of important issues relating to the Third Reich's policy. 'The . diary will be an important source of information to historians that . complements, and in part contradicts, already known documentation.' How . the writings of Rosenberg, a Nazi Reich minister who was convicted at . Nuremberg and hanged in 1946, might contradict what historians believe . to be true is unclear. Further . details about the diary's contents could not be learned, and a U.S. government official stressed that the museum's analysis remains . preliminary. But the diary does include details about tensions within the German high-command - in particular, the crisis caused by the flight of Rudolf Hess to Britain in 1941, and the looting of art throughout Europe, according to the preliminary analysis. The recovery is expected to be announced this week at a news conference in Delaware held jointly by officials from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Justice and Holocaust museum. Evil workings: Reichsleader Alfred Rosenberg (left) and Reichsminister Dr Henrich Lammers with Adolf Hitler . The diary offers a loose collection of Rosenberg's recollections from spring 1936 to winter 1944, according to the museum's analysis. Most entries are written in Rosenberg's looping cursive, some on paper torn from a ledger book and others on the back of official Nazi stationery, the analysis said. Rosenberg was an early and powerful Nazi ideologue, particularly on racial issues. He directed the Nazi party's foreign affairs department and edited the Nazi newspaper. Several of his memos to Hitler were cited as evidence during the post-war Nuremberg trials. Rosenberg also directed the systematic Nazi looting of Jewish art, cultural and religious property throughout Europe. The Nazi unit created to seize such artifacts was called Task Force Reichsleiter Rosenberg. He was convicted of crimes against humanity and was one of a dozen senior Nazi officials executed in October 1946. His diary, once held by Nuremberg prosecutors as evidence, vanished after the trial. A Nuremberg prosecutor, Robert Kempner, was long suspected by U.S. officials of smuggling the diary back to the United States. Defeated: War criminals of the Nazi regime (left to right) Hermann Göring, Alfred Rosenberg, Baldur von Schirach and Karl Dönitz sit at a wooden table with metal plates and pieces of bread during the Nuremberg Trials in 1946 . Born in Germany, Kempner had fled to America in the 1930s to escape the Nazis, only to return for post-war trials. He is credited with helping reveal the existence of the Wannsee Protocol, the 1942 conference during which Nazi officials met to coordinate the genocide against the Jews, which they termed 'The Final Solution'. Kempner cited a few Rosenberg diary excerpts in his memoir, and in 1956 a German historian published entries from 1939 and 1940. But the bulk of the diary never surfaced. Part of history: Robert M. W. Kempner, a Nuremberg prosecutor, was long suspected by U.S. officials of smuggling Rosenberg's diary out of Germany after the Nazi trials . When Kempner died in 1993 at age 93, legal disputes about his papers raged for nearly a decade between his children, his former secretary, a local debris removal contractor and the Holocaust museum. The children agreed to give their father's papers to the Holocaust museum, but when officials arrived to retrieve them from his home in 1999, they discovered that many thousands of pages were missing. After the 1999 incident, the FBI opened a criminal investigation into the missing documents. No charges were filed in the case. Reign of terror: Hitler and his retinue, including Rosenberg, on the Koniglichen Platz in Munich . But the Holocaust museum has gone on to recover more than 150,000 documents, including a trove held by Kempner's former secretary, who by then had moved into the New York state home of an academic named Herbert Richardson. The Rosenberg diary, however, remained missing. Early this year, the Holocaust museum and an agent from Homeland Security Investigation tried to locate the missing diary pages. They tracked the diary to Richardson, who was living near Buffalo. Richardson declined to comment. A government official said more details will be announced at the news conference.","400 pages written by Alfred Rosenberg, a leading Nazi who played a central role in the extermination of millions of Jews and others .

"French actor Gerard Depardieu has been granted Russian citizenship after a very public war with the leaders of his country over high taxes on the rich. A brief announcement on the Kremlin website said president Vladimir Putin had signed the citizenship grant today. Depardieu is furious at French president Francois Hollande's attempt to raise taxes on the mega-rich to 75 per cent. Russia has a flat income tax of 13 per cent. Angry: The French actor, pictured with Putin in St Petersburg in 2010, has been locked in a very public battle with his country over the tax hike . Vladimir Putin, centre, was today pictured during a visit to the Krasnaya Polyana ski resort near the Black Sea resort of Sochi . Putin, pictured with regional governor Alexander Tkachyov, signed the citizenship grant for Depardieu . A representative for Depardieu declined to say whether he had accepted the offer, which, although genuine, is widely seen as a Russian swipe at France rather than a genuine act of concern for the multi-millionaire actor's finances. Depardieu has made more than 150 films, . including 1991 comedy Green Card, about a man who enters into a marriage . of convenience in order to get U.S. residency. Mystery: Depardieu, seen at the opening ceremony of his wine corner at a store in Moscow, has not revealed whether he has accepted the offer . The actor was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as Cyrano de Bergerac in the 1990 film by the same name. He also appeared in an adaption of the Belgian classic Asterix and Obelix. Depardieu said in an open letter published in mid-December that he had been 'insulted' by . France's prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, and planned to turn over his passport and French social security card. Ayrault called him pathetic for wanting . to leave France for tax-friendly Belgium to avoid the new top rate. In an angry letter, published in Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Depardieu wrote: 'I was born in 1948. I started working aged 14, as a printer, as a warehouseman, then as an actor, and I’ve always paid my taxes.' Over 45 years, Depardieu said, he had paid €145million euros in tax, and to this day employs 80 people. Last year he paid taxes amounting to 85 per cent of his income. 'I . am neither worthy of pity nor admirable, but I shall not be called ""pathetic"",' he concluded. 'I'm a true European, a citizen of the world.' As a clear statement of intent, Mr Depardieu, has put his luxury house on Paris’s Left Bank up for . sale for an estimated €50m. British tax expert Richard Murphy who runs Tax Research UK . said: 'Mr Depardieu has claimed to be one of France's great patriots yet . he runs off to Belgium to avoid French taxes, showing little respect . for the country's ""liberté, égalité, fraternité"" motto.' 'Citizen of the world': Depardieu has sold his home in Paris and reportedly bought one in Nechin, Belgium . Belgium's top rate, like the UK, is capped at 50 per cent, although Britain's will return to 45 per cent as of April 2013. The tax on millionaires was struck down by France's highest court on December 29, but the government intends to resubmit the law in a slightly different form soon. Depardieu is well known in Russia, where he appears in an ad for Sovietsky Bank's credit card and is prominently featured on the bank's home page. France's Civil Code says one must have another nationality in order to give up French citizenship because it is forbidden to be stateless. Today's decision by the Kremlin would appear to fulfil that requirement. The helmet... and the gloves are off: Depardieu responded angrily to claims by the French Prime Minister that he was pathetic for running away to avoid tax . The Belgian Foreign Minister has . given carte blanche to anyone planning to follow in Depardieu's . footsteps and move to Belgium in an attempt to escape higher French . taxes. 'If other French people want to come to Belgium, I'm not at all opposed,' said Didier Reynders in an interview with Le Figaro. He . emphasised that France shouldn't be blaming Belgium if some residents, . one of the leading lights of national cinema among them, are leaving the . country. '…It is totally fallacious to believe . that we Belgians would do everything to attract the French. No! It . turns out that for years, France has freely chosen a tax system that . carries consequences and led the French to leave the country,' he added. Au revoir: France's Civil Code says one must have another nationality in order to give up French citizenship because it is forbidden to be stateless. Thursday's decision by the Kremlin appears to fulfill that requirement . Reports say Depardieu had acquired property in the Belgium village of Nechin. Le Soir . newspaper said that his new neighbours could include the Mulliez . family, a billionaire clan that owns the giant French retail chain . Auchan. Up to 27 per cent of Nechin’s . inhabitants are French, according to France's Le Point magazine. Bernard Arnault – . France's richest man – applied for Belgian citizenship after the .

"The European Union is set to impose further sanctions on Russia following its decision to annex Crimea as German Chancellor Angela Merkel today declared the G8 'is dead'. EU leaders are set to meet in Brussels today to discuss how to deal with the developments in Crimea after Russian troops seized majority control of the peninsula. In an address to the German Parliament . in Berlin this morning, Merkel said the EU was readying further . sanctions and that the G8 forum of leading economies has been suspended . indefinitely. Russia holds the presidency of the G8 and President Vladimir Putin was due to host his counterparts, including President Barack Obama, at a summit in Sochi in June. But Merkel today declared the G8 will not meet again until the situation in Ukraine has been resolved. Scroll Down for Video . Response: German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced the EU will impose further sanctions on Russia . The G8 is dead': German Chancellor Angela Merkel tells the lower house of parliament in Berlin the G8 forum has been suspended indefinitely . German Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses lawmakers at the lower house of parliament in Bundestag, Berlin, on Thursday ahead of a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels . 'So long as there aren't the political circumstances, like now, for an important format like the G8, then there is no G8,' Merkel said. 'Neither the summit, nor the format.' Earlier this week, the EU and the United States slapped sanctions on certain individuals that were involved in what they say was the unlawful referendum in Crimea over joining Russia. Moscow formally annexed Crimea earlier this week in the wake of the poll. The Black Sea peninsula had been part of Russia for centuries until 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine. Russian forces effectively took control of Crimea some two weeks ago in the wake of the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych, after months of protests and sporadic violence. The crisis erupted late last year after Yanukovych backed out of an association deal with the EU in favor of a promised $15 billion bailout from Russia. That angered Ukrainians from pro-European central and western regions. Cancelled: Russian President Vladimir Putin was due to host the G8 summit in Sochi in June . British Prime Minister David Cameron pictured arriving for a meeting of European Conservatives ahead of an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday . Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras at a media conference at an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday. The EU Commission president wants the summit to center on boosting the fledgling government in Kiev rather than focus exclusively on sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula . Merkel said EU leaders would increase those 'level 2' sanctions against Russia when they meet onThursday in Brussels to widen the list of those whose assets are being frozen and who are banned from traveling. She also reiterated that if things worsen, the EU is prepared to move to 'level 3' measures, which would include economic sanctions. 'The European Council will make it clear today and tomorrow that with a further deterioration of the situation we are always prepared to take level 3 measures, and those will without a doubt include economic sanctions,' she said. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has close economic ties with Russia which is its main supplier of gas and some companies are worried they would be hit if economic sanctions go ahead. The United States and its G7 allies will gather next week in The Hague without Russia to consider a further response to the Kremlin's moves in Crimea.

Time to go: Ukrainian air force officers leave the Belbek airbase, outside Sevastopol, Crimea, with their belongings on Thursday as pro-Russian troops close in on the peninsula . Merkel, who still wants a diplomatic solution to the crisis, also questioned whether annual German-Russian government consultations, scheduled to take place in Leipzig next month, could go ahead. Last week, Merkel, who was brought up in Communist East Germany, warned Moscow that it risked 'massive' political and economic damage if it refused to change course. The government on Wednesday publicly intervened in business dealings with Russia for the first time since the escalation of the crisis by telling defence contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear to Russia. European Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger spelled out some of the sectors further sanctions discussed by EU leaders in Brussels this week could cover. 'We have products that Russia needs - machines, equipment, hardware, software, vehicles,' Oettinger told German television, playing down the prospect of sanctions in the energy sector.","EU leaders are set to meet in Brussels to discuss developments in Ukraine .

"Billionaire Elon Musk's groundbreaking private space firm SpaceX has been shaken up this past week by class action lawsuits filed on behalf of some angry former employees. The suits come less than a month after SpaceX laid off up to 400 employees who spokesmen claimed were 'low performers,' but one of the suits says the unexpected mass terminations violated California law. The other suit suggests working conditions weren't ideal leading up to the lay-offs, anyway, with claims the company failed to provide employees--even its technicians producing space rockets--with state mandated lunch and rest breaks. Giant leap...to the curb? Two lawsuits claim billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX firm has violated California labor laws . In the second suit, disgruntled employee Joseph A. Smith alleges the company failed to provide required half-hour lunch breaks after five hours of work followed by a second break after 10 hours, CNN reports. Smith's suit even claims SpaceX bilked him out of wages he was owed by forcing him to work off the clock and rounding down his reported hours to 'fewer total hours than were actually worked.' Structural technicians Bobby R. Lee and Bron Gatling have also filed suit. They were part of the layoffs in late July when between 200 and 400 employees were shown the door. The plaintiffs say they weren't given a 60-day notice of the upcoming layoffs, which would break California's Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The law stipulates that companies with over 75 employees must provide the notice when letting go 50 or more workers. Lawsuits claim the Hawthorne, California company withheld lunch breaks and wages and violated California law by failing to forewarn employees of a mass layoff . Companies found to be in violation of the law are required to pay 60 days compensation and could face civil penalties, notes the LA Times. However, the former rocket techs' case--which they hope will become a civil suit covering all those who were laid off--spins largely upon whether or not the shedding of employees was a 'lay off.' SpaceX has not qualified it as such. President Gwynne Shotwell instead characterized it as the termination of 'low performers.' Lee and Gatling are asking for back pay, the value of unrecieved benefits and penalties. Mr. Smith also hopes his case will become a class action and is asking for unpaid wages, wages from the rest periods he missed and penalties.","Two class action lawsuits have been filed against the Hawthorne, California firm within the last week .
One suit claims SpaceX failed to provide employees with the lunch breaks and rest periods prescribed by state law .

"A picture claiming to show the front panels of Apple's upcoming iPhone 6 has leaked online. It reveals a much-rumoured larger 4.7inch screen. Apple is also believed to be developing a 5.5inch screen version, with both expected to be unveiled in September and go on sale soon after. Scroll down for video . Images claiming to be the front panel of the upcoming device, pictured, were leaked on Chinese site Weibo earlier this month. It similarly revealed what appeared to be the much-rumoured 4.7-inch screen, but reports also claim Apple is working on a 5.5-inch version and the rear casing may be either . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. According to iphone.fr, which first spotted the images, the dimensions of the screen lend credibility to the image. 'This snapshot WAS spotted on Weibo this morning,' the site says. 'It features what may be (or not) an ""iPhone 6"" front face. 'By comparison with the iPhone 5 (left), we can estimate year height for the screen of 4.1 inches (10.7 cm) and a width around 2.35 inches (6 cm). 'This Gives a ratio of width and height 0.55, which is exactly the one found on the current iPhone 5 and a 4.7 ""diagonal length!' Having exactly the same screen dimensions would ensure app developers do not have to create separate versions of their software for the new sizes. The rumours come amid claims Apple suppliers around the world are about to crank up their production lines for the big screen set to find its way into the iPhone 6. Japan Display Inc, Sharp Corp and South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd have all been tapped to make the screens. They will begin mass producing displays as within weeks for the next iPhone, expected to be launched this autumn, with a 4.7-inch screen likely to be produced first while a 5.5-inch version could be delayed. Representatives for the three suppliers and for Apple declined to comment. Both iPhone 6 screens will be larger than the 4.0-inch panels on Apple's existing iPhone 5S and 5C models. Recent concept images by designer Martin Hajek, pictured, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S . Larger iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch up to rivals like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. CEO Tim Cook, while promising only 'new product categories' for 2014, has played his cards close to his chest. Apple's shares have languished below $600 since November 2012, in part because of worries about smartphone market saturation and its ability to stay at the forefront of tech innovation. Both iPhone 6 screens are expected to use in-cell touch panel technology - built into the screen and allowing for thinner construction than with standard touch panel films - that was introduced with the iPhone 5, the sources said. The images, pictured left and right, were posted on Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week and are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera, similar to that seen on the iPod touch . But due to difficulties with in-cell production technology for the larger 5.5-inch size, one of the sources said, a decision was made to begin mass production with the 4.7-inch version alone. Production of 5.5-inch screens is expected to start several months later, with the possibility of a shift to a film sensor instead of in-cell technology for that size, the source said. Japan Display will be the first supplier to start production, at its flagship plant at Mobara, east of Tokyo, as early as May, the sources said. The others are due to begin output around June. Images posted to Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera, similar to those seen on the iPod touch. Alternatively, the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of Apple's MP3 player. Reports are claiming Apple is gearing up to go into mass production of the screen on its next flagship phone as early as next month. The first image shows what appears to be a blueprint of the iPhone 6, while the other two images of prototype models are shown in silver with rounded edges - similar to those seen on last year’s iPad Air tablet. Speculation is rife that Apple could follow up this super-thin tablet with an equally slim phone, dubbed iPhone Air, and the new images appear to corroborate this. Earlier this month, Japanese magazine MacFan published drawings of what purported to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6C. Earlier this month, Japanese magazine MacFan published drawings of what seemed to be a 4.7-inch and 5.7-inch iPhone 6C, pictured.

The drawings feature a flat, bezel-free device with rectangle-shaped volume controls like those found on the current iPhone 5C, as well as a camera with a single LED-flash on the rear. Recent concept images were then created using the schematics detailed in MacFan’s release, by designer Martin Hajek, and Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni. These concepts feature a curved screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints, first introduced on the iPhone 5S. The protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported iPhone 6 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current iPod touch model, pictured . The latest mockups come after Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP megapixels, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures. If Apple follows its usual release schedule, the new models will be unveiled in September this year, although experts are expecting the tech giant to launch at least one model in June. Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible. But reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused Apple to delay production of the 5.5-inch versions. It has been widely accepted Apple's rumoured 4.7-inch iPhone 6 (concept pictured left) will debut in September, with the 5.5-inch model launching in 2015. This was blamed on manufacturing problems. The latest reports, instead, are blaming this staggered release date on Apple's marketing strategy .","Claims front panel was taken from an iPhone production facility .

Launched in 1965, the DB6 superceded the famous DB5 model and enjoyed a production run of six years, the longest of any Aston Martin model. As with previous Aston Martin cars a high-powered Vantage was made, capable of 0-60 in eight seconds and boasting a top speed of 150mph. The Vantage model featured triple Weber carburetors and a high-compression cylinder head that produced 325 bhp. Despite needing thousands of pounds spent on it, the classic car could be worth a fortune if returned to pristine condition. Tim Schofield, director of Bonhams motor car department, said: 'This is a beautiful car but I imagine nearly everything needs doing to it. 'It is complete but it is going to require a restoration in the full sense of the word. This one needs the full monty.

"'It's changing all the time,' says photographer Harry Hook. 'I tell myself not to be nostalgic because I have to record Africa's state of flux and because yesterday is kind of irrelevant.' After almost 40 years of photographing Africa, Hook is explaining why the dark continent continues to fascinate. Born and raised in Kenya, he's spent decades charting the changing circumstances of Africa's people, whether Samburu pastoralists or Tanzania's Hadza hunter-gatherers. Just how rapidly life is changing for Africa's traditional peoples is made clear in a new BBC4 documentary which follows Hook as he searches for five Samburu women he first photographed 30 years ago in northern Kenya. Tradition: Samburu tribespeople Esia, Ntiani, Melenkuan and Kutanas photographed by Harry Hook during a visit to their Kenyan homeland in 2010 . Creative: Linkas (left) and Marian (right) show off their elaborate Samburu jewellery in this pair of portraits taken in northern Kenya in 2010 . Town: Establishments such as this restaurant are encouraging people to swap traditional lifestyles for modern, urban dwellings . Once a nomadic people, the women he rediscovers have become sedentary, with one, Ndito Lekisoli, found living just two miles from where she was first photographed and claiming to have travelled no more than 12 miles in her entire life. 'Life for them has changed a lot,' explains Hook. 'A lot of Samburu have become sedentary, which does mean good things such as being able to send their kids to school, having access to healthcare, water and things like that. 'It's not my role to bemoan the passing of an era but I do think tradition is very important in people's lives.' During his journey through Samburu tribal land, a vast region that covers 8,000 square miles and includes the Samburu National Park, it becomes clear that many of the traditional ways do remain, even among Samburu who have left the tribal homeland to pursue careers in Nairobi and other large cities. Cattle camp: The Mundari, a South Sudanese people, live 75km from the capital Juba and rely on their animals to survive . Danger: The Mundari, who rely on spears and bows and arrows to defend themselves, are at risk of being caught in South Sudan's latest conflict . Pastoralist: The Turkana people of Kenya and Uganda, such as this man photographed in 1990, are famous for their elaborate basket weaving and for raising camels . Tradition: A group of Masai initiates photographed in Tanzania in 2012 with their faces embellished with patterns created using traditional chalk face-paint . Love: An elderly Samburu woman kisses her grandchild in a photograph taken by Harry Hook during a visit to the country in 1993 . Like their neighbours, the Bor Dinka, the lives of the Mundari tribe of South Sudan revolve around their cattle. Famous for their bright red locks, achieved by using cattle urine as hair bleach, the tribe are semi-nomadic and spend their lives wandering the open plains of Central Equatoria province. Still clinging to tradition, the main threat to their existence is the civil war currently raging that has pitted their Dinka neighbours against another Sudanese tribe - the Nuer. 'They are incredibly resilient and . proud people who have held out [against modernisation],' adds Hook. 'The . [neighbouring] Masai have moved much closer to everyone else but . because the Samburu are further away from the big cities, they've . retained their customs a little bit longer. They are extraordinary . people.' But while the . Samburu form the backbone of Hook's latest African venture, they're by . no means the only people he meets during a journey that takes him into . one of the continent's newest - and least stable - nations, South Sudan. Here, he photographs the Mundari people, a tribe of spear-wielding nomadic pastorialists whose life, unlike the Samburu, has changed little over the centuries. For them, the main threat to their way of life comes not from encroaching technology but from war. 'It was very lucky - we just got in and out in the nick of time,' explains Hook of his trip to South Sudan, a country currently convulsed by a vicious civil war that began last December. 'Based on intelligence on the ground, we knew we only had a blip of peace before the whole thing unravelled again.' And it's not the first time he's faced conflict while in pursuit of the perfect picture, although he says it's a risk that can be minimised by keeping a weather eye on the situation on the ground. 'The main risks, on the whole, are that you can be targeted for some money or caught in the crossfire,' he explains. 'I was apprehensive [about going into South Sudan] but literally you go along and if all's clear you carry on, while keeping an eye on the information that comes to you on the ground.

Colourful: This woman, photographed in Mozambique in 2008, is a member of the Makua tribe, Mozambique's largest ethnic group . Modern: Badiva and Dhiramu, photographed in eastern Kenya in 2001, combine modern conveniences such as radios with traditional clothes . 'On the whole, people are immensely . hospitable,' he adds. 'But I have had situations in past where I've been . arrested or passport taken away by suspicious officials. I shoot on . film so sometimes, people think you're a spy when they can't see the . pictures!' Despite the dangers, Hook says his . African journey will continue for as long as there are still people to . photograph and new places to explore. 'It's the people you meet,' he . says of the pleasures of African travel. 'It's the hospitality and spending time with people who have very little and are living in the moment and are grateful just to spend time with you - just sharing a laugh with people.' That side of the adventure becomes clear during an encounter with the Hadza hunter-gathers, whom Hook joins for a successful baboon hunt. Asked by Hook whether he would ever live in a town, Obabu, a tribal elder, replies: 'No, it's too dangerous! Next they'll make us pay taxes! Bad!' Sentiments with which many of us would no doubt agree. Hook, meanwhile, plans to continue  'There are 48 countries in Africa and I've only been to 25. In a way, that's the danger of calling [the documentary] Photographing Africa. It's an ongoing process and there's still much more to do.' Photographing Africa, tonight at 9pm on BBC4.

"Roy Keane is poised to return to the Premier League - as Paul Lambert’s assistant at Aston Villa. The former Manchester United midfielder turned the job as Celtic manager but is on the brink of a move to Villa Park. Keane had been expected to be appointed as Neil Lennon’s successor at Parkhead after talks but the 42-year-old instead chose to work with Lambert, as the role would allow to also continue as Martin O’Neill’s No 2 with the Republic of Ireland. Eyes on the ball: After much thought Keane decided not to take the Celtic job and has now left ITV . Multiple roles: It is believed Roy Keane has chosen to take the Aston Villa assistant manager job, as the role would allow him to continue as Martin O'Neill's number two with the Republic of Ireland (pictured) Staying put: Keane as decided to remain as Martin O'Neill's No 2 for the Republic of Ireland . Lambert and Keane held talks before Celtic’s failed attempt to land their former midfielder and he will replace former assistant manager Ian Culverhouse, who was sacked last month. His new role at Villa Park, where he will try to help the club improve on their miserable 15th place finish last season, may also be able to accommodate his role as ITV’s top pundit on Champions League nights. Reports in Ireland have stated Keane had a formal offer in front of him from the Scottish champions but a source close to Celtic claimed: ‘Roy was not offered the job - no-one has been offered it yet. But he has ruled himself out and asked not to be considered for the position.’ New era: Ian Culverhouse (right) was sacked by Villa after an incident that took place in April . Helping out: Shay Given (left) was promoted to a coaching role during Culverhouse's suspension . The FAI then released a short statement confirming Keane would remain with them after the recent frenzy of speculation over his future.

"First impressions will count very favourably for potential buyers of this £3million property, not necessarily thanks to the grand house, but because of the garden pond. Easterlands is an eight-bedroom house built in the 19th century, sitting in more than 44 acres of prime Somerset countryside. The real selling point, however, is its beautiful pond, which looks just like Monet's Water Lilies paintings. Spot the difference: The Japanese bridge at Easterlands House in Sampford Arundel, Somerset which is identical to the bridge painted by Monet . The iconic painting: Water Lilies and Japanese Bridge 1897-99 by Monet, which bares a striking resemblance to the pond in Somerset . At the centre of the rambling grounds and gardens . is the elegant water feature with its Japanese bridge, which could be right out of a . garden in the French village Giverny, Claude Monet’s famous home. The artist moved to the village in 1883 and had a beautiful lily pond which he would regularly sit and paint. Both Monet’s pond and the one at Easterlands, which pre-dates the artist’s, have the same bridge and beautiful trees hanging over the water. The Frenchman, who died in 1926 aged 86, painted approximately 250 pieces around the pond and bridge with works in galleries across the world. Relative bargain: Owning Easterlands House for £3million is a snip compared to buying one of Monet's water lily paintings, which sell at £41million . View of the grounds: The conservatory at Easterlands, from where the new owners will be able to survey their beautiful garden and pond . But while one of Monet’s water lily paintings sold for £41 million in 2008, Easterlands is on the market for less than a tenth, with the owners asking for £3.1 million. The stunning home, in Sampford Arundel, has a reception hall, study, drawing room, dining room, garden room and billiards room. On top of the eight bedrooms, there is a coach house with stables and barns as well as a tennis court, covered swimming pool, a two-bed cottage and three-bed lodge. It is on the market with Savills, who describe it as 'one of the area’s most important homes'. Idyllic: The sweeping driveway up to the house, which sits in more than 44 acres of land . Restful: A perfect country scene with the house in the background, reminiscent of the gentle landscapes painted by Monet . Luxurious: The swimming pool is discreetly set back within a walled garden and attached to an old out-building . Richard Addington, from Savills in Exeter, said: 'The property sits among the rolling countryside on the Devon/Somerset border at the foot of the Blackdown Hills. 'Although built in the 19th Century, the style of the property harks back to the Georgian era. 'The gardens and grounds are nothing short of glorious. 'The bridge over the pond bears a striking resemblance to that featured in Monet’s paintings of Giverny and offers quite a bonus for purchasers.' The reception rooms boast high ceilings and have elegant detailing including substantial fireplaces and panelling. Bonus: As if one big country house were not enough, it also comes with a separate guest house . Grand interior: The sitting room is just one of the many reception rooms that offers dramatic views of the Somerset countryside . There is also a conservatory and billiards room while the bedrooms are nearly all arranged with en suite access to a bathroom and the cellars beneath the house offer plenty of usable accommodation. In the mid-1920s, the house was lived in by the Fox family, which were behind Fox Brothers and Co, the textiles business now run by Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden. The current owners have lived in the property for around 35 years and, while they have carried out a lot of work, it could do with some updating.","For a tenth of the price of the painting, you could own a pond just like Monet's Water Lillies paining - with an accompanying country house .

"Families will splash out an average of £133.70 on Christmas Day food - but they'll throw a fifth of it in the bin. The day's feasting will create an extra 50m bags of rubbish, or £600m of food. As a nation we'll spend £3.3 billion on food for the Christmas table this year, according to a national survey commissioned by food waste disposer maker InSinkErator. Leftovers: British households will throw away £600m worth of wasted food this Christmas . More than half (56 per cent) of 3,000 householders polled admit they will throw away between 20 to 30 per cent of that extra Christmas food as waste this year - a minimum of £600m of Christmas food thrown directly into our dustbins. The knock-on effect of that extraordinary wastage is that 66 per cent of the nation will use between two and four extra bin bags to discard their unwanted Christmas food in 2011 - approximately 50 million bin bags of extra rubbish just for unwanted Christmas Day food (based on two thirds of the nation using 3 extra bin bags on Christmas Day). Landfill: The leftover food waste from Christmas day feasting will fill an estimated 50m bin bags . That extra waste also contributes . significantly to the 30 extra 'tidying up' hours that almost half the . nation (49 per cent) claims it will undertake during the annual . Christmas break. InSinkErator spokesman Ashley Munden . said: 'Everyone loves Christmas and Britain clearly gets into the spirit . of things at this time of year. The environmental impact of food waste is a huge concern . 'But the environmental impact of our seasonal celebrations is clearly felt across the nation. 'We create an extra 50 million bags of food waste on Christmas Day alone. 'The cost of that food waste is staggering too - £600 million. It's truly mind-boggling. 'The environmental impact is clearly a concern - there is a huge amount of landfill required to house all that waste. If people simply had a food waste disposer fitted into their homes it could be dealt with swiftly, efficiently and, most importantly, in a truly eco-friendly responsible fashion designed to reduce impact on landfill sites. Food waste disposers have a positive impact on landfill and food waste is dealt with through the waste water system when disposed of through a waste disposal unit.",Britons will spend £3.3bn on festive food this year - but £600m will be tossed away .
"Colin Kaepernick dressed for the salary he wanted when he donned a pair of 'make it rain' socks to sign his new contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers. The quarterback made the right outfit choice too, since Wednesday's deal to keep him with the 49ers through 2020 for $126million has now made him one of the richest players in the NFL. Kaepernick insists the socks were a coincidence though, since he put them on before finding out what his new paycheck would be. 'I had these on before I found out,' he quipped. 'Luck of the draw.' Lucky socks: San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick wore flashy 'make it rain' socks when he signed his $126million contract extension with the California team on Wednesday . 'To . be honest, one of my friends gave them to me, gave me a box of socks,' he said. 'No idea what brand or what company, but they were in my . drawer.' The socks that show a hand throwing out dollars bills are currently sold by company 40s and Shorties, and can be purchased online for $12. With his new deal, he can now afford 10,500,500 pairs - that's enough socks to wear a fresh pair every day for the rest of his life... if he lived another 28,768 years. Kaepernicks' new deal includes $61 million in guaranteed money, a person with knowledge of the contract said, speaking on condition of anonymity because terms weren't disclosed. The sides had made it a top priority to get a deal done before the start of training camp next month. Sticking around: Kaepernick will remain with the 49ers through the 2020 season, according to the deal inked Wednesday. Pictured above at a press conference to announce the contract . 'They were able to get it done six weeks earlier than what I think everyone thought,' Kaepernick said. 'I'm very excited to have it done at this point and we don't have to worry about talks or anything like that moving forward.' Kaepernick, whose quick ascent to the ranks of the NFL's elite under center has earned him rock star status, had been due to make less than $1 million this season. Now, the 26-year-old Kaepernick instantly becomes one of the league's richest stars. 'I'm always striving to be in that group. An elite group in the NFL. Not necessarily pay, but as far as a player. Whatever comes along with that comes along with it,' Kaepernick said. 'I'm very grateful for it. ... I don't think my motivation is money-driven.' Since taking over the starting job from Alex Smith two years ago, Kaepernick led the 49ers to their first Super Bowl in 18 years after the 2012 season — losing by three points to Baltimore — and then to the NFC championship game last season, a three-point defeat to the rival and eventual Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks. Kaepernick even offered a shoutout to 2005 No. 1 overall draft pick Smith, saying, ""I don't think I would be able to be at this point so quickly if he hadn't been such a great mentor to me and helped me along with things."" Going for the ring: Kaepernick's main goal in the coming years is to go to as many Super Bowls as he can . Kaepernick's next mission: . 'Trying to win as many Super Bowls as I can,' he said. 'I think that's your goal as a player to try to win a Super Bowl every year that you're playing.' A second-round draft pick out of Nevada in 2011, Kaepernick has thrived under former NFL quarterback Jim Harbaugh — and the coach has said how much he wants the mobile, strong-armed QB around for the long haul. Accomplishing an extension before the season is a big deal as the team begins its first year in $1.2billion Levi's Stadium at team headquarters. 'I really expect a real breakout year for Colin. Athletically, he looks bionic,' Harbaugh said during the organized team activity last week. 'If you all remember 'The Six Million Dollar Man,' that's what it looks like to me. He's very gifted and he always has been. He has the look and feel of a guy who's really going to break out, even more so than he already has. I'm really excited about everything about his game right now.' Greetings and kind words came via Twitter posts from teammates. 'Congrats to my boy @kaepernick7 on the extension! (hashtag)deserving (hashtag)hardestworkingdudeiknow' wrote fullback Bruce Miller. In a sensational playoff debut in January 2013 against Green Bay, Kap — as they call him — used his speedy legs to run for a quarterback playoff-record 181 yards and a pair of touchdowns. Then, in a season-opening win against the Packers last September, the strong-armed San Francisco QB threw for a career-best 412 yards and three scores. Rich: Only Wayne Rooney and Robin Van Persie of Premier League players will earn more than Kaepernick . 'Colin's hard work and dedication have played an integral role in the recent success of the 49ers organization,' 49ers general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. 'His work ethic, leadership and on-field production have positively influenced our team, and we look forward to his continued growth in all areas. Our organization always looks to reward our players for their contributions and commitment to the team.' Harbaugh remained optimistic of getting a new deal done, while Kaepernick said his only focus was on football and he was leaving it to his agents to do the rest. The quarterback had said he sought a 'fair' deal. He is regularly the first to arrive at work each morning and the last one off the field. Kaepernick has completed 382 of 639 passes for 5,046 yards and 31 touchdowns. He also has started all six postseason games in which he has appeared, earning four wins and passing for 1,374 yards and seven touchdowns. Kaepernick said last week he hopes a Miami investigation from April that names him will soon be over. He said that matter didn't affect his thoughts about whether it would affect the extension. 'That wasn't something I was worried about,' Kaepernick said. 'I let my agents handle all the talking.' Last month, Miami Police released two calls to a 911 dispatcher saying a woman identifying herself as Jesus was lying naked in a bed and refusing to leave. The callers said the woman wanted to spend time with a third man who wasn't there. Police say the players also involved in the case are 49ers wide receiver Quinton Patton and Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette. None of them has been charged with any wrongdoing. 'We're just really thrilled for the Kaepernick family. They're amazing people,' agent Scott Smith said after Kaepernick's news conference. 'We're just so happy for them. We're really grateful of all the hard work the 49ers put into it.'","The 26-year-old quarterback wore a pair of colorful socks with a dollar bill pattern to sign his contract extension with the San Francisco 49ers .

"Justice: Gisela S was a guard at the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland, where more than 1million people were exterminated . This grainy photograph shows the female Auschwitz death-camp guard who is set to stand trial on charges of aiding in mass murder. The woman, who is now 90 years old and has been identified only as Gisela S, worked at the camp under her maiden name Demming. If convicted, she will be among a handful of the 3,700 women employed to oversee female prisoners to face justice. Gisela S. is the second person within . a week judged to be fit to answer charges relating to their roles in . the camp in occupied Poland where some 1.1million people, mostly Jews, . were killed. The other . is Oskar Groening, 92, who was in charge of sending back the possessions . and money of the doomed to his SS masters in Berlin. Gisela . S is now living in a home near Hamburg, and has been described as a . fanatical Nazi supporter who early on in the Nazi regime joined the BDM, . the League of German Maidens, before entering the SS in 1940. The . Federal Archive in Berlin threw up her SS identity card for war crimes . investigators. It shows a cold, hard-faced woman who worked in Auschwitz . in 1944 under her maiden name of Demming. It is claimed at Asuchwitz she was a . harsh disciplinarian who beat prisoners and who was often in charge of . the standing cells - small, dark rooms where up to 15 people at a time . were crammed in for minor rule infractions. It was not uncommon to leave . people in these rooms for days on end, causing the death of some or all . of those confined. She formed a romantic relationship . with SS doctor Franz Bernhard Lucas, but dropped him when he railed . against the hideous experiments on prisoners carried out by notorious . ‘Angel of Death’ Dr Josef Mengele on inmates. She appeared at the Auschwitz Trial of former guards and overseers in Frankfurt in the 1960s but escaped jail. Guard: Gisela S worked at Auschwitz, the infamous front gates of which are pictured above. Over the gate is written Arbeit macht frei, 'work sets you free' The . conviction of Sobibor death camp guard John Demjanjuk in 2011, who was . tried in Munich on charges of assisting in the murders of 28,060 Dutch . Jews, means that prosecutors no longer need expert witness testimony . about what individuals did in death camps, proving that they were there . is now enough to bring about charges of complicity in mass murder. Nana Frombach, a spokeswoman for the . public prosecutor’s office in Hamburg, confirmed the investigation which . should lead to charges later this year.

Above a mass of Jewish prisoners are pictured in 1944 arriving at Auschwitz . Gisela S is one of 30 former Auschwitz personnel still living in Germany now under the microscope of war crime hunters. Six are women. The most notorious guard was Irma Ida Grese, employed at the Nazi concentration camps of Ravensbrück and Auschwitz, and was a warden of the women’s section of Bergen-Belsen. Grese was convicted for crimes against humanity at the Belsen Trial and sentenced to death aged 22.

"Britain is poised to overtake ailing rival France in car production as UK motor manufacturing heads towards a new record high.

Pushing ahead: Figures to be released later this month are expected to show 1.55million cars were built in the UK in 2013 . This would be up from 1.47 million in 2012 and 1.35million in 2011.

By contrast France’s car production is expected to slip to around 1.54million cars for 2013 -  down from 1.66million in 2012 and 1.88 million in 2011. France’s ailing economy -  exacerbated by problems with the Euro -  and overcapacity under the current socialist Government are cited as key reasons for its declining car sales. A spokesman for Britain’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said: ‘We’re currently neck and neck with France. ‘But Britain’s car production is on an upward trend. France’s is on a downward trend. We’re about to cross. It could well be that the new figures will show that 2013 is the year in which we overtake them.’ Germany is on track for 5.45m cars in 2013 with Spain reaching 1.76m. But recent big investments by car-makers in Britain are aimed at boosting production even further, said the SMMT. So by 2017 Britain is expected to hit a new record production level exceeding the 1.92million cars built in 1972 during the highpoint of the UK car industry - but also a period blighted by strikes, industrial unrest and union militancy. Car production for the first 11 months of 2013 was up 4.5 per cent to 1.424million with the SMMT predicting full year production is ‘set to pass 1.million for the first time in six years.’ The news comes as latest figures released yesterday (Tuesday) showed sales of cars in the UK soared by nearly 11 per cent in 2013 to a six year high of more than 2.26milliion - and back to levels last seen before the economic melt-down. Production: The motor industry and its suppliers already employs 750,00 people in the UK . The sales boom has been fuelled by rising confidence, cheap and flexible car finance deals, and windfall pay-outs by the banks to customers from the ‘personal protection insurance’ or ‘ppi’ miss-selling scandal. Pay-outs of around £3,000 per customer equate roughly to the deposit needed on a car finance plan. The motor industry and its suppliers already employs 750,00 people in the UK. Some 80 per cent of the cars built in the UK are exported. Of those exports, worth £30bn, half go to Europe and the other half to the rest of the world. Exports of cars and engines make up 10 per cent of the value of total UK exports. The car-building boom is being spearheaded by mainstream British-brands such as Jaguar Land Rover, MINI, and Vauxhall, super-luxury car-makers like Rolls-Royce and Bentley, and the UK factories of Japanese giants such as Nissan, Toyota and Honda. Bentley, owned by Germany’s giant Volkswagen group, is expanding to produce a new luxury 4X4 at its Crewe factory. Nissan is about to start full production of its new generation Qashqai model at its factory in Sunderland where it employs more than 6,100 building it and the Note, juke and all-electric LEAF models. In 2012 it recorded record production of 510,57 cars. From 2015 a new Infiniti model will be added following £250m investment creating 1,000 new jobs at the factory and with suppliers. MINI, owned by Germany’s BMW, started production at its Oxford plant of its latest generation model in November with the help of 1,000 new robots installed as part of a major £750million investment that helps preserve 5,500 jobs at the plant. Leading the way: The car-buying boom is being spearheaded by companies such as Jaguar . Rolls-Royce, also owned by BMW, is enjoying record sales with its Phantom, Ghost and Wraith Models. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata, is now expanding globally after investing billions in Britain including £1.5billion in a new hi-tech aluminium facility in Solihull creating 1,700 new jobs. Because so many car-makers are foreign owned, executives refer now to ‘the car industry in Britain’ rather than ‘the British car industry’. But business leaders and ministers say their presence proves that the UK is a good place to manufacture motor cars. New car sales in the UK alone raced to a six-year high in 2013. A total of 2,264,737 new cars were registered in 2013 - a 10.8% rise on the 2012 figure and the best annual total since the pre-recession year of 2007, said the SMMT. The annual total was boosted by a festive 23.76per cent rise, to nearly 153,000 sales in December alone- the 22nd successive month of increases. On average, an additional 600 extra cars were registered per day in 2013 than in 2012. Private sales made up 1.07 million of the registrations last year - a rise of 15.6% on the 2012 share. Luxury: Rolls Royce are enjoying huge sales of their Phantom model . SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said: ‘With its best year since a pre-recession 2007, the UK new car market has helped stimulate the country’s economic recovery.’ He noted: ‘While the European market is only now showing signs of improvement, the UK has consistently outperformed the rest of Europe with 22 consecutive months of growth.’ Mr Hawes explained: ‘The 10.8% increase in 2013 reflects the attractive financial offers available, as well as increased demand for more technologically advanced new cars.’We expect new car registrations to remain stable in 2014 as customers return to a more regular replacement cycle.’ Petrol engines’ share of the market grew slightly - from 47.8per cent in 2012 to 48.8per cent in 2013 - while diesel’s share dipped from 50.8per cent in 2012 to 49.8per cent. in 2013. The share of the market by alternatively-fuelled vehicles remained flat 1.4per cent. The ‘supermini’ sector was the largest last year, accounting for nearly 36per cent of all sales.","Around 1.55 million cars were built in 2013, up from 1.47million in 2012 .
In France, production expected to slip to 1.54million for last year .
By 2017, Britain is expected to hit a new production record - 1.92million cars ."
"A unique planet may be causing the star it orbits to act much older than it actually is, according to new data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. The star, WASP-18, and its planet, WASP-18b, are located about 330 light-years from Earth. Astronomers were shocked to find it displaying traits of an old star - and say its planet is to blame. The artist's illustration depicts a star and its planet, WASP-18b, a giant exoplanet that orbits very close to it. A new study using Chandra data has shown that WASP-18b is making the star that it orbits act much older than it actually is. Pillitteri's team determined WASP-18 is between 500 million and 2 billion years old, based on theoretical models and other data. While this may sound old, it is considered young by astronomical standards. By comparison, our sun is about 5 billion years old and thought to be about halfway through its lifetime. Using established relations between the magnetic activity and X-ray emission of stars, as well as its actual age, researchers determined WASP-18 is about 100 times less active than it should be. WASP-18b has a mass about 10 times that of Jupiter and completes one orbit around its star in less than 23 hours, placing WASP-18b in the 'hot Jupiter' category of exoplanets, or planets outside our solar system. WASP-18b is the first known example of an orbiting planet that has apparently caused its star, which is roughly the mass of our sun, to display traits of an older star. 'WASP-18b is an extreme exoplanet,' said Ignazio Pillitteri of the Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica (INAF)-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo in Italy, who led the study. 'It is one of the most massive hot Jupiters known and one of the closest to its host star, and these characteristics lead to unexpected behavior. 'This planet is causing its host star to act old before its time.' Pillitteri's team determined WASP-18 is between 500 million and 2 billion years old, based on theoretical models and other data. While this may sound old, it is considered young by astronomical standards. By comparison, our sun is about 5 billion years old and thought to be about halfway through its lifetime. Younger stars tend to be more active, exhibiting stronger magnetic fields, larger flares, and more intense X-ray emission than their older counterparts. The right image reveals that no X-rays of the WASP-18 system were detected during a long Chandra observation. The source is visible in the optical image, left. The non-detection in X-rays is surprising given the age of the star, suggesting that the planet is weakening the star's magnetic field through tidal forces. Magnetic activity, flaring, and X-ray emission are linked to the star's rotation, which generally declines with age. However, when astronomers took a long look with Chandra at WASP-18 they didn't detect any X-rays. Using established relations between the magnetic activity and X-ray emission of stars, as well as its actual age, researchers determined WASP-18 is about 100 times less active than it should be. 'We think the planet is aging the star by wreaking havoc on its innards,' said co-author Scott Wolk of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The researchers argue that tidal forces created by the gravitational pull of the massive planet – similar to those the moon has on Earth's tides, but on a much larger scale – may have disrupted the magnetic field of the star. The strength of the magnetic field depends on the amount of convection in the star, or how intensely hot gas stirs the interior of the star. 'The planet's gravity may cause motions of gas in the interior of the star that weaken the convection,' said co-author Salvatore Sciortino also of INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo in Italy. 'This has a domino effect that results in the magnetic field becoming weaker and the star to age prematurely.'","The star, WASP-18, and its planet, WASP-18b, are located around 330 light-years from Earth .

"The last-but-one trophy Tottenham won was the League Cup of 1999, with Allan Nielsen snatching an injury-time header for a 1-0 win over Leicester. Aside from Emile Heskey, then a young Fox and now a 37-year-old on a revival tour at Bolton, the cast of players from both sides are mostly managers, coaches or pundits. They include Kasey Keller, Neil Lennon, Robbie Savage and Tony Cottee from Leicester’s starting XI, and Sol Campbell, Justin Edinburgh, Les Ferdinand and David Ginola of Spurs. Allan Nielsen celebrates with the  cup and his man of the match trophy after the final at Wembley . And then there is Tottenham’s Swiss centre-half that day, Ramon Vega, who took the route less travelled for a former footballer, and went from the dressing room to hedge funds and asset management. In a 13-year professional playing career that ended in 2003, Vega did well financially for the era, playing at Grasshoppers, Cagliari and Spurs among others. ‘My top salary as a player was around £15,000 per week, at Tottenham, at a time when the best-paid players were on perhaps £25,000 a week,’ he told the Mail on Sunday. But it was his post-playing days when he really struck it rich. Having earned single-digit millions in total as a player, he has since banked around £15 million from asset management ... and counting. Former Tottenham man Ramon Vega won the cup before turning his back on football altogether . ‘The risks in business are bigger than in football, and the rewards can be likewise,’ he says. ‘My second career has definitely been more risky. As a footballer you’re an employee. You play. You get paid. ‘As a businessman you take risks. Your investment can go up. Or it can crash and you lose everything.’ He cites the 1999 League Cup win, played on painkillers because of a stress fracture in his ankle, as a career high. ‘The whole day was off the dial,’ he recalls. ‘Painful, so painful. But sport is about winning and it was a brilliant occasion. The Spurs fans were just fantastic.’ Vega played the 1999 League Cup win on painkillers because of a stress fracture in his ankle . His other football career highlights were winning a Treble in Scotland with Celtic in a brief stay in the 2000-01 season, and playing for Switzerland in a draw against hosts England at Wembley Stadium in the opening game of Euro 96. He had been called up years earlier by a former Swiss national manager, Roy Hodgson. Having earned a degree in business administration and finance from Zurich Business School while still a young player, he co-founded his first asset management firm, the Duet Group, in the final year of his playing career. He sold his stake for millions a few years later and now has interests in various companies including Vega Swiss Asset Management - which has around $1 billion of investor funds under management - and a new venture, From Pitch to Boardroom (FPTB). ‘With FPTB I’ll be combining my passion of football and my background in business to help other businesses succeed,’ he says. In essence, FPTB will offer consultancy services and management tools to corporations. Vega believes Daniel Levy is an astute man but claims Tottenham still haven't reached their potential . Vega believes English football could be much better run, and that with the top club’s ever-growing riches, they should be doing better on the pitch at continental level, Spurs included. ‘Daniel Levy is an astute man and he’s getting there but the club still hasn’t reached its potential,’ Vega says. He adds that football is an industry like no other. ‘In manufacturing for example, if your product is crap you can change it relatively simply and take it back to market,’ he says. ‘In football it’s the same principle but it’s nowhere near as quick and easy.’ He thinks in the short-term, Spurs have a realistic shot of glory in this weekend’s final. ‘The players are finally starting to catch up with the philosophy of Mauricio Pochettino,’ he says. ‘Of course Chelsea are strong, terrific, and Jose Mourinho will prepare them brilliantly. ‘But this is a one-off. Spurs will go out there under less pressure. I think they’ll win, 2-1, maybe 3-1, with Harry Kane scoring.’ If his prediction comes off, he won’t be the only one partying like it’s 1999. Vega believes the Tottenham squad are finally getting to grips with the philosophy of Mauricio Pochettino .","Ramon Vega played through the pain to help Tottenham lift the cup .

"A defiant dad-of-seven has responded to local officials who demanded he painted his house - by covering it in stars and stripes. Brent Greer, 43, was angry when a code enforcement officer visited his home in Bradenton, Florida after someone complained that he had left an old Christmas tree on a balcony - and slapped him with even more complaints. Among the gripes were missing window screens, peeling paint and the need for pressure washing, the Bradenton Herald reported. But Greer, a married foster dad whose seven children are all adopted, said he has more things to worry about than minor alterations - especially because the house is safe for his large brood. Scroll down for video . Proud: Brent Greer reacted to local officials' complaints about the upkeep of his family's home by painting it red, white and blue. The neighbors have supported the home's new look - which Greer said is staying . Fight: Greer inherited the 100-year-old home and said he should be able to do with it what he pleases . So he decided to stand up for his family and together, they slathered the house in the most eye-catching way they could imagine - one that comes with a message. 'I want to remind people this is America,' he told Bay News 9. 'This is the home of the free, and I'm not changing because I have some zoning ordinance that doesn’t like the way I express myself.' Next they plan to put a Liberty Bell on the second floor and the Statue of Liberty on the chimney. Greer, who grew up in the 100-year-old home, said the trouble first began when code enforcement officers responded to an anonymous tip about the Christmas tree a few months ago. In addition, some neighbors had complained about his 'tacky' holiday decorations. 'We . got our oldest daughter when she was 10,' Greer told the Bradenton Herald. 'She had been . homeless all her life and never even knew what a Christmas tree was. So . yeah, I go all out with Christmas trees and other decorations for that . very reason.' Support: Mr Greer, who has adopted seven children with his wife, said they have more to worry about than cosmetic problems with their home. He said the house is a safe place for his children to live . Before: Ahead of the paintwork, anonymous neighbors had complained that he still had a Christmas tree up on a balcony, and city officials complained that the house needed aesthetic updates . After: He said he has carried out most of the updates on his home but officials will check later this month . Volker Reiss, Community Services and Code Compliance Manager for City of Bradenton, said that his staff asked the family to remove the tree and they did. But then, the family were slapped with as many as nine other violations. Homeowner Brent Greer . 'He sent out a list of all these things and I was like, ""Are you kidding me?""' Greer said, adding that he was most annoyed by a complaint that the paint on the outside of the house was not up to standard. 'This is a house where a family lives and plays,' he said. Officials insisted that the issue was more than just cosmetic. 'We had a safety concern about . electrical,' they told WTSP. 'It seemed the wires weren't up to code. The balcony had . rotten wood, some concerns, but the home is livable.' Greer was told if he fix his house in accordance to the standards, he would be fined $250 a day. Inspiration? Greer's wife previously shared an image of this house on Facebook saying she loved that it reminded her that she was American . He added that he has now complied with most of the complaints and will work on others - but the color of the house is staying. 'I'm not going to paint over it,' he said. 'I like it.' Neighbors agreed that they also liked it, as well as the family's defiance. 'I think it's one of the best things in the neighborhood,' Chris Grumley told WSPA as he stopped to look. 'My family and I are British. We’re not transplanted Brits. We . live the American life, and it's people like this displaying their true . patriotism that makes us proud to be here.'

"American workers are less scared of being fired and are growing more confident in their level of job security according to an influential poll. The findings by Gallup suggest that job security among workers in the Unites States is at a record high and people are generally happier with their wages, jobs and benefits. According to the survey, 58 per cent of full-or part-time workers are confident completely satisfied with their job security. Confidence: According to Gallup 58 per cent of full-or part-time workers are completely satisfied with their job security . Satisfaction: Gallup's results show a marked increase in the number of American workers who are satisfied with their job security . This represents an increase from the levels recorded during the aftermath of the recession -- from 2009 to 2013 -- when roughly 50 per cent of Americans said they were completely satisfied. Over the past five years, workers’ key concerns were the weak economy and soft job market, despite the unemployment rate falling in 2010. Meanwhile, worker satisfaction with different aspects of their jobs vary widely. One . in four workers, or 27 per cent, are completely satisfied with their . amount of on-the-job stress, while three in four (74 per cent) are . satisfied with physical safety conditions in the workplace. However, the unemployment rate is currently down to nearly 6 per cent which appears to have given the American workforce a well-needed boost. This is helping many workers feel less fearful of getting the dreaded pink slip. Worry: These findings show that worries over wages, hours and layoffs vary widely . Gallup: The poll examined everything from safety in the workplace to chances of promotion among workers . However, according to Forbes, the ‘real' unemployment rate is around 12.6 per cent. This number reflects the government’s ‘U-6’ report, which accounts for the full unemployment picture including those ‘marginally attached to the labor force.’ It also includes those ‘employed part time for economic reasons.’ It paints a picture of people doing jobs that they are overqualified for until they find something suitable in their field. Yet while many are having to adjust their work habits, Gallup suggests that among those with a job, overall job satisfaction has increased over the past year. Last year, 54 per cent of workers were completely satisfied with the amount of vacation time they receive. This increased by five percentage points to 59 per cent in 2014. Recovery: President Barack Obama claimed during a Democratic Party fundraising dinner that the United States is 'stronger' since he took office in 2009 . In 2013, 56 per cent were satisfied with their boss or immediate supervisor. In 2014, 60 per cent are satisfied -- a four-point increase. The findings match those released by the US Commerce Department. It releases data each month on the number of layoffs as a percentage of total employment of the layoff rate. It was at a record high during the recession, but has fallen consistently since and is now back to pre-recession levels. But while the findings are welcome news it does not point to a full recovery. A recent Gallup poll found that only 31 percent of workers were satisfied with their earnings, a two point improvement over 2013, but low nonetheless. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama claimed during a Democratic Party fundraising dinner that the United States is 'stronger' since he took office. Yet, the federal government's debts have ballooned by $7 trillion since he became Commander-in Chief. The U.S. economy has been under immense strain over the past five years. And the percentage of working-age Americans who are part of the U.S. workforce has reached the lowest level since 1978. Millions more remain unemployed.","The findings by Gallup suggest that workers are .

"She is the new darling of the velodrome. But few who watched 20-year-old Laura Trott race to gold for the second time in three days will realise how her very presence on the Olympic track is a minor miracle in itself.

Scroll down to hear from Laura . Triumph: Double Olympic champion Laura Trott celebrates winning her second gold medal at London 2012 . This led her to suffer from severe asthma as a young girl for which doctors advised her to start swimming to strengthen her body. She was eight when she swapped swimming for cycling, becoming  European champion in 2010. She overcame her asthma but is still often sick after races, a result of a separate acid lining problem that also dates to her childhood. ‘I’ve been throwing up since I was 10,’ she said. ‘As soon as I stop I can’t control it for long. The worst was at the [2010] Commonwealth Games. It was on telly, wasn’t it?

"Chinese journalist Chai Jing has been branded a hypocrite and traitor for giving birth to her daughter in the U.S. in October last year. Chai, a China Central TV host, sparked the outcry based on her journalistic work. She is dubbed the 'Chinese liberals’ goddess' and in the eyes of the public she is seen as an advocate for China. As a journalist, Chai built an established career based on investigative work on the SARS outbreak, the Sichuan earthquake and coal mine accidents - becoming one of the country's most respected journalists. Traitor: Giving birth to her daughter in the US last year has caused public debate in China over whether Jing, pictured in a US airport, did the right thing . In 2009 she spoke at the Beijing Journalists Association’s speech competition where she outlined the value of a strong nation. The speech resonated deeply with the public and elevated Chai to celebrity journalist status. 'A country is built upon individuals; she is constructed and determined by them. It is only if a country has people who…build but do not take advantage of the land,' Chai said. When photographs of Chai holding her new born daughter, Chai Zhiran, in a U.S. airport emerged, the Chinese public was hurt and angered. Acclaim: Jing was held in high regard by the Chinese public for her work advocating China . Giving birth to her child in the U.S. was seen to undermine Chai's work advocating the country and the people took to the web to vent their rage and label her a hypocrite and traitor. Despite there being no confirmation that Chai's daughter is a U.S. citizen, the move has been labelled as unpatriotic. The images sent Weibio, China's version of Twitter with more than 300 million users, into a frenzy. Off Beat China reported that users did not agree with Chai's decision and were vocal about their reasons. 'I have no problem of her giving birth in the U.S. But she shouldn’t put on a show on TV as if she is a patriot and cares about this country or its people,' one user said. Debate: Chinese social media went into a frenzy when news of Jing giving birth in the US broke . Another user said: 'If she is an ordinary mum, I won’t be so disgusted. But Chai’s been trying hard to establish herself as a patriot who cares about this country. If so, be a Chinese!' 'This shows the hypocrisy of liberals in China. Their credibility is declining. People are glowingly disappointed at these so-called liberals,' said another. But not all the feedback was negative, with one person pointing out many others would do the same thing if given the opportunity. 'After all, U.S. has better environment, better healthcare, better education and better everything.' The backlash is also fueled by China's culture of corruption with many corrupt officials, known as naked officials, moving their entire families overseas, but mainly to the U.S. But to cash in the on their power the officials remain in China and are seen to have no desire to improve life in the country. The practice of 'birth tourism' is popular with Chinese women who travel to the U.S. on tourist visas in order to give birth to children who automatically become American citizens. The cost of having a so-called 'anchor baby' in America is estimated at $20,000. This includes accommodation, care in the weeks running up to the birth and for a month afterwards. Assistance with immigration paperwork is normally included in the deal. The practice of 'birth tourism' does not violate federal law but there are dubious ethical issues surrounding the practice. It is written into the U.S. constitution under the 14th Amendment that those born in the U.S. will be granted citizenship. According to studies on 'birth tourism' it is popular with wealthy mothers-to-be from several countries including China, South Korea, Taiwan and Turkey. Although most mothers return home after giving birth, because their child has been born in the U.S., it allows them to get around strict international rules for studying at American colleges. Once they turn 21, the children can also petition for permanent residency for their parents through family reunification. The government estimates that there were 7,462 births to foreign residents in 2008. The Center for Immigration Studies said close to 40,000 births each year are to 'birth tourists' - however that number could be as high as 200,000.","Journalist Chai Jing labelled unpatriotic for giving birth in the US .

"British hostage John Cantlie was brutally tortured by a British jihadi in Syria whom he nicknamed ‘Pinocchio’ because he always lied, court documents reveal. Mr Cantlie, a 43-year-old photojournalist from Surrey, is believed to be the last British hostage held by the Islamic State who is still alive. He was captured when he went to report in Syria two years ago and has recently been forced to appear in sickening propaganda videos for the terror group. Hostage: US photojournalist John Cantlie, 43, before his capture with a Free Syrian Army rebel in 2012 . Now in the most detailed account yet of the conditions of his captivity under the Islamic State, court documents reveal Mr Cantlie was: . The new testimony was provided by a Belgian who was held captive with Mr Cantlie and Mr Foley between August and September 2013. Sickening: Mr Cantlie has most recently been forced to appear in a propaganda video for the terror group . In an interview with Belgian police, seen by The Mail on Sunday, Jejoen Bontinck, 19, says that ‘Pinocchio’ was one of the guards who tortured Cantlie and Foley while they were held in an IS prison near Aleppo. Describing the guard, he says: ‘He came from Great Britain and had dark skin – he was of Pakistani or Bengali origin.’ Bontinck’s evidence will be of particular help to the Security Services who are desperately trying to track down Jihadi John and other IS terrorists who have beheaded four Western hostages, including Britons Alan Henning and David Haines. In the beheading videos, Jihadi John speaks with a British accent and can be seen to have dark skin. Bontinck was part of an extremist group linked to IS. When he tried to leave the group, they imprisoned him and accused him of spying. His father travelled to Syria last year and helped negotiate his release. But Bontinck is now a defendant in a court case in Belgium in which 46 suspects are accused of being part of a banned group, Sharia4Belgium, whose members have gone to Syria to fight. Bontinck says a second torturer at the IS prison was called Abu Horeia, whom Cantlie and Foley nicknamed ‘very good’. Bontinck explains: ‘They called him “very good” because they once saw him torture someone and he then said “very good”.’ Bontinck also claimed the two journalists were moved on several occasions and ‘tortured’ while ‘barely getting enough to eat’, before they were handed over to an IS group in Raqqa where Jihadi John and other members of the so-called Beatles are based. He says the first IS prison complex was next to a sharia court which was in an urban part of Aleppo screened by high buildings. Describing the cell in which the hostages were held, he says: ‘It was an ordinary room with pale brown walls, a pale brown floor in stone and a ceiling of the same colour. There were mattresses and reed mats and we had some books. ‘I think it was about four metres long and eight metres wide. There was electricity and light. It was half underground and the sash window was overlooking a huge dead wall. We had to eat in our cell. Apart from going to the toilet, we had to stay there all day. But still I think of all the prisoners, we were treated the best.’ They passed the time by playing games such as ‘animal, vegetable mineral’ in which they took it turn to guess who or what they were pretending to be. Evidence: Jejoen Bontinck, 19, the Belgian who was held captive with Mr Cantlie and Mr Foley between August and September 2013. He was part of an extremist group that was linked to the Islamic State . Bontinck adds: ‘They had already been prisoners for ten months. That means it must have been around December when they were taken prisoner. They were tortured by Al Nusra [Al Qaeda]. Torture included waterboarding. They had dirty water to drink.’ During his three-week detention with the two Western hostages, he says they became good friends, exchanging addresses: ‘Our conversations were about the present and the future… that James had better get married and the like. We also talked about what I want to do with my life. I wanted to do something involving computer games. John told me that he had once worked for Sega testing computer games.’ Bontinck says the man in charge of the prison was Abu Hobeida, a Dutch-speaking Arab, whom he described as tall and thin. Crucial: Bontinck’s evidence will be of particular help to the Security Services who are desperately trying to track down Jihadi John and other IS terrorists. Above, John Cantlie in an IS propaganda video . He told police: ‘He speaks perfect Arabic. I don’t know why or how he gained this important position. He has two wives and three children – the eldest is about seven. They are also in Syria.’ This man has since been reported to have been executed by IS over allegations of spying. According to Bontinck’s testimony, Kurdish prisoners held in adjoining cells were executed: ‘I know that people from the PKK [Kurdish fighters] were imprisoned in the corridors of the court. I think their fate had been decided. I suspect they were executed. When I was in the third cell I saw through the gaps in the door clothes lying in a pile down the corridor, whereby I recognised clothing of people who had previously been chained up in the corridor… . ‘Sometimes we heard a shot or a few shots in the cell; we suspected that these were executions.’","Mr Cantlie, believed to be last British hostage held by ISIS who is still alive .

"A 24-year-old American who was arrested in North Korea after traveling to Pyongyang and requesting 'asylum' is now begging the U.S. government to help free him. Matthew Todd Miller and fellow-U.S. citizen Jeffrey Edward Fowle have appeared on camera for the first time since they were detained in April. They are appealing to the State Department for help - and say they face trial for 'anti-state crimes' that could bring long, harsh prison sentences. Mr Fowle, a father-of-three from Ohio, was arrested after allegedly leaving a Bible in a nightclub while visiting the country. He apologized to the U.S. government for 'causing a headache.' Mr Miller was arrested on April 10 shortly after landing at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport. He reportedly tore up his tourist visa and requested asylum in the hermit kingdom - saying he chose . the country 'as a shelter.' On Friday, he appeared humbled on video. No looking into the camera, he said: 'I am now requesting help from the American government, the citizens of America and the world to release me from this situation.' Scroll down for video . Matthew Todd Miller (right) Jeffrey Edward Fowle (left) have been held in North Korea for three months and face a criminal trial that could send them to a labor camp for many long, harsh years . In their first appearance since being . detained more than three months ago, Mr Miller and Mr Fowle told a local . AP Television News crew that they were in good health and were being . treated well. They also said they were allowed to take daily walks. The brief meeting was conducted under the condition that the specific location not be disclosed. Mr Fowle said he fears his situation will get much worse once he goes on trial. 'The horizon for me is pretty dark,' he said. 'I don't know what the worst-case scenario would be, but I need help to extricate myself from this situation. I ask the government for help in that regards.' It was not clear whether they were speaking on their own initiative, or if their comments were coerced. The TV crew was permitted to ask them questions. A State Department official told MailOnline: 'Out of humanitarian concern for Mr Miller, Mr Fowle, and their families, we request the DPRK (North Korea) release them so they may return home.' The United States has no embassy in North Korea - but is working through the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang to keep in touch to the captives and help secure their release. Mr Miller was arrested after arriving at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport and declaring he had chosen to seek 'shelter' in North Korea . The State Department said officials are in 'regular contact' with the families of the two detained men. Little is known about Mr Miller. The State Department has refused to say where he is from or identify his family. North . Korea's state-run media have said the 24-year-old entered the country . April 10 with a tourist visa, but tore it up at the airport and shouted . that he wanted to seek asylum. He traveled to North Korea after purchasing a private tour of Uri Tours, a New Jersey-based company that runs tours to the reclusive nation. In an update in April posted to the company's website, Uri Tours said it had repeatedly tried to reach the family member Mr Miller listed a his emergency contact information, had gotten no response. To date, no members of Mr Miller's family have come forward publicly to ask for his release. North Korea says Mr Fowle and Mr Miller committed hostile acts that violated their status as tourists. It has announced that authorities are preparing to bring them before a court, but has not yet specified what they did that was considered hostile or illegal, or what kind of punishment they might face. The date of the trial has not been announced. Ri Tong II, a North Korean diplomat, declined to answer questions about the Americans at a news conference Friday at the United Nations. But when pressed in a follow-up question he said their cases were 'legal issues' and they had 'violated our law.' Kenneth Bae, a 45-year-old Korean-American citizen, has been serving a sentence of hard labor after he was arrested. He told a Japanese TV station he felt 'abandoned' by the US government . Fowle arrived in North Korea on April 29. He is suspected of leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the northern port city of Chongjin, but a spokesman for Fowle's family said the 56-year-old from Miamisburg, Ohio, was not on a mission for his church. Fowle works in a city streets department. He has a wife and three children, ages 9, 10, and 12. 'The window is closing on that process. It will be coming relatively soon, maybe within a month,' Fowle said of his trial. 'I'm anxious to get home, I'm sure all of us are.' Fowle also produced a letter he said he had written summarizing his experience in North Korea. A large number of Western tourists visited Pyongyang in April to run in the annual Pyongyang Marathon or attend related events. Miller came at that time, but tour organizers say he was not planning to join the marathon. 'I expect soon I will be going to trial for my crime and be sent to prison,; Miller said. #I have been requesting help from the American government, but have received no reply.' North Korea has also been holding another American, Kenneth Bae, since November 2012. Bae, a Korean-American missionary who turned 46 on Friday, told a Japan-based pro-North Korean news organization earlier this week that he felt 'abandoned' by the U.S. government. He is serving a sentence of 15 years of hard labor for what North Korea has claimed were hostile acts against the state. However, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday the agency is in regular contact with Bae's family. Last summer, authorities moved Bae from a work camp to a hospital because of failing health and weight loss. He was sent back to the work camp earlier this year, only to be taken again to a hospital less than two months later. His family says he suffers from diabetes, an enlarged heart, liver problems and back pain. Mr Miller and Mr Fowle were arrested after traveling to North Korea shortly after the landmark Pyongyang Marathon in April . Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said in a statement Thursday it was the first word the family has had of Bae since April. 'After months of silence, it is devastating to hear Kenneth talk about ""feeling abandoned by the United States government,""' she said. 'Although we acknowledge and appreciate all the efforts the U.S. State Department has been making behind the scenes to secure Kenneth's release, the fact remains that after almost two years, Kenneth still remains imprisoned in North Korea.' North Korea has in the past waited for senior U.S. officials to come to the country to secure the release of some American detainees. Both Fowle and Miller suggested that intervention from the highest levels in Washington — possibly a visit by a former president — might be needed to gain their release. The U.S. has repeatedly offered to send its envoy for North Korean human rights issues, Robert King, to Pyongyang to seek a pardon for Bae and other U.S. detainees but without success. Washington has no diplomatic ties with North Korea and no embassy in Pyongyang. Instead, the Swedish Embassy takes responsibility for U.S. consular affairs there. Though a small number of U.S. citizens visit North Korea each year as tourists, the State Department strongly advises against it. After Miller's detention, Washington updated its travel warning to note that over the past 18 months, ""North Korea detained several U.S. citizens who were part of organized tours."" North Korea has been strongly pushing tourism lately in an effort to bring in foreign cash. But despite its efforts to bring in more visitors — mostly from neighboring China — it remains highly sensitive to any actions it considers political and is particularly wary of anything it deems to be Christian proselytizing. In March, North Korea deported an Australian missionary detained for spreading Christianity in the country after he apologized and requested forgiveness.","Matthew Miller was arrested on April 10 after he tore up his tourist visa and said he wanted to 'take shelter' in North Korea .

They then relocated to the trendy West Hollywood hotel Chateau Marmont for an encounter that takes several paragraphs to describe. Johnny Weir is his second high-profile target. Readers learn he had little in common with the reality star and Olympic competitor who he met through Elton John. The sex, however, was perfect, according to Hollywood Reporter.

"The hardest thing about being one of the actors in Sherlock is that people expect me to know all the answers. For two long years after Holmes’ apparent jump to his death, wherever I went people would ask me ‘How will they do it? How will they bring him back?’ When I told them I didn’t know, it was the truth. And as much as I asked, nudged, and twisted arms to find out, no one would tell me anything until the scripts were finished. There’s a culture of secrecy around them which is absolutely right, even it if it is infuriating. Equally clueless: Rupert Graves tells his story of of life behind the scenes of Sherlock and how he still does not know exactly how Sherlock faked his death . The scripts for the third series arrived at my North London home last spring, and if you’d been the kind of Sherlock-obsessive who listens at doors, you would have heard a mixture of ‘Wow’, ‘Oh my God!’ and ‘I can’t believe you did that!’. The scripts arrived just a couple of days before our first read-through at a rundown church in Soho. It was the first time the cast had been in the same room together for two years, and we all got a bit giggly because we were so excited. It’s a lovely team — and the success of the show binds us together. It’s rare to be in anything that has an impact as big as Sherlock, and we are all enjoying it. Afterwards, the show’s creator and writer Steven Moffat reminded us not to breathe a word. The scripts are carefully crafted and you don’t want to ruin the surprise — however much people ask. And, boy, do they keep asking. Benedict Cumberbatch’s life changed the moment the first episode of Sherlock aired. His profile has become extraordinary. I think he found it overwhelming at first. He gets a huge amount of attention wherever he goes, and I don’t think he can even get on the Tube. Love and hate: Rupert's character Inspector Lestrade has mixed feelings about Sherlock . Because my role is so much smaller, I don’t have to deal with anything like that, though people often think they know me and sometimes mistake me for someone they met at their daughter’s wedding. From the moment I read the very first Sherlock script, I knew I wanted to be involved. It was an astonishing, adrenalin-filled action story, without actually much action in it. The adrenalin is all verbal: it comes from Sherlock’s mouth. His reasoning and intelligence is almost like that of a superpower. I like being the character who anchors him into the real police world. I’m the hapless Inspector Lestrade, whose relationship with Sherlock is interesting. He both loves him and he resents him. It’s not really anything do to with class. He knows he needs Sherlock’s brilliance, and he is angry at himself for not being brilliant. He is quite out of his depth with Sherlock — and he knows it. He looks flummoxed a lot. I’ve never played a copper before, and not playing the upper-class boy for once is nice. Because my name is Rupert and I starred in some glossy Merchant Ivory films, people have always assumed I’m posh and put me up for those parts. It’s never something I’ve been comfortable with. For a long time I wanted to change my name to Michael. I love working with Benedict and am full of admiration for him. He’ll have to learn three pages of speeches which are like verbal car chases — and I’ll just have to interject with the odd word, like ‘Exeter’. He has to work hugely long hours, but even when he’s doing night scenes after working all day, he’ll still be spinning around the room. It’s incredible. It’s like watching fireworks go off. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit there was a part of me that would have loved to have been Sherlock. After I’ve been on the show, I spend about a week pretending to be him. Did that woman have those shoes on before? If she changed them, why? What caused that scratch on that man’s face? But there are very few actors who could have played this version of Sherlock, and Benedict is the best of them. He has this very fast front-footed energy, which is perfect for this part. He always runs full pelt into a speech, and each take is always different. It does mean he occasionally stumbles, but what he does is brave; alive. Filming the wedding scenes in this last series were particularly fun. We spent two weeks at The Orangery in Clifton, Bristol. It was a great chance to catch up as we don’t often get to appear in scenes together. We watched, chewing three-day old cheese, as Benedict and Martin recorded scene after scene. There are worse ways to earn a living; it felt like a little holiday. There was some socialising — but I think people would be surprised at how tame our nights out are. When I started out, actors would get drunk all the time, but people work a lot harder now. Sherlock has always been very much a family affair. It’s produced by creator Steven Moffat’s partner Sue Vertue, and her mother Beryl, a BBC stalwart, is the executive producer. For me, that’s what makes it so good. Together, they have the power and the ability and the means to achieve their vision. Not over yet: Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Doctor John Watson are set to return for a fourth and a fifth season . Being with Steven and fellow creator Mark Gatiss is sometimes like stumbling into a Sherlock geek convention, because they know everything there is to know about him. You can see how they love the fact they’ve made Sherlock into the extraordinary character he was when he was invented all those years ago. The detective genre has moved on since Conan Doyle wrote the books, but now he has been reinvented he is a well-loved and astonishing figure all over again. The family theme has continued this series. Sherlock’s parents were played by Benedict’s real parents, who are both actors. They were both very nice, very normal people, who seemed really excited to be on the set. Dr Watson’s wife Mary was played by Martin’s partner Amanda Abbington, while Steven and Sue’s son Louis was cast as the young Sherlock. Do I know what will happen next? Of course not. I’m still as confused as anyone about exactly how Sherlock came back. I think it was a bit smoke and mirrors, but that was deliberate. It’s always dull hearing how a magic trick was done. Everyone is keen to make another series soon, and I’ve already driven my agent mad to find out when it will be. We are all waiting to find out what will happen next. Is Moriarty really back? Did he actually die? Will there be a Christmas special? I wouldn’t tell you even if I knew. But I genuinely won’t know until that script lands on my doormat. Hopefully it will be soon.",Rupert Graves tells his story of of life behind the scenes of Sherlock .

"A group of Virginia mothers have launched a fundraising campaign for a woman left to raise three sets of twins alone after her husband died suddenly. Dad-of-six Wayne Beale, who had a heart condition, passed away unexpectedly at the family's Fredericksburg, Virginia home on Sunday after battling bronchitis for a few days. The tragedy means that the 45-year-old man's wife, Joni, is now left to care for their children - two two-year-old girls, an eight-year-old boy and girl, and two 13-year-old boys. Due to Mr Beale's heart condition, the family was unable to secure life insurance for him, meaning that Mrs Beale, a homemaker, has been left with little financial support for her large brood. Tragedy: Three sets of twins, aged two, eight and 13, have been left without a father after he suddenly died on Sunday. A fundraising campaign has launched to help their mother, Joni Beale . But now, in just a few days, a GoFundMe page set up by fellow mothers has surpassed their aim. The total stood at more than $20,400 early on Friday. 'She . just can't believe it,' Mrs Beale's friend Joy Moeller told NBC Washington. '""Where is . all this coming from? Who are all these people?"" She said there are . people who have given, [she doesn't] even know who they are.' The page was first set up by Heather Ablondi, a religion reporter for the Free Lance-Star and a mother who met Mrs Beale through a preschoolers group. 'Going . forward, she needs to be able to pay her mortgage payment, her electric . bill [and] buy groceries for her kids,' Ablondi said. 'Just what could we do?' She said that they hoped to raise $6,000 to cover immediate costs for the funeral, plus anything else people were willing to give. But within 24 hours, they had already raised $10,000 on the page. Loss: Wayne Beale, left with his wife Joni and four of their children, had a heart condition that prevented him from getting life insurance. Mr Beale, who worked in construction, passed away on Sunday . Left behind: The twins are all home schooled by their mother, who is being helped by the community . 'It surprises me a little bit how quickly . it poured in,' she said. 'I think people just want to be there for her.' Friends said that the beloved family, who are church-goers, have never asked for anything; Wayne worked construction jobs while Joni, his wife of 20 years, home-schooled the children. 'He was a constant worker, just serving his family,' friend Michelle Nicely told the Lance-Star. Mrs Beale, who homeschools her children, is now planning her husband's funeral. Fellow churchgoers at Spotswood Baptist Church have volunteered to baby-sit and provide meals for the family and have watched as the GoFundMe page continues to grow. Generosity: By early on Friday, the GoFundMe page had raised more than $20,000 for the family . 'When you meet Joni, the first thing that . you notice is her amazing smile and enthusiam for life,' the GoFundMe page explains. 'It is hard to . believe that this beautiful, well put together woman is the mother of . three sets of twins! 'Joni is facing an uncertain future as the sole provider for her family. 'Her most immediate needs include the funeral expenses... We would love to raise over and above that in order to provide Joni a financial cushion to rely on while she makes plans for this unexpected chapter of her life.'","Wayne Beale died unexpectedly at the family's Virginia home on Sunday after briefly battling bronchitis .

"Spain legend Xavi has confirmed he will step down from international duty to concentrate on club football, and said he hopes to be welcoming new team-mate Luis Suarez to Barcelona sooner rather than later. After over 100 games for the national team winning two European Championships and a World Cup the midfielder, widely recognised as the country’s greatest ever player, said: 'I leave the Spain team a very happy man and I desire them all the best.' It did appear in the summer that he would also be turning his back on Barcelona but he finally committed himself to the club and speaking on Tuesday at the club's Joan Gamper training complex he said Barca players would be waiting with ‘open arms’ to welcome new signing Suarez as soon as his ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini was served. VIDEO Scroll down for Barcelona's Xavi retires from international football . End of the line: Xavi, pictured here in action against Holland at the 2014 World Cup, won 133 caps for his country . Game over: Xavi has decided to retire from international football after Spain's disastrous World Cup campaign . Plenty to smile about: The midfielder helped Spain win Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine . Champions: Xavi also played a key role as Spain won their first World Cup in South Africa in 2010 . The veteran 34-year-old said of Suarez's pending appeal, due to be heard at the court of arbitration for sport in Lausanne on Friday: 'It’s a spectacular signing. He had an incredible season with Liverpool and we hope that the sanction is reduced. I know him personally and he is a great person. 'He has apologised for what happened [at the World Cup] so we hope the appeal is successful.' The Barcelona captain – who will find out on Tuesday if he remains captain after a team vote – also admitted it was talks with Sporting Director, Andoni [Zubizarreta] and Luis Enrique that persuaded him that he still had a role to play. 'I’m I’m not 20 any more but I still have the same desire. I feel really good and I’m very happy to be carrying on,' he said. Xavi was one of Barcelona’s three captain’s last season with Carles Puyol and Victor Valdes and with the other two now gone from the club, players will vote on a new trio of leaders to take them through this season.

"People in Panama feel happiest about their lives, according to a new global well-being poll in which the U.S. finished 12th and the United Kingdom 26th. There were six Latin American countries in the top 10 in the poll, which asked people to measure their well-being across five key areas. Panamanians were well above the world average for feeling positive about their lives - 61 per cent were found to be 'thriving' in at least three of the five facets - compared with just 17 per cent internationally. Latin America is the place to feel happy: Seven of the top 10 countries in the well-being poll hailed from the Americas, with Canada rounding out the top 10. Six of the 10 worst were from Africa . The five elements of the poll were: purpose - liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals; social - having supportive relationships and love in your life; financial - managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security; community - liking where you live, feeling safe, and having pride in your community; and physical - having good health and enough energy to get things done daily. Interviewees were then put into three categories for each element - 'thriving' (well-being that is strong and consistent), 'struggling' (well-being that is moderate or inconsistent), or 'suffering' (well-being that is low and inconsistent). Adults in Latin America were found most likely to be thriving, with six of the world's top 10 coming from the region, which was in keeping with a previous Gallup-Healthways poll which found them to have the most positive outlook on life. Panama came top in four of the five categories, while Sweden was the world leader for financial well-being, with 72 per cent saying they were thriving. Costa Rica finished second in the overall rankings, with 44 per cent thriving in three or more categories, while Brazil, Uruguay, El Salvador and Guatemala also made the top 10. People in sub-Saharan Africa were found to be least satisfied with their lives - just nine per cent of those asked said they were thriving in at least three of the elements. The data was collected in 2013 for the Gallup-Healthways Global Well-Being Index - which they describe as 'a global barometer of individuals' perceptions of their well-being'. More than 133,000 interviews were carried out in person and over the phone to compile the report. Those living in poverty-stricken war-zones unsurprisingly had the lowest levels of well-being. In Syria and Afghanistan, just one per cent said they were thriving in three or more elements. Panama is a country with the best well-being in the world, according to a new Gallup-Healthways poll . People in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Chad, Madagascar, Uganda, and Benin also showed very low levels of happiness with their lives. More surprisingly, Croatia and Italy were also very low down the list. The results of the poll also showed how people's perceptions could sometimes differ from reality - for instance, Mexico and Saudi Arabia both came in the top 10 for physical well-being, despite being two of the world's most obese nations. This comes largely down to a lack of education about health. 12. USA - 33 per cent . 14. Netherlands - 33 per cent . 17. Mexico - 31 per cent . 21. Saudi Arabia - 29 per cent . 23. Australia - 28 per cent . 26. United Kingdom - 28 per cent . 29. Germany - 27 per cent . 51. France - 19 per cent . 71. India - 15 per cent . 90. China - 12 per cent . 118. Italy - 8 per cent . 128. Croatia - 7 per cent . All-in-all, countries in the Americas and Europe came out best for well-being, while worldwide, people felt they were thriving most in the community aspect of life - 26 per cent. Just 18 per cent of people internationally considered themselves to be thriving in terms of their sense of purpose, while in Asia and the Middle East and Africa, it was just 13 per cent. Only five countries outside of the Americas and Europe made it into the top 10 for any of the five elements of the poll: Bahrain in financial well-being (48 per cent), Saudi Arabia in community well-being (43 per cent) and physical well-being (39 per cent), Malta in social well-being (47 per cent), and Sri Lanka (50 per cent) and the United Arab Emirates (49 per cent) in community well-being. The USA ranked 15th for social well-being, 18th for sense of purpose, 21st for financial well-being and 25th for both physical well-being and community. Gallup-Healthways research has shown that those have a higher well-being rating are happier, healthier, work better and are more able to recover from problems than those with a low ranking. The results do not necessarily correlate with a country's wealth - China has a GDP of nearly $10trillion, but is 90th in the well-being rankings, with just 12 per cent of people thriving in at least three categories.","Latin American countries come out best in the poll, with six in the top 10 .

"Possums carry a flesh-eating strain of bacteria in their faeces harmful to humans . Scientists have discovered a strain of bacteria in possum faeces with the potential to cause flesh-eating ulcers in humans. Infectious disease researchers at Victoria's Barwon Health have found that the fury critters carry the buruli bacteria - a disease-carrying germ with the potential to cause 'permanent disfigurement and disability' in humans if they come in to contact with it. In most cases the bacteria leaves people with  major skin ulcers, most prominently on the arms and legs. However depending on the level of human exposure it can potentially render people permanently disabled. The most recent cases of exposure to the buruli bacteria have been in the Gippsland, Bellarine and Mornington regions in Victoria. Barwon Health Associate Professor Daniel O'Brien said possum faeces is rich in the bacteria. He told 774 ABC Melbourne there needs to be more research into whether contact with possum faeces is what causes buruli ulcers, also known as Bairnsdale ulcers, in humans. 'What we know in areas where we're getting infections and possums are infected is that their possum poo does carry a large amount of the organism,' he said. 'What we do think is a good public health measure is to remove the possum faeces from the area as much as possible and wash your hands as much as you can after that to minimise potential exposures.' The organism that causes the ulcer is in the same family as that which causes tuberculosis and leprosy, according to the World Health Organisation. 'Patients who are not treated early suffer long-term functional disability,' The WHO states. 'Early diagnosis and treatment are the only ways to minimize morbidity and prevent disability.' Researchers say that a better understanding of the transmission of the disease between possum poo and humans is needed . The infection usually begins as a painless, itchy pimple which then breaks down to form an ulcer. If treated early the ulcer is curable but if left to spread the condition can be serious, according to Professor O'Brien. 'The treatment is really quite difficult. It often involves a long period of antibiotics which can be difficult to take and often involves surgery.' He said people have been infected in Victoria's Gippsland region and the Bellarine Peninsula, and most recently in the Mornington Peninsula. No infected possums have been detected in metropolitan Melbourne. Professor O'Brien said a better understanding of how the bacteria is transmitted between the faeces and humans is needed. 'The most important thing for me is that we can prevent this infection, because at the moment we can treat it but we don't really know how to prevent it,' he said. 'When you see young kids coming into the clinic with really nasty ulcers on their arm ... what we really need to do is stop them getting it in the first place.'","Victorian researchers discovered the flesh-eating strain of bacteria .

"A British mother who is accused of kidnapping her four-year-old son for a year after Dubai court handed custody to her ex-husband has claimed she went on the run because he threatened to kill her. Afsana Lachaux, 46, from London, is facing charges of kidnapping in the United Arab Emirates this week after taking her son when custody was awarded to her French ex-husband by a Dubai court. Mrs Lachaux, was a senior . civil servant in east London before moving to the UAE in 2010. Afsana Lachaux, 46, from London, is facing charges of kidnapping in the United Arab Emirates this week after taking her son when custody was awarded to her French ex-husband by a Dubai court . She claims she has been living in poverty 'trapped' in the country since the authorities took away her passport following a travel ban obtained by her ex-husband. Mrs Lachaux alleges that her wealthy ex-husband has exploited Dubai’s legal system, based in part on Islamic sharia law, to gain custody of the little boy and have criminal charges brought against her. She is now facing . trial for allegedly abducting her son in March 2012, when she failed to . take him to a court-ordered access meeting in a park with her former . partner, a 38-year-old aviation engineer. She strongly denies the charge and told a court this week: 'I did not kidnap my son. But after one of our court hearings, my ex-husband threatened to kill me if I didn’t give him the boy so I got scared and stayed away from him.' In a letter submitted to prosecutors on February 18 last year her ex-husband wrote:  'She would forget his vaccinations, prevent the father from providing him with medical care, since he suffers eczema, and leaves the boy with strangers during her repeated travels and staying up late at parties with her friends.' Mrs Lachaux has been told she must produce three witnesses who support her defence, that she did not turn up because she had allegedly suffered domestic abuse. If she is found guilty at the next hearing on February 11, she could be imprisoned and deported. She told the Telegraph: 'I just want to be reunited with my son and I want to come back home. 'I feel let down and abused by everyone and everything, and especially let down by the Foreign Office.' One of her two adult sons in Britain, Rabbhi Yahiya, 26, is raising the profile of his mother's case at home. Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, told the House of Commons Mrs Lachaux had moved to Dubai, but is 'now stranded there' He wrote on a blog: 'On one occasion Afsana and her baby were flung into Bur Dubai jail where her baby was denied food and water and she was assaulted by a prison guard. Her incarceration was at the insistence of her husband. No investigation or action was taken into the false imprisonment or assault.' A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the arrest of a British national in Dubai in June 2011. We have been providing consular assistance to the family since that time and continue to do so. 'We cannot interfere in the judicial process of another country and must respect their systems just as we expect them to respect the UK’s laws and legal processes.' In December Jim Fitzpatrick, Labour MP for Poplar and Limehouse, brought up Mrs Lachaux's situation in the House of Commons saying she was a friend of mine, who has been a constituent.' He told the house she had moved to Dubai, but is 'now stranded there.' 'Sadly, although Afsana is a Muslim, because she is a woman in a Muslim country and because she is being reported by a man, even though he is French and, I believe, is not a Muslim, she has to explain and defend herself to each set of police officers who come to arrest her and, when she goes to report at police stations and is detained, she has to go through the elaborate process of explaining her circumstances all over again. She is not able to work and is surviving on what her family can send to her from London. 'To compound Afsana’s misery, she found out last month that her husband had divorced her and had successfully sued for custody of their child in a sharia court in Dubai more than 12 months ago. The rule in the UAE and under sharia law is that if 12 months have lapsed and the decision of the court has not been challenged, it is no longer appealable and is upheld. She was divorced and lost custody, but was not even aware of the fact.'","Afsana Lachaux, 46, from London, is facing charges of kidnapping .

"Killed: Shaaliver Douse, 14, was killed by police early Sunday. Officers say he pointed a gun at them . The mother of 14-year boy who was shot dead by a rookie police officer early on Sunday, spoke out on Monday to defend her son. Shaaliver Douse's death shocked New York City and the teenager had been in trouble with the police before. Parent Shanise Farrar said: 'I'm not saying he's the best. But he's my angel. 'I wouldn't want this to happen to nobody's kid,' Farrar told the New York Daily News. The New York City Police Commissioner, Ray Kelly, concedes that the teen may be the youngest person ever killed by the NYPD. Despite the tragic young age of Shaaliver Douse, Kelly was quick to defend the white 26-year-old officer, who just graduated from the police academy last month. Kelly said the teen had fired multiple rounds and was chasing someone through the streets of the Bronx about 3am Sunday. When two officers confronted him, he refused to drop the pistol and pointed it at them, the Commissioner said at a press conference Sunday evening. The officer fired a single round from his 9mm service pistol, striking Shaaliver in the jaw and killing him. Police sources told the New York Times that they believe Shaaliver was pursuing a gang rival. Detectives believe the incident was also . related to the shooting of a 15-year-old boy on May 24, only a mile and a half from where he was shot on Sunday. In that incident Shaaliver was arrested and charged with attempted murder. The Bronx District Attorney didn't prosecute after the victim couldn't identify Shaaliver, according to the Daily News. Farrar said of the victim: 'This person can't keep their story straight.' Shaaliver was also due a court appearance later in August from a weapons possession arrest in October. This bloody 9mm handgun (pictured here) was involved recovered from an armed 14-year-old Bronx boy who was killed by a rookie NYPD officer . The NYPD says this video shows Shaaliver shooting at the man in the blue t-shirt and then chasing after him . Police say this teen in a white T-shirt is Shaaliver. He can be seen running after his target on the streets in the Bronx . Douse threw a loaded revolver to the ground on October 10, as reported to the Daily News. The . NYPD released a picture of an Astra 9mm semiautomatic pistol covered in . the boy's blood after his shooting on Sunday- in an effort to prove . that he was armed at the time he was killed. The department also produced surveillance video that purportedly shows Shaaliver in a white t-shirt running toward a man standing in . front of a bodega and opening fire. A second video . shows Shaaliver chasing the target around the corner. It was there that . the teen was confronted by police. When Kelly was asked whether the Bronx teen was the youngest person ever killed by a New York police officer, he hesitated. 'I don't recall any other at this juncture. There may have been, I just don't recall,' he said, according to the New York Post. Despite this show of evidence, his family has denied that the 14-year-old boy was involved in gangs and said the NYPD is trying to whitewash the killing. 'They're making it all up. There was no gun. It’s all a cover-up. It’s what the police do. They kill us and cover it up,' the boy's aunt Quwana Barcene told the Post. 'It’s not fair. It was my sister’s only child. You shouldn’t have to bury your child. My beautiful nephew got shot in the head. A mother of one now has to bury her only child.' NYPD top brass are standing by the officer in the shooting - but are treading carefully. 'Regardless of the circumstances, this is a crushing blow to any parent,' Kelly said. The crime scene (pictured here) was located in the Bronx where in the early hours of the morning two uniformed police officers found boy firing at a fleeing man . In the aftermath of the shooting NYPD officers carefully case the scene for evidence where two rookie cops shot an armed 14-year-old boy . Ms Barcene likened the shooting to . the death of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Florida - a case that sparked . outrage across the country. 'Him, . Trayvon Martin, it’s never going to end.' she said. 'A child. Fourteen . years old. Fourteen years old. Gone. Shot in the head. By police.' Many . in the black community remain highly skeptical of the NYPD over the . shooting death in march of 16-year-old Kimani Gray in Brooklyn. Police . said the teen also had a gun, though the shooting drew marches across . the borough in protest of the killing. Sunday . was not Shaaliver's first run-in with police. In May, he was arrested . and charged with attempted murder after he shot and wounded a . 15-year-old boy in the neighborhood. Police say they used surveillance . video from that that incident to identify Shaaliver among a group of . teens running from the scene. However, those charges were later . deferred and Shaaliver was released back onto the streets when the . 15-year-old victim couldn't testify against his shooter. Police believe that shooting was gang-related, as well. The fatal shooting occurred in the Bronx at the volatile corner of Courtlandt Avenue & 151st Street . The shooting occurred right near this Bronx convenience store where police discovered Douse firing shots at a fleeing man . Police . said the altercation Sunday started when Shaaliver, who lives in a . nearby housing project with his mother, opened fire on a man standing . outside a bodega in the crime-ridden Melrose section of the Bronx. The target fled, running down the street, with Shaaliver chasing after him. Two . officers, age 26 and 27, who had jointed the NYPD in January and . graduated from the academy last month, were in the area as part of an . Operation Impact deployment of police in the neighborhood. The . uniformed officers identified themselves as police and ordered .

"Neglect: Tiffany Nicole Klapheke claims her military husband's deployment left her too stressed to care for her three children . A Texas woman who claims her military husband's deployment overseas left her too stressed to care for their three young children, one of whom died, remained jailed Friday in connection with their alleged neglect. Tiffany Nicole Klapheke is charged with three felony counts of injury to a child in connection with her 22-month-old daughter's death and the severe neglect of her two other daughters, ages six months and three years, Abilene police said. Her toddler suffered from dehydration and malnutrition from a lack of basic care over a period of time, according to the preliminary autopsy report from the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office in Fort Worth. Klapheke, 21, remained in the Taylor County Jail in Abilene with bonds totalling $500,000. She does not yet have an attorney, according to jail records. The report also shows that the toddler weighed only 17.5 pounds and her body had chemical burns, indicating the child was exposed to human waste. The toddler died at an Abilene hospital after being found unresponsive at her Dyess Air Force Base home Tuesday. The woman's two other daughters were treated for severe neglect at a children's hospital in Fort Worth, about 150 miles east of Abilene. They were to be taken out of intensive care soon, Abilene police said. Absence: Klapheke, pictured with her now ex-husband Thomas, had a boyfriend in the home at the time her child died, according to CPS . Air Force airman Thomas Klapheke has divorced his wife and the state has temporary conservatorship of the children, with their father granted restrictive custody . Marleigh Meisner, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, said her office has custody of the two girls. Meisner declined to discuss whether Klapheke had a prior history with the agency. Her office is talking to relatives as part of its 30-day investigation to determine the best placement for the children, she said. In an interview from jail, Klapheke told Abilene's KTAB-TV that she should have been a good mother and taken them to the doctor, but 'I didn't put them first anymore.' Klapheke, who moved with her husband to Texas a couple of years ago from Lexington, Kentucky, said none of her relatives live in the area. The young mother grew up in foster homes, a background that defense attorneys tried to use in the trial . She also said she tried committing suicide three weeks ago but a friend stopped her. 'I'm so just stressed out and depressed, and I just need help taking care of them, and I don't have any help,' she told the station. Klapheke recalled her impatience over her children's potty training, saying she left her toddler in the crib in her own urine for nearly a week. 'I just got tired of always changing the sheets, so it was on there a little bit longer than it should have been,' she said about her deceased daughter's exposure to human waste. 'I made a horrible, horrible mistake that I'm going to pay for for the rest of my life,' she said.","Tiffany Klapheke, 21, charged with three felony counts of injury to a child after her 22-month-old daughter died .

"Russia has re-established contact with a satellite containing geckos designed to test the effects of weightlessness on reproduction. The lives of the geckos, along with other animals on board including fruit flies, were feared at risk when engineers were unable to communicate with Foton-M4 following its launch on 19 July . But the spacecraft is now back in the hands of ground control and the mission can safely continue towards a planned landing on Earth in September. Scroll down for video . A satellite containing five geckos has been saved. The five lizards are flying in the Gecko-F4 experiment aboard the satellite (ground control experiment shown). They are being observed to see how their bodies and sexual behaviour are affected by microgravity . Five lizards are flying on the Gecko-F4 experiment aboard the satellite. Contained in a small room, they are being observed to see how their bodies and sexual behaviour are affected by microgravity. The species being used is the Mauritius ornate day gecko (Phelsuma ornate), according to Spaceflight 101, which can reach up to 4.7 inches (12 centimetres) in length. Inside . their habitat is a ventilation system to supply fresh air, food for two . months, environmental control in the form of temperature and light and a . waste disposal system. A video camera is being used to monitor their behaviour and any eggs that are produced. These . are expected to hatch after 40 days, which means they will hatch while . the mission is still in space - an important goal that would assess the . effects of microgravity on birth. The geckos and their offspring will be assessed on their return to Earth in September. ‘We have conducted several communication sessions, and the link is stable,’ head of Roscosmos Oleg Ostapenko said, reports Russia Today. ‘We are sure that we will be able to conduct 90 per cent of what we initially planned.’ Communication was made on the spacecraft on Saturday night. The Foton-M series of satellites are a continuation of the Russian Bion spacecraft, which are intended to observe the effects of space travel on different species. Aside from geckos this particular satellite also has other biological experiments on board including fruit flies and mushrooms from both Russia and Germany. The two-month mission will monitor by video how well the geckos sexually reproduce in space before returning them safely to Earth. The reason communication was lost with the 6.8-ton satellite isn't known, but Roscosmos thinks it may have been due to impact with space debris or a mechanical failure. The satellite will be studied on its return to Earth in September to see what the cause was. If it does turn out to be space debris, this will be cause for concern; it is estimated there are 22,000 man-made objects four inches (10 cm) or larger in Earth orbit. And there are some fears Earth orbit may become polluted to such an extent that many spacecraft are at risk. The biological experiment launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan last week. Ground controllers had been unable to communicate with the Foton-M4 satellite (illustration shown). The Foton series of satellites are designed to perform biological experiments in space . Following . the launch, the satellite had been failing to respond to commands to . start its engine and move to a higher orbit, according to the Progress . space firm. However, the rest of its systems were operating nominally, which means the animals on board remained alive. ‘The . equipment which is working in automatic mode, and in particular the . experiment with the geckos is working according to the programme,’ said . Oleg Voloshin after lanch, a spokesman of Russia's Institute of . Medico-Biological Problems, which is running the experiment. Progress said the design of the Foton-M4 ‘allows for the functioning of the satellite in automatic mode for a long time.’ Regaining control over the satellite's engine was needed to ensure its controlled return to Earth as planned in two months to recover the geckos for further study. At the moment the spacecraft is still orbital height of about 155 miles (250 kilometres). The original mission specification, however, called for the spacecraft to be raised to an altitude of 357 miles (575 km). The planned burn to get the spacecraft to this height did not occur after the launch due to a malfunction, leaving it stuck in a lower orbit. However, Russian space officials will decide today whether to attempt moving the satellite into a higher orbit, or they may consider leaving it where it is if the goals of the mission can still be attained. The capsule will re-enter Earth's atmosphere in mid-September and land via parachute in southern Russia. Pictured is the launch of the satellite on a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in the early hours of 19 July. Aside from geckos this particular satellite also has other biological experiments on board including fruit flies and mushrooms.

"Southampton squandered the chance to climb back into the top four as West Brom striker Saido Berahino’s early goal dealt a fresh blow to their faltering Champions League hopes. It took all of 72 seconds for Berahino to notch his 17th goal of the season as the Baggies made it just one defeat in 11 matches in all competitions under Tony Pulis and moved eight points clear of the bottom three. It was, however, another sobering afternoon for the Saints who would have leapfrogged Arsenal into the top four with a victory. Saido Berahino scored to put West Bromwich Albion 1-0 up within two minutes against Southampton .

West Bromwich Albion striker Brown Ideye (left) vies for possession with Southampton left-back Maya Yoshida . Ronald Koeman’s team have now won just one of their last five Premier League outings and there was further evidence here that their Champions League ambitions are fizzling out. ‘You need to pay more attention at the start of the game,’ Koeman said. ‘I was always realistic. Never was I thinking we would simply qualify for the Champions League as there are a lot of big teams normally fighting for those positions in the table. ‘We are trying to win more points than last season, playing the way we do, then we will see what happens.’ Front-foot football has been one of Albion’s hallmarks at home under Pulis and their flying start was a case in point. Chris Brunt’s hanging free-kick from close to the halfway line was only half-cleared by Maya Yoshida and Berahino made Saints pay with an emphatic strike into the top corner from 10 yards out — his first touch of the game. ‘It was a wonderful strike and goal,’ Pulis said. ‘There’s no questioning his talent. He is the icing on cake, that extra bit of quality every team is looking for.’ Sadio Mane wasted one excellent chance but the villain-in-chief for Saints was Graziano Pelle. The Italian was guilty of missing a sitter in the 68th minute when he somehow failed to connect with Ryan Bertrand’s ball across the face of goal. The one moment of controversy late on came in the visitors’ area when Stephane Sessegnon was correctly cautioned for diving. ‘If Sess has dived I will have a word with him, I won’t have that,’ Pulis added.

"An angry wife who tried to return $1.4 million in goods her then-husband bought from a saleswoman who was allegedly his mistress has settled has settled her lawsuit against Neiman Marcus. Patricia Walker, an Arkansas heiress living in University Park, Texas, wanted to return the goods after learning that her ex-husband Robert Tennison had been having an affair with her own 'trusted' Neiman Marcus personal shopper, Favi Lo, who received a steep commission on the purchases. The store was unaware of the liaison, according to court documents, and said it had no obligation to accept the goods. The collection of clothing, jewellery, accessories and artworks had been given to Walker over the three years she had spent recovering from a serious car accident. According to the Dallas News, the case has been settled but court documents relating to the case have been sealed. Not happy: Patricia Walker (above) from University Park, Texas, is suing Neiman Marcus after the store refused to refund $1.4million worth of goods bought for her by her ex-husband. She claims she never wanted the gifts . Expensive taste: The women's now ex-husband was allegedly cheating on her with her own personal shopper from Neiman Marcus, who received a commission on the goods, some of which are pictured above . The accident, which occurred in 2007, left her bedridden for a majority of the time. Lo, the female personal shopper who had an affair with Ms Walker's ex-husband, Robert Tennison, received a 'steep commission' from the purchases according to the plaintiff's attorney Mike Ticer. The store called Walker’s claims 'nothing more than the ventings of a . woman scorned by the infidelity of her former husband that have spilled . over from her highly contentious divorce.' Walker filed a lawsuit against the store on the grounds of fraud, deceptive trade practices and a violation of company policies which normally allow customers to return goods within a specified time frame. The store's returns policy was a weak point in Neiman Marcus' case. Neiman Marcus attorney Walter Herring claimed there was no written policy regarding in-store and catalog returns, saying that the decision was made at individual store manager's discretion. According to the Dallas News, Judge Ken Molberg asked, 'How does the manager find out about this unwritten policy if it’s not somewhere? Is it just kind of word of mouth?' 'I believe that must be, Your Honor, because they say there is no written policy,' responded Herring. 'Boy,' replied Molberg, 'I find that totally incredible.' Walker’s lawyer, Mark Ticer, took a printout from the Neiman Marcus website concerning returns that stated: 'You may return for credit, at any time, merchandise with which you are not completely satisfied.' According to a witness called by Ticer, a Neiman Marcus loss-prevention official, the store had at another time provided a refund for a customer in Atlanta returning a four or five-year-old pair of worn shoes because she 'didn't like them anymore.' Ex-husband: Robert Tennison, pictured, is the ex-husband of Ms Walker. He spent $1.4million on gifts for her . Cheater: Favi Lo (above), Ms Walker's personal shopper, is said to have received a steep commission on each of the ex-husband's purchases. She is still employed at the department store in Dallas . Walker had only learned of the alleged . affair in 2010, which was just a few months into the couple's divorce. She closed her account with the store immediately after she found out. Ms Walker was a loyal customer; she had spent $100,000 per year at the store up until her accident. Her husband's total purchases, which are described as 'like new' or in 'mint condition', outweighed her own by hundreds of thousands of dollars between 2007 and 2010. In 2009, his purchases totaled $850,000. According to FD Luxe, after Walker's car accident, her husband took over much of the running of the household - including her Neiman Marcus account. Walker, an heiress from Arkansas, married the already thrice-divorced Tennison in 2005. He had had some professional success but Walker was the financier of the marriage. Ticer told ABC that the gifts, including a pair of earrings worth $30,000 and a pair pf pajamas worth $285, were items that his client 'couldn't wear and never really wanted'. He said: 'The product of these sales is sex for merchandise.' Distasteful: Mike Ticer (pictured), the woman's attorney, claimed the gifts  were items she 'never really wanted' The store's return policy states: 'If for any reason you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept your . timely return of unworn, unwashed, or defective merchandise. 'Returned . merchandise should include the vendor packaging and tags and be in the . same condition as when it was received. Used merchandise cannot be . returned unless defective. A pickup and/or restock fee may apply.' After Ms Walker had requested that the goods be refunded, the store sent staff out to inspect the merchandise. Mr Ticer said 'the store never followed through or offered an explanation for not taking the items back'. Location: The Neiman Marcus store in Dallas where Ms Walker's ex-husband purchased the large amount of goods. His mistress, the personal shopper who earned commission on the purchases, still works there . He expressed further disapproval over the company's choice to keep Ms Lo as an employer. She is still employed at the retailer's NorthPark Mall location in Dallas. He said: 'The real villain in this case is Neiman Marcus. After . learning of this affair, they decided they weren't going to do anything about . it.' According to FD Luxe, Favi Lo, along with three other Neiman Marcus staff members, met with Walker for mediation in April. Together they drafted a four-page, handwritten agreement and canceled the jury trial scheduled for this month. A formalized version of the document, however, was contested by Walker, who refused to sign it.  According to court papers filed by Neiman Marcus, 'Walker has refused to sign the agreement - a document she last edited and approved — and she has not explained why.' Walker and Neiman Marcus returned to court on June 20 to settle the case. The transcript and papers related to the case are sealed and neither party will discuss the terms of the deal.","The store was sued by Patricia Walker after it refused to accept the return of $1.4 million worth of goods .

"The share of Americans in the workforce has sunk to its lowest point in 35 years. It's a sign of both an aging population and of unemployed people who have given up on their dispiriting job hunts. The drop could accelerate in the months ahead because Americans who have been out of work for more than six months have lost their unemployment benefits. Congress is debating whether to renew for a sixth year an emergency program that paid benefits averaging $256 a week. As a requirement to receive unemployment checks, recipients needed to actively look for a job. Without their payments, many workers will likely stop looking for a job. Once they do, they'll no longer be counted as unemployed and no longer considered part of the labor force. Low point: The share of Americans in the workforce is at its lowest point in 35 years . A gauge known as the labor force participation rate measures the proportion of working-age adults who either have a job or are looking for one. This rate fell to 63.2 percent last year, its lowest level point 1978, according to the Labor Department. The rate had peaked at 67.1 percent during the late 1990s. At the time, it was buoyed by a strong economy, the baby boom generation entering its peak earning years and the entrance of more women into the workforce. The rate's decline has accelerated since the 2008 financial crisis, partly because baby boomers are reaching retirement age and the unemployed have struggled to find work. So what happened in . December? Economists struggled for explanations: Unusually cold weather. A statistical quirk. A temporary halt in steady job growth. Blurring . the picture, a wave of Americans stopped looking for work, meaning they . were no longer counted as unemployed. Their exodus cut the unemployment . rate from 7 percent to 6.7 percent - its lowest point in more than five . years. Friday's weak report from the Labor . Department was particularly surprising because it followed a flurry of . data that had pointed to a robust economy: U.S. companies are selling . record levels of goods overseas. Americans are spending more on big . purchases like cars and appliances. Layoffs have dwindled. Consumer . confidence is up and debt levels are down. Builders broke ground in . November on the most new homes in five years. Bottom line: Economist Robert Shapiro says that the bottom line is the economy isn't creating jobs for everyone who wants them . 'The . disappointing jobs report flies in the face of most recent economic . data, which are pointing to a pretty strong fourth quarter,' said Sal . Guatieri, an economist at BMO Capital Markets. Economists differ over which single factor best explains the decline in labor force participation. But few dispute that the trend will likely persist. More than 1.3 million Americans lost these benefits when the program expired last month. An additional 800,000 will lose their checks in the weeks ahead. Economists say the likelihood of landing a job dims substantially after six months of unemployment. The economy remains 1.2 million jobs shy of the 8.7 million that disappeared after the recession struck. 'The bottom line: The economy is not creating positions for these people,' said Robert Shapiro, chairman of the economic advisory firm Sonecon. Here is a chart of changes in labor force participation in five-year increments: . Labor Force Participation . 1978 63.2 percent1983 64 percent1988 65.9 percent1993 66.3 percent . 1998 67.1 percent2003 66.2 percent2008 66 percent .","The share of Americans in the workforce has sunk to its lowest point in 35 years .

"For years, scientists thought that the eternal flame in New York was kept alight by gas produced by ancient, extremely hot rocks. However, researchers from Indiana University have discovered that the rocks underneath the Chestnut Ridge County Park aren't hot enough to produce this gas, which means another process is producing the gas that's keeping the flame burning. And they have not been able to identify exactly what the process is. Scroll down for video . The New York eternal flame is found in the Eternal Flame Falls, a small waterfall in the Shale Creek Preserve at the Chestnut Ridge Park. A small chamber under the waterfall produces natural gas, which keeps the flame alight. Researchers from Indiana University are unsure the source of this gas, after previous theories were disproved . There are thousands of flames around the world that are able to burn constantly because of gas seeping through the soil, or because of man-made structures. Some of the man-made flames are kept alight for religious reasons, others were lit in honour of famous people who had died, such as the eternal flame at the Kennedy memorial. However, natural eternal flames, like the one in New York, are rare. This is because natural eternal flames can only be kept alight by gas 'macro seeps'. Gas usually comes through . soil, where bacteria eats the methane converts it into carbon dioxide. Alternatively, gas comes out in a location where it disappears quickly, so can't keep a lit flame burning. In the case of the New York flame, a 'macro seep' of gas comes from a . natural hollowed-out chamber. Because the gas is contained and isn't converted, the flame is kept alight eternally. The eternal flame sits behind a waterfall in western New York. It is said to have been lit thousands of years ago by Native Americans. There are hundreds of 'natural' eternal flames around the world, and each one is thought to be kept alight by natural gas produced from the rocks beneath it. The gas used to keep the flames burning is thought to come from ancient and extremely hot rocks called shale. However, Arndt Schimmelmann and the researchers from Indiana University discovered that rocks beneath the flame in New York aren't hot enough to produce this reaction. Schimmelmann told OurAmazingPlanet that the rocks were only the temperature of a 'cup of tea'. Plus, the shale isn't as old as first expected. Both of these factors mean that the shale beneath the New York flame couldn't be creating gas in the same way as other flames around the world. And the researchers admitted they are unsure exactly how the New York gas is being produced. Researchers from Indiana University took several measurements of the eternal flame in New York. By measuring the size of the flame, the researchers were able to determine how much gas it needed to burn . Although there are thousands of eternal flames around the world, many are man-made for religious purposes or in honour of famous people who have died, such as President Kennedy at the Kennedy Memorial. However, natural occurring flames are rare because the gas and flame need to live in a specific environment to make sure the gas isn't burnt away or destroyed, and the flame doesn't go out . Schimmelmann said: 'We think there's a . different pathway of gas generation in this location and that there . probably is elsewhere as well. 'If . that's true, and gas is naturally produced this way in other locations, . we have much more shale-gas resources than we thought,"" he added. The temperatures, said to be near the . boiling point of water or hotter, break down the carbon molecules in . the shale and this reaction gives off a natural gas. Schimmelmann and his colleague Maria Mastalerz . made the discovery as they were studying the amount of methane that is . produced by the ground along the east coast of America. The eternal flame in New York was said to have been lit thousands of years ago by Native Americans and has been kept alight by naturally formed gas. Yet researchers from Indiana University have since discovered that the way the gas is produced is different to what was first thought and are unsure of the source . This geologic map of western New York State and north-western Pennsylvania shows the locations of eternal flames at Chestnut Ridge County Park and Clarington . They also looked at a 'permanently burning pit' in Cook Forest State Park in northwestern Pennsylvania, although this eternal flame is fuelled by an old gas well. The team reported their findings in a study published in the May issue of the journal Marine and Petroleum Geology. The researchers also discovered that the New York gas seep also features the highest concentration of ethane and propane of any seep in the world, according to the study. Researchers from Indiana University also studied the eternal flame in Pennsylvania. This map shows the profile of gas flux measurements at the Pennsylvanian gas seep in, plus the 3D plots of methane flux distribution .","Thousands of eternal flames across the world are usually kept alight by gas formed from boiling hot ancient rocks .

"Salford owner Marwan Koukash will not walk away from the club and is to enlist the help of Australia's national coach Tim Sheens in an effort to turn around their fortunes. The multi-millionaire racehorse owner sparked off fevered speculation over his future with the Red Devils in the wake of last Thursday's crushing 52-6 defeat by St Helens in their opening home Super League match of the season by tweeting: 'I have had enough'. Koukash then went to ground but emerged on Monday to insist he remains fully committed to the club. Luke Thompson touches down as Salford were thrashed 52-6 by St Helens in their first game of the season . He told Press Association Sport that the position of head coach Iestyn Harris is not under threat. Indeed, he will be given 'additional resources' if necessary. Koukash, who ploughed between £3million and £4million in his first two years in charge of the Salford club, also revealed his plans to bring Sheens over from Australia to provide him with advice and help put new structures in place. Of his famous tweet, Koukash said: 'I don't want to discuss that publicly. I discussed it with my boys this morning. We had a great meeting and whatever was discussed in house is going to stay private. 'I'm not walking out on the club. We're going to come out fighting. 'I'm going to work harder and if Iestyn wants additional resources he will have them at his disposal. Australia coach Tim Sheens will advise Koukash, but the Salford owner insists Iestyn Harris' job is safe . 'And also a friend of mine will be visiting me soon, to look around the club and give me his opinion. I'm not the most experienced person in rugby league - I've only been in the sport for three years - and sometimes I need extra help. 'That friend is Tim Sheens, who will visit me for three weeks and advise me on various bits and pieces and help put some systems and structures into the club.' Koukash, a regular visitor to Australia, says he expects Sheens to arrive for a pre-arranged visit by the end of the month and insists his presence will not threaten the position of Harris. 'He's not coming for any other reason but to look at the club as a friend to help me out,' Koukash said.","Speculation followed Salford owner's tweet after defeat to St Helens .

"A mysterious disease is killing dogs across Britain, vets have warned. Pet owners have been urged to look out for the disease - which so far has no name - if their dogs start to forming lesions on their lower legs. Warning posters were yesterday put up in popular dog walking parts of the New Forest, Hampshire. So far 16 dogs have died in the last year - nine in Hampshire, and seven in other parts of the country including Cornwall, Surrey, Worcestershire and County Durham. Tests: Vets are fighting to find what disease is crippling and killing dogs across the UK (stock image) Dogs which have been killed by the disease develop lesions on the lower legs followed by kidney failure between two and seven days later. Vet David Walker said that the deaths have similarities to a disease called Alabama rot which was first reported in the United States in the 1980s. He said Alabama rot was caused by toxins from the E. coli bacteria - but this had not yet been traced in the UK. Mr Walker, from Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists in Hursley, near Winchester, told the BBC: 'The advice I would give to the pet-owning general public is if you see a wound on your dog's leg, where you might ordinarily leave that for 12 to 24 hours, the advice would be to take your dog to the vets. 'Most vets are now aware of the condition so seek early veterinary attention.' British Veterinary Association president Robin Hargreaves said: 'Dog owners in these regions will feel understandably anxious about the recent cases but it seems that only a very small proportion of the dogs walked in these areas each day have been affected. 'Owners should make sure they are aware of the signs and symptoms and contact their vet immediately if they have any concerns.' A Forestry Commission spokesman said that the cause of the deaths had not yet been confirmed and added that signs had been put up to advise dog owners to look out for the symptoms. He said: 'There have been a few as yet unexplained incidents in the New Forest and the Forestry Commission is working closely with vets and putting up notices to inform the public. 'Owners should always keep their dogs under close control and be aware of anything they may pick up, chew or eat in a woodland area. If their dog becomes ill they should contact a vet as soon as possible with as much information as they can.' The sign says: 'Dog owners are advised to look out for wounds or lesions on the limbs or face of their dog which will not heal. Affected dogs then go on to develop signs of severe depression, loss of appetite and vomiting, quickly accompanied by acute injury to the kidneys.'","The nameless disease gives dog lesions on their lower legs, experts warn .

"This map of China's Lunar New Year travel tells a story of massive migration home from the big city. The interactive, updating graphic posted online by the Chinese Internet portal Baidu shows a 'heat map' of lines tracing the trips of individual travellers. The brightest spokes emanate from eastern employment hubs Beijing, Shanghai and the southern nexus of Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Dongguan. Use your mouse to see each journey on the map below . The most popular destination is Beijing, followed by Chongqing. The hub cities in Hunan and Guangxi provinces tie for third. Beijing is also the most popular city to leave, followed by Shanghai and Guangzhou. The trip both to and from Chengdu and Beijing take up the top two most popular routes. During the 40-day holiday period – which is called Spring Festival in Chinese – 3.6 billion passenger trips will be made. The Year of the Sheep — which is also known as the Year of the Goat - begins on February 19th. About 80 million people were traveling on Monday alone, mostly by road, according to government estimates. Baidu was able to illustrate many of those journeys thanks to the 350 million active users of its smartphone map and other apps that use location positioning. If someone uses a Baidu app in Beijing in the morning, then pings from the southwestern city of Kunming in the evening, a new trip will be registered and a straight line added from Beijing to Kunming. Lines glow white-hot during the biggest travel days of the holiday, which officially runs from Wednesday through Feb. 24 but unofficially includes many days on either end. The period of heightened travel is considered 40 days long. 'You're basically looking at the serious intensity of travel in this holiday. 'It's not just the world's biggest human migration, it's the biggest mammalian migration,' Baidu spokesman Kaiser Kuo said. 'It's a sight to behold. It's quite miraculous that nothing goes terribly wrong.' The Baidu Migration interactive also includes data for individual cities, airports and train stations, and could help transportation officials plan future seasons, Kuo said. During the 40-day holiday period – which is called Spring Festival in Chinese – 3.6 billion passenger trips will be made . If he used Baidu apps, 28-year-old Li Shengtao would have contributed to the Baidu interactive when he departed by train from Shanghai where he works as an interior designer for his annual, 1,100-kilometer journey to his northern hometown of Shijiazhuang. 'Even if you don't manage to buy a ticket you have to get home somehow,' Li said. 'That's the tradition of us northern Chinese.' The interactive has been employed for more than details on holiday travel. Last Lunar New Year season, some media outlets suggested, rather dubiously, that many of the bright lines on the map emanating from the city of Dongguan were prostitutes fleeing a crackdown there.

"Tragic: Less than three weeks after this photo of Nico Lambrechts and his wife Adele was posted online, the investment analyst fell 80ft to his death . He appeared to have the perfect life. Pictured on a recent tropical holiday, Nico Lambrechts looked a relaxed and contented family man as he posed with his wife. But less than three weeks after he posted this photograph on the internet, the investment  analyst fell 80ft to his death from an exclusive open-air restaurant in London. The successful 46-year-old took a lift to Sir Terence Conran’s Coq d’Argent at lunchtime and then fell through the atrium within the building. He landed next to diners who were enjoying lunch at cafes and bars in a shopping complex at the bottom of the building in the City. Medics reached him within minutes but were unable to save him. He was pronounced dead by a doctor at the scene minutes later. Mr Lambrechts is thought to have made the short walk to the restaurant from his office at Investec Asset Management in the Square Mile. Last night neighbours said they were baffled as to why a devoted family man would want to potentially commit suicide. His wife Adele was too distressed to talk about her loss. But a neighbour said: ‘He was a really great guy.’ When asked about the reason behind the possible suicide, he said: ‘You never know. He was a random man, unpredictable – you know.’ Mr Lambrechts lived with his wife and three children in a £2million six-bedroom gated home in the upmarket town of Cobham, Surrey. He took his family on luxury holidays to destinations such as Venice. The banker’s death last week is the fourth to have occurred at the restaurant and the second in as many months. In May 2007, City employee Richard Ford, 33, died after he plunged from the terrace onto a bus. In July 2009 stockbroker Anjool Malde, 24, leapt to his death from the venue holding a glass of champagne after being suspended from his job at Deutsche Bank. And last month diners watched in horror as businesswoman Rema Begum, 29, took a sip of wine from her glass on the outdoor terrace, before putting her handbag on the floor and then toppling over the edge. Another tragedy: In May 2007, City employee Richard Ford (right), 33, died after he plunged from the terrace of Sir Terence Conran’s Coq d’Argent (left) onto a bus . Suicide: Mr Lambrechts jumped to his death in the internal atrium of the building in the City of London . A woman who works in a shop nearby said the restaurant is ‘cursed’ because of the rising number of deaths. ‘It’s become a trademark place to come and commit suicide,’ she said. ‘It’s very sad.’ Coq d’Argent is built on the site of an ancient burial ground where for centuries hundreds of corpses of affluent Londoners were  buried in shallow graves. The restaurant appeared in the James Bond-themed film sequence for the Olympics opening ceremony that featured the Queen. In the film, diners at Coq d’Argent can be seen waving to a helicopter which supposedly contains Her Majesty and James Bond actor Daniel Craig, who ‘fly’ over the restaurant on their way to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford where the Queen ‘parachutes’ in. Yesterday an inquest into Mr Lambrechts’s death was opened and then adjourned at the City of London Coroner’s Court. The man fell to his death in the building's internal atrium . Site: Police stand at the spot where Mr Lambrechts fell to his death . W worker cleans the area where Mr Lambrechts died . Witnesses have told how they heard a ‘loud bang’ and a ‘cracking like a whip’ as he hit the ground near Bank Tube station. Rita Olsen, a Danish tourist, said she thought there had been a car crash. ‘I was texting my friend to arrange meeting her because I was running late and suddenly heard a loud bang and a cracking sound, like a whip,’ she said. 'He was a really great guy. He was a random man, unpredictable - you know' Nico Lambrechts's neighbour in Cobham . ‘Someone screamed and I couldn’t see what was happening, but thought maybe there had been a car crash but when the police showed up I realised someone had died. ‘It is really sad and I’m still in shock. I was horrified when I found out what had happened. I feel sorry for whoever he has left behind.’ Some workers blamed the stress of the City for the spate of deaths. One said: ‘The last girl only jumped not too long ago and someone else died a while back when they jumped and landed on a bus. ‘It’s terrible that someone can be in such a bad place that they would do that. Maybe the pressure of working in the City got to him.’ Also dead: In July 2009 stockbroker Anjool Malde (pictured with singer Geri Halliwell), 24, leapt to his death from the venue holding a glass of champagne after being suspended from his job at Deutsche Bank .","Nico Lambrechts posted this tropical holiday photo online three weeks ago .

"The last words of one woman who died at Mt Everest’s highest base camp were ‘save me,’ according to a close friend. Toronto native Shirya Shah-Klorfine was one of the four who were confirmed dead after a ‘traffic jam’ of mountaineers rushed to scale the 29,000ft peak over the weekend during a brief window of good weather on the world’s tallest mountain. The news comes as another climber at base camp said as many as seven people could be dead. Scroll down for video . Dead: German doctor Eberhard Schaaf, left, and Nepalese-Canadian Shriya Shah-Klorfine were among those found; according to a friend, Shah's last words were 'Save me' Treacherous: The area above the last camp at South Col is nicknamed the 'death zone' because of the steep icy slope, dangerous conditions and low oxygen level . The top of the world: Mount Everest, in Nepal's Himalayas, is the tallest peak... and also one of the deadliest . Shah-Klorfine told a Sherpa guide ‘save me’ before she died while attempting to descend from the summit, according to family friend Shellyann Siddoo. Ms Siddoo told CBC’s Metro Morning: ‘I just learned…that her last words were “save me,” as she was taking her last breath.’ About 150 people - described as a 'traffic jam' by Everest's standards - rushed to scale the 29,000ft peak. However, a fierce windstorm swept the higher altitudes of the mountain on Saturday morning and many climbers were left trapped as they waited for it to pass before beginning their descent. Colorado native Dr Jon Kedrowski told station Fox 31 in Denver in an exclusive interview today that some climbers have not yet been located, and as many as seven could be dead. Dr Kedrowski was climbing the mountain over the weekend, but was not able to reach the summit. Tributes: The page one of the victims created on Facebook so people could keep up-to-date with her trek . Fatal expedition: Mountain climber Shriya Shah had been updating her friends via Facebook of her progress . Progress: In a photo album on her Facebook page titled 'Expedition Pictures', praise for Shriya (pictured) turned to condolence messages . He said he passed climbers returning from the summit who were hallucinating and disoriented, and suffering from bad altitude sickness. He told Fox 31: ‘I counted four people that had either died that evening or probably got disoriented or basically passed out from their summit attempts on the 19th.’ He described seeing climbers acting 'like zombies' as they returned to the summit of Mount Everest in deadly overcrowding which claimed the lives of four people. 'Once you are above 8,000 metres - or 26,000 feet - the body deteriorates so fast that if you are not with a big group of people that can help you  there's really nothing you can do.' -Dr Jon Kedrowski . Many of those stuck were without sufficient oxygen supplies for their extended stay at the top and some who made it down were suffering from severe exhaustion and altitude sickness. Dr Kedrowski ended up helping with four of the attempted rescues close to Everest's summit, the Huffington Post reported. The climber, from Avon in Colorado, told Fox 31: 'I counted four people that had either died that evening or probably got disorientated and basically passed out. 'Once you are above 8,000 metres - or 26,000 feet - the body deteriorates so fast that if you are not with a big group of people that can help you  there's really nothing you can do. '[One man] was basically hallucinating, he took his hat off, his gloves were thrown away and then he kind of reached out and looked at me … he kind of reached out to me, kind of in a zombie-like fashion. 'At that point, there’s not a lot you can do for somebody that’s dying and frozen to death.' Ascent: Climbers who had made their way to the summit over the weekend had waited for several days at a 'staging camp' for the conditions to improve before continuing . Risky: Climbers are advised to not attempt to reach the summit after 11am . German doctor Eberhard Schaaf, 61, Nepalese-Canadian Shriya Shah-Klorfine and South Korean Song Won-bin are all believed to have to have died from a brain swelling triggered by the high altitude as they made their way down from the 8,850-metre summit. It has now been confirmed that a fourth climber - a Chinese national - died on the mountain. Nepali mountaineering official Gyanendra Shresta confirmed that the body of Ha Wenyi was discovered near the spot where the three other climbers perished. His Nepalese Sherpa guide, who had been reported as missing, reached the base camp safely after he became separated from the group without sufficient communications equipment. The deaths this weekend have been described as one of the worst days ever recorded on the world's highest mountain and has prompted concerns about overcrowding at Everest's peak. Climbers who had made their way to the summit over the weekend had waited for several days at a 'staging camp' for the conditions to improve before continuing with their ascent. The brief window of clear weather on Friday afternoon presented the first opportunity of the year to scale the world's highest mountain, resulting in a race to get to the top. Gyanendra Shrestha, of Nepal's Mountaineering Department, said: ‘There was a traffic jam on the mountain on Saturday. Climbers were still heading to the summit as late as 2.30pm, which is quite dangerous.’ Climbers are advised to not attempt to reach the summit after 11am. The area above the last camp at South Col is nicknamed the ‘death zone’ because of the steep icy slope, treacherous conditions and low oxygen level. ‘With the traffic jam, climbers had a longer wait for their chance to go up the trail and spent too much time at higher altitude,' Shrestha said. 'Many of them are believed to be carrying limited amount of oxygen not anticipating the extra time spent.' The power of nature: A storm on Mount Everest, where four climbers died over the weekend . Feat: Climbers reaching the summit of Everest in 2009 . The climbers who died were believed to have suffered high altitude cerebral oedema. One of the victims - Nepalese-born Canadian Shriya Shah - had been updating her friends on her progress on Everest via her Facebook page. A photo album titled 'Expedition Pictures' featured a series of comments from friends commending the climber's bravery. However, the praise turned to messages of condolence as news of her death emerged. One friend, Kimberly Vogel, posted: 'Condolences to your family and friends. You remain an inspiration to young adventurers everywhere and to us all. Rest in peace.' 'Climbers had a longer wait for their chance to go up the trail and spent too much time at higher altitude' Gyanendra Shrestha, mountaineering official . Among the climbers who succeeded in the treacherous mission was student Mollie Hughes, 21, from Bristol, who has become the youngest woman ever to reach the summit. Her mother was told she was safe after beginning her descent. Her mother Jane Spreckley, from Torbay, Devon, is incredibly proud of her daughter's achievements. She said: ‘We're all beyond proud of Mollie. She's dedicated her life to today and has raised an incredible £2500 for her charity Action Aid. ‘I still haven't managed to speak to Molly but the group radioed to base camp to say they had made it safely. ‘We are extremely relieved to hear everything has gone well and she is fine - we can't wait to hear all about it.’ Weather conditions are clear enough to permit climbing to Everest's 29,035ft peak for only a short time in May. On May 10, 1996, eight people died on what is believed to be the worst day on Everest. The main reason was said to be that climbers who started their ascents late in the day were caught in a snow storm that swept the mountain in the afternoon. Tourist attraction: Mount Everest's peak . The latest deaths of Mount Everest have raised more questions over the commercialism of climbing the highest mountain in the world. Just a few decades ago, scaling Everest was a feat attempted by only a handful of hardy and experienced mountaineers, trained to the highest fitness levels. However, it would seem that now almost anyone could potentially attempt one of the toughest challenges known to man. It has become a booming tourist industry in its own right, boosting the economy of Nepal, particularly during the climbing season from late March to the first week in June. Hundreds of people attempt Everest every year and about 4,000 have climbed it since Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first scaled it in 1953. Anyone with the money to spare could sign up with one of the many tour operators that arrange trekking trips. Nepali mountain officials say about 200 people will attempt to scale the summit this weekend when the next safe window of weather is expected to allow safe ascent. Due to an increase in the number of climbers in recent years, it is now prone to overcrowding, especially around the area of Hillary Step - a rockface neat the Nepal-side of the peak - where there is a bottle neck of ascending and descending climbers. According to experts, because some people might have paid up to tens of thousands of pounds to take part in the challenge, climbers are taking risks when conditions are poor and time is running out for them to ascend. One of the worst disasters encountered at the mountain was during the 1996 season when 16 people died climbing Everest - eight of them on May 11 alone.

"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie laid into President Barack Obama on Tuesday night over his refusal to take responsibility for his role in the rise of the Islamic State. Referencing the president's claim in a recent interview that the terrorist group accumulated so much territory in Syria because the American intelligence community 'underestimated' the radical militants' capabilities, Christie said he was 'disturbed' by Obama's behavior. The Republican Governor argued that Obama shares in the blame for the  tumultuous situation in the Middle Eastern country and border state Iraq, and he should own up to his mistakes. 'It should be 'we,' Mr. President,' Christie told CNN's Dana Bash in an interview. 'It's your administration, and when you're the leader, you have to be held accountable for what they do.' 'He's the president, and he needs to be accountable, and I hope that he says that and corrects what I hope was a misstatement,' Christie continued. Scroll down for video . Blame Game: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie chided President Barack Obama on Tuesday for refusing to admit that he, too, underestimated the Islamic State . 'He's the president, and he needs to be accountable, and I hope that he says that and corrects what I hope was a misstatement,' Christie told CNN's Dana Bash in an interview . Obama's noteworthy castigation of his intelligence team stemmed from an interview Central Intelligence Agency Director James Clapper gave to the Washington Post in mid-September. Clapper told the Post that his agency didn't 'predict the will to fight,' or lack thereof, among Iraqi forces. 'That’s always a problem,' he said, citing the Vietnam War. 'In this case, we underestimated ISIL and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi army.' President Obama jumped on Clapper's admission of error in a 60 Minutes interview that aired Sunday evening. When asked by veteran correspondent Steve Kroft if the ascent of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, came as a 'complete surprise' to him, Obama said: 'Well I think, our head of the intelligence community, Jim Clapper, has acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.' The president immediately came under fire from intelligence and national security officials for the reproof, with one Obama administration staffer telling MailOnline that the Presidential Daily Briefs have included detailed information on the extremist group for at least the last two years. 'Unless someone very senior has been shredding the president's daily briefings and telling him that the dog ate them, highly accurate predictions about ISIL have been showing up in the Oval Office since before the 2012 election,' the national security staffer said. The claims by the Obama administration insider accompanied a Government Accountability Institute report on Monday that showed that president Obama has attended just 42.1 percent of his intelligence briefings since taking office. Former Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan indicated on Wednesday morning that even he was warned about ISIS in his high-level national security briefings leading up to the 2012 general election. 'We've been warned about ISIS for quite some time,' he told the hosts of Fox and Friends. Christie assailed Obama for conveniently ignoring his own failure to correctly size up ISIS during a sit-down interview with Bash at a Baptist church in Newark, New Jersey . Christie, center right, held a summit on drug addiction there on Tuesday morning. Christie is pictured during the panel with New Hope Baptist Church pastor Joe Carter, right, listening to former drug addicts talk about their struggle . Christie assailed Obama on Tuesday conveniently ignoring his own failure to correctly size up ISIS during a sit-down interview with CNN's Bash at the Baptist church in Newark, New Jersey after participating in a panel on 'ending the stigma' of drug addiction. In the one-on-one interview, Christie, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, touted his own leadership ability and pointed to the addiction event as proof that he can be tender-hearted and thoughtful when the circumstances allow. Noting that his softer side has 'always been there' and his brash behavior is reported on in the media more frequently because 'it's the entertaining on television,' Christie told Bash that 'as a leader you need to be compassionate, and you need to listen. 'And I have that ability to do that, too,' Christie swore. 'And by the way,' he interjected moments later, 'when it's required to get in somebody's face and tell them off, I'll do that, too.' Asked directly about his presidential ambitions, Christie gave the usual response, saying he hasn't decided and won't make an announcement until the new year. His decision to weigh in on the president's handling of ISIS suggests otherwise, however. Christie, who also heads the Republican Governors Association, has said in the past that he won't give his opinion on national or international issues unless he runs in 2016. The Garden State governor went so far this summer as to credit his inability to speak decisively on pressing national issues to his ignorance of federal policies. Christie has repeatedly said that his mind is firmly on the issues confronting his home state and his responsibilities as RGA chair. Democratic National Committee spokesman Mike Czin told The Hill on Tuesday evening that Christie 'should stick to what he knows best: collecting credit downgrades and lane closures' and defended the president's record on national security. 'When it comes to serious national security issues, President Obama has degraded terror networks around the world, killed Osama bin Laden and worked with our allies to confront new threats while restoring America’s standing and authority around the world,' Czin told the news publication in an email.","'It's your administration, and when you're the leader, you have to be held accountable for what they do,' Christie told CNN .

"To Naomi Cavaday it seems a lifetime ago since she briefly thrilled Wimbledon’s Centre Court by taking eventual champion Venus Williams to a first set tiebreak. It was actually only 2008 when, at 19, she showed why many judges believed she was that rare commodity, a British tennis player who was a surefire prospect to crack the world’s top fifty. The tale of someone who represents Wimbledon’s host nation failing to deliver on early promise is a familiar one, but none have been quite like that of the now 25-year-old from Bexley. British tennis player Naomi Cavaday is back on the tour after retiring for three years due to illness . Expectations proved so suffocating that she fell into long bouts of depression and bulimia that caused her to retire for three years, a phase of her life from which she has happily emerged to the extent that last month she returned to competition. Three weeks ago she won her first professional tournament back, in Egypt, and while it was at the humble Futures level of the tour it gave more satisfaction than the scare she once gave the illustrious Williams sibling at SW19. Cavaday looks healthy and content as she reflects on how her eating habits towards the end of her ""first"" career became so dysfunctional that she once went for three months surviving on nothing but coffee and pineapple. 'I wasn’t one of the ""chosen ones"" as a junior and only took tennis seriously at around 15. I improved very quickly and at 16I suddenly started getting lots of attention and financial support. Within twelve months I was given a wildcard into Wimbledon when I’d never even played there as a junior,' she recalls. 'I got inside the world’s top 200 at 18 but then I got sort of stuck and that’s when it got really difficult. Everyone was telling me that I was heading for the top 50 and I just thought ""hold on, I’ve got to get my head around this"". I was trying to act as the person I wanted to be, not who I was. 'Some people think that British tennis players can be a bit weak and I was desperate not to fit into that stereotype.' Away on tour evening mealtimes became a desperate ritual, eating and then emptying her stomach in the privacy of her hotel room. Cavaday suffered from long bouts of depression and bulimia that caused her to quit the sport . 'I’ve had issues off and on with food since I was about 12 and about 19 or 20 it started getting quite bad. I was effectively getting by on two meals per day despite the calories I was burning. There were times I was too heavy, others when I’d get too thin. 'People underestimate how tough and competitive tennis is. Virtually everyone loses every week they play, and when you are depressed that is tough to handle. The eating and depression went together.' This highly engaging and unusually gifted lefthander, whose potential could be bracketed with that of Heather Watson or Laura Robson, has always been a bit different with an avid curiosity about the world, as you would expect from someone whose heroes are Richard Dawkins and the late polemicist Christopher Hitchens. Just before her 22nd birthday she quit the circuit. 'I’ve often wondered if there were other things I might be good at. But I started coaching and also became a young ambassador for BEAT, the eating disorder charity. Once they sent me off to speak at this major international conference in Italy. I think I was the about the only young athlete they could find prepared to talk about it, but the problem is definitely quite common among young people in sport. When you’ve been through it you can spot it sometimes with how people are. It is quite easy to underestimate the pressure in any sport.' Cavaday (left) shakes hands with Venus Williams after losing in the first round at Wimbledon 2008 . Cavaday’s coaching work took her to the Virgin Leisure Centre in Northwood, and it was earlier this year she started thinking about playing again. Working with eminent British coaches Alan Jones, Jo Durie and her former coach David Felgate, she began joining in with elite training squads to set an example of what professional training is like - and found she fell in love with it again. 'David was coaching Donna Vekic (the Croatian teenager who has been in the world’s top 70 this year) and got me to hit with her. It turned out I could compete well, winning sets in practice against her. Donna was saying, ""Why aren’t you playing anymore?""' Cavaday pushed Williams close on Centre Court in 2008 before losing 7-6, 6-1 to the then-defending champion . The death in May of her friend and former British number one Elena Baltacha was another factor. 'Elena was so brave and always so encouraging to me. She never nagged me about coming back but always said she envied my natural ability. I thought of how she coped with her liver condition during her career and it made me think I could cope with my own things.' Later this week Cavaday will travel to Sweden to play more tournaments. 'I’m in better physical shape than I’ve ever been but still very short of matchplay. The big difference this time is that it is my choice, and my experience of recent years and being older has made me much better equipped to handle the pressures. I feel so much better in myself. 'I still have to be careful about my eating but everything is under control and my confidence is very high. I’m sure I can get back to where my ranking was pretty quickly and go on from there, but if I don’t it’s not the end of the world. And I want to show that young people can get through things like depression and bulimia, that it’s not a life sentence.'","British player Naomi Cavaday has returned to the tour after a three-year absence .

"Nobody gets out the bunting for sixth place, but there is more to Liverpool’s inch-by-inch pro-gress up the table than first sight suggests. This win edged them past Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, but the gap now separating Liverpool from clubs with loftier ambitions is increasingly small. They are a point behind Southampton, whose bubble may be about to pop, two points off Manchester United in fourth, three points away from Arsenal in third. Inferior goal difference means Liverpool will need to go that extra yard but, on this form, it is well within their power. They scored with their first two shots on target in this game, the second in the 73rd minute, but that should not detract from the display. Southampton had three first-half penalty appeals — one of which was particularly convincing — but this was a gutsy, impressive win on a day that made it impossible to play the brand of football that is the trademark of manager Brendan Rodgers.

Liverpool had to tough it out instead, and did. In a spoiling swirl of wind and driving rain, not to mention strength-sapping bitter cold, they dug in against the formidable aerial power of Graziano Pelle, and the midfield worked hard. They have now kept five consecutive clean sheets away from home in the league — a record unmatched since 1985, the days of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson. No, it wasn’t the prettiest, but it was never going to be, and Philippe Coutinho’s first goal at least was a thing of beauty. It was fitting that it should take place in front of local hero Matt Le Tissier, too. It will not have greatly pleased him — he is too much of a Southampton loyalist for that — but he would surely have admired the artistry and the technique. Lazar Markovic slipped a simple pass inside to Coutinho and he turned it into something truly magnificent with a curling shot from 30 yards. Le Tissier scored a few like that and it may have jogged his memory as Coutinho’s effort bent perfectly beyond the reach of Fraser Forster, struck the underside of the bar and bounced down over the line, as if the ball itself knew a degree of aesthetic flamboyance was required for such a finish. That was after just three minutes, and 70 had passed by the time Liverpool struck their next shot on target, again with success. The fact that Southampton’s usually pin-sharp defence made not one, but two mistakes, on the way to goal illustrates the job that Liverpool had done by then. soaking up the pressure and leaving them exhausted.

Former Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana (left) is tackled by Steven Davis of Southampton at St Mary's . What did Graham Poll make of the declined penalty appeals? Find out here. One would never have guessed it was Liverpool that had played a European game as recently as Thursday. Southampton substitute Morgan Schneiderlin played a careless square ball directly to Alberto Moreno, whose forward run ended with a cross which should have been cleared by Matt Targett. Instead, off-balance, he tapped it helplessly to Raheem Sterling, who drove the ball through a crowd of players, goalkeeper Forster unsighted until it was too late. So nothing to celebrate yet, but suddenly Liverpool have options. When Rodgers left out Daniel Sturridge many felt it was a sign he was prioritising the Europa League as the best entry route to next season’s Champions League. Not after this. If it was even half in Rodgers’s mind that the small number of set-pieces required to secure cup qualification might prove less of an obstacle than an assault on a top four, he can now afford to play both ends. Manchester United must be worried. Squeezed by Arsenal and Southampton, and now Liverpool, the league is their only route back.

Filip Djuricic of Southampton is caught in a sandwich between Dejan Lovren (top) and Joe Allen . Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet rushes out to the edge of his area to block a shot from Southampton's Eljero Elia . And what of Southampton, pace-setters, fairy-tale, the Champions League choice of all football romantics? It is going to be hard going from here. Southampton have won one game in the last five in all competitions and Sunday’s display fizzled out into a standard hard- luck story of penalty appeals denied. They didn’t play poorly, but they didn’t convince, either, and the feeling of injustice that permeated St Mary’s obscures a dip in form. Southampton look leggy and their threat reduced as the game wore on. The filthy weather that plagued the south coast made flowing football a forlorn hope, so no wonder much of Southampton’s threat came from balls in the air, won by Pelle, who was a handful without being a threat. Liverpool do not care for that option, as Rodgers made plain on the day he told Andy Carroll he had no future at the club. Even so, the real enemy, according to the locals, was not the rain or the wind but referee Kevin Friend, who rejected four penalty appeals. That the first came after just 25 seconds created a feeling of injustice to rival that felt by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. Friend, who is having a weekend of it, was the fourth official at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, too. New signing Filip Djuricic, on his debut, was the first to fail to convince Friend, putting Emre Can under pressure from the opening attack of the game. Can certainly seemed to place a hand on his shoulder, and not in a fatherly way, but not with the force needed to make Djuricic collapse as he did. The ease with which he went down probably got Can off the hook. Maybe Djuricic, on loan from Benfica, would have swayed official judgment in Portugal’s league, but not here. The second was more convincing, Joe Allen bringing down Djuricic only to find Friend curiously unmoved. The ball ran free to Eljero Elia, who forced Simon Mignolet to make a fine save, overlooked in the furore.

Dejan Lovren (left) appears to handle the ball in an incident which saw Southampton unsuccessfully appeal for a penalty . Southampton forward Eljero Elia charges forward with the ball as he battles with Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel (right) Only Fraser Forster (12) and Ben Foster (West Brom, 10) have kept more Premier League clean sheets this season than Simon Mignolet (nine). A final penalty appeal was made against Can, for handball, just before half-time but there was a growing feeling of resignation about Southampton’s desperate pleas. Seconds earlier, they were making a strong case for a free-kick just outside the box. A long pass sent Elia through and Mignolet came charging from his line, intercepting with inches to spare on the edge of the area. It hit his body inside, but perhaps a hand outside, although it is hard to see how Friend could have made a handball call with any certainty. TV replays were not totally clear initially, suggesting his reluctance was justified. Even if video technology is allowed it is unlikely to clear up incidents such as this in the time allotted. Sterling had one rejected at the other end, too, but it appeared Jose Fonte got the ball. Even if he hadn’t, it is hard to imagine Friend pointing to the spot. Maybe he’s just the sceptical type.

"Every day, Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. Barcelona may not have new star signing Luis Suarez available for the new season, but the Catalan giants have another fresh face - Lionel Messi. Catalan paper Sport have the Argentine star back in pre-season training across their front page, with the headline 'The New Messi.' Look who's back: Messi returns to Barcelona with a new military hairstyle and starts double training sessions . While the No 10 caught the eye with a edgy new hairdo, the paper also claim he is undergoing double training sessions in order to get ready for the season ahead. Barcelona had a training camp at England's St. Georges' Park before their most recent friendly without their star man. They drew 1-1 against French Ligue 1 side Nice, with veteran midfielder Xavi rescuing a share of the spoils. Italian Newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport leads on Gonzalo Higuain who has put his World Cup disappointment behind him and is raring to go to challenge Juventus for the Scudetto with Napoli. The striker questions a move back to spain, to join fellow Argentine Lionel Messi at Barcelona, insisting he wants to win the Serie A title with Napoli to follow in the footsteps of national treasure Diego Maradona. A fan now: Xavi hangs up his boots for the Spanish national side (left) and insists he'll just be a fan now . He told the Italian newspaper: ‘I am sure that we will celebrate in May. But let's not forget the Champions (Juventus) ahead of us ...’ The 26-year-old added: 'Did I want to go to Barcelona? I always told the truth and that is that I wanted to think only of the World Cup and then I would return to Napoli. 'So I kept quiet and I had nothing to fear, because there was nothing to comment about . 'Messi said certain things and I can only be flattered by them. I believe that every player would love to play alongside a great champion like him, but that does not mean that I ever wanted to leave.' The ex-Real Madrid striker joked: 'But if Messi came to Napoli, that would be great.' Gazzetta dello Sport has also linked Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic with a move back to his former club Fiorenta, with league champions Juventus also apparently interested. In the Spanish paper Marca the ‘king of tiki-taka’ Xavi waves goodbye to the national team. The Barcelona midfielder won one World Cup in 2010 and two European titles with the Spanish side in 2008 and 2012. He told Marca: 'It has been extraordinary, an honour, now I will be just another fan of La Roja.’ Challenger: Keylor Navas (right) is determined to fight for the number one spot at Real Madrid this season . L'equipe report on some of the 'hottest stories from the summer'. With the return of Formula One, rugby and football to French focus. The French newspaper wonders whether French Open champion will return to fitness in time to take on world number one and Wimbledon champion, Novak Djokovic, who Nadal beat at Roland Garros in the final. Spanish newspaper AS reports that new Real Madrid goalkeeper Keylor Navas will challenge Iker Casillas and Diego Lopez for the number one spot but has much to learn from his colleagues. He said: 'Iker and Diego are my guides,' after his presentation at Madrid was watched by 7,000 fans at the Bernabeu and followed live in Costa Rica in the early hours. All change at Milan: Robinho looks set to leave AC Milan this summer with the Serie A giants in for Diego Lopez . Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport claims AC Milan will be very active before the season starts and will offload Robinho to Santos .

"It is rumoured that Apple’s iPhone 6 will feature a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire. And now the eagerly-anticipated handset’s screen is said to be about to enter large-scale production later this month. To create enough of the man-made sapphire material, which will make screens that are scratch-resistant and flexible, Apple struck a deal with GT Advanced Technologies in Mesa, Arizona. Scroll down for video . The iPhone 6's sapphire screen is rumoured to be going into large scale production this month. Here, one of the screens is repeatedly stabbed by a knife and emerges unscathed from the video trial which also sees in being bent and scratched with keys . Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As . the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced . using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and . polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in . the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. The . sapphire material will be manufactured at a plant powered by renewable . energy, which has been built as part of the $578million (£350million) arrangement, The Guardian reported. It . is claimed to be composed of thin man-made layers of sapphire, which enables the . material to be flexible - giving it a change of withstanding knocks and . falls that shatter other types of toughened glass. A YouTube videomaker recently claimed . to have acquired one of the screens - and subjected it to a barrage . of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting . it. In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple. Marques Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claimed last month to have got the screen from well-known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video showcasing the screen. In the video, Mr Brownlee can be seen bending and twisting the screen. 'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said. 'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.' The glass is also extremely high-quality, Mr Brownlee noted: 'There’s absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass.' Apple already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front display is made of Gorilla Glass. The new glass display is 'paper thin,' Mr Brownlee said in his video. He showed that his screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally, which is in keeping with rumours that Apple will release two different-sized iPhones this year: A 4.7-inch model and 5.5-inch one. Reports claiming that Apple was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year, yet sources claimed at the time that Apple found the technology ‘infeasible.’ In the video, Marques Brownlee stands on the thin screen and bends it. When released, it goes back it its normal shape, raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen . The screen is also shown being repeatedly stabbed by a knife - and emerging with no scratches, although it has not been confirmed to be the 'official' screen that will feature in the new handset . This was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens. But it appears that the sapphire screens will soon be manufactured at GT Advanced Technologies' new facility, which is expected to employ around 700 people. An Apple spokesman previously said: 'We are proud to . expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in . Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and . construction.' ‘This new plant will make components . for Apple products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from . day one, as a result of the work we are doing with SRP to create green . energy sources to power the facility.’ Last month, iPhone maker Foxconn revealed Apple's new iPhone 6 could be the first to be made using its 'robot army'. The screen is described as 'paper thin'. It is claimed to be made from thin man-made layers of sapphire, which enables the material to be flexible, giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass . In the video, the screen survived having keys scratched across its surface - a common problem for iPhone owners who keep their handsets in their pocket . The firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and CEO Terry Gou  revealed the robots, dubbed 'Foxbots', are in the final stages of testing. It is believed Foxconn will install 10,000 robots as a test and that lines dedicated to Apple devices will get first priority, according to IT Home. The . website says Gou told a shareholder meeting that Apple would be the . first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that . its next product - the iPhone 6 - will be manufactured in this way. Each $25,000 (£14,945) Foxbot can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year, it has been claimed. Workers are seen inside a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province. The firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build Apple's latest iPhone . Foxconn currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across China and is said to be ramping up the number of human workers needed for the launch of the iPhone 6, with 100,000 being hired according to some reports. In a bid to make sure there will be enough iPhone 6 handsets to meet demand, Apple has ordered a first batch of between 70 million and 80 million handsets, The Wall Street Journal reported. This would be its largest first production run ever and handsets would be expected to reach customers by Christmas. Dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6. They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back. However, . a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product . will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen. A leaked image, posted on Twitter by  SonnyDickson in June, shows the difference in size between the current iPhone 5S (left) and the 'iPhone6' (left) Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm).

"It’s a tentative anchors away for the world’s first floating start-up as more than 250 companies have expressed interest in joining Blueseed, a massive ship anchored in international waters off the coast of California’s Silicon Valley. The concept of the visa-free metropolis is simple – allow entrepreneurs from any country to do business near Silicon Valley, even if they cannot acquire a United States visa. Blueseed says that start-ups from 52 different countries are expressing interest, a positive sign in getting the conceptual ship out into the open. Scroll down for video . Floating an idea: A drawing provided by Blueseed shows a ferry docking next their proposed floating city outside of San Francisco . Interested parties: Out of 252 interested companies, Blueseed says that nearly 30 per cent are from the U.S., followed by India, the UK, Australia, and Canada . Nearly 30 per cent of start-ups interested are from the U.S., though India, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Spain also expressed interest. Blueseed will charge around $1,600 monthly rent, and requires a cut of around 6.5per cent of company shares. While the massive ship offers hope for entrepreneurs wanting to do business in America, there is still little momentum for so-called start-up visas, which would allow those whose businesses earn more than $100,000 in venture capital to stay in the country indefinitely. The company’s website states that only a passport is needed to live and work aboard the vessel, and that it will collect no taxes. 'A lot of people say, ""I'd like to go to Silicon Valley"" but there is no way for them to do it,' said Max Marty, Blueseed CEO and co-founder, told the AP in an interview earlier this year. Marty, the son of Cuban immigrants, thought of the ship after listening to international classmates of his at the University of Miami business school lament about having to leave the U.S. after graduation. Politicians have wrangled with the issue, but efforts to change the system have stalled. A life on the ocean waves: Another proposed design for Blueseed's floating start-up city, apparently modelled on a huge container ship . Live to work? This third artist's impression shows how luxurious live-work units would sit along side container storage areas and a helipad . Residents . would be ferried ashore with temporary business or tourist visas, which . are easier to get, to meet with investors, collaborators, partners and . others. Mr Mutabdzija said the ability to have face-to-face meetings . cannot be underestimated when trying to gain trust - and secure funds - . from investors. 'Yes, we . live in an interconnected age with Skype and other video conferencing. But if you want to grow a company, physical interactions are of . paramount importance,' Mr Mutabdzija said. 'We're a startup. We ran into . this. Some people said if you're not within a 20 mile radius, we won't . talk to you.' The proximity . to high-tech's center, Silicon Valley, is also important. 'The talent, . the money, the expertise and a cultural acceptance of risk. Elsewhere if . it doesn't work out, you're a black sheep and the funds dry up,' Mr . Mutabdzija said. The ship would be a remodeled cruise ship or barge that Blueseed leases or owns. It would have all the high-tech amenities expected of a start-up incubator and the look of employee-friendly Internet giants Facebook and Google, famous for their modern campuses complete with gourmet cafeterias, exercise facilities and an environmentally-sustainable design. A live-work space would cost about $1,200 a month. Urbanists: More than ever, technology entrepreneurs are choosing the urban charms of San Francisco over the sprawl of neighboring Silicon Valley; Blueseed's CEO hopes talent will also be drawn to their ship . Logistical support, including food and other supplies, would come from local businesses along the coast, helping the economies of Half Moon Bay and San Francisco, though it hasn't been determined exactly which port Blueseed would use. A helicopter would also be available for emergencies. Critics deride the ship as a publicity stunt, and say investors would be better served contributing to ventures that help Americans create businesses. 'I would say the whole thing is a perfect metaphor for how in corporate America the practice to grow talent and incubate business locally is drifting away - quite literally,' said Bob Dane, of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which advocates for limited immigration. But supporters of foreign entrepreneurship say immigrants are responsible for some of the most successful businesses in the world and if the U.S. doesn't try to attract them, others will. 'The ship may sound like a crazy idea but it illustrates how seriously flawed the immigration system here is,' said John Feinblatt, who runs Partnership for a New American Economy, which advocates for immigration reform. The organization published a report in June that said 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. Feinblatt said countries including Chile, Singapore and the United Kingdom have programs to attract immigrant entrepreneurs. 'While the U.S. is driving people away, other countries are welcoming them with open arms,' he said. 'If you miss out on them, you miss their talent, their ideas and ultimately the jobs that they create and the taxes that they pay.' Vision for the future: Blueseed founders Dario Mutabdzija, left, and Max Marty, right, stand on the pier at San Francisco. They hope to raise between some $30million to fund their ambitious scheme, with the launch planned for late 2013 . Christopher S. Bentley, a spokesman with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, said the agency has not seen the proposal and it's premature to comment. Maritime experts say such an idea is feasible, but very costly. 'A good single point mooring costs in the millions of dollars but it could restrain a ship-shape vessel in quite severe storms and in deep water,' said Bil Stewart, CEO of Houston-based Stewart Technology Associates, an engineering consultancy specialising in offshore and marine structures. 'But it would be prudent if the vessel had its own propulsion if you had a Pacific hurricane come along,' Stewart added. Blueseed's idea has started gaining steam. Silicon Valley investor Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, announced he would lead Blueseed's financing search. Mr Thiel has been a big supporter of 'seasteads' - self-ruling cities on the ocean - and both Mr Marty and Mr Mutabdzija worked at the Seasteading Institute. Blueseed wants to raise $10million to $30million over the next year and a half. The goal would be to launch in late 2013.","Blueseed says more than 250 companies from 52 countries expressing interest in floating business ship .

"The brother-in-law of murdered hostage Alan Henning rounded on the Government yesterday, saying they could have done more to save the aid worker. Colin Livesey said he was ‘angry’ with Ministers for failing to take more action to secure the release of the father of two when they knew about his capture ‘months and months ago’. He was speaking after international condemnation of a video released on Friday night that showed the taxi driver from Manchester had been beheaded by a man believed to be British extremist Jihadi John. Alan Henning was captured by the group on Boxing Day last year as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees . Mr Livesey's anger came as David Cameron, the prime minister, ordered spy chiefs to find the militants killing international hostages so special forces soldiers can go in to either capture or kill them. Just 12 hours after the video was published all but showing the beheading of Mr Henning, Mr Cameron summoned the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ to his country retreat, Chequers, where he instructed them to track down the Islamic State executioners. Intelligence chiefs have reportedly already supplied the government with information about the militant unit which is holding the remaining hostages, among them British photojournalist John Cantlie. But the Sunday Times reports that the intelligence assessments are not detailed enough for a special forces raid because the group is constantly on the move around the desert. The Prime Minister was said to have told special forces chiefs he wants the militants captured dead or alive. Mr Cameron said after the briefing: 'The murder of Alan Henning was absolutely appalling. It is senseless; it's completely unforgivable. Anyone in any doubt about this organisation can now see how truly repulsive it is and barbaric it is as an organisation. 'What we see with this organisation is that there is no level of depravity to which they will not sink. The fact that this was a kind, gentle, compassionate and caring man who had simply gone to help others, the fact they could murder him in the way they did shows what we are dealing with.

For a person who went there to give aid, to help their kids, their people in Syria, and for them to do what they have done, there is just no sense in it at all. There are no words in the dictionary to describe how I feel towards them. I’ve just got so much hatred for them.’ His accusations were echoed by Majid Freeman, 26, a friend of Mr Henning who was on the aid convoy in December when the 47-year-old was seized. He said: ‘The Government did nothing to help him. They should have secured his release but instead they abandoned him and left him out there.’ Last night, the parents of the latest American hostage threatened with murder, Peter Kassig, issued an emotional video appeal to his IS captors to ‘show mercy’. His schoolteacher father, Ed Kassig, and mother, Paula, said that the 26-year-old former soldier converted to Islam after he disappeared in October 2013 in Syria, where he was delivering food and medical supplies to casualties of the civil war. Mr Kassig said: ‘We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go.’ Barbara Henning has said the family is 'numb with grief' after being told her husband had been killed . Colin Livesey, pictured, described his brother-in-law Alan Henning's killers as 'scum', adding: 'I just hope and pray they get what's coming to them' In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Barbara Henning said her family and friends were ‘devastated’ after receiving the ‘news we hoped we would never hear’. Alan Henning: 'I am Alan Henning. Because of our parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic state I as a member of the British public will now pay the price for that decision.' Jihadi John: 'The blood of David Haines was on your hands Cameron, Alan Henning will also be slaughtered but his blood is on the hands of the British parliament.' Jihadi John then steps forward to cut Mr Henning's throat and his body is shown lying on the floor. Peter Kassig is then shown kneeling next to Jihadi John. Jihadi John: 'Obama you have started your aerial bombardment in Sham (Syria) which keeps on striking our people, so it’s only right we continue to strike the necks of your people.' Mrs Henning, who had issued a series of emotional appeals for her husband’s release over recent days, said she, her son Adam, 15, and daughter Lucy, 17, were ‘numb with grief’. ‘We always knew that Alan was in the most dangerous of situations, but we hoped that he would return home to us. That is not to be,’ Mrs Henning said. She added that her husband was a ‘decent, caring human being’ of whom she and her family were ‘extremely proud’. The Mail on Sunday has learned that an Islamic campaign group linked to former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg was at the centre of increasingly frantic efforts to free Mr Henning over recent weeks. The London-based Cage UK, of which Mr Begg is a director, tried to persuade the jihadis that it would be un-Islamic to murder an aid worker. Mr Begg, 45, was released from Belmarsh prison on Wednesday after terrorism charges against him were dropped. David Cameron vowed yesterday to use all available means to hunt down those responsible for the beheading. There were hopes that Mr Henning, right, could be freed after a sharia court set up by Islamic State to investigate claims he was a spy found him innocent . The Prime Minister said: ‘We will use all the assets we have to try to help those hostages… and defeat this organisation which is utterly ruthless and barbaric. ‘There is no level of depravity to which they will not sink. No appeals made any difference.’ Lord Dannatt, a former Chief of the General Staff, said his heart went out to Mr Henning’s family and friends but said it was ‘quite harsh’ to blame the Government. He said: ‘We don’t know what our Government has and hasn’t been doing. But I think we are all united in the fact that the so-called Islamic State and these fighters are an abomination and they have got to be confronted.’ Mr Henning was the fourth Westerner and second Briton – after fellow aid worker David Haines – to be murdered. As before, the video depicted Mr Henning, dressed in an orange jumpsuit, kneeling alongside his black-clad, masked killer. In the recording he recited: ‘Because of our Parliament’s decision to attack the Islamic State, I, as a member of the British public, will now pay the price for that decision.’ Muslim leaders had appealed to ISIS over the threat to kill Mr Henning, who was working for an Islamic aid organisation, saying it went against the religion .","Brother-in-law of Alan Henning says he is angry with government ministers .

"Jay Wylie will serve more than three years behind bars . A US Navy commander will serve more than three years behind bars after admitting sexual assault and raping two of his female sailors. A military judge ordered Jay Wylie's dismissal and sentenced him to confinement. Navy spokeswoman Sheila Murray said Wylie was sentenced to 10 years, but would serve 42 months as part of a plea deal. During the San Diego, California, hearing, the judge also ordered that Wylie forfeit future benefits. He was immediately sent to the brig at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. His lawyer Jeremiah Sullivan said Wylie was extremely remorseful. Mr . Sullivan said the dismissal case would be appealed, but only because . all dismissal cases automatically go through such a process. According to the navy, Wylie got drunk on two occasions and sexually assaulted women who were on the destroyer he commanded. ""He wanted to make clear that he's taking full responsibility and accountability for his misconduct,"" said Mr Sullivan. After hearing: Wylie was immediately sent to the brig at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station (pictured) Guilty: Jay Wylie sexually assaulted women who were on the destroyer he commanded (library image of a US Navy destroyer pictured) ""(Wylie) could not have been more remorseful to the victims."" Twenty officers have been relieved of command by the navy this year. Crimes, of a sexual nature or otherwise, are vigorously investigated and adjudicated as appropriate by the navy, said Ms Murray. ""We hold our people accountable and we expect commanding officers to uphold the highest personal and professional standards,"" she said.",Plea deal sees Jay Wylie's 10 year sentence slashed to just 42 months .
"This is the astonishing moment a jaguar emerged from the water to launch a ferocious attack on a caiman basking on a sand bank. These stunning images show the 20-stone cat striking with lightning speed while the eight-foot reptile basks on a river island in Brazil. In a flurry of action, the ferocious cat sinks its teeth and claws into the back of the leathery reptile before whisking it away in its jaws. Killing: This is the dramatic moment a male jaguar sneaks up behind a Yacare caiman before it launches a ferocious attack . Brutal: Photographer Justin Black, 39, who witnessed the attack, said: 'He lifted the 150lb caiman from the ground and trotted toward the water like it was a doggie bone' Astonished photographer Justin Black, 39, said: 'He lifted the 150lb caiman from the ground and trotted toward the water like it was a doggie bone. 'The fact he attacked from the water is astonishing, It was reminiscent of crocs attacking land animals in Africa.' The scene unfolded by the Cuiaba River in the Pantanal Wetlands of western Brazil. The battle-scarred jaguar is well-known to biologists, who have nicknamed him 'Mick Jaguar'. He is estimated to be seven years old and is almost blind in his right eye, probably due to battles defending his territory. Mr Black, from Washington DC, U.S, was on a boat with fellow photographer Jeff Foott when they spotted 'Mick' stalking Yacare caiman. Hunt: This jaguar was filmed launching a ferocious attack on a caiman as it basked in the sun in western Brazil. Above, the animal crouches down as it plans its attack . Stealth: The 20-stone cat stalked the reptile while it lay on a sandbank by the Cuiaba River in the Pantanal Wetlands. Above, the jaguar glides silently across the river . In danger: The cat, nicknamed 'Mick Jaguar' by biologists in the region, is captured approaching the small island, while the Yacare caiman relaxes leisurely in the sun . Panic: As the jaguar attacks, the caiman attempts to make an escape . He said: 'Using the hyacinth for cover, 'Mick' slowly entered the small channel and swam up directly behind the caiman, keeping his profile as low as possible. 'Once at the edge he exploded from the water and onto the caiman's back, swinging the claws of his right paw into its side. 'He then hooked the caiman with his left paw as well and went for a killing bite at the back of the skull - but he didn't have a good angle. 'In the process his momentum carried them both into the water where he readjusted his position and his teeth found purchase on the back of the caiman's neck. 'He then pushed the caiman into the water broadside - pushing a bow wave ahead of them as he swam. 'When he reached the opposite beach he quickly disappeared into the grasses with his kill.' According to scientists, there are an estimated 4,000-7,000 Jaguars in the Pantanal. They . have become specialist caiman killers and hunt during broad daylight, . surprising the cold-blooded reptiles while they bask in the sun. They are also the largest and most powerful jaguars in South America, enabling them to take down larger prey. Vicious: The battle-scarred jaguar is estimated to be seven years old. He is almost blind in his right eye, which is believed to be due to battles defending his territory . Biting: The photographer, from Washington, added: 'The fact he attacked from the water is astonishing, It was reminiscent of crocs attacking land animals in Africa' Savage: Following the struggle, the powerful jaguar could be seen clinging onto the Yacare caiman with its strong teeth, before whisking the leathery creature away . Victorious: According to scientists, there are an estimated 4,000-7,000 Jaguars in the Pantanal Wetlands. Above, the victorious cat drags the caiman through the river . Jaguars are starting to become a tourist pull in this area of the Pantanal because they can be regularly seen in broad daylight. Elsewhere, jaguars are often hunted and tend to be shy and reclusive, making them much harder to see in the wild. Biologist Charles Munn from the Jaguar Research Centre predicts that in 2013, 4,000 people will come to see the caiman-hunting jaguars. The scientist believes this could rise to almost 100,000 eco-tourists per year in 2025 and eclipse sports fishing as the biggest tourist pull in in wetlands - which span an area the size of the UK. He added ""My goal is to use sustainable, exciting Jaguar tourism to stabilise land-use and protect forests in half of the Pantanal, which offers the most extraordinary wildlife spectacle in the Americas.' There are estimated to be between 50,000 to 100,000 jaguars in the wild throughout South America.","Images show the 20-stone .

"Ever since QPR returned to the Barclays Premier League under Harry Redknapp, they have been confronted by the same weary issues. This Rangers team are weak at the knees. They have spent the last six months staving off the inevitable and the winter of discontent continued at Loftus Road when Southampton scored a winner in the third minute of added time. This was supposed to be a more rugged, focused Rangers side after their new director of football Les Ferdinand and his two coaches, Chris Ramsey and Kevin Bond, crashed a few heads together in the week. Instead Nedum Onuoha allowed Sadio Mane to hold him off before turning inside the area to fire beyond Robert Green .

Click here for more MATCH ZONE . It will take a major operation to save Rangers now. Ramsey and Bond will pick the team for Tuesday’s trip to Sunderland as chairman Tony Fernandes works out what he is going to do with this team. ‘I am keeping the seat warm but I’ve had a taste for management for a long time,’ said Ramsey. ‘We had a plan for Southampton but the difficulty is making the players believe in it when we keep losing. We will re-evaluate after Tuesday.’ Southampton returned to third, dreaming of Champions League glory again after Arsenal lost the north London derby. Ronald Koeman has redefined this club which is focused on European football after a fourth successive away victory in the league. ‘It is not just about the top four, we want to finish in a European position for next season,’ said Koeman. ‘Maybe seventh is enough. There are key moments in a season and this is one because of the defeat against Swansea last week.’ Nedum Onuoha put the ball in the back of the net for the home side in the final seconds but it was ruled out for a foul . Jose Fonte could not keep the ball from crossing the line but the decision went in Southampton's favour as the referee called play back . QPR players are left stunned after Charlie Austin sees his effort brilliantly saved by Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster . This was a key game for Rangers and even the prospect of Tim Sherwood sporting a QPR gillet at their next home game, against Arsenal on March 4, will offer no guarantees. Ramsey said: ‘I socialise with Tim Sherwood, but I haven’t spoken to him about this.’ No-one believed him. Assuming he still wants the job after QPR’s 15th defeat in the league, Sherwood will discover that there isn’t a great deal to work with on the training ground. On matchday, it is even worse. Ferdinand and his two coaches picked a team to play on the front foot, flooding it with forward-thinking players as they searched for their first win in the Premier League since December 20. Adel Taarabt was the pick of them until his tiring frame was forced to make way for Mauro Zarate midway through the second half .

QPR midfielder Leroy Fer slides into a challenge with Southampton's Victor Wanyama during a cagey first half at Loftus Road . QPR defender Richard Dunne beats Southampton striker Graziano Pelle to the ball as he heads clear . There was the odd flicker from Taarabt, notably a jaw-dropping three-point turn followed by a nutmeg on James Ward-Prowse in the first half. Their best chance to win it came late in the second half when Southampton keeper Fraser Forster fisted over the bar after Charlie Austin diverted Joey Barton’s shot towards goal. At the back for Rangers the central defenders, Steven Caulker and Richard Dunne, played as if they had never met each other in their lives. When Eljero Elia split them in the opening minutes, Green came flying out of his area to clean up the mess in front of him. Elia beat him to it but the Southampton forward clipped his effort wide. Graziano Pelle, without a goal in the Premier League since December 20, hit the bar just before the break. By then Southampton had been forced to reshuffle their defence when young left back Matt Targett was taken to hospital with concussion. ‘It is under control and the message is that it is positive,’ added Koeman. ‘It is his head and neck, but we think he will be OK.’ When Southampton settled, they controlled much of the game. Morgan Schneiderlin, on the bench until Victor Wanyama made way in the second half, gave them purpose from the centre of midfield. Beyond that they needed a match winner and Mane was that man when he appeared inside the penalty area to leave Green on his knees.

"Alan Pardew has revealed that the man who potentially saved his job – Papiss Cisse – should NOT have played against Hull City. The Senegal striker came from the bench to score twice in 13 minutes and rescue a point – and perhaps more – for Pardew. But the advice of United’s medical staff was not to include Cisse, who hasn’t featured since last season after breaking his kneecap in April. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has heaped praise on Papiss Cisse after the striker grabbed two goals . Cisse dedicated his second goal to his Newcastle Jonas Gutierrez, who is currently battling against cancer . The pressure was mounting on Pardew until Cisse saved the day by scoring two late goals . Pardew, though, gambled by naming the 29-year-old on the bench and he scored twice to save a 2-2 draw. And the boss – whose position is now safe in the short term - said: ‘Cisse should not have played. My medical staff did not agree that he should be included. He’s trained five days. ‘But myself and John looked at him on Thursday and thought “he’s fresh, he’s bright, he’s not ready for 90 minutes but he knows how to carry the jersey”. ‘That’s where I felt some sympathy for Manu. He’s not ready to carry that jersey yet full-time, it’s heavy that No 9. He’s had too much responsibility. ‘That was great to see Papiss take that chance, that little movement and pessimism in the box.’","Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse score two late goals against Hull City to help his side claim a point .

"Lurking deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico is a species of squid that wouldn’t look out of place in a sci-fi thriller. The Mangapinna squid, sometimes referred to as the bigfin or long-arm squid, is around 26ft in length with thin elastic tentacles thought to be between 15 to 20 times larger than the squid’s body. Adult bigfins have never been captured or sampled but rare video footage recorded by the Shell Oil company reveals their alien-like behaviour. Scroll down for video . The giant squid, pictured, was caught on camera in the Gulf of Mexico. It has elastic tentacles thought to be 15 to 20 times longer than the squid's body and the total length is around 26ft. Its ten appendages are often held at right angles to the body, or mantle, which gives them the appearance of having elbows . Mangapinna squids were first discovered . in 1907 but it wasn’t until 1988 that the first footage was filmed off the . coast of Brazil. A squid spotted in 2000 was thought to . have been around 23ft long and more recent sightings have estimated . lengths of 26ft. The arms and the tentacles of the . Mangapinna squid are the same length and look identical. These ten appendages are also often held at right angles to the body, or mantle, . which gives them the appearance of having elbows. Very little is known about the feeding behaviour of these squid. Scientists believe that bigfin squid feed by dragging their arms and tentacles along the seafloor, and grabbing organisms off the floor. They may however simply use a trapping technique, waiting passively for prey to bump into their arms . The footage was captured using a remotely operated underwater vehicle known as an ROV. Shell Oil, along with other companies, uses the vehicles to study the water around its oil rigs and this particular recording was filmed in the Gulf of Mexico in the Perdido Area of Alaminos Canyon. The rare sighting of the squid was discovered at a depth of more than 7,800 ft back in November 2007. Shell oil has a rig located 200 miles off the coast of Houston, Texas. Mangapinna squids were first discovered in 1907 but it wasn’t until 1988 that the first footage of the bizarre creatures were caught on camera by a submersible off the coast of Brazil. Ten years later a Japanese submersible called Shinkai 6500 filmed another long-armed squid in the Indian Ocean south of Mauritius. The majority of other sightings have been in  various canyons in the Gulf of Mexico. A . squid spotted in 2000 was thought to have been around 23ft long. However, more recent sightings have estimated lengths in excess of 26ft. Aside from their overall lengths, the . arms and the tentacles of the Mangapinna squid are the same length and . look identical.

"A pregnant woman in Iowa had a particularly difficult labor this week when she was held at gunpoint on her way to the hospital. Rachel Kohnen and her husband Ben were going 30 miles over the speed limit on Tuesday morning in Fort Dodge, Iowa, as Rachel was in labor and felt that if the two did not get to the hospital soon she was going to give birth in a car. Around that time, a police officer turned on his sirens to pull the couple over, but they kept going, ultimately being stopped when dispatched officers threw down tire spikes, blowing out the couple's tires. And now, in just released video from the dashboard camera of one of the officers, Rachel can be seen struggling to get down on the ground as multiple officers surround her with their guns drawn, this before being led off to the hospital in a squad car where she gave birth soon after. Scroll down for video . Bad timing: Rachel Konen (circled in red) was on her way to the hospital with her husband Ben when officers stopped them for speeding, and forced them to the ground at gunpoint . Guns drawn: Rachel (circled in red)  can be seen struggling to get on the ground and leaning on the car as at least two officers have their guns drawn on her . Poor woman: A barefoot Rachel (above) was eventually led to a police car by the officers and taken to the hospital . The video, which aired on Good Morning America, also made it clear the couple had called 911 to notify them of the situation, but nothing was done in time. '[The cop] starts following me and he turns on his lights an my wife says we can’t pull over. The baby is coming now,' Ben, who was driving, told NBC 13. Said Rachel, 'I did tell him not to stop.' Hard Labor:A few hours later she gave birth to her daughter Hazel with her husband Ben by her side (above) She then added, 'I think I was screaming,  ""Oh dear God, we can’t have the baby in the car.”' Keep going: Even after a police officer turned on their sirens to pull the couple over, Rachel told her husband to keep going so she wouldn't give birth in the car . Baby girl: Hazel (above)  weighed in at a very healthy 10 pounds . And what a baby it was, as after the couple was driven to the hospital Rachel gave birth to her fourth child, Hazel, who weighed a whopping 10 pounds. And while the Kohnens seem to be taking this terrifying incident in stride, and mom and baby are both doing well, charges may still be brought against the two. Did their best: The couple called 911 to tell them about the situation, but it did not help . Damage: There is now still a chance the couple will be charged for speeding and not stopping, and they will definitely need new tires (above) The scene: The two were going 85 mph in a 555 mph zone, being stopped on Iowa Highway 7 (above) Manson Police Chief Tom Ritts said that while no charges have been filed yet, it’s up to County Attorney to decide if that remains the case.

"Around one hundred activists clutching the bodies of dead animals assembled in the centre of Melbourne, Australia, to protest violence and neglect towards animals. The protestors, from Animal Liberation Victoria (ALV), silently held dead sheep, pigs, kangaroos, chickens, fish, ducks and other species, claiming they wish to draw attention to the ' hidden suffering of animals in Australia and around the world'. The carcasses were found by ALV's rescue team, many of them dead or dying inside industrial animal factories, in paddocks or hit by vehicles and left to die, according to the organisation. Trail of the dead: Animal Liberation Victoria (ALV) members holding 100 dead animals in the centre of Melbourne. Sheep, pigs, kangaroos, chickens, fish and ducks were among the animals . Grim: A woman displays a dead duck as part of the protest, intended to draw attention to the suffering of animals in society. ALV says the cruel treatment of animals is 'one of the world's largest social justice issues' and said similar displays of respect for the billions of animal victims have taken place in Spain, Chile, France, Germany and Peru. 'We are here today to draw attention . to the fact that humans are currently responsible for the slaughter of . 64billion land animals around the world each year, and between one and . three trillion sea animals,' said ALV’s campaign co-ordinator Noah Hannibal.

It has also protested against sheep exports, whaling, the killing of animals on television by Jamie Oliver and animal deaths in Melbourne Zoo.

"Facebook has started charging users up to £10 to message celebrities and others outside their circle of friends. Under the trial scheme, it costs 71p to send a standard message on the social networking site. But the fees vary depending on the popularity of the recipient, with a current maximum charge of £10.68 to contact celebrities such as Olympic diver Tom Daley. Top dollar: Facebook users will pay £10.69 to contact celebrities including diver Tom Daley, seen using his mobile phone during practice at the Aquatics Centre before the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games . Popular: It will cost users more to send a message to the young Olympic diver via Facebook than to less popular, or non-celebrity users . It puts him a tier above U.S. gangster rapper Snoop Dogg and Booker prize-winning author Salman Rushdie, both of whom cost £10.08 to message. And in what may cause some embarrassment, many well-known figures such as broadcaster Louis Theroux and comedian Miranda Hart can currently be contacted for the standard charge of 71p. The fee structure is decided by a mathematical formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the number of followers a user has on Facebook and how many messages they receive. Charges to contact somebody using the . system can rise and fall under the system. The fees were introduced for . 10 per cent of British users as a trial at the end of last month with . the plan to introduce it to all members of Facebook in the country. Sliding scale: The new charges depend on the popularity of the recipient so it will cost £10.08p to send Snoop Dogg a message, while fans of Miranda Hart will pay just 71p to contact her via Facebook . The company said that the paid for . ‘priority messages’ were intended to stop users from being bombarded . with unwanted contact from strangers . But Facebook faced criticism yesterday after details of the costs became known, especially because it has boasted that ‘the site is ‘free and always will be’. Peter Wood, social media director at digital marketing agency Steak, tweeted: ‘Facebook charging users in the UK to contact celebs online. 1-0 Twitter. Seems a bit mean to charge someone to send fan mail.’ Users who are Facebook friends or who share mutual friends are still able to keep in contact with no charge. There is also a cap on the number of paid messages any user can receive. Messages are sent directly to a recipient’s inbox on their profile page. Those who don’t want to pay are still . able to send a message, but these are not put into the recipients inbox . but another box called in the “other folder” that most people rarely . check and many don’t even know about. The charge can be paid online instantly with a credit or debit. Under-18s are barred from making such payments and are also blocked from receiving unsolicited messages. snoop.jpg . Users in the US are charged $1, $5 or $15 to send a priority message. Facebook scrapped a $100 fee to . contact the most prominent celebrities after it was mocked for applying . the charge to contact the company’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg.

"Maybe it just took a while for the message to sink in. It’s been five weeks since Garry Monk told Jonjo Shelvey that the problems in his head were close to cancelling out the game-changing talent in his feet. The word he used was ‘lazy’; the message was that if Shelvey kept trundling around the pitch collecting thoughtless yellow cards then Swansea would soon lose patience with a player who ran out of time at Liverpool. On Sunday, his talent came up with a delayed reaction, the midfielder hitting a brilliant strike from 25 yards with seven minutes remaining. The goal came from nowhere — and so did the win — for a side that rarely finds rewards on the road.

This was Swansea’s first away win against Southampton since 1953, when they were known as Swansea Town. Monk spoke of a ‘spot-on’ game-plan to let Southampton hog possession before a late onslaught. Ronald Koeman’s view was more in keeping with most others here, that his side enjoyed ‘total domination’ and should have won. How costly this sucker punch could be to Southampton’s bid to storm the top four. This was not a game they should have lost, nor a fixture they had cause to fear. Swansea’s pre-match tally of Premier League away wins was two. There ought to be perspective, though. Southampton had so many injuries they could not fully stock their bench. And their defence, the tightest in the top flight, was only breached by a sublime goal. But the concern, quite aside from Ryan Bertrand’s straight red card for a horrible late foul on Modou Barrow, should be how possession was not turned into goals. These are opportunities Koeman knows cannot be missed. Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand catches Swansea substitute Modou Barrow with a high challenge late in the game .

Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne (left) competes for the ball with Swansea winger Nathan Dyer during the opening period . Swansea youngster Jay Fulton (right) clears the ball under pressure from Saints midfielder James Ward-Prowse . ‘It is difficult to keep our position in the table and we know that,’ he said. ‘We have to be very good in each game and if our players are not at their best it is more difficult. ‘We can expect teams like Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool to win games as they are big teams with good players. The position, even after this defeat, is not normal for Southampton — but we keep going. I’m frustrated because I don’t think we deserved to lose. We played very well in the first 45 and had total domination. In the second half we had less control but the lucky team won. That’s football.’ On Bertrand’s foul, which led to Barrow leaving the pitch on a stretcher, Koeman did not share the common view that such a high tackle merited a red card. He said: ‘In my opinion it is not a red card. In my opinion these fouls are yellow.’ Barrow will be ‘fine’, according to Monk, who added: ‘I thought it was a bad tackle. I’m not sure it was a red card. It is the momentum that made it look bad.’ For Monk, this was a happy homecoming to a club that employed him for eight years before his time at Swansea. He is currently experiencing his first adverse moments in the dugout, having seen Wilfried Bony sold to Manchester City and his side winless in the league since Boxing Day coming into this game. For long spells here, this looked like another miserable away day. James Ward-Prowse shot straight at Lukasz Fabianski after seven minutes and Dusan Tadic miscued a volley later in the half. By the time Shelvey pounced, Southampton had taken more than 65 per cent of the possession. Even then there was time for Sadio Mane to have two shots cleared off the line by Ashley Williams.

Monk said: ‘It has been a difficult month for us for various reasons — losing players, injuries, suspension. But we went back to basics. We executed a game-plan. ‘I knew we were against a very good side in the Champions League spots. The plan was to concede possession, frustrate them and then when the crowd gets frustrated they would look for a goal. We wanted to use the ball in those moments and what a great strike. Tactically we got it spot on.’ Koeman might view it as more of a missed opportunity.

"The stock market had a swift and clear reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision to trim its stimulus efforts as stocks surged Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 300 points to another record after the Fed decided the economy was strong enough for it to begin a modest reduction of its bond purchases. The Federal Reserve announced today that . it decided to reduce its stimulus efforts next month because the job . market has shown steady improvement, opting to only buy $75billion in . bonds as opposed to the scheduled $85billion. 'Investors should see this as a vote of confidence for the economy,' said Kristina Hooper, head of U.S. investment strategies for Allianz Global Investors. Good sign: Federal reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said Wednesday that the strong jobs numbers indicate that they need to buy fewer bonds next month as the stimulus appears to be working . The central bank also tempered the impact of its pullback by signaling that it plans to keep short-term interest rates at record lows for longer than previously thought. Investors had long anticipated the Fed would pull back on its purchases, but did not think it would happen until next year. Because the market had grown accustomed to stimulus, some investors had worried about a decline in stocks once the market got less rocket fuel. Instead, the Dow jumped 292.71 points, or nearly 2 percent, to 16,167.97 - another all-time high for the blue-chip index. Shortly before the Fed announcement at 2pm, the Dow was up just 47 points. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 29.65 points, or 2 per cent, to 1,810.65 and the Nasdaq composite rose 46.38 points, or 1 per cent, to 4,070.06. All 10 sectors of the S&P 500 ended the day higher, with health care and banking up the most. The rally adds to what has already been a historic run for stocks. The S&P 500 is up nearly 27 percent, its best yearly performance since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. They feel confident enough in the months of continued job growth that chairman Ben Bernanke announced Wednesday that they will trim its $85billion a month in bond purchases by $10billion starting in January. Noticeable spike: The Dow responded positively to the announcement, jumping up nearly 300 points immediately following Bernanke's announcement . The Fed said it could further reduce the pace of its purchases next year if the improvement continues. The shift could lead to higher long-term borrowing rates for individuals and businesses. At the same time, the Fed strengthened . its commitment to record-low short-term rates. It said it plans to hold . its key short-term rate near zero 'well past' the time when unemployment . falls below 6.5 per cent. Unemployment is now 7 per cent. Investors responded by sending stock prices surging more than 150 points, or nearly 1 per cent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The Fed's reduction to $75billion a month in bond purchases is a small but significant step. It means Fed policymakers are ready to ease the extraordinary support they've provided to the economy since the Great Recession began six years ago. The move 'eliminates the uncertainty as to whether or when the Fed will taper and will give markets the opportunity to focus on what really matters, which is the economic outlook,' said Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist who is now head of monetary policy research at Cornerstone Macro. But Perli noted that the Fed has not entirely pulled its support for the economy. By still keeping interest rates historically low, the Fed 'will continue to remain very supportive of risky assets,' Perli said. Positive outlook: Analysts predictions are being buoyed by four straight months of hiring increases and the unemployment rate hitting a five year low . In a policy statement released after its two-day meeting, the Fed says it will reduce its purchases of mortgage- bonds and Treasury bonds each by $5billion. Beginning in January, it will purchase $35billion in mortgage bonds each month and $40billion in Treasurys. The bond purchases have helped keep long-term interest rates low to encourage more borrowing and spending. Bernanke said that he has made a practice of consulting with Yellen and that she was 'consulted closely' before the Fed voted to reduce its bond purchases. Yellen's nomination as the next Fed chairman is expected to be confirmed soon by the Senate. Bernanke's term as chairman ends on January 31. Responding to a question, Bernanke said that his impending departure played no role in the decision to vote on reducing the bond purchases at the December meeting. The Fed's actions were approved on a 9-1 vote. The only member to object was Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. He called the move premature because unemployment remains high and inflation extremely low. The Fed's action comes after encouraging reports that show the economy is accelerating. Hiring has been robust for four straight months. Unemployment is at a five-year low of 7 per cent. Factory output is up. Consumers are spending more at retailers. Auto sales haven't been better since the recession ended 4 1/2 years ago. What's more, the stock market is near all-time highs as inflation remains below the Fed's target rate. And the House has passed a budget plan that seems likely to avert another government shutdown next year. The Senate is expected to follow suit. One factor of concern for some members is inflation, which remains historically low. The Fed's optimal rate is 2 per cent. For the 12 months ending in October, consumer inflation as measured by the Fed's preferred index is just 0.7 per cent, well below its target. On board: though Bernanke was the one to announce the trimmed stimulus, Janet Yellen is expected tp be the Fed chairwoman at the time of its implementation . But the Fed sees inflation slowly moving toward its target, according to its most recent economic projections that were released Wednesday. The Fed projects inflation would range between 1.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent next year and could reach the Fed's target in 2015 at the earliest. Fed officials still project economic growth of roughly 3 per cent next year. But they are slightly more optimistic about unemployment, predicting it could fall as low as 6.3 per cent in 2014, down from a low of 6.4 per cent forecast in September.","Strong jobs numbers and a decreasing unemployment rate cited as factors in decision to lower monthly bond buying from $85billion to $75billion .

"A pair of young female lovers writhing in pleasure as they embrace. A married, older couple entwined in each others arms. A courtesan, her neck exposed, the flash of crimson at her collar hinting at pleasures to come. This is Shunga or 'spring pictures', an astonishingly explicit genre of Japanese art that is the subject of a new exhibition at the British Museum. But though it sounds like pornography at first hearing, the reality of shunga is far from crude modern depictions of sex. Erotic: A pair of lovers embrace in a scene from Kitagawa Utamaro's Poem of the Pillow, circa 1788 . Most of the images, although explicit, are loving - even tender - and show the pleasure being shared out between men and women in equal measure. Nevertheless, it certainly doesn't pull any punches. So frank are the 170 artworks on display, the museum has insisted on a no unaccompanied under-16's rule. There are young people and old, gay and straight couplings, clothed and unclothed, and images that hint at sex, while others offer a ringside seat. Many focus on middle-class married couples with their stories delicately inked in alongside as well as exhortations to go faster or slow down from the ladies pictured. Courtesan: A 'sexual dalliance' with a geisha portrayed by Nishikawa Sukenobu circa 1711 - 1716 . Lovers: Two women embrace in one of the erotic shunga scenes that will go on display at the British Museum . Particularly stunning is Torii Kiyonaga's 1785 Sode no maki (Handscroll for the Sleeve), where the finely drawn scene offers an intimate glimpse into the bedroom of an ageing couple, her hair elaborately drawn up with gold pins, his receding rapidly. But not everything is so familiar.  Hokusai's 1814 Dream of the Fisherman's Wife, shows a dreaming woman wrapped in the erotic embrace of an octopus. And while most shunga do focus on ordinary Japanese people, the odd Dutch or Portuguese adventurer sometimes creeps in. Although most of the works on display at the British Museum date from between 1600 and 1900, shunga's roots go back much further and to China. Mature: An older couple star in Torii Kiyonaga's Sode no maki (Handscroll for the Sleeve), circa 1785 . Sexuality: Utamaro explores female pleasure in Uwaki no so (left) and a young woman enjoying a daydream . Among the first artists to create what would become known as shunga was T'ang Dynasty erotic painter, Zhou Fang, whose paintings, created between 730 to 800 AD, depicted courtiers in various states of undress and with unusually large genitalia. In Japan itself, the earliest works can be traced to the contemporary Heian period, although it didn't become widely popular until much later. By 1600, shunga was being produced by the Ukiyo-e school (‘pictures of the floating world’), which included some of the greatest Japanese masters including Hishikawa Moronobu, Kitagawa Utamaro and Katsushika Hokusai. Despite widespread acceptance, shunga was banned by the Japanese government in 1722, although censorship barely dented in its popularity. Shunga finally fell out of favour in the late 19th and early 20th century, when the advent of erotic photography left it unable to compete. Now, with porn and boob-heavy lad's mags everywhere you look, shunga appears an oddly gentle way of portraying sex and love - octopuses notwithstanding. Shunga: Sex and Pleasure in Japanese Art runs from 3rd October until 5th January 2014 at the British Museum.

"Their manager might claim to be the most sophisticated in this Premier League of riches, but it was a 39-year-old substitute goalkeeper who made a point. In doing so, he also claimed one for West Ham. It turns out there are some saves left in old Jussi Jaaskelainen, the long-lost Finn who came off the bench and made a quite magnificent block to deny Dejan Tadic in stoppage time. Without that contribution from a player who has not played in the Premier League since January 1, 2014, West Ham would have lost this game. Not that Sam Allardyce thought he should have been on the pitch. The fact that he was came down to a questionable judgement from Adrian, Allardyce’s first-choice stopper, and an equally dubious call from the referee to send him off. West Ham keeper Adrian is sent off by referee Craig Pawson after handling the ball outside the area in their clash with Southampton . Spanish keeper Adrian dives on the ball outside the penalty area under pressure from Sadio Mane after a butchered back pass . After Adrian is dismissed Jussi Jaaskelainen is called into action with Carlton Cole the outfield player to be sacrificed .

The flashpoint came on 61 minutes when Adrian impulsively decided to round Sadio Mane, the Southampton striker, instead of a simple clearance. He made a hash of the move and then handled outside his area in attempting to atone for the error. The handball was blatant but Allardyce was angry that Craig Pawson and his officials did not spot Mane tugging Adrian’s shirt after the first error. Coupled with a late knee injury to Andy Carroll which will keep him out for more than two weeks, it took the shine away from what looked to be an impressive point. On the sending off, Allardyce said: ‘He (Adrian) made a mistake at the beginning, but he was recovering and the opposition player had two hands on him. ‘If you (the assistant referee) have seen handball on his blinside (but not the grappling), I suggest Mike Riley (the referees’ chief) does something. I can’t suggest publicly because I will get fined. I will appeal the red card immediately.’ West Ham captain Alex Song controls the ball in midfield under pressure from Southampton striker Graziano Pelle .

West Ham's Carl Jenkinson keeps close tabs on Dutch winger Eljero Elia at St Mary's Stadium on Wednesday night . Southampton Reed (right) surges through the midfield as Sakho attempts to stem his momentum . The early diagnosis of Carroll was equally grim, considering his recent struggles. Allardyce was forced to leave the striker on after a tackle from Maya Yoshida because he had already used all his substitutes. Allardyce said: ‘The sad thing is the injury to Andy which we can ill afford. It’s the same knee (he injured against Liverpool on January 31). ‘He got kicked in the back of his knee and he stayed on as nuisance value. We just hope staying on has done no more damage.’ Hammers boss Sam Allardyce makes his presence known on the sideline during a scoreless first half in Southampton . Saints boss Ronald Koeman appears exasperated as his side fail to make the most of the majority of possession .

Southampton keeper Fraser Forster makes a save in a crowded box as Koeman's side are held to a goalless draw by West Ham . Cole directs traffic after getting a rare start in from Allardyce at the top of the West Ham attack . At the very least it helped salvage a point from a game that will have done nothing to make £5bn from Premier League television rights look like a bargain. This was dull, often uninspiring football. But that is not to say no one deserved the win because Southampton often dominated. They had won six of eight Premier League games coming into this one, but Ronald Koeman has been increasingly concerned about their ability to take chances. This game did nothing except reinforce that view. He said: ‘It was frustrating. If you are the better team with more ball possession, more chances and you play 25 minutes 11 against 10 you expect to score at least one. We didn’t and that shows a little what has been happening in the last few games - we are struggling to create and score. ‘It was not god enough. We don’t have really have the sharpness and creativity that we had in the beginning of the season. It was another clean sheet but if you play another game like this, in my opinion, you have to create more.’ Steven Davis has a rare shot on on goal for Southampton but is unable to trouble West Ham keeper Adrian . Referee Craig Pawson books Cole (centre) after a high-footed challenge on Maya Yoshida that caught the Japanese player in the face . Pawson shows Adrian the red card just after the hour mark to reduce Allardyce's side to 10 men . To that end, West Ham managed only one shot in the first half, while Southampton frequently danced to the edge of the visitor’s error before falling in a muddle. Mane had an effort hacked off the line by Carl Jenkinson and Cheikhou Kouyate did the same to keep out a Florin Gardos header. Yoshida required lengthy treatment to a gash beneath his left eye after being caught by a high boot from Cole – making his first appearance since his aborted deadline-day move to West Brom – and West Ham were then cut down by Adrian’s two moments of impulse. On came Jaaskelainen, the ‘old master’ in Allardyce’s words, and he saved from Tadic. It was brilliant; perhaps the only moment in this match that was.

"Greek shipping tycoon Demetri Marchessini, pictured wearing trousers at his home in London . A wealthy new backer of the UK Independence Party claims women who wear trousers are 'deliberately’ making themselves unattractive to men. Greek tycoon Demetri Marchessini, who believes not wearing a skirt is ‘hostile behaviour’, gave UKIP £10,000 this year - a fifth of all its cash donations. But the parlous state of the party’s finances has forced officials to issue a begging letter to supporters for money – and policies. The surge in interest and support for Nigel Farage’s anti-EU has not been matched in its bank balance. Mr . Farage's attempts to win support in Scotland backfired yesterday, when . an angry protest in Edinburgh forced him to take refuge in a pub before . being escorted to safety by police. Mr . Marchessini gave UKIP £5,000 in February and another £5,000 in March, . as the party prepared for local elections which saw it take almost one . in four votes cast. But Mr Marchessini’s views on women – and what they wear –are likely to raise eyebrows. He . is the author of a book entitled Women In Trousers: A Rear View in . which he photographed women from behind and then commented on their . clothes. In it he claimed that the ratio Britain of women wearing . trousers to skirts is 10 to 1. ‘The interesting thing about this . phenomenon is that, because women cannot see themselves from the rear, . the vast majority of women are unaware that trousers are very . unflattering to them,’ he said in the 2003 book. 'Trousers are made for men's bodies, which are mostly straight up and down. 'Women's bodies on the other hand consists of curves. Women have big bottoms - they are meant to have big bottoms. Jennifer Lopez, pictured wearing trousers in New York this week, was once branded a 'Mexican tart' by the businessman . 'Countless women who would look lovely in dresses or skirts are embarrassingly unattractive in trousers.’ He warned that Britain had a high . divorce rate and low marriage rate, and suggested women were not helping . their chances of finding a husband by wearing trousers. ‘The . more women dress like men, the less they are attractive to men. If a . man finds a woman attractive, he will find her legs sexy even if they . are not perfect, simply because they are her legs. ‘Women know that men don't like trousers, yet they deliberately wear them,’ he continued in the bizarre coffee table book. 'Walk . along any street and you see women using trousers like a uniform every . single day. This is hostile behaviour - they are deliberately dressing . in a way that is opposite to what men would like. 'It is behaviour that flies against commons sense, and also flies against the normal human desire to please.’ In an interview plugging the book, he was asked if was pleased at the rise of curvy stars like Jennifer Lopez. But Mr Marchessini he told The Guardian: 'She looks like a Mexican tart'. At the launch of the book his ex wife Lucinda told reporters: 'He is deeply sexist.' According to records from the Electoral Commission, Mr Marchessini’s two donations to UKIP are the first time the 78-year-old has given money to a political party. Latest figures show that in the first quarter of 2013 it received a total of £74,150, of which just £47,000 was in cash. By comparison both Labour and the . Tories were given £3.7million, the Lib Dems received £842,710  and even . the Socialist Party had a donation of £295,775. UKIP has now launched a drive to find more people to do the same. A begging letter sent to supporters highlights a lack of money, staff and policies. Treasurer Stuart Wheeler complains that recent boosts in opinion polls have ‘disappointingly, not yet resulted in a surge of donations’. UKIP leader Nigel Farage's attempts to win support  in Scotland backfired yesterday, when an angry protest in Edinburgh forced him to take refuge in a pub before being escorted to safety by police . He reveals the party has set up a separate campaign account for the 2014v European Parliament election to attract backers who want to take a tougher line on Europe, but fear a strong UKIP showing at the 2015 election could cost the Tories support and allow Ed Miliband to form a Labour government. Mr Wheeler said it was becoming a priority ‘to hire some very good people to fill several roles’. ‘Above all, we have got to improve our policy production. For one thing the other parties will be attacking us on policy and we need to be quite clear what our ripostes are,’ the letter added, according to The Times.","Greek tycoon Demetri Marchessini gave UKIP £10,000 - a fifth of all cash donations this year .

"Bernard Hopkins insists he belongs in a class of his own as he attempts to defy the doubters once again two months shy of his 50th birthday. Hopkins, incredibly, remains a top contender as he approaches his half-century, breaking several records along the way, and his storied career continues at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City on Saturday night. He puts his WBA and IBF light-heavyweight titles on the line against WBO champion Sergey Kovalev in a unification clash and victory would see him once again be heralded as one of the finest boxers walking the planet. Bernard Hopkins believes he is creating a new legacy in boxing ahead of his 50th birthday . Hopkins (centre left) faces Sergey Kovalev in Saturday's WBA, IBF and WBO light-heavyweight title unification . Yet the Philadelphia fighter has no interest in being placed in the mythical pound-for-pound rankings, believing his accomplishments outstrip anyone else's. Hopkins, who has given himself the moniker 'The Alien' for the longevity of his career, said: 'I don't want to be on anybody's pound-for-pound list when I win this fight because to put me on a pound-for-pound list says that I'm human.

"Retired Australian tennis champion Paul McNamee has put his stunning Victorian residence on the market this week. The 1930's mansion in Malvern has sold seven times since 1987, with Paul and his wife Lesley paying $6 million in May 2008. The current asking price for the property is a tidy $7.5, which estate agent Mark Wridgway says reflects market forces. Scroll down for video . Retired Australian tennis champion Paul McNamee's 1930s mansion in Malvern was put up on the market this week . Not only is this property gorgeous, but it offers some well-connected neighbours- it is just down the road from the  house labelled the most expensive in Australia, whose previous owners included the late Prime Minister Robert Menzies. The statuesque family home blends period detail with more contemporary spaces throughout the property, making it 'very comfortable and ready to move into,' said Mark. The house is enviably position North West, ensuring plenty of natural light. In fact, said Mark, 'by 12 o'clock the whole place is simply flooded with sunlight.' Offering five bedrooms plus an extra study, this is a family home with so many bonuses, such as the championship north to south tennis court. The house has sold seven times since 1987, with Paul and his wife Lesley paying $6 million in May 2008 . That may have been expected from the former tennis player, who won two single and 23 double titles in his career. McNamee won the 1979 and 1983 Australian Open and the 1980 and 1982 Wimbledon Championships with his partners, and is still an avid member of the tennis circuit. One of the reasons he and wife Lesley are parting with the beautiful residence is his coaching, which sees him travelling nationally and overseas. One of the reasons McNamee and wife are parting with the residence is his coaching, which sees him travelling nationally and overseas . 'Paul’s gone back to coaching, which means he's travelling a lot more and is away close to half a year,' said Mark. 'He used to be stationed in Melbourne, but not any more. He and Lesley only have one child, who is heading off to study Law at university next year.' 'It's a large property. That's a lot of house for Lesley.' The mansion boasts glorious spaces, including a grand entrance hall, a magnificent formal sitting and separate dining rooms . The 1930's mansion does indeed boast of glorious spaces, including a grand entrance hall, a magnificent formal sitting and separate dining rooms.

"Sending naked pictures to an ex-boyfriend's wife, bugging the boss' office and using company phones to send explicit 'sext' messages between colleagues are not activities often associated with America's highest level of law enforcement. But the FBI has been rocked by a slew of lewd revelations over the behavior of its agents when they were supposed to have been fighting crime, according to a leaked internal report.

"A man who was quickly branded a 'selfie stalker' after his picture turned up on a crime victim's cellphone is suing television commentator Nancy Grace for defamation, saying she refused to stop airing his photo even after authorities had cleared him of any wrongdoing. The lawsuit filed Monday in Denver says Grace, who hosts a show on Turner Broadcasting's HLN network, incorrectly told millions of viewers that Ben Seibert invaded a woman's home and snapped a photo of himself on her phone, which she described as a 'textbook serial killer's calling card.' Seibert said Grace humiliated him with her commentary, which prompted people across the country to label him a weirdo, sicko, rapist and pervert on various social network sites. The lawsuit  Grace incorrectly told millions of viewers that Ben Seibert (inset) invaded a woman's home and snapped a photo of himself on her phone, which she described as a 'textbook serial killer's calling card' Seibert said Grace humiliated him with her commentary, which prompted people across the country to label him a weirdo, sicko, rapist and pervert on various social network sites . The suit says Grace didn't check the facts and didn't care. 'It hasn't been easy for him as a result of this,' Seibert's attorney, John Pineau said. Turner Broadcasting did not immediately return calls and emails seeking comment. Through his attorney, Seibert declined to comment. Denver Metro Crime Stoppers released Seibert's photo on Jan. 29, after a woman called police saying a man had entered her home while she was putting her children to bed. Police said she was especially fearful because she believed the man had taken a selfie with her phone inside of her home. But further investigation showed the picture was Seibert's Facebook photo that had been taken elsewhere. Seibert, who was working in California, called police Feb. 8 after friends told him his photo was being associated with the Denver home invasion. He was not charged. The same month, police told Grace her broadcast was false, but she continued to air it, according to the lawsuit, which seeks more than $100,000 in damages. The suit also names Crime Stoppers, which Seibert says refused to stop publishing his picture even after Denver police notified the organization of the mistake. Denver Metro Crime Stoppers released Seibert's photo on Jan. 29, after a woman called police saying a man had entered her home while she was putting her children to bed . Mike Mills, board president of Metro Denver Crime Stoppers, told The Associated Press that police agencies choose when to release and retract crime alerts. 'When we heard there was a mistake, or that it had been retracted, we pulled it off Facebook. We pulled it off Twitter. We pulled it off our website,' Mills said. The lawsuit points to other cases in which it says Grace made 'outrageous and defamatory' comments on television and notes that several courts admonished her for unethical conduct during the nine years she was a prosecutor. 'Based on the history we've researched regarding Ms. Grace, we're pretty confident there are other victims,' Pineau said, urging others to come forward to help Seibert's case.","Suit says Grace incorrectly told millions of viewers that Ben Seibert invaded a woman's home and snapped a photo of himself on her phone .

"Theirs was one of the most enduring political partnerships of all time. But that didn’t stop Margaret Thatcher from giving Ronald Reagan a good handbagging when he crossed her. Newly released National Archives files show the extent to which their relationship was put under strain following a coup in Grenada. Mrs Thatcher made clear her distaste for US military intervention in the Commonwealth territory, recognising it as a slight on the Queen’s authority as head of state. Despite their enduring political partnership, Margaret Thatcher was still prepared to give Ronald Reagan a good handbagging over the US intervention in Commonwealth territory . For his part, Mr Reagan saw himself as defending the island against the rebels, who he saw as an ‘unpleasant band of Left-wing thugs’. In a letter dated October 24, 1983, Mrs Thatcher wrote that his decision to take action caused her the ‘gravest concern’ and accused him of putting the lives of citizens at risk instead of protecting them. She says: ‘This action will be seen as intervention by a Western democratic country in the internal affairs of a small independent nation, however unattractive its regime… . ‘I must ask you to think most carefully about these points. I cannot conceal that I am deeply disturbed by your latest communication. ‘You asked for my advice. I have set it out and hope that even at this late stage you will take it into account before events are irrevocable.’ But he told her the US military were already ‘at zero’. Mrs Thatcher made clear her distaste for US military intervention in the Commonwealth territory of Grenada (left), recognising it as a slight on the Queen’s authority as head of state . In an account of a phone call on October 26, Reagan tells Mrs Thatcher that if he was in London, he would throw his hat in the door first – presumably to avoid being shot. Mrs Thatcher clearly wasn’t impressed as she barely spoke during their 15-minute conversation. He told her he ‘very much regretted’ the embarrassment caused and confessed he had been on a golf holiday when  he was woken at 3am and informed of the situation. The note adds: ‘He wanted the Prime Minister to know that there was absolutely no feeling of a lack of confidence in the British Government but this was the first decision he had taken during his Administration which had been properly kept secret.’","Files show extent to which their relationship was put under strain .

"Final preparations were underway at Nasa today as the space agency's Curiosity rover began its final approach to the red planet ahead of its expected landing on monday morning. Mission scientists explained how the seven cameras aboard the rover are set to capture the martian surface as we have never seen it before. However, the rover still has one massive hurdle to overcome before it can even begin work - the much anticipated 'seven minutes of terror' as it hurtles through the martian atmosphere, before (hopefully) being gently placed onto the surface by a floating 'air crane'. Scroll down for video . Speaking martian - Scientists comment on the seven cameras aboard the Curiosity Mars Rover during a media briefing at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena - but have to explain each acronym first . Today the leading scientists behind the project explained exactly what will happen - and admitted that explaining the project has been tough due to the huge number of acronyms used. Names and descriptions are often reduced to acronyms and abbreviations, which are faster to string together in a sentence but can end up sounding downright martian to the outside world.. Curiosity is loaded with the most . sophisticated instruments to study Mars' environment — with convoluted . names to match. 'Mastcam' refers to the pair of 2-megapixel color . cameras on the rover's 'head'. 'SAM', short for Sample Analysis at . Mars, is the mobile chemistry lab designed to sniff for carbon . compounds. 'ChemCam' stands for Chemistry and Camera, otherwise known as . the rock-zapping laser. 'RAD' is the radiation detector. 'EDL' is the entry, descent and landing, or as NASA has come to call . it: Seven minutes of terror. 'DSN' is the . Deep Space Network, a worldwide network of antenna dishes that . communicates with interplanetary spacecraft. Nominal means A-OK. Not so . for anomaly (translation: Houston, we have a problem.) 'It's kind of our own slang,' explained Michael Watkins (above), mission manager of NASA's $2.5 billion Mars project. 'It's a shorthand way to talk about these very complicated systems.' He added: 'Even folks from other missions have no idea what we're talking about."" Even the rover's name can be complex. In the halls of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, it's called MSL — short for Mars Science Laboratory. Spacecraft typically have technical names before being rechristened by the public through naming contests sponsored by NASA. For example: the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity that landed in 2004 were known as MER-A and MER-B for the longest time (MER is shorthand for Mars Exploration Rover.) MSL did not become Curiosity until 2009 when a sixth-grader from Kansas proposed the nickname. Still, there are some hard-cores who continue to use the scientific moniker. The dizzying naming system even extends to time. It takes Earth 24 hours to spin on its axis — the definition of a day. Mars spins more slowly than Earth — taking 24 hours and 39 minutes. To distinguish between Earth and Mars time, a Martian day is called a sol, Latin for ""sun."" Yesterday on Mars is yestersol. Newcomers often find there's a steep curve to master the technical language. 'It takes some time to pick it up,' said Ken Farley, a professor at the California Institute of Technology who is participating on his first space mission. Luckily, Farley said new shorthand words are added to the mission's internal website. Before Spirit and Opportunity launched, cultural psychologists worked with scientists to come up with a better way to communicate. The rules of Mars-speak put in place back then still lives on today. JPL scientist Deborah Bass, who worked on that mission, said it's important to talk with precision. But she said it's also essential not to alienate fans. Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission members work in the data processing room beside Mission Control at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena . 'We're so jazzed about what we do,' Bass said. 'We can forget that not everybody has the same fundamental background as we do.' However, the team admit that while nowhere will extraterrestrial . vocabulary fly faster than in the JPL mission control room on landing . day, for the casual observer there is one simple tip - just look for the cheers or . tears. To reach its intended touch-down zone in a deep equatorial crater, the Curiosity rover must enter the atmosphere at a very precise point. A slight course correction - the fourth since launch - was made last Saturday, and mission scientists said the latest analysis indicates Curiosity will be no more than a kilometre from going straight down its planned ""keyhole"". The team is so confident it may abandon a planned final course correction on friday. 'We are about to land a small compact car on the surface with a trunk-load of instruments,' said Doug McCuistion, the head of Nasa's Mars programme. 'This is a pretty amazing feat getting ready to happen. 'It's exciting, it's daring - but it's fantastic,"" The $2.5bn mission is due to touch down at 05:31 GMT (06:31 BST) Monday 6 August; 22:31 PDT, Sunday 5 August. Engineers work on a model of the Mars rover Curiosity at the Spacecraft Assembly Facility at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena . It will be a totally automated landing, as the vast distance between Mars and Earth means there is a 13-minute lag . in communications, making real-time intervention impossible. The team has devised a rocket-powered, hovering crane . to lower the rover to the surface in the final moments of its descent. The first black-and-white images of the surface taken by Curiosity . should be returned to Earth in the first hours after touch down, but the . mission team do not intend to rush into exploration. 'This is a very complicated beast,"" said Pete Theisinger, Curiosity's project manager told the BBC. 'The speech I made to the team is to recognize that on Sunday night at . [22:32 PDT], we will have a priceless asset that we have placed on the . surface of another planet that could last a long time if we operate it . correctly, and so we will be as cautious as hell about what we do with . it.' Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Lead Flight Director David Oh in the Mission Control room ahead of the landing of the Mars rover Curiosity. The team has also been experimenting using a full size replica of the rover, and has even created a 'martian park' in Pasadena so they can replicate the surface of the red planet.

"As one of the most successful British singer-songwriters of the past decade, KT Tunstall seemed to have it all. Having sold four million albums since her debut, Eye To The Telescope, she toured the world and picked up prestigious Brit and Ivor Novello awards. One week, she’d be in a sequinned dress on the LA red carpet with Justin Timberlake and Mary J. Blige. The next, she’d be playing a gig in Greenland with Jarvis Cocker and visiting New Zealand with members of Radiohead. KT Tunstall is going back on the road a year after her father died and she split from her husband Luke Bullen . KT, pictured performing yesterday, said her new album 'affirms life' On a personal level, too, things were going well. Five years ago, the Edinburgh-born singer married Luke Bullen, the drummer in her band, in a ceremony on the Isle of Skye. But last summer, everything changed. In August, her father, David Tunstall, 73, a lecturer at St Andrews University, died. A month later, she and Bullen separated and are now divorcing. Facing a ‘tsunami of emotions’, KT admits she is still coming to terms with it all. ‘Losing Dad made me examine my own life, and my priorities have changed,’ she says. ‘He had Parkinson’s disease, so he wasn’t well. But he died as a result of a cycling accident. ‘It was very sad, as he was always an impressive man physically. He ran marathons and hated getting old. But he had lived a good life. He didn’t want to stick around in a bad shape.’ Tunstall — whose initials are an abbreviation of her real name, Katie — is less forthcoming about the end of her marriage, but hints that the pressures of combining professional and personal lives under one roof took their toll. ‘Being a touring musician can be very intense,’ she says. ‘Luke and I played in the band for a year before we got together as a couple, so it was always impossible to untangle our personal lives from the music. ‘I could have patched things up, but I didn’t want to do that. I’m nearly 38, and I’m a different person. Music isn’t who I am any more — it’s what I do.’ Even before last year’s momentous events, KT had been getting itchy feet as a musician. Weary of the treadmill of a major artist, she’d released a low-key, acoustic EP, The Scarlet Tulip, before decamping to Arizona in April 2012 to work with  U.S. musician Howe Gelb, of  alt-country band Giant Sand. Her father, David Tunstall, a lecturer at St Andrews University, died in August aged 73 . KT and husband Luke Bullen, pictured on their wedding, are now divorcing. She said it was 'impossible to untangle our personal lives from the music' Those songs, with some recorded in the . same studio in November, comprise her fourth studio album, Invisible . Empire // Crescent Moon. Not surprisingly, the record is her most . personal yet. A move away from the ‘stompy, sensitive girl-blues’ of old, it is a stripped-back, gentle affair, with strings, clarinet and euphonium adding subtle colour. It is also a record of two halves — hence the double-headed album title. She says: ‘It would be easy to say I’ve been gifted traumatic material, but half the songs were written before last summer. 'Maybe my subconscious worked ahead of me. ‘The songs written in November are different to the ones written in the spring. 'The early ones are introspective and uptight, but the second half is more of a rebirth.’ Now Tunstall is looking forward to playing live again, with this month’s solo gigs followed by an autumn tour with a full band — though life on the road will also be different this time. ‘I’ve calmed down a lot. Some people have said they want the old, fun KT back. 'But I don’t think she has gone. My new record isn’t morose. 'It’s not a death or a break-up album. It’s one that affirms life.’","KT Tunstall said her new album 'affirms live' despite her recent trauma .

"Big Brother plans to spy on all internet visits, emails and texts will cost the taxpayer £2billion. The extraordinary bill was revealed amid revelations that Britain’s snooping watchdog has grave doubts about the mass surveillance project. The Office of the Information Commissioner said the case had ‘not been made’ to justify the sweeping expansion in the power of the police and other public bodies to trawl through private communications, including visits to Facebook and eBay. Internal ICO papers, marked restricted, say the Orwellian plan could lead to the innocent being wrongly identified as criminals or terrorists and barred from flying. Grave doubts: The mass surveillance project has sparked fears that it could lead to the innocent being wrongly identified as criminals or terrorists . Division: Splits in the coalition over the proposals were signalled by Tim Farron (left) while the concerns of the Information Commissioner's Office were uncovered by the Tory MP Dominic Raab (right) A huge row has broken out at Westminster over the plans, which look certain to be included in the forthcoming Queen’s Speech. Splits . in the coalition over the proposals were signalled by Tim Farron, the . Lib Dem president. He said: ‘We didn’t scrap ID cards to back creeping . surveillance by other means. The State mustn’t be able to trace citizens . at will.’ In opposition, both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats were fierce opponents of the policy, first suggested by Labour in 2006. They are now pointing to the huge estimated cost of the spying project at a time when the Government is making cuts elsewhere. The . Home Office estimates that the programme – under which internet . providers will be paid to store hundreds of millions of pieces of data . for up to two years – will cost £2billion over its first decade alone. Beyond this point there will be annual running costs of £200million – or £380 a minute. Even these figures, which are based on . 2009 prices, could be an underestimate given the complexity of the . project – and officials’ terrible record for estimating the price of IT . schemes. The data will have . to be stored securely, in a way which makes it easy for GCHQ, the . government listening agency, to access. This requires huge resources . which the Government has agreed to pay. The alternative would have seen internet service providers passing on the cost to their customers. Downing Street insisted that only times, dates, numbers and email and internet addresses would be accessible by GCHQ. A warrant will still be required to access the content. Ministers say the changes are needed to keep pace with technology.  But the concerns of the Information Commissioner’s Office were uncovered by the Tory MP Dominic Raab, using freedom of information requests. Staff prepared papers for the . commissioner, Christopher Graham, in 2010 when it was first suggested . that the Coalition might revive Labour’s scheme. 'This is a stark warning' The . documents say: ‘Our position remains that the case for the retention of . this data still needs to be made.

"The owners of a run-down Disney-esque theme park  are hoping for a fairytale ending in their search for a passionate buyer willing to part with $560,000 to restore the tourist attraction to it's former glory. Shane and Karen Hay put the iconic Fantasy Glades theme park, in Port Macquarie, NSW, on the market after six years of trying to restore and modernise the amusement park for a new generation. Fantasy Glades, set in two hectares of bushland, was home to Snow White's cottage, Cinderella's castle (complete with drawbridge), and a dragon cave, and ran for 35 years before shutting in 2002. Scroll down for video . Theme park Fantasy Glades in Port Macquarie, NSW, is up for sale for $560,000 . Fantasy Glades was built by a family of little people- George and Rosemary Whitaker and their children . The theme park was created by George and Rosemary Whitaker, who had dwarfism, along with their children and Rosemary's parents, and opened in 1968 out of a desire to build their own fairy tale. After changing hands several times, the Hay's bought the property at 44 Parklands Close, Port Macquarie, in 2009 as a 'semi-retirement plan' after falling in love with the theme park. 'We wanted to bring it back to life, and it was a matter of bringing it into the new age to make it digital and more modern,' Shane Hay told Daily Mail Australia. 'My father was a builder and he was going to help us but he passed away and unfortunately we have to move on,' he said. Fantasy Glades has deteriorated over the years, vandalised by graffiti and attacked by natural elements, and is now a shadow of the park it used to be. Cinderella's castle was one of the many highlights of Fantasy Glades (above in it's heyday) The castle, which is owner Karen Hay's favourite attraction, has deteriorated since the park closed in 2002 . The inside of the castle has been vandalised by broken windows and grafitti (above) Many of the windows have been broken by rocks, and rotted wood and faded paint now feature heavily around the theme park. In the theme park's heyday, thousands of excited families streamed into the tourist attraction to spend time in fairy tales brought to life. Mr Hay said that he and his wife both have fond memories of Fantasy Glades, and his wife's favourite attraction  was the chapel and Cinderella's castle. 'How would you like to live in and enjoy this idyllic situation, there is more than enough room to build the home of your dreams and take advantage of the unique ambiance that this property has to offer,' says the ad on Gumtree. Original signs for the theme park advertised for some of the attractions including the Witch's Cottage (right) The mini-chapel featured tiny pews and was inscribed with Rosemary's favourite bible verse, Psalm 23 . The Hays wanted to modernise the attractions at Fantasy Glades for a new generation . Popular attractions included Snow White's cottage- complete with dwarves and beds-, the Old Lady who lived in a Shoe, the Crooked House, a monorail, Humpty Dumpty, Little Red Riding Hood's Grandmother's House, and many others. 'My wife always wanted to do it up, and we'd like to see it sold to someone who will preserve the heritage,' he said. The couple had made plans to import modern dinosaur figures, to add to the original figurines, which have now been sold and are being kept in storage. While Mr Hay said that the couple are realistic about needing to sell, and cannot hold onto the property forever, they would ideally like the potential buyer to be passionate about the site and interested in restoring it. Snow White's cottage featured dwarves and beds for the characters to sleep in . Snow White's Diamond Mine was a walk-through mine with a series of animated show-scenes . Snow White's cottage was a miniature replica of the house where Snow White and the Seven Dwarves . 'We've had a fair amount of interest, and some from local groups who would like to use it as a community site for gardens and sculptures,' he said. The ad on Gumtree has had 28,000 hits, and close to 5,500 people have joined the Facebook page in support of keeping Fantasy Glades open. 'Port Macquarie really needs something like this. I'm sure there's someone out there, someone younger than us,' said Mr Hay. The theme park is up for both cash and trade, with the ad indicating that up to $210,000 in trade will be accepted. While the Hay's hope that someday their prince will come- and that he'll bring along $500,000 with him- the property is still on the market, offering some lucky potential buyer a modern fairy tale in the making. The theme park operated for 35 years before being closed in 2002 . Mr Hay said that he hopes the new buyer will respect the theme park's heritage and restore it's glory .

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge could be waking with sore heads on Monday morning after they attend an exclusive wine-tasting event during the royal tour. William and Kate will be heading to Central Otago in Queenstown on Sunday where 30 wineries will be showcasing selections of their finest produce. With a focus on Pinot Noir, the variety the region is famous for, the royal couple will also be able to sample Riesling, Chardonnay, Pinot Gris, as well as sparkling wines. Royal tour: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at a state reception at Government House in Wellington . Next stop: Kate and William will visit Amisfield Estate for wine tasting on Sunday . The Duke and Duchess - along with Prince George - are on a three-week tour Down Under, which started in New Zealand on April 7 and ends in Australia on Anzac Day. Winery Amisfield, which is idyllically located overlooking the stunning Lake Hayes with its vineyard overlooking the Pisa mountain range, will be hosting the royal couple on Sunday for the event, which is being billed as the ‘most important wine tasting of the century’. Central Otago Winegrowers Association president James Dicey will be escorting the Duke through the tasting, while Central Otago Pinot Noir Chairwoman Lucie Lawrence will accompany the Duchess. Mr Dicey called it ‘an absolute privilege’, adding he was ‘nervous’ about spending time with the royal couple. Royal tour: The stunning Central Otago wine region in Queenstown where Kate and William will visit . Wine tasting: Thirty wineries will be offering samples to the royal couple at Amisfield Winery & Bistro . 'Quite nervous': James Dicey and Lucie Lawrence will be escorting the royal couple around the winery . ‘My friends have been teasing me about what I am going to wear on the day,’ he said. ‘It’s a fantastic opportunity and once-in-a-lifetime chance to have one-on-one time with William and talk him through our region’s wines. ‘I’m excited and a little nervous about the event given the level of international interest surrounding their visit.’ Kate and William will also have the chance to tour the wine facility, which is usually open to the public, learning about what makes the wines so unique. Stunning view: The Amisfield winery in Queenstown where Kate and William will be visiting on Sunday . Award-winning: The Amisfield Bistro will be supplying food for the royal visit . Mr Dicey said: ‘It will very much be an informal event with us walking around chatting to the various winemakers, growers and owners representing each of their wineries. ‘The Royal couple have asked to meet people of a similar age and those at the forefront of winemaking and they seem to have a real interest in wine.’ Thirty wineries will be represented with wines available from each for the royal couple to sample – and each variety will be matched with food crafted by the award-winning team at Amisfield. Family trip: Kate cuddles Prince George with William in the background at Plunkett's Parent's Group at Government House where the family are staying . ‘The special menu is being kept under wraps until the day but suffice to say the Royals will be treated to a wonderful local food and wine experience which we hope they will remember forever,’ Mr Dicey added. ‘The eyes of the world will be on Central Otago wine this weekend and we’re just over the moon to be a part of the royal visit.’ And in terms of a tourism boost, Mr Dicey said: ‘We certainly expect interest in the region to significantly increase following the royal visit.’ Kate and William arrived in New Zealand on Sunday, and have been staying at Government House in Wellington. Their first official duties included attending Plunkett's Parent's Group with Prince George.","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to visit award-winning winery on Sunday .

"The scandal shaking China's ruling Communist Party was triggered by claims the wife of one ambitious candidate was involved in the death of a British businessman. Neil Heywood, 41, died in Chongqing last November from excess alcohol, according to initial reports by Chinese officials. But a senior police chief has since cast doubt on the cause of death after claiming the father-of-two may have been poisoned. Suspicious death? Gu Kailai (left), the wife of fallen Chinese city leader Bo Xilai, has been accused of playing a part in the death of British businessman Neil Heywood (right), who had close links to the family . Countless rumours and speculation, fuelled by Chinese online whistleblowers, suggest his death was linked to his professional relationship with Bo Xilai, the now-purged leader of the city of Chongqing. In startling new claims, the city's former police chief Wang Lijun told Bo he believed his wife, Gu Kailai, was involved in Mr Heywood's death in the southwest Chinese city, according to a Reuters source. It has also been alleged that a new report reveals how Mr Heywood told friends he feared for his safety after falling out with Gu, according to the Sunday Telegraph. Claims that she may have been behind his death are the first direct account of events which eventually led to last month's downfall of Bo Xilai, who had very publicly bid for a place in the Party's inner circle later this year. Purged: Allegations that the wife of Chongqing leader Bo Xilai (above) may have been behind Mr Heywood's death given an insight into events that forced him from office . A source, citing accounts coming from an . unfinished central investigation, said it was unclear how much truth . there was to the claim by Wang. But he said had 'no doubt' that Wang had raised it with Bo. The account helps explain the apparent rupture between the city chief and Wang, who led Bo's widely applauded crackdown on crime in China's most populous metropolis. In early February, Wang briefly sought refuge in the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, several hours' drive from Chongqing, which suddenly made the growing scandal public. Bo, 62, and his wife have disappeared from public view since his abrupt removal on March 15 as party chief of Chongqing. Gu is believed to be under arrest, according to The Sunday Times. They cannot respond publicly to the rumours and reports, nor can Wang, who is under investigation. The Chongqing government has not answered repeated phone calls and faxed questions from Reuters about the circumstances of Bo's downfall and Heywood's death. Power: Chinese paramilitary police patrol the grounds of the Communist Party provincial head office in Chongqing which was the office of Bo Xilai . The central government has said the . results of its investigation into Wang's flight to the consulate will be . released, but to date it has not offered a detailed account. The Foreign Ministry has also not answered questions about Heywood, with a spokesman saying that he had no information. In . a news conference days before his dismissal, Bo scorned as nonsense . unspecified accusations of misdeeds by his wife and said some people . were pouring 'filth on my family'. Gu was formerly a high-powered . lawyer. 'Wang Lijun . has told central investigators that Gu Kailai turned on the British man . because of economic interests and that she wanted to destroy him . (Heywood),' said the source, who is generally sympathetic to Bo. Beijing . and London-based relatives of Heywood told Reuters in separate . interviews that they did not suspect foul play in his death. They both . spoke on condition of anonymity. Favours: Mr Heywood is said to have helped the Bos' secure top British public school berths for their son, Bo Guagua, centre . Access: Mr Bo's son Bi Guagua, seen here on the right with action movie star Jackie Chan, left, won places at Harrow and Oxford . 'It's . preposterous. The more description (in the media), the darker it . becomes,' the family member said, occasionally breaking into tears in an . interview in the lobby lounge of a hotel on the outskirts of Beijing . late on Thursday. The family denied reports that Heywood was a spy and that he was cremated against their wishes. 'We requested the cremation. We were not forced to do so. We have no doubts about the police report,' said one family member. Dismissed Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai had built a national reputation as a crusader against organised crime and corruption among China's elite. But now a very different picture of his mafia-busting initiative — called da hei, or smash black —  is emerging, since Mr. Bo was fired last month after a scandal involving his police chief Wang Lijun. Critics called his clampdown, launched in 2009, the 'red terror', saying state security apparatus were allowed to act with impunity: framing victims, extracting confessions through torture, extorting business empires and visiting retribution on Mr Bo's  political rivals. Cheng Li, an analyst of the Chinese leadership at the Brookings Institution, told the New York Times: ‘Even by Chinese Communist Party standards, this is unacceptable.’ He added: ‘This is red terror.’ In 10 months, 4,781 people were arrested, including business executives, police officers, judges, legislators and others accused of running or protecting criminal syndicates, according to the New York Times. Chongqing’s top justice official was even found to have buried $3 million under a fish pond, during the crackdown. He became one of 13 da hei defendants to be executed. But Mr Bo's spectacular fall from grace was sparked when his enforcer, police chief Wang Lijun last month sought refuge in a United States consulate. He apparently feared for his safety after telling Mr Bo that his family was linked to an inquiry into the death of a British citizen, Neil Heywood, who was an acquaintance of Mr Bo’s family. The . British Embassy in Beijing has asked the Chinese government to . reinvestigate his death, attributed by Chongqing police to cardiac . arrest due to over-consumption of alcohol. Heywood married Chinese national Wang Lulu after moving to the country and they had two children, Olivia, 11, and son Peter, 7. He . was not a heavy drinker, but was a chain smoker. His father, Peter, . also died of a heart attack after drinks over dinner at his London home . in 2004 at age 63, the family members said. It is understood Mr Heywood helped . arrange business meetings with Mr Bo when he was a government minister . in the Ministry of Commerce in the capital, Beijing. It is also claimed Mr Heywood helped . the Bos secure top British public school berths for their son, Bo . Guagua, who studied at Harrow and Oxford, though this cannot be . confirmed. The source . said that according to Wang, Gu believed Heywood had abused or taken Bo . family funds to which the Briton might have had access. Heywood's . family members said he had no business dealings with the Bos. The . source's account of Wang Lijun's accusations tallies with details that . have emerged about the drama that unfolded before he took flight to the . U.S. consulate in Chengdu, where he stayed for 24 hours before officials . coaxed him out. The . emerging accounts help explain why central leaders decided to risk the . aftershocks triggered by unseating Bo, an ex-commerce minister known . both for revolutionary style populism and for his courting of . multinationals. By . the time Wang arrived at the U.S. consulate, his relationship with his . long-time patron, Bo, had already curdled into mutual distrust, said the . source. According . to the source and previous accounts reported by Reuters, Wang feared . that Bo, eager to preserve his reputation and chances for a spot in the . next central leadership, could turn on him after central party . investigators began probing Wang's past. About . a week before his flight to the consulate, Wang told Bo about his . suspicions about the death of Heywood, a business consultant who was . instrumental in Bo's son attending Harrow, an exclusive private school . in England. Heywood . knew the Bo family from the time when he lived in China's northeastern . port city of Dalian, where Bo was mayor from 1993 to 2000. '(Wang) told Bo that the problem couldn't be covered up,' said the source. Bo . was outraged, said the source, who has met both men. Days later, Bo . demoted Wang to the much less powerful role of vice mayor for education, . culture and science. Bo . initially tried to muffle the allegations, but the former police . chief's flight to the consulate brought the rupture between the men into . the open, said the source. Even . if Wang's suspicions over Heywood's death prove unfounded, Bo's initial . failure to report the case could end his political career, said the . source. 'In the . central leadership's view, that was too late. They said he should have . reported the problem as soon as Wang Lijun raised allegations about Gu . Kailai.'","Officials initially said fixer Neil Heywood died of excess alcohol .

"Four police officers involved in the fatal pursuit of Brazilian student Roberto Curti in Sydney's CBD have lost their bid to have the criminal case against them dropped. Mr Curti died in the early hours of March 18, 2012, following a chase and violent struggle with police in which he was Tasered, handcuffed, hit with capsicum spray and knelt on. Police officers Scott James Edmondson, Chin Aun Lim, Daniel David Barling and Damian John Ralph have since been charged over the alleged assault on Mr Curti. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO .

All four have pleaded not guilty. However, earlier this month their legal team had applied to permanently stay proceedings against them. Magistrate Mark Buscombe on Tuesday rejected the application. In a hearing on November 3, Barrister Bret Walker SC told Downing Centre Local Court they were making an application to stay the proceedings against the officers. Police officer Damian Ralph is one of four officers involved in the fatal pursuit of Brazilian student Roberto Curti. Moves to permanently halt criminal proceedings against them failed . Magistrate Mark Buscombe rejected the application to stay the proceedings against Scott Edmondson (pictured) and his three fellow officers . The prosecution case against the four had been tainted by directed interviews which took place in the days after Mr Curti's death, Mr Walker said. During the interviews, officers were 'compelled' to answer questions by threat of disciplinary action and therefore their answers should not have been used against them. Instead, Mr Walker argued, the interviews became 'inextricably entangled' in the ensuing investigation of them. This meant the prosecution case was 'rooted in an eradicable error', he said.

"A leader in the Islamic community has refused to condemn the actions of 18-year-old Numan Haider, who stabbed two police officers before one of them shot him dead. The Islamic council of Victoria secretary Ghaith Krayem stopped short of defending the teenager, who was known to police and had apparently been seen in his local area brandishing an ISIS flag. Mr Krayem told The Age on Wednesday evening he refused to condemn Haider's actions, taking a swipe at authorities for taking an' enforcement' approach to the threat of terrorists at home. He described the underlying factors behind it as social rather than religious, and accused authorities of pre-empting the outcome of Tuesday evening's events. Scroll down for video . Islamic council of Victoria secretary Ghaith Krayem said authorities' approach to stopping home-grown terrorism wasn't working . 'I'm not going to condemn what he did because I don't know what he did and I think it's wrong for anybody to be condemning this young man until the full investigation takes place and we actually understand what occurred,' Mr Krayem said. 'It is incumbent on us as a society not to forgo our own principals and values that make us who we are and one of those is the presumption of innocence, even for a deceased person.' Numan Haider was killed on Tuesday evening outside Endeavour Hills police station south-east of Melbourne, after he stabbed two officers from the joint terror task force during a scheduled meeting. Mr Krayem also said despite not knowing Numan Haider (pictured), the fact he had been seen with an ISIS flag did not make him a terrorist . An AFP officer and a member of the Victorian Police were both injured during the altercation, before one of the men discharged one bullet which killed Haider. He was known to police, recently has his passport cancelled, and had been monitored by officers for the past three months. Mr Krayem also told the website he understood that information about the event had to be given to the public, but criticised some coverage of the shooting asking people to remember that a life had been lost. He also said that an appearance with the ISIS flag, a bad attitude and a discontent with the way the government is running the country do not necessarily equate to him being a terrorist. Haider was killed outside Endeavour Hills station on Tuesday evening after he stabbed two officers from the counter terorism unit . While he didn't know the young man personally, Mr Krayem said Haider's age and immaturity could have been a factor in the event, and reiterated that treating people like 'criminals' off the bat was doing nothing to help Australia. Leader of the Cyprus Turkish Islamic Community of Victoria, Ekrem Fuldagli, took a difference stance, saying moderate Muslims are nothing like those who sympathise with extremists. He told 3AW radio: 'The general public at large... are led to believe that these extremists are actually part and parcel of our religion. They're not with us.' Mr Fuldagli also condemned any violent acts, and said he had been 'Team Australia' as Prime Minister Tony Abbott put it, for many years.","The Islamic council of Victoria secretary Ghaith Krayem refused to condemn actions of Numan Haider .

"From Premier League lightweights to World Cup heavyweights, the transformation in some of English football's most disappointing imports has been quite remarkable. From Bolton to Rio, Merseyside to Recife, these players have swapped anonymity in the English winters for dancing to the Samba beat on the grandest stage of all at the World Cup. Bryan Ruiz – Costa Rica . Signed for £10.6million in 2011, the Costa Rican playmaker was jeered off the field against Manchester United three years - and just eight goals – later. The forward’s fleetness of touch has never been in doubt and his flicks and tricks have, on occasion, drawn gasps of wonder from the Craven Cottage crowd but his inability to produce consistently led Fulham supporters to view Ruiz as a scapegoat as the club’s form disintegrated under Martin Jol. Loaned out to PSV in January and now likely to move on permanently following Fulham’s relegation. Magic moment: Fulham's Bryan Ruiz scored Costa Rica's winner against Italy last week . Pablo Armero – Colombia . Armero was signed on loan in January by West Ham manager Sam Allardyce but made just five appearances, with the Hammers losing four of those assignments. The World Cup, though, has been a different story for Armero, with the full-back embracing Colombia’s high-tempo, attacking football, opening the scoring in the win over Greece and impressing once more in the victory over the Ivory Coast. Getting forward: Ex-West Ham loanee Pablo Armero scored Colombia's opener in their 3-0 win against Greece . Shkodran Mustafi - Germany . Just as David Moyes though his reputation could barely take any more blows to the system, along comes Shkodran Mustafi, the youngster that the former Manchester United manager released on a free transfer after handing him just one appearance as a substitute for Tony Hibbert during a Europa League match against BATE Borisov. Mustafi joined Everton from Hamburg in 2009 but did not appear in the Premier League and was released in 2012, joining Sampdoria, where the defender has flourished, culminating in a World Cup place and a second-half substitute appearance against Ghana in the 2-2 draw on Saturday evening. World stage: Shkodran Mustafi (bottom) was let go by Everton but came on for Germany against Ghana . Blerim Dzemaili – Switzerand . Signed by Sam Allardyce for Bolton at the age of 20, the Swiss midfielder arrived at the Reebok Stadium with great expectations but was immediately set back by a serious knee injury and made just one appearance for the club in a 2008 home defeat inflicted by Sheffield United. The midfielder, though, managed to reinvent his career in Italy, enjoying spells with Torino, Parma and now, Napoli, where he made 28 appearances last season. His wonderful free-kick in the 5-2 defeat by Switzerland remains the only direct free-kick to be scored in Brazil so far. Revival: Blerim Dzemaili scores for Switzerland against France but was unsuccessful at Bolton . Gary Medel - Chile . The self-anointed ‘pitbull’ lost his bite as Cardiff meekly surrendered to relegation under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but in the colours of Chile, Medel has been a Rolls-Royce at the heart of a back three, anticipating danger and using the ball with composure and accuracy. Cardiff can expect plenty of interest both at home and on the continent – Valencia are keen - for one of the most impressive defenders on show in Brazil. Chairman Mehmet Dalman is determined not to make a loss on a player who cost an initial £10million to the Welsh club, with wages in the region of £35,000-a-week. Key man: Cardiff's Gary Medel has helped Chile reach the last 16 after being relegated with the Welsh club . Jo – Brazil . A relic from the days of Manchester City’s kamikaze spending, the £19million Jo struggled to make an impact in the Premier League after signing from CSKA Moscow, scoring just thirteen goals in three seasons at Manchester City - a period which also included loan spells with Everton. A return to his homeland with Internacional and Atletico Mineiro has resurrected his international career, although it is admittedly helped by the paucity of options available to Brazil in the forward positions. Yet to start at a game at the World Cup but did appear to represent an upgrade on Fred when he came on against Mexico. Surprise inclusion: Jo flopped at Manchester City and Everton but has seen some action for host nation Brazil . Reza Ghoochannejhad - Iran . In Iran, they call him Gucci. At Charlton, they sing: ‘We’re calling him Dave.’ The Valley locals will be shaking their heads at the man who scored one goal in seventeen appearances since signing for Charlton in January, and then headed to Brazil to terrorise Argentina’s superstars in a scarcely believable performance of courage, organisation and quality by Iran. Finding his form: Charlton striker Reza Ghoochennejad almost got on the score-sheet against Argentina for Iran . Julio Cesar – Brazil . A Champions League winner with Inter Milan, Cesar was actually one of QPR’s most impressive performers in that wretched campaign that saw their frenetic approach to the transfer market result in relegation. Loaned out to Canadian side Toronto to offset the club’s spiralling wage bill. From relegation at Loftus Road to World Cup glory in the Maracana - via a pit stop in Toronto - would make for quite the 18 months. Safe hands: Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar, pictured here in action against Mexico, was frozen out at QPR . Giovani Dos Santos – Mexico . Recruited with the reputation of being one of Barcelona’s most exciting young talents, Dos Santos failed to live up to expectations at Tottenham Hotspur, completing ninety minutes on just six occasions in between loan spells with Ipswich Town, Racing Santander and Galatasaray. It would be an exaggeration to say that Dos Santos has set this World Cup alight for Mexico but he has forced the prolific Javier Hernandez out of the starting line-up, who boasts 35 goals in 64 starts for Mexico. The Manchester United striker's record of an international goal every 1.83 games is better than that of Cristiano Ronaldo (goal every 2.3 games) and Lionel Messi (goal every 2.2 games). On the run: Giovani dos Santos (right) endured a difficult time at Tottenham but is a key player for Mexico . Gervinho – Ivory Coast . It is quite difficult to believe that Gervinho - who glided and tricked his way past a host of Colombian defenders to score one of the individual goals of the tournament against the Ivory Coast - is the same Arsenal flop that scooped an open goal over the crossbar on a freezing December night at Bradford just 18 months ago. A fine season for Roma has been followed by two goals in two games in Brazil. Maybe the winger had a point when he commented earlier this year: ‘The fundamental difference between the Roma and Arsenal is the coach. Garcia here gives me confidence, I know that he believes in me. What I learned at Arsenal? Honestly, not so much, because you cannot learn a lot if you're on the bench.’ Stunner: Former Arsenal man Gervinho scored a fine solo goal in the Ivory Coast's defeat to Colombia .","Fulham forward Ruiz was sent out on loan in January but has been in fine form for Costa Rica .

"A Florida department store has come under fire for placing a sign in the children's department asking Santa for 'a big fat bank account and a slim body'. The sign, propped up between girl mannequins, reads: 'Dear Santa, This year please give me a big fat bank account and a slim body. Please don't mix those two up like you did last year. Thanks.' A horrified mother posted an image of the sign she saw at a Dillard's store in the Wellington Green Mall near Palm Beach, and the photo has since been shared nearly 400 times. Mother-of-three Julie Khanna wrote that she was 'appalled' when she spotted the sign. Thoughtless: A mother spotted this sign at a children's clothing department and shared it online . The sign reads: 'Dear Santa, This year please give me a big fat bank account and a slim body. Please don't mix those two up like you did last year. Thanks', which parents said sent the wrong message to children . 'This is NOT the message we should be sending our girls!!' she wrote on Facebook as she posted the image. 'I hope Dillard's will consider removing these display signs and anything else that reduces our daughters to irrelevant numbers. We don't bully our kids about their weight or size, so why should we let Dillard's?' She added that she spoke to a manager who agreed to take it down temporarily but that she would need the store manager's approval to remove it permanently. 'It's kinda funny because a women who wants to wish for that should make it happen for herself,' Florida shopper Sally Stewart told WPTV. Outrage: Mother-of-three Julie Khanna, pictured with her husband, shared the image to her Facebook page as she called for Dillard's to remove the sign. Her post has now been shared hundreds of times . 'What would a little girl want with a bank account? It gives the wrong message about having a slim body. That's not the message we want to give our kids.' Since the outrage across social media, the store has said that the sign - meant as a joke for adults - was placed in the children's department accidentally. The sign has since been removed from all departments across their 299 stores, WPTV reported. 'It's time for retailers to stop making a joke out of women's body image,' Dr. Robyn Silverman, a body image expert, told Yahoo Parenting. Taking action: Dillard's said it has now removed the sign from all departments across all of its 299 stores . 'Every time we receive a message like this - and we do over and over and over again - it hammers home the message that the most important thing to wish for is a thin body. 'We want our children to realize that the most important thing about them is who they are - their character, strength, and what they bring to the table. Their body is a vehicle to relay these gifts, it is not who they are.'","The sign reads: 'Dear Santa, This year please give me a big fat bank account and a slim body.

"A pensioner has been sent a bill demanding he repay 93p authorities claim he was overpaid in unemployment benefit more than twenty years ago. Mike Gardiner was left shocked after he received a 10-page letter from Barrow Borough Council ordering him to repay the debt, from way back in 1993. Mr Gardiner, 72, joked: 'I don't know how they want it paying. I was thinking of giving them it in instalments' Pensioner Mike Gardiner has been sent a bill asking him to repay 93p authorities claim he was overpaid in benefits 20 years ago . Retired welder Mr Gardiner says the savings made by not posting the letter could have almost wiped out the debt. He said: 'It's just baffling that someone could sit there and work it out years later. Where has this been for the last 21 years? 'You hear of all sorts of money that the council loses, I couldn't believe this is a top priority. 'It's easier to write the debt off. It probably cost them more than 93p with all the postage and paper they've sent. He says it would have saved his local council money by simply writing off the debt and not sending him the 10-page demand . Mr Gardiner, of, Barrow, Cumbria, received a letter from Barrow Town Hall dated April 15 2014, telling him he'd been overpaid in 1993. The former contract worker was briefly unemployed that year and received unemployment benefit. But Mr Gardiner has questioned why Liberata - which works with Barrow Borough Council to manage the authority's revenue and benefits service - sent the printed 10-page document through the post as he believes the cost of postage and processing the case will be more than the overpayment itself. The bill of 93p is in relation to an overpayment in benefits between April 1, 1993 and April 4, 1993. The letter claims the tiny sum should be paid separately from Mr Gardiner's council tax 'in the next 14 days' The letter, from the director of resources at Barrow Town Hall, tells Mike that he must pay off the tiny debt within 14 days, and he must pay it separately to his council tax. The bill can be paid off in several ways, including by cheque, by cash at any post office, or by direct debit, the letter states. Mr Gardiner's wife, Susan, said the letter could easily confuse people 'without their wits about them'. She said: 'Anyone could read the letter and get confused and worried. It wasn't until the last page we realised it was only 93p Mike owed. There is no point contesting it as it's such a small amount. It's very peculiar.' Liberata - which manages Barrow Borough Council's revenue service - has apologised for the blunder . Commenting on Mr Gardiner's case, John O'Connell, director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'It's likely that a computer chucked this demand out automatically, but it's a bit silly that it was then actually sent out as the demand and will have cost taxpayers more than they lost out from the unpaid bill. 'The reason these overpayments occur in the first place is because the benefits system is too complicated, so a drastic overhaul is badly needed.' A joint statement from Barrow Borough Council and Liberata stated: 'We are aware that an issue has caused a number of erroneous council tax invoices and notifications to be produced. 'We have identified the customers affected and have sent them a letter today to apologise for the error. 'We reviewed our procedures in light of the error and are introducing measures to ensure it does not happen again.'","Retired welder Mike Gardiner told he was overpaid the tiny sum in 1993 .

"Freddie Starr was last night forced to admit being ‘mistaken’ after footage from 1974 showed him alongside the teenage girl who now claims he abused her. Starr had strenuously denied ever meeting Karin Ward – who claims he tried to molest her in Sir Jimmy Savile’s BBC dressing room. The comic had also insisted he only met Savile twice in his life, and had never even been to the BBC. Scroll down for video . Together: Karin Ward in yellow, sitting behind Freddie Starr when he appeared on the BBC TV show hosted by Sir Jimmy Savile, 'Clunk Click', in 1974 . But last night he was proved wrong on all three counts after watching 1974 footage unearthed by Channel 4 News. It showed Starr appearing on one of . Savile’s BBC shows, Clunk Click – the very episode Miss Ward says was . being filmed the day she was abused. Standing next to him was a 14-year-old Miss Ward, in a yellow blouse and long brown hair. Last night Starr’s lawyers issued a . statement admitting the mistake, but still strenuously denying the . ‘awful allegation’ of abuse. The 69-year-old comedian was first . named by Miss Ward when she spoke to the BBC’s Newsnight reporters last . year for a report which was never broadcast. Then last week she told ITV News: ‘I . was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad . attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn’t like him . because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked . me out, and I rebuffed him.’ It prompted Starr to seek an injunction to prevent the claims being aired, but his High Court application was rejected. Allegations: The 69-year-old funnyman was first named by Karin Ward (pictured) when she spoke to the BBC's Newsnight reporters last year for a report which was never broadcast . On Friday, he invited reporters into . his home in Warwickshire, and told them the woman was ‘a nutter’ and . accused her of ‘picking my name out of a hat’. He said: ‘I’ve never . touched an under-age girl in my life. ‘I have never been in any situation with Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter, and I have certainly never been with this woman. 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn’t like him because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked me out, and I rebuffed him' Karin Ward . ‘She’s claiming I made advances to her, it didn’t happen. I’ve only met Jimmy Savile maybe twice.’ He also said: ‘Don’t tar me with the same brush as a scumbag and a paedophile.’ Starr, whose fiancee Sophie Lea, 34, . became pregnant with his fifth child last November, made further claims . on Friday night when he went on stage in Wolverhampton on the first . night of a stand-up comedy tour. Branding Miss Ward a ‘liar’, he told his audience: ‘My brief is going to tear her to pieces. I’ve never been to the BBC.’ However, he changed his mind yesterday . after the footage obtained by Channel 4 News showed him appearing as a . ‘special guest’ of Savile during the BBC programme. Couple: Freddie Starr (left) is engaged to Sophie Lea (right), 34, who fell pregnant with his fifth child last year . Last night a spokesman for Starr said: . ‘Freddie is now 69 and cannot be expected to recollect every show that . he has appeared on and to remember every person that he has met. Presenter: Starr had denied ever meeting Ms Ward - who claims he tried to molest her in Sir Jimmy Savile's (pictured in 1982) BBC dressing room . 'It would . now appear from seeing footage of a Clunk Click show aired in 1974 that . in fact Freddie was mistaken and therefore that he had in fact been on a . Jimmy Savile show. ‘However this does not detract away . from the fact that Freddie vigorously denies the awful allegation that . has been made by Karin Ward, which despite this footage is still totally . unsupported and uncorroborated by any other evidence.’ Miss Ward – who also claimed to have . seen paedophile pop star Gary Glitter raping a 13-year-old girl in . Savile’s dressing room on a different occasion – was a pupil at the . now-defunct Duncroft School for girls. Savile used to prey on under-age girls at the school and invited his favourites to London to watch his shows being recorded. Yesterday, Biddy Baxter, the former editor of Blue Peter told Radio 5 Live how she was a victim of sexual harassment at the BBC. Miss Baxter, 79, who held the position . between 1965 and 1988, said she endured ‘several slightly hairy . encounters’ with overly-friendly male producers during her early career. She added: ‘There’s been such a change . of culture since then. Now, that sort of incident is taken notice of . whether that’s a good thing or not.’ A campaign was launched yesterday to . posthumously strip Sir Jimmy Savile of his knighthood. Victims of child . abuse are to lobby MPs for the honour to be removed. ■ Vanessa Feltz has claimed she was groped by a ‘married, avuncular, much-beloved national treasure’ while hosting a TV chat show in the mid-1990s. The presenter, who at the time was working on ITV chat show Vanessa, and Channel 4’s The Big Breakfast, said that her guest put his hand up her skirt during a live interview, which left her feeling ‘humiliation and outrage’ even now.

"The teenager shot dead by police in Melbourne was once a member of a radical Muslim group that was the target of police terrorism raids back in 2012. Numan Haider was shot after he drew a knife during an arranged meeting with authorities and stabbed two police officers in Melbourne's south-east on Tuesday night. The 18-year-old, who  lived in Narre Warren south-east of the CBD, was once associated with the Melbourne-based Islamic fundamentalist group Al-Furqan. Scroll down for video . Numan Haider, the teenager shot dead by police in Melbourne, was once a member of a radical Muslim group that was the target of police terrorism raids back in 2012 . The Al-Furqan Islamic Centre in Springvale, which offers lectures and discussions about Islam, confirmed Mr Haider was once a member of their group, the ABC reports. Secretary of the Islamic Council of Victoria, Ghaith Krayem, said he spoke the centre on Tuesday night following Mr Haider's death. 'They are as distressed as anybody in the community about what occurred. My understanding is that a young man hasn't been with them for quite some time so they had no recent contact with him,' he said. In September 2012, Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police raided a number of properties belonging to people connected with the Al-Furqan centre. Police seized guns, computers and a memory stick containing violent extremist material during the raids. A 24-year-old man was arrested as a result and charged with possessing and collecting material in connection with the preparation of a terrorist act. The Al-Furqan Islamic Centre in Springvale, south east of Melbourne, is an Islamic fundamentalist group that offers lectures and discussions about religion . Many of Melbourne's mainstream Islamic groups considered some individuals associated with the centre to have controversial views, including its Bosnian-Australian leader, Sheikh Harun. The leader of a Bosnian mosque nearby, Ibrahim Omerdic, told the Age Sheikh Harun had led a group of 'radical followers' away from his mosque to form the Al-Furqan Centre a decade earlier. 'They radicalised matters regarding women and men. He said Muslims were not allowed to vote,' he said. The chairman of the Bosnian Islamic Organisation of Australia, Jasmin Bekric, told the Herald Sun he met the centre's founders shortly after the September 11 attacks in the US. Numan Haider, pictured here in full military dress on his Facebook page, had recently parted ways with the Al-Furqan centre before he died on Tuesday night . 'In 2001, I met with them when they were established, maybe seven to 10 days after the attacks,' he said. 'We had a clash with their ideas and their approach to interpreting Islam, and at the time I strongly condemned their thinking, their dogma. 'They tried to say some things about the United States. We said to them: ""You have got to understand America and its government helped Bosnia and the Bosnian people"".' In one of several videos uploaded to YouTube by Al-Furqan in 2012, Sheikh Harun condemned Muslims who was thinking of joining ASIO, the Australian army or police force. 'I hope that none here thinking it is allowed to be soldier in Australian Army without losing your religion and out of Islam,' he said. 'So I hope none here has any doubt. And I said army, then police, ASIO, AFP - all that nullify the religion of the person.'","Numan Haider was shot after he stabbed two police officers in south-east Melbourne on Tuesday .

"High cost of going green: Britain's green energy 'folly' will cost every family an extra £600 a year by 2020, a report warned last night . Britain's green energy ‘folly’ will cost every family an extra £600 a year by 2020, a report warned last night. The cost to consumers of green energy subsidies will exceed £16billion a year within seven years, according to a leading industry analyst. Dr John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, warned that the huge burden on taxpayers could lead to the first long-term decline in living standards since the Industrial Revolution. He estimates that a third of the £600 annual cost will land on energy bills. The rest will be borne by businesses who will pass on the costs to consumers by charging higher prices for their goods. In . a report titled Are Green Times Just Around The Corner?, he said: . ‘Shifting to current renewables for the bulk of our energy would result . in a reversal of the long-run economic trend since the Industrial . Revolution. 'More . people would be working for lower wages in the energy sector, energy . costs would rise, the economy would stagnate and there would also be a . significant decline in people’s standard of living.’ He . added: ‘The annual additional cost to consumers will be upwards of . £16billion a year in 2020, which is over 1 per cent of current GDP. ‘One . third of this cost would hit households directly through their . electricity bills, regardless of income, making it an intensely . regressive measure. ‘The . remainder of the cost would be passed through from industrial and . commercial customers and eventually be met by households from increases . in the cost of living. The total impact would be in the order of £600 . per household per year, assuming there are 26million households.’ Under EU laws, Britain’s energy . consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020 – one of . the largest proportional increases in Europe. It is currently around 6 . per cent. Dr Constable said . the Renewables Obligation – the amount customers pay on their fuel bills . to fund green energy – currently costs consumers £2billion a year. This will have to rise to almost £8billion to meet the targets, he said – costing an average family some £200 extra a year. The . Carbon Price Floor policy, which is a charge on businesses for every . tonne of carbon dioxide they emit, will cost an additional £1billion. Experts say this will make  Britain’s firms uncompetitive and force them to pass on costs to consumers. Additional charges to help fund wind farms are likely to add around £5billion a year, the report claims. Wind turbines stand close by Mossmorran Ethleyne Plant: Under EU laws, Britain¿s energy consumption from renewables needs to reach 15 per cent by 2020 - one of the largest proportional increases in Europe . Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘With many families struggling to make ends meet in these tough economic times, taxpayers will be disgusted at how much of their cash is subsidising green energy. ‘Millions of people are worried about the cost of living, yet the Government’s own policies are making bills even more expensive for households up and down the country. ‘Ministers should be looking to reduce the burdens they are placing on people by scrapping expensive green taxes and subsidies which are unnecessarily pushing up our energy bills.’ Last night a Department of Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: ‘We don’t recognise these numbers. The costs of renewables are coming down. ‘We’ve already cut the subsidies for onshore wind and solar and in future all green technologies will have to compete to deliver the best bang for the buck. ‘Renewable energy is helping support growth through jobs and investment.’",Pressure group warns cost could lead to first long-term decline in living standards since the Industrial Revolution .
"'Colourful past': Prince Andrew has been controversially elected to the fellowship of the Royal Society . Founded in 1660, the Royal Society brings together luminaries of the scientific world. The cosmologist Stephen Hawking, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the internet, and Sir John Sulston, who oversaw the human genome project, are among its current fellows. Now they have been joined by someone with a rather less distinguished scientific background. Prince Andrew, who gained six O-levels and three A-levels (in English, history and politics) before going to the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, has been elected a fellow. But his selection to the prestigious role has caused a revolt at the society. Critics have highlighted his 'over-colourful past', and lack of a scientific background. They have told Royal Society president Sir Paul Nurse they oppose the choice of the Duke and have also questioned the validity of the election. Rebels claim the use of ballot papers that carried only a Yes box meant the only way to vote against the Duke was to spoil it, so they had no way of preventing him being chosen. But the society claims fellows were offered advice on how to vote against. Results of the ballot announced on Friday showed he won the role with votes from only 11 per cent of the electorate, with a huge number of abstentions. Only 147 fellows out of some 1,300 had voted for the prince with 24 spoilt papers against. Some 1,128 fellows abstained. The rebellion is being led by David Colquhoun, a society fellow and professor of pharmacology at University College London. 'The Royal Society was founded to advocate the idea that science is what matters, not deference to authority,' he said. 'The exception to that seems to be deference to “royal blood”, but it is taking deference too far to elect Prince Andrew.' Giants of science: Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is a fellow of the Royal Society . Prof Colquhoun highlighted some . controversial aspects of the Duke's 'over-colourful past' including the . sale of his former home, Sunninghill Park, to Timur Kulibayev, the . son-in-law of the Kazakh president, for £3million above the £12million . asking price. The Duke was nominated by the . society's ruling council. Last night a spokesman for the society said . Prof Colquhoun and other critics were 'in a minority'. Bill Hartnett said: 'The Duke was . nominated because of the huge support he has shown to British scientists . and the development of British science. 'The Duke has been very supportive of . young British scientists, hosting events and attending events at the . society, and he has been instrumental in bridging the gap between . academic science in Britain and British industry.' Prince Andrew joins his father Prince . Philip, siblings Prince Charles and Princess Anne and nephew Prince . William as royal fellows. The Queen is the society's patron. Mr Hartnett added: 'We have a very strong link with the Royal Family. That is why we are the Royal Society.' Great mind: Sir John Sulston's work on mapping the human genome has made him a champion of science and a fellow of the Royal Society .","Prince Andrew joins Stephen Hawking and Sir Tim Berners-Lee as a fellow .

"Under-fire: npower chief executive Paul Massara told MPs the company had paid no corporation tax in the UK for the last three years . Energy giant nPower has admitted paying no UK corporation tax for three years despite making £766million in profits. The revelation emerged yesterday during fierce questioning of the company's chief executive by MPs. NPower joins Amazon, Google and Starbucks in coming under fire for making millions in Britain while contributing little to the Treasury's coffers. The company's average dual fuel bill has risen by £257 in just two years – leaving households facing punishing annual payments of £1,352. In theory, the £766million profits for the period 2009 to 2011 could have generated a tax bill of £200million rather than staying wholly with German parent company RWE and its shareholders. Ian Lavery, a Labour MP, suggested several of the 'big six' power firms were paying less corporation tax than they should – with nPower the worst offender. Paul Massara, who heads the firm, admitted it had paid no corporation tax in the three years. However, he insisted the situation was perfectly acceptable because nPower had put the cost of building wind farms against its tax liability. Mr Lavery said he was amazed by this and customers would struggle to understand such a 'surprising' explanation. Fellow Labour MP John Robertson said: 'Everyone watching these proceedings will be absolutely shocked that you are willing to stand up and say we deserve not to pay tax. If I said that, I would be crucified. The firm in part blamed investment in wind farms for its failure to pay corporation tax to the UK Treasury (file picture) 'You have used the rules to suit . yourself. I am glad I don't get my energy from you, if I did I would be . switching as soon as I left this room, I am so annoyed about it.' Rise: nPower's UK profits have increased and so have average household fuel bills .

"Savers with over 100,000 euros deposited in the Bank of Cyprus could now be hit for losses of up to 60 per cent, according to a central bank official and a senior finance ministry technocrat. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they're not authorized to publicly discuss details of the issue, said deposits over 100,000 euros at the country's largest lender will lose 37.5 percent of their value after being converted into bank shares. They said that savers could then lose up to 22.5 per cent more, depending on an assessment by officials who will determine the exact figure aimed at restoring the troubled bank back to health.

Cyprus crisis: Deposits over 100,000 euros will lose 37.5 percent of their value after being converted into bank shares and savers could then lose up to 22.5 per cent more, according to two anonymous insiders . Cyprus agreed Monday to make depositors . contribute to a financial rescue in order to secure 10 billion euros . ($12.9 billion) in loans from the eurozone and the IMF. On Wednesday night, five shipping containers filled with billions of Euros are reported to have been flown to Cyprus from Frankfurt and delivered to the island’s central bank to ensure money did not run out. A helicopter and police cars guarded the armoured cash convoy, thought to have been sent by the European Central Bank, on its way from the airport. Strict new rules have been imposed to stop a run on Cyprus banks which yesterday opened for the first time since the island’s economic meltdown started nearly a fortnight ago.

"The Seattle Seahawks self-proclaimed 'best cornerback in the NFL' roared into the Super Bowl on a wave of publicity generated by his trash talk but bowed out with a whimper. Richard Sherman said after the game he suffered a high ankle sprain in the first quarter but stayed in until further aggravating it early in the fourth - he was taken off the field on a cart. Sherman was seen later in the game with a boot on his right foot and walking around using crutches. Ready to rumble: Cornerback Richard Sherman #25 of the Seattle Seahawks is shown prior to Super Bowl XLVIII . He finished the game with only one pass defended and three tackles, and his presence in the game wasn't enough to stop Denver quarterback Peyton Manning from throwing in his direction. Sherman's job was to cover Demaryius Thomas, number one corner versus number one receiver. Manning completed a Super Bowl-record 14 passes, including a late touchdown, to Thomas. The Broncos QB famously responded during Super Bowl media day to Sherman saying he throws 'ducks' by saying 'they were touchdown ducks.' In a heap: Sherman lays on the ground after being injured during the second half of the Super Bowl, he later said it was a high ankle sprain . In need of assistance: Sherman (25) is carted off the field after being hurt . Back in action: Sherman walks on crutches while wearing a boot on his injured right ankle after the game . Sherman attributed the lackluster performance in on the game's biggest stage to the ankle sprain in a post-game interview with Westwood One Radio, according to NBC Sports. High ankle sprains usually heal with rest, but some require surgery. Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Roddy White, a perennial all-pro, suffered through the 2013 season with a severe high ankle sprain that sidelined him for the eight games and left him a shell of his former self the rest of the way. White is expected to be back up to speed by the time NFL training camps start in July, it is still too early to tell what Sherman's prognosis is.","Richard Sherman said earlier this week that Peyton Manning throws duck, Manning responded by saying 'those ducks were touchdowns'

"Took it to the top: Security expert Khalil Shreateh used a Facebook glitch to post to Mark Zuckerberg's wall after the site's security team refused to heed his warnings about the vulnerability . The hacker who broke into Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Timeline to expose a security lapse will be awarded nearly $12,000 from an online crowdsourced campaign. The GoFundMe campaign has raised $11,741 for Khalil Shreateh, of Palestine, who claims he was forced to hack into Zuckerberg's page to bring attention to the security vulnerability because Facebook had ignored his earlier warnings. The bug that Shreateh found allowed him to post on the Timelines of people who weren't his Facebook friends. The reward for his work was arranged by Marc Maiffret, the chief technology officer of security firm BeyondTrust. 'Khalil Shreateh found a vulnerability in Facebook.com and, due to miscommunication, was not awarded a bounty for his work,' Maiffret wrote on the GoFundMe campaign page. 'Let us all send a message to security researchers across the world and say that we appreciate the efforts they make for the good of everyone.' Facebook has a 'Bug Bounty' program that pays out at least $500 to hackers who bring software bugs to the company's attention. Scroll down for video... Pictured: Only your friends are supposed to be able to write on your Facebook wall, but using the glitch he found, Shreateh wrote about the issue on CEO and founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg's wall . Smiling now? He was ignored twice by Facebook security, but Shreateh got a speedy response when he posted to Zuckerberg's wall. But he won't get the usual $500 reward because he violated their terms of service . But the company said Shreateh would not qualify for a reward because he tested the bug against another user. Joe Sullivan, Facebook's Chief Security Officer, explained the company's decision in a post online. 'We . will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers . who have tested vulnerabilities against real users,' he wrote. 'It is . never acceptable to compromise the security or privacy of other people. In this case, the researcher could have sent a more detailed report . (like the video he later published), and he could have used one of our . test accounts to confirm the bug.' Shreateh . first contacted the Facebook security team after proving the glitch was . real by writing on the wall of a friend of the Facebook founder. But instead of thanking him and fixing the issue, Facebook said it wasn’t a bug. ‘My . name is Khalil Shreateh. I finished school with B.A degree in . Information Systems . I would like to report a bug in your main site . (www.facebook.com) which i discovered it...The bug allow Facebook users . to share links to other facebook users , I tested it on Sarah.Goodin . wall and I got success post.’ Shreateh, . whose first language is Arabic, lives in Palestine and is in no way . connected with Zuckerberg’s fellow Harvard alum Goodin. He hoped his . ability to post to her page, nonetheless, would help prove his case to . Facebook security. However, instead of repairing the obvious security breach, Facebook replied to Shreateh by saying the issue ‘was not a bug.’ Undeterred, Shreateh used the glitch to hack his way onto Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page. ‘Sorry . for breaking your privacy,’ he wrote in a since removed post to . Zuckerberg, ‘I had no other choice…after all the reports I sent to . Facebook team.’ Shreateh went on to recount his attempts to warn the website and posted a grab of the post on his blog. Minutes later, his pleas were answered. Facebook contacted him demanding to know how he’d hacked their bosses personal page. ‘We fixed this bug on Thursday,’ wrote Matt Jones from Facebook’s security team in a Saturday post on Hacker News.

"Britain is on track to suffer its coldest March in more than 50 years as conservationists warned that the prolonged winter weather was damaging wildlife. Forecasters said the latest cold spell was keeping average temperatures several degrees below the norm, with the next seven days to be chillier than usual. The Central England Temperature – covering an area bounded by Lancashire, Bristol and London – shows temperatures have been 2.8C lower than normal. Compared: These satellite images from March 2012 (left) and March 2013 (right) show how far we’ve fallen from the March 2012 high of 23.6C recorded in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, to -12.9C in the same village last week . The last time March was so cold was in 1962, when the average temperature was 2.4C (36F) – or 4.1C below the norm. Now these satellite maps show just how . far we’ve fallen from the March 2012 high of 23.6C recorded in Aboyne, . Aberdeenshire, to a daytime low of -7.8C in the same village on Monday . of last week. That astonishing difference - which is 36.5C when considering Aboyne's even colder overnight low last week of -12.9C -  in just one year comes as another snowfall covered northern Britain overnight. A Met Office spokesman said: ‘This time last year the UK was under the influence of high pressure. This gave us clear skies, plenty of sunshine and with a light southerly breeze, temperatures that were well above average. Highs and lows: Charlotte Robertson, two, plays with daffodils in a park in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, on March 27 2012 (left), while spring chickens huddle against the cold in the same village last week on March 11 2013 (right) Sun and snow: Richmond Park in south-west London seen on March 15 2012 (left) and March 11 2013 (right) ‘This year, with a strong easterly . wind bringing cold air from Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, we have . quite the opposite with eastern parts of the UK in particular seeing . snow, ice and temperatures around 20C lower. ‘The . direction of the wind therefore plays a major part in what type of . weather you and I will see, especially as we have the Atlantic Ocean to . our west and continental Europe to our south and east.’ 'This time last year the UK was under the influence of high pressure. This gave us clear skies, plenty of sunshine and with a light southerly breeze, temperatures that were well above average' Met Office spokesman . Up . to four inches of snow was predicted to settle in parts of Scotland and . north England by this morning, with more expected to fall during the . day as temperatures hover around a bitter 3C. The Met Office has issued a number of . amber weather warnings across north-east England and central and . eastern Scotland urging people to be prepared for disruption. But regions south of Cumbria and Yorkshire escaped the snowy weather, instead set to enjoy a dry day with relatively warmer temperatures, of up to 9C in London, with a risk of scattered showers. MeteoGroup forecaster Matt Dobson said: ‘It's a real north-south split today. Over high ground up to 10cms (3.9in) could have fallen over night, with the potential for the same amount again today. ‘Even down to sea level there could be a covering of between 1cm (0.4in) and 4cm (1.6in), very likely in Edinburgh. ‘In the north of England there will be up to 6cm (2.4in) overnight and a few more falling throughout the day, along with higher parts of north Wales. Today's weather: Frost covers the ground looking towards Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in this stunning spring scene . Extraordinary: Thousands of starlings swoop high above the snow covered fields near Bowes, County Durham . Beautiful: The starlings were on their way to their winter roost as the arctic weather continued in England . Staying together: These two lambs snuggle up to their mother in a snow-covered field in County Durham . Grazing: Heavy snow in the Borders and many areas of Scotland is causing concern from farmers as they prepare for the lambing season . ‘But south of the country there will be few showers but a lot of dry weather and some sunshine breaking through.’ 'Whether you think that Spring officially starts on March 1 or March 21, this is certainly unusually cold for this time of year. It's very cold for mid-March when we should expect much higher temperatures' MeteoGroup forecaster Matt Dobson . More snow is expected on Friday. He added that the cold weather and snow storms across the north were likely to linger throughout the week and could even lead to blizzard conditions in Scotland. It continues a cold month across the UK which has brought an unwelcome delay to spring weather. Mr Dobson said that while snow is not uncommon for March, the continued cold weather is. He said: ‘Whether you think that Spring officially starts on March 1 or March 21, this is certainly unusually cold for this time of year. It's very cold for mid-March when we should expect much higher temperatures. ‘It's not unusual for it to snow in . March, in fact we are far more likely to see snow at Easter than at . Christmas. What is unusual for March is how persistent the cold weather . and snow is.’ No-go area: A motorist is unable to continue on a snow-covered road near Forfar in Angus, Scotland . Splash: Several motorists were left stranded after their cars got stuck in floods near Witham, Essex today . Three-day forecast: The cold snap will continue this week, although northern Scotland will see some sunshine . Today and tomorrow: These Met Office maps show an amber weather warning in place for parts of Scotland . This time last year: Alex Hamilton (left) rollerskates in Hyde Park, central London, on March 28 2012, while Cherry Lewin and Tony Johnson (right) enjoy the weather in Warkworth, Northumberland, on March 29 2012 . He added that it is too early to predict a white Easter. The cold weather is likely to bring more travel misery today. Yesterday a number of key commuter routes were disrupted, including some south-east England journeys which were hit by a build-up of ice on the ‘third rail’ from which trains get their power. 'It's not unusual for it to snow in March, in fact we are far more likely to see snow at Easter than at Christmas. What is unusual for March is how persistent the cold weather and snow is' MeteoGroup forecaster Matt Dobson . Services in Hampshire, Surrey and Kent were particularly affected, with a number of trains being delayed and cancelled, while passengers were left waiting for trains between Rugby, Northampton and London, and signalling problems in Glasgow led to delays. Police closed the A66 across the Pennines between Bowes, County Durham, and Stainmore, Cumbria, because of heavy snow and Leeds Bradford International Airport was closed. The bad weather will mean cargo ship MV Danio, which ran aground on Saturday on rocks near a  Farne Islands lighthouse, three miles off the Northumberland coast, will stay put for at least a week. Britain has been gripped by a long and cold winter, but forecasters say temperatures were not particularly exceptional when comparing it to previous years. Winter 2012/13 was only 0.4C below the UK mean of 3.7C on average during January 2013, according to Met Office forecasters who studied data back to 1910. Figures for the winter as a whole showed a UK mean temperature of 3.3C, which makes it colder than the 4.6C in 2011/12, but warmer than 3.2C in 2008/09, 1.6C in 2009/10 and 2.4C in 2010/11. However, even further back, there was 4.9C recorded in 2007/8 and 5.6C in 2006/07, with the latter being the second warmest winter for Britain on record behind the 5.8C in 1988/89.","Astonishing Met Office satellite maps compare March 2012 to March 2013 .

"A cyber-criminal nicknamed the 'Black Dragon' has been jailed for masterminding an audacious attempt to hack into the UN's computer systems to steal £6.5million worth of carbon credits. Matthew Beddoes, 32, created a rogue 'Trojan' programme he called Zeus to transfer 426,108 Certified Emission Reduction credits from an account on the UN's Clean Development Mechanism Registry in Bonn, Germany. But he was thwarted when an incorrect account number was used. United Nations hacker Matthew Beddoes a series of charges at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court . Beddoes then targeted the Spanish Carbon Credit Registry and 350,000 European Union Allowances were transferred to a UK broker, who sold $89,000 worth to BP before the remainder were frozen. He pleaded guilty at Kingston-upon-Thames Crown Court to six counts of conspiring to do unauthorised acts, with intent to impair computer programmes, four counts of unauthorised access to business computers, three counts of possessing electronic files containing credit card information and one count of acquiring criminal property on or before November 17, 2011. He was recruited by Jasdeep Randhawa, 38, of Leicester, who received twenty-one months imprisonment and his friend Jandeep Sangha, 28, of Leicester, who laundered the stolen money, received twelve months, suspended for two years, was fined £1,000 and ordered to complete 120 hours community service. Shrewsbury-born Beddoes, of Donnington, Telford, who also nicknamed himself 'Cyber Commander' and 'Secret Squirrel' boasted of his hacking skills online, with his Facebook name 'Matty Net Jackal Beddoes' an 'Old Skool Hacker'. He spent a short time living in South Tidworth, Wiltshire, after setting up Alladin Technologies, a computer security company, specialising in removing malicious software and viruses. His lawyer Mark Cotter told the court: 'He has had an itinerant lifestyle, bouncing from place to place, but always with the company of his laptop. 'He first became interested in computers at the age of five and if circumstances were different his skills may have been channeled into more lawful use. Matthew Beddoes, from Telford, posted this picture of his laptop and wads of cash on his online profile . 'He started his first steps in hacking at the age of sixteen and is in some ways addicted. He has immersed himself into online computing and hacking and it became a challenge. 'It appear to have been a highly-addictive hobby, a hobby that has ended with him breaking the law. There is a culture of bragging within this community and it has a fantasy element to it. 'You get the feeling with the names Black Dragon and Cyber Commander you are dealing with a James Bond-style secret organisation when in reality it is a bloke on his laptop in a friend's house living an itinerant lifestyle. 'You could describe him as a master online locksmith and he advertised his services to find new challenges and was approached by Mr Randhawa on the internet. 'The proposal that was put forward in relation to carbon credits was a new challenge for him and he formulated an effective way of putting the operation into effect. 'The powerful malware you employed was a . so-called Trojan called Zeus which when injected into computer systems . was highly-efficient at stealing information.' Judge Nicholas Price . 'It came as an enormous surprise to him that it ultimately did work. He did not think in a million years that anyone would open the email and the attachment, particularly in an organisation like the United Nations.' Beddoes received £6,250 for the smaller sale of carbon credits to BP. 'I am sure he would be an extremely valuable asset to any company, telling them where their weaknesses lie and how to stop people getting in,' added Mr. Cotter. Coalminer's son Beddoes, who left school after failing all his GCSE's has been in custody since his arrest on November 17, 2011. 'He has found his time in prison difficult and feels he does not belong there, that he doesn't fit in there.' On Twitter in November 2010, he boasted: 'I'm a web/network hacker that is looking to sell my excess data or trade for services. Here is a list of data I am selling for now and more. 'On a mission to code these apps, hack three sites, make some dolla on da forex and debug some router firmwares. Virtually unstoppable.' Randhawa pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiring to secure unauthorised access to computers and two counts of conspiring to impair computer programmes between June 4 and November 17, 2011. Sangha pleaded guilty to conspiring to disguise criminal property and acquiring criminal property on or before November 17, 2011. Judge Nicholas Price told Beddoes: 'From a career, which started with no promise academically, your interest in computers started at an extraordinarily young age. 'You possess considerable IT skills that if harnessed legitimately should have provided you with a rewarding job and a substantial salary. 'You would have been an asset to any company, to point out potential abuses in their computer systems and it is a tragedy that you abused those skills in such a criminal way.' When arrested Beddoes was in possession of 3,000 credit card numbers, 500 email addresses of potential 'phishing' scam victims and he had accessed the computers of HSBC, Virgin, LloydsTSB and other companies. 'You adopted a number of cyber tools to attack websites and to obtain carbon credits as well as usernames, passwords, email addresses and bank details. 'The powerful malware you employed was a so-called Trojan called Zeus which when injected into computer systems was highly-efficient at stealing information.'","Matthew Beddoes, 32, targeted UN and EU carbon credits to sell on .

Another victim, an African man, aged 36, was found . weeping in the street outside her home after an ordeal lasting 36 hours. Imprisoned: Antje Crapnik, 47, was found dead by her latest lover at her home in Munich. She was arrested earlier this year for imprisoning men for lengthy sex ordeals . Recalling his encounter with Miss Crapnik, the man said: 'I met her on a bus. She invited me back here. Oh God, it was hell. I can't walk. Please help me.' She was . found lying dead next to her latest and last lover in her bed on Friday. The man, who was Miss Crapnik's neighbour, rang police to report her death when he woke up to . find her lifeless beside him. He said: 'I knew something was wrong because usually she wanted it first thing in the morning.' An . autopsy will determine what the cause of death was - and whether her insatiable . sex drive had anything to do with it. Her last lover said to police that she had 'been . hitting the wine' before they retired to her room on Thursday night and that she had snorted a drug. Miss Crapnik, dubbed the woman who could not say 'nein', formerly owned a fashion store before her sex drive forced . her into poverty and on to welfare. She told social workers she needed . sex up to ten times a day, every day. Antje's mother told Germany's Bild newspaper: 'She . was a sick person.' She spoke with her mother the night before she died.  Her . daughter complained that 2012 was a terrible year and that next year 'would be better'. Her first victim Dieter Schulz, 43, met her in a bar in . the centre of his home city. She took him back to her apartment and they had . sex several times. But when the woman demanded more, the exhausted man said . no. A police spokesman said: 'He complied with the woman's wishes another few . times so he could finally leave the apartment. 'But when she continued to refuse and demanded even more . sex from him, he fled to the balcony.'  Schulz phoned police and pleaded . for assistance. 'You have got to help me,' he told them. 'She is trying . to kill me with sex. I cannot get out - and I cannot go on!' When police arrived to question the woman and free Schulz . she invited two officers to join her in bed for a 'quickie', but they declined.

"Germany forward Thomas Muller insists that he is not thinking about winning the Golden Boot for a second successive World Cup - despite netting a hat-trick against Portugal. Joachim Low's side hammered Cristiano Ronaldo and his nation 4-0 in Salvador, putting Germany in control of Group G and Muller at the top of the goalscoring charts. But the 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward is fully focused on helping Germany win the tournament and not the personal glory that comes with the Golden Boot, a trophy he won in South Africa in 2010 after scoring five goals and contributing more assists than his rivals. Focused: Thomas Muller insists he is concentrating on winning the World Cup and not the Golden Boot . Treble: Muller (centre) scores his hat-trick goal during Germany's 4-0 demolition of Portugal . Muller said: 'Let’s remain objective here, this was just the first match. 'We just want to be world champions and if we do that, records may or may not come, but we have other things to focus on. 'A hat-trick at the World Cup doesn’t happen every day of course, but I have had a good run at World Cups and I wanted to pick up where I left off. 'I am known for giving my utmost, but no one could have assumed that would happen and I can’t say that will happen again in the next match, but I’ll certainly try.' And Muller's German team-mate, defender Mats Hummels, is remaining positive about his future participation in Brazil despite picking up an injury in Monday's encounter. The Borussia Dortmund defender limped off the field and he undergo tests to reveal the extent of his thigh injury. Celebrate: Muller (right) is hugged by German team-mates following his penalty which opened the scoring . Pinpoint: Muller slots home against Portugal as he went top of the goalscoring charts in Brazil . The 25-year-old scored Germany’s second goal against Portgual, powering in a header from a corner, and he told Sportl television: 'The injury doesn’t feel like something which would end my World Cup. 'Maybe it will cost me one game, or maybe none at all. 'It looked worse than it is. I do have my thigh heavily strapped, but it’s going to be fine. It could have been worse.' However, the German FA are less confident that Hummels will be fit for Germany's next match against Ghana on Saturday following a magnetic resonance imaging test of the injury. They said on their website: 'Hummels suffered a contusion in his right thigh with bleeding into the muscle.' 'It will depend on the further healing when he will be able to resume training or whether he can plan in the second Group G match against Ghana in Fortaleza on Saturday.' Hummels's fellow defender Jerome Boateng also suffered an injury against Portugal, partially tearing ligaments in his right thumb. 'Boateng will have to wear a protective splint for six weeks with which he can play with after the approval of each respective referee,' the DFB said.

Tough terrain: Yong Chun Kim, 66, survived two days and nights on Mount Rainier in Washington by burning money and then his socks . Mr Kim, who served in the South Korean military in the Vietnam War, told local station KOMO-TV that he had fire . starters with him and first burned some leaves before turning to personal items. The 66-year-old also kept moving to stay warm, took cover under a tree at night and dreamed of his wife and being in a sauna. He was rescued yesterday but was in such good shape that there was no need for him to go to hospital. An emergency team discovered Mr Kim in deep snow in a river valley after snowshoeing to find him. It took nine hours to bring him down from the remote spot because of the treacherous conditions. Rescued: Kim flashes a victory sign after he was rescued after being lost for two days in a blizzard in Mount Rainier National Park . Fighting for survival: Kim snapped a photo of a fire he attempted to start by burning a $5 bill and other personal possessions . Mr Kim, who has been a U.S. citizen for 30 years, said: 'The rangers, they're good people. I love them.' Rescue service spokeswoman Lee Taylor . told the News Tribune newspaper that Mr Kim was an . experienced hiker, and had been alert, conscious and stable when he was found by . the team of three. Mr Kim was reported . missing on Saturday after he fell down a slope and became separated from his group in the highly-elevated Paradise region.

Mr Kim, who has been snowshoeing for a decade, was well-equipped for a day . trip but didn't have overnight gear. In good spirits: Kim sits in a snow vehicle after he was rescued . Precarious peak: Mount Rainier in Washington has seen snow drifts as high as 30 inches . The 66-year-old was the leader of his group meaning the other less experienced members weren't able to . accurately describe where he had slipped. Mount Rainier has seen temperatures . in the teens (minus 9 Celsius), and eight inches of new snow fell in some places over the weekend. Wind-blown . snow drifts were as high as 30 inches in some areas. Bad weather prevented a helicopter rescue, so crews used a Sno-Cat snow vehicle to reach the area where Mr Kim was. His son Malcom An thanked rescuers. Recovered: Kim, of Tacoma, Washington, talks at his home about his experience being lost in a blizzard for two days . On the edge: It took nine hours to bring Mr Kim (pictured) down from the remote spot because of the treacherous conditions . He said: 'A . terrible situation that could have ended in tragedy, instead turned . into another beautiful example of how Americans come together to help . each other.' Mr Kim's sister-in-law, . Sang Soon Tomyn, told the Associated Press that 'as soon as we heard he . was alive, my sister, his wife, praised God and said ''Hallelujah''. We . were so worried. We prayed every day.' She said her brother-in-law was a strong hiker, had food in his backpack and knew the area very well. 'He's a very strong person,' she added.","Yong .

"St George Illawarra drew first blood in the new World Club Series by grinding out an 18-12 win over Warrington in an action-packed clash in front of a 13,080 crowd at the Halliwell Jones Stadium. It was a full-blooded encounter in which the NRL club incurred the wrath of the partisan crowd with two ugly high tackles that might well have produced red cards in Super League. The Wolves battled throughout without being anywhere near their best but had no real answer to the craft of the Dragons' Anglo-Kiwi half-back pairing of Widdop and Benji Marshall. Tyson Frizell celebrates after scoring the opening try for St George Illawarra in their 18-12 win over Warrington . Ben Westwood of Warrington (centre) bursts through the tackles of the St George defence . The Wolves were dealt a blow before kick-off when England utility man Stefan Ratchford was ruled out with a shoulder injury but Kevin Penny proved a superb replacement at full-back and Gary Wheeler slotted in at centre for his full debut. The visitors made the best possible start, making the most of an early knock-on by former player Ashton Sims as Wales international second rower Tyson Frizell took a short pass from Marshall to go in for the first try with just 80 seconds on the clock. Widdop added the goal to make it 6-0 but Warrington's response was impressive and the Dragons were indebted to debutant winger Eto Nabuli for a trysaving tackle on home skipper Joel Monaghan. Jason Nightingale (centre) attempts to escape the grasps of Ben Currie and Westwood at the Halliwell . Ashton Sims (left) looks to get past Leeson Ah Mau of St George during his side's second half defeat . Second rower James Laithwaite was then held up over the line before O'Brien brought Warrington level after dummying his way past Marshall and full-back Josh Dugan to score a superb solo try, to which he added the goal. The kicking game of Widdop and Marshall always threatened to cause problems for Warrington's defence and, when Monaghan failed to clear the former's grubber on the last tackle, second rower Joel Thompson pounced to score a second try and regain the lead. Referee Ben Thaler seemed determined to let the game flow but he was forced to blow up for a horrible-looking tackle by Nabuli on Penny and Warrington took advantage of the first penalty of the match to score their second try on 29 minutes, centre Ryan Atkins taking Wheeler's pass to cross at the corner. Warrington also had a claim for a penalty try ruled out as they trailed 12-10 at the break and they almost fell further behind early in the second half when Dugan breached their line only to be held up on his back. Kevin Penny (centre) is double teamed high by Ben Creagh and match winner Josh Dugan . Tempers flared during the match after some high tackles took place much to the anger of the players . A string of errors forced the Wolves onto the defensive for much of the third quarter but some robust work from forwards Ben Westwood and Chris Hill rallied their side and they drew level with a penalty from O'Brien on 58 minutes. That followed another ugly high shot, this time by Marshall on O'Brien, and the penalties began to pile up as the Australian side's discipline started to let them down. However, just as Warrington appeared to be getting on top, they crucially conceded a try against the run of play. Hooker Mitch Rein split them down the middle and, after Daryl Clark was only able to parry Marshall's kick, Dugan was on hand to gather the ball and touch down for the Dragons' third try.

"An international rugby player is at the centre of a race storm after blacking up as an African football star for a photograph. Wales full-back Liam Williams dressed as Premier League striker Wilfried Bony for the picture, which he then posted on Twitter. Williams, 23, wore the white strip of Bony’s club, Swansea City, donned a black wig and painted his face black to impersonate the Ivory Coast footballer. Yesterday he was accused of racism over the image, which was retweeted 160 times and favourited 345 times after he shared it with his 31,000 Twitter followers. Wales rugby international Liam Williams (right), 23, posted a picture on Twitter of himself dressed as Ivorian striker Wilfried Bony and wearing full face paint. There was an outcry after the picture was posted on Twitter . Williams, who plays for The Scarlets rugby team in Llanelli, West Wales, said Bony gave the costume his blessing. Williams, who plays for the Llanelli-based Scarlets rugby union team, insisted Bony had given him permission, through a friend, to wear the costume. But Show Racism The Red Card criticised the player – who featured in one of its campaigns last season – saying his behaviour was unacceptable. Campaign manager Sunil Patel said: ‘I can’t comment on whether Wilfried is fine with it, but I am sure many black people would not be fine with it. It’s something we might have seen 30 or 40 years ago but it is not something we expect to see in a multicultural society.’ And Weyman Bennett, secretary of Unite Against Fascism, added: ‘This picture is absolutely not appropriate. It is racist to black up.’ Williams, who was pictured alongside teammates including Harry Robinson, Michael Tagicakibau and Rhys Priestland, deleted the picture following critical comments on Saturday. Williams, pictured in an RBS Six Nations match in March, took part in Show Racism the Red Cards 2013/14 campaign with the Welsh Rugby Union.The sports body was yesterday investigating the image . He told his critics to ‘shut up’, adding: ‘There’s not a racist bone in my body. I know Bony through a mutual friend and he said it was OK.’ But yesterday he tweeted: ‘I am very sorry for any offence caused by my actions. I’m not a racist and there was no malice behind it.’ The Welsh Rugby Union is investigating the image.

"The Russian politician wanted for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko has married in a lavish ceremony to a young bride who had 'never heard' of the dead former KGB agent. Wedding pictures, published in the Russian edition of Heat magazine, show a smiling Andrei Lugovoy, 46, dressed in a white suit next to his beaming bride, 23-year-old student Xenia. According to British authorities Lugovoy - a former KGB agent - is the chief suspect in the murder of Mr Litvinenko, a critic of President Putin who worked for MI6 and Spanish secret services. Wedding pictures, published in the Russian edition of Heat magazine, show a smiling Andrei Lugovoy, 46, dressed in a white suit next to his beaming bride, 26-year-old student Xenia . Mr Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair. Lugovoy, the alleged poisoner, is now an ultra-nationalist politician in the Russian State Duma. It has been reported he and his wife - half his age - met in a shop. The over-the-top festivities took place in the celebrated Abrau-Durso winery located in the picturesque resort town of Gelenzhik on the Black Sea. The Times reports that the festivities stretched over several days, with the couple changing outfits, from traditional Cossack outfits to football kits. Mr Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair . According to British authorities Lugovoy is the chief suspect in the murder of Mr Litvinenko - a critic of President Putin who worked for MI6 and Spanish secret services . There were ice sculptures, singing and fireworks, and Russian vodka, it is said. The nuptials have remained a secret since the ceremony took place in October. In the Heat interview, Mr Lugovoy said his wife had no idea who he was when they met. It was only when she saw him on a television programme, taking a polygraph test to deny involvement in the Litvinenko murder, that he said she expressed 'surprise'. He said: 'It turns out she had never heard about this (Litvinenko) story. It was a long time ago and not many people remember it, basically just the politicians with whom I associate. She was of course very surprised.' He added that he met his wife in a shop while buying his 'own products', a habit he has formed because he does not 'trust anyone else.' Attempts to extradite Lugovoy to the UK have been rejected by the Russians. He is accused of poisoning Mr Litvinenko with radioactive polonium-210  at a London hotel in 2006, and says the results of  the polygraph test he took in Russia earlier this year prove he was not involved. The Crown Prosecution Service has named Mr Lugovoi as the prime suspect in the case and is seeking his extradition to the UK to face trial. But the former Russian intelligence officer has refused to surrender himself to British justice and has agreed only to provide video evidence to the inquest next year. He has asked his lawyers to challenge rules which prevent  lie-detector evidence being admitted in court because it is considered unreliable. It has been claimed that Lugovoy and another former KGB agent, Dmitry Kovtun, poisoned Mr Litvinenko at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. Moscow has so far refused to co-operate with Mr Litvinenko's inquest or extradite Lugovo .","Andrei Lugovoy, 46, wed in a lavish ceremony to 23-year-old student Xenia .

"There is always a group of children waiting to hand the Queen the customary posy of flowers when she walks out of morning service. But yesterday Prince Philip was also given his own treat when the couple emerged from a church in West Newton, Norfolk. As Her Majesty smiled as she looked on, the Duke of Edinburgh appeared equally delighted to receive a bag of sweets from a young well-wisher outside the church in the heart of the Sandringham Estate. Sweet treat: Prince Philip was given a bag of Morrisons chocolate éclairs by a young girl, left, after attending a church service in West Newton, Norfolk . Inedible gifts: As has become tradition, the Queen accepted bouquets of flowers from waiting children . The sweets - an 89p bag of own-brand chocolate éclairs from Morrisons - were later spotted on the Prince's lap as he was driven away. Parents crowded round with camera phones to capture the moment as their sons and daughters bravely stepped forward to meet the monarch - while some hung shyly back. The bouquets are often tactfully placed in a separate car by one of the Queen's security team. But the éclairs seemed to find a special place in the Prince's heart, and was spotted still on his lap as the Royal car pulled away. The Royal pair had attended a service at the Church of St Peter and Paul, which is on the Sandringham estate. Happy and glorious: The Queen beamed as excited parents and children crowded round in the sunshine . Spectators: During the service, the Queen and Prince saw a Biblical play performed by Sunday school children . According to local media, the Queen and Philip had just enjoyed a performance of a Biblical play - Whither Thou Go'est - performed by children at the church's Sunday School. The monarch often accepts flowers after morning service when she is staying at Sandringham, although in recent weeks the practice has become a little haphazard. Last week the Queen dashed straight to her waiting car because of heavy rain, following successive Sundays in which she has accepted bouquets of flowers. She had refused to accept flowers from children for two Sundays over Christmas and New Year, reportedly because she had to collect so many on Christmas Day she was late for lunch.","Queen and Duke of Edinburgh visited a church in West Newton, Norfolk .

"Rising energy bills are a political hot topic at the moment but one YouTube user has devised a way of heating a room for just 8p a day. Journalist and boat owner Dylan Winter created his DIY heater using tealights placed inside a bread tin and covered with two ceramic flowerpots. The system uses the scientific principles of convection heat transfer and Winter claims it can heat his home for around eight hours a day. In the video, the tealights are put inside a bread loaf tin and covered with a small upside-down flowerpot. The hole in the top of the upside-down pot is covered with the metal casing leftover from one of the tealights. This pot is covered by a second, larger pot and the hole in the bigger flowerpot is left uncovered. The system works because the candles produce gases full of heated particles that are captured and channelled through the pots. These hot gas particles are lighter than the gases in the air, meaning they rise up into the colder area. This . causes the cold air to fall into the warm areas and creates a . convection current which transfers heat from one pot to another, and out of the hole on top. Winter, who posts to YouTube under the username KeepTurningLeft, is a journalist and boat owner. He created the DIY heater as an alternative way of heating his boat as well as his office at home. Winter bought tealights from Ikea that cost £1 for 100, a standard loaf tin, and two different-sized flowerpots. The smaller flowerpot, when placed upside down, needs to just cover the centre of the loaf tin, while the larger flowerpot needs to sit comfortably over the smaller one. In the video explaining how to build the heater, Winter lights four of the candles and places them inside the tin. He places the smaller flowerpot upside down on top of the tin and covers the hole in the pot with one of the metal cases leftover from the tealights. The larger flowerpot is then placed on top of the smaller one, and its hole is left uncovered. In the video, the tealights are put inside a bread loaf tin and covered with a small upside-down flowerpot. The hole in the top of the upside-down pot is covered with the metal casing leftover from one of the tealights.

Journalist and boat owner Dylan Winter, pictured, created his DIY heater using tealights, a loaf tin and two ceramic flowerpots. In the video, pictured, Winter places the tealights inside the small tin before lighting them . Winter explains that the heat from the . candles warms the inside of the smaller flowerpot, which becomes an . ‘inner core’ that gets ‘very hot.’ A . ‘convection of air’ is then created between the smaller and larger pots . and this heated air comes out the top of the homemade heater. The system works because the candles produce gases full of heated particles that are captured and channelled through the pots. These hot gas particles are lighter than the gases in the air, meaning they rise up into the colder area. Winter covers the tealights and tin with a small upside-down flowerpot, pictured. The hole in the top of the pot is covered with the metal casing leftover from one of the tealights . This causes the cold air to fall into . the warm areas and creates a convection current which transfers heat . from the pots and through the hole in the top. Winter . said: ‘People have told me that judicious positioning of flowerpots . help to make the heating more efficient. I did not believe it but it . really does seem to work. 'You get a nice flow around the [pots] and it warms the room up. You’d be amazed.’ KeepTurningLeft works for Practical Boat Owner magazine and claims he uses the DIY heater on his boat. Each tealight burns for around . four hours, and Dylan Winter uses four tealights in the morning, and four in . the afternoon to heat his rooms for eight hours a day. The smaller pot is covered by a second, larger one and the hole in the bigger flowerpot is left uncovered, pictured. The system works because the candles produce gases full of heated particles that are captured and channelled through the pots . However, station Manager Charlie Pugsley, from the London Fire Brigade’s investigation team, warned against using the homemade heater. 'This heating system is unsafe. As a fire investigator, I see dozens of fires every year, including fatal fires, that are caused by people using alternative forms of heating and lighting, most of which include a naked flame. 'Candles and tea lights can be extremely dangerous – a small gust of wind can cause an innocent candle flame to set light to objects nearby if left too close. 'We understand that some people may be struggling to pay fuel bills, but we’d urge everyone to think carefully about their safety and the safety of those around them before using candles to heat their homes.'","YouTube user Dylan Winter created the DIY heater for his boat and office .

"Schoolchildren should be taught using pounds, ounces and yards, not grams and kilometres, David Cameron has claimed. The Prime Minister insisted he was a 'modern compassionate conservative' but wanted to turn the clock back to using imperial measurements. Embarking on a media blitz of TV and radio interviews, he also said he was relaxed about gay men kissing in public, hailed Boris Johnson as a 'star player' and revealed he has still not apologised to the Queen for revealing she 'purred' down the phone when Scotland voted against independence. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured tonight working on his conference speech, has suggested schools teach using imperial measurements and not metric . Mr Cameron also insisted he was happy to see two gay men kissing in a park . Samantha Cameron arrived in Birmingham tonight, ahead of husband David's speech to the Tory conference . Mr Cameron has been hoping to use a round of media appearances to get a grip on the coverage of his party conference in Birmingham. It follows the shock defections of two MPs to UKIP, growing rows over Europe and the resignation of charities minister Brooks Newmark who sent an explicit picture of himself to an undercover journalist. The Tory leader is expected to use his keynote speech tomorrow to set out his personal plan for Britain. Appearing on BBC2's Newsnight last night, Mr Cameron was asked a series of questions to shed light on his own character. Four decades since metres and litres replaced yards and pints on the curriculum, the Prime Minister suggested he would prefer to see a return to the old system. 'I think I'd still go for pounds and ounces, yes I do,' Mr Cameron told BBC2's Newsnight when asked which should be taught predominantly. Sitting in the audience for Boris Johnson's speech today, Mr Cameron appeared to be mobbed by Tories wanting a selfie . Activists appeared from all directions wanting a photograph with the Prime Minister in the Symphony Hall . Tameena Hussain (left) was among those wanting to get snap on their phone with the Tory leader . Mr Cameron was all smiles as he prepared to listen to the London Mayor's barnstorming speech . Mr Cameron used a series of radio and TV interviews to announce plans to offer 7-day GP surgeries . On a tour of the Tory party conference, Mr Cameron posed for a selfie with Conservative Women's Hub member Parveer Hasan . David Cameron and Boris Johnson appeared together at the Tory conference on Monday . David Cameron has insisted he is 'delighted' at the prospect of Boris Johnson returning to Parliament. The Prime Minister rejected suggestions that he was worried about the Commons comeback of his leadership rival. Asked whether he was 'worried' about Mr Johnson returning to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in May, Mr Cameron told Good Morning Britain: 'No, not at all.' He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I think Boris is a complete star and what I am pleased about in the Conservative Party is that there isn't just one Prime Minister and one leader - we have got a team of leaders. 'I have got an excellent Home Secretary in Theresa May, you saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday with the grit that he has shown in getting our deficit down and delivering our long-term economic plan. Boris is an outstanding Mayor of London and I am delighted he is coming back to Parliament and I think there are real opportunities for him in the future.' Mr Cameron said; 'It's a bit like being a football manager. I'm delighted that I have some great strikers to put on the pitch. 'I have the opposite of tall poppy syndrome - I like being surrounded by talented and good people, because politics is a team enterprise. You need a strong team to deal with all the problems you face and Boris will be a very strong part of that team in the next Parliament.' The present curriculum, which Tory ministers have said they will skew towards imperial measures, requires only that pupils 'understand and use approximate equivalences between metric units and common imperial units such as inches, pounds and pints'. It was one of three questions posed to the PM by the programme to try to define his wider stance. Asked how he would feel if he saw two men kissing in a park, Mr Cameron replied: 'That's fine... I think men should be able to marry each-other and women should be able to marry each-other. 'I can kiss my wife in public, I don't see why you can't kiss your husband,' he said. However, he gave less definitive in his answer to a third posed dilemma - whether a pharmaceutical firm should recruit a British candidate over a better-qualified foreign one. 'I want to make sure that the pharmaceutical company has good British people to employ. In the end, they have to choose,' he said. Mr Cameron today revealed he will not follow Labour leader Ed Miliband to deliver a 'no-notes' speech to his party conference. Last week Mr Miliband was ridiculed after forgetting to mention the deficit during his 69-minute address, claiming he did not want to read a script because he wanted to do politics differently. However, Mr Cameron plans to use a script so he can 'lay out my plan for Britain'. He told the BBC: 'I've been leader of my party for eight years and prime minister for four and I think people have a clear idea. I don't see a contradiction: if people are worried, is this country going to deliver for me? Is there a good job for my child? 'Is there a good school place and is there going to be a clean and safe environment? Are we going to be a country that keeps our promises to the poorest in the world because Britain means something in the world? 'I think all those things are connected and I think a modern compassionate Conservative can appeal to all of those and it actually all first together.' Today Mr Cameron has promised 'many more' family doctors after the general election in order to deliver a pledge of extended-hours access to a GP seven days a week for every NHS patient in England. Doctors' leaders warned that there would need to be significant additional funds and staffing to implement the pledge, announced by the Prime Minister at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. But Mr Cameron insisted that 8am-8pm opening, weekdays and weekends, was already in place for seven million patients after the launch last year of a £50 million fund in selected surgeries. The Conservatives have produced a range of memorabilia for their conference in Birmingham (top), including mugs and travelcard holders carrying Conservative slogans (middle row) and crisps beer mats and lager bottles mocking the Labour party . He announced a further £100 million to ensure that at least 10 million are covered in 2015, and a further £400 million is earmarked to make the extended service nationwide over the five years following next May's election. Mr Cameron told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'I think our health service is performing well and it is a testament to the doctors and nurses and all the other staff who work in our NHS, which is a national treasure. 'It's one of the things I care most about in politics and I am really pleased today to be able to signal what you will get from a Conservative government in terms of seven-day access to your GP.' David Cameron still not apologised to the Queen in person for the embarrassment caused by his comments that she 'purred' down the telephone when Scotland rejected independence. Mr Cameron was left red-faced after being caught on camera revealing details of his conversations with the Queen. On a visit to New York last week, the PM was filmed boasting to former mayor Michael Bloomberg about the call he made to the Queen at Balmoral. Prime Minister David Cameron today admitted that he will have to apologise to the Queen (left, pictured outside Crathie Kirk in Aberdeenshire) again for revealing details of his conversations over the Scotland result . As the Prime Minister and Mr Bloomberg arrived for a press photo-opportunity, Mr Cameron smiled broadly as he recalled how he was able to tell the Queen it was 'all right' after the referendum resulted in a victory for the No camp. 'The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying 'Your Majesty, it is all right, it's okay',' Mr Cameron said. 'That was something. She purred down the line.' Downing Street has already contacted Buckingham Palace to offer the Prime Minister's apologies and Mr Cameron has said he will say sorry in person when he next meets the Queen for one of his regular audiences. Asked whether he had given his apologies to the Queen about the incident yet, Mr Cameron told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'My office has already registered that very strongly with the Palace and I will do so in person when we next have our audience. 'But I think I have probably said enough about those audiences, so I won't say any more.' As the Prime Minister and Mr Bloomberg arrived for a press photo-opportunity last week, Mr Cameron smiled broadly as he recalled how he was able to tell the Queen it was 'all right' after the referendum resulted in a victory for the No camp.

'That was something. She purred down the line.' Asked whether he would leave Tory activists 'purring' when he addresses the party conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron told Sky News's Sunrise: 'That is a word which I'm going to avoid from now on.'","Prime Minister urges a return to imperial measurements in the classroom .

"A lucky sheepdog was saved from burning to death after a refuse worker spotted him among rubbish about to be thrown into a scorching hot 1,000C incinerator. Wensley, a Shetland sheepdog, became trapped in a bunker full of rubbish at a waste plant on Monday afternoon after going missing three days earlier. The dog was just seconds away from being thrown into the blistering heat with the rubbish when a crane worker spotted movement among the bin-liners and raised the alarm. Lucky escape: Shetland Sheepdog Wensley was moments away from being thrown in a incinerator along with household rubbish when a waste plant worker spotted moment in the bin-liners . Piping hot: The incinerator at Eastcroft waste plant in Nottingham heats up to 1,0000c . Missing: Wensley had disappeared from a park in West Bridgford, Nottingham, three days before he was discovered at the Eastcroft waste plant . Firefighters were called and lowered down the 40ft drop to rescue the one-year-old and reunite him with his grateful owners Dorothy and Roger Bladon. Wensley had been missing for three days after he ran off from Mrs Bladon when she was walking him in a park in West Bridgford, Nottingham. Mrs Bladon, 71, said yesterday: 'The more days that passed the more we thought we would never find him. Rescued: Firefighters were lowered down a 40ft drop to rescue Wensley, aged one, from the incinerator . 'I was absolutely delighted when I heard he had been found and I cannot quite believe what he has been through, he is so lucky.' Two fire crews and a specialist rescue team were called in for the rescue operation at the plant in Eastcroft, Nottingham. Firefighters reached a terrified Wensley at the bottom of the bunker, caught him in a net and hoisted him to safety. Nottinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service Station Manager Andy Lindley said: 'He was obviously very scared. 'We are all really pleased that he appears to be unharmed by the experience and that the RSPCA has managed to reunite him with his owner. He had a very lucky escape.' Mrs Bladon, who is from Liverpool, was visiting her son James Cousins when she decided to take Wensley for a walk in the park last Friday. She added: 'I just let him off the lead for an extra run and a spaniel that was in the field ran at him. He got nervous and darted off. 'The next morning I went around asking people if they had seen him but I couldn’t find him. I decided I’d probably never see him again. 'When the RSPCA called to say he’d been found and told me what had happened I was just saying ""thank you, thank you"".'

"House Speaker John Boehner lashed out at the Obama administration on Wednesday for issuing the latest in a long series of Affordable Care Act delays, giving prospective enrollees another half-month to signup for insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act website, healthcare.gov. 'What the hell is this, a joke?' an incredulous Boehner said during his regular Wednesday press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. He said the White House has been reduced to treating the law's March 31 regulatory deadline as a formality – 'another deadline rendered meaningless,'  he mocked – allowing weeks of extra time for Americans who claim they tried in earnest to sign up before the deadline. 'The dates are the dates, and the law is the law,' Boehner said, answering a reporter's question about why Americans shouldn't have more time. 'The president doesn't have the authority to change the law whenever he wants, which he continues to do.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Not impressed: House Speaker John Boehner castigated the White House for the latest in a long series of administrative changes to the 2009 Affordable Care Act during its rocky implementation . 'No, sir': Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told the House Ways and Means Committee on March 12 that Obamacare's March 31 deadline would not be extended, but the administration has done just that . March 31 was supposed to be a drop-dead, red-line date, creating a frenzy of activity among health insurance enrollment counselors in anticipation of financial penalties for those who don't comply . zzzzzzzzzz . 'Why don’t they just say, ""We've moved the date to April 15""? Because that's in effect what they’ve done,' Boehner said. 'The law says that enrollment stops at the end of March. That’s what the law says,' he said later, sticking up for Congress' part in the four-year-long Obamacare saga. 'I've got to live by the law. You've got to live by the law. The American people have got to live by the law. And guess what? The president needs to live by the law as well.' A source inside the Centers for . Medicare and Medicaid Services who is familiar with Tuesday's decision . told MailOnline that the agency has not determined what the new cutoff . date will be. But the . insider said that CMS was not likely to fix April 15 as the revised . zero-hour since it would coincide with the Internal Revenue Service's . deadline for individual income tax filings. Cries of hypocrisy rang out Tuesday night when the news was leaked, with some online commentators comparing the move to leaving Election Day polls open for extra days in order to accommodate people who claim they meant to vote on time. 'If Obamacare was a good law, the president wouldn't need to break the law nearly every week to implement it,' texas Sen. John Cornyn said. 'Rather than issue yet another extension, the president should admit his law does not work and waive Obamacare for all Americans. Once it’s repealed, we can work together to put health care reforms in place that empower, not limit, the consumer, provide more choices, and expand access to better care.' Health and Human Services Department spokeswoman Joanne Peters insisted in a schizophrenic statement that “[o]pen enrollment ends March 31,' but then added that HHS is 'experiencing a surge in demand and are making sure that we will be ready to help consumers who may be in line by the deadline to complete enrollment – either online or over the phone.' Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, in California for the state party's spring conference, mocked the latest delay and predicted it would have political consequences in November . White House spokesman Jay Carney hinted at the development last Friday, telling reporters during a daily briefing that the administration wanted ensure that 'people who are already in line can finish their enrollment.' An 11th-hour delay was treated as outside the realm of possibility just two weeks ago, however. During a March 12 congressional . hearing, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told Texas Republican Rep. Kevin Brady that there would be no such extensions. 'Are you going to delay the open enrollment beyond March 31?' Brady asked. 'No, sir,' she replied. On the same day, Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services – the agency charged with implementing the Obamacare law – told reporters that 'we have no plans to extend the open enrollment period' that began disastrously on October 1. 'In fact, we don't actually have the statutory authority to extend the open enrollment period in 2014,' she said. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services spokeswoman Julie Bataille told reporters two weeks ago that HHS doesn't have the legal authority to budge the open-enrollment zero hour into April . During the March 12 hearing before the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, chairman Dave Camp asked Sebelius if she agreed with that assessment. 'I haven’t seen their statements,' she replied, despite having been on the conference call, 'but there is no delay beyond March 31.' The Obama administration leaked the latest tactical shift after 8:00 p.m. Tuesday night while President Barack Obama was sleeping in Brussels, Belgium, and first lady Michelle Obama was beginning the day in Chengdu, China during part of a three-city tour. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus leapt into the political opening immediately, releasing a dismissive statement. 'Another day, another Obamacare delay from the same Obama administration that won't work with Republicans to help Americans suffering from the unintended consequences of the Democrats' failed healthcare law,' he said . 'Democrats in leadership may say they are doubling down on Obamacare but you have to wonder how many more unilateral delays their candidates running in 2014 can withstand.' The White House has struggled to enroll the 7 million Americans Sebelius has put forward as a goal. 'I think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014,' Sebelius said during an NBC News interview in September 2013. Later, the administration ratcheted that number down to 6 million, and lower still. If the nebulous targets were a series of goalpost-moving exercises, Tuesday's move will be seen as a sudden extension of Obamacare's game clock. The Washington Post reported that the extension past March 31 'will rely on an honor system,' requiring users only to check a blue box on the federal government's health insurance enrollment website to indicate that they made good-faith efforts to meet the original deadline. 'The government will not try to determine whether the person is telling the truth,' said the Post. Some states that are running their own online insurance marketplaces are expected to make similar arrangements, but others will not. Americans who aren't insured by the final, absolute deadline – a date that remains uncertain despite four years of planning and regulating – will face penalties in the form of new taxes on their income, unless that, too, is not strictly enforced. Boehner lashed out at Barack Obama for treating the March 31 deadline, a date prescribed by the Obamacare law's text, as a moveable suggestion instead of a red line . Once the Obama administration's open enrollment period is finally in the rear-view mirror, it will likely have to answer the thorny question of how many enrollees have actually begun their coverage by paying first-month's premiums. The White House has repeatedly declined to release that information, claiming the administration hasn't collected those statistics. But Rep. Camp and Ways and Means health subcommittee chairman Rep. Kevin Brady lobbed a broadside at Sebelius on Tuesday, saying they have 'new evidence' proving the contrary is true. “New evidence obtained by the Committee strongly suggests that the Administration knows who has enrolled and paid their first month’s premium,' the two Republican lawmakers wrote to the HHS secretary. 'In fact, there is specific information about who has paid their premium that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is collecting and using to make payments to insurers.' 'We have recently obtained information that suggests your most recent testimony before the Ways and Means Committee was at best evasive and perhaps misleading,' they charged, explaining that '[i]nsurers are submitting information to CMS about who has effectuated their enrollment, i.e., who has paid their premium.' 'Please provide this information in its most updated form immediately.'","The Health and Human Services Department is allowing Americans who use healthcare.gov to blow off the March 31 enrollment deadline .

"A man whose scrotum swelled to weigh more than 130lb has spoken of his relief after he had most of removed via surgery. Wesley Warren Jr.,from Las Vegas, drew international attention last year for the mass that made his day-to-day life a nightmare. But he is now recovering after a team of surgeons in California led by Dr Joel Gelman spent nearly 13 hours operating on the 48-year-old for free. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Surgery: Wesley Warren Jr., pictured before surgery, is recovering after his giant scrotum was removed . Discomfort: Warren could not urinate like a normal man and wore a hoodie for pants to conceal his enormous genitals . Mr Warren, who is staying at a . nursing home in Orange, California, said he can finally wear normal . underwear and pants, but he is not yet used to the dramatic change. 'My body is acclimatising,' he told ABC news. 'I'm still not able to get around much and enjoy driving or . going to dinner. But I intend to make up for it and treat myself to a . truly fabulous meal and enjoy relaxing for at least a few days.' He said he would like to enjoy a meal of scampi served over fettuccini with a rack of lamb - having been eating only vegetarian meals at the nursing home. 'It's all part of the pathetic life one has to deal with trying to recuperate from such a devastating handicap,' he said. 'I call Dr. Gelman my lifesaver, and I'm grateful to him and all those caring fans of 'The Howard Stern Show' that have supported me through this,' he said. 'I cannot express,' he added, with an emotional pause. 'Enough cannot be said.' On April 8, Gelman and three other . physicians cut away simultaneously on the grossly enlarged protective . sac of skin and muscles that contained Warren's testicles and penis, . according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. 'There are a lot of shows about . makeovers, but this is a real makeover,' Dr. Joel Gelman, who heads the . Center for Reconstructive Urology at the University of California, . Irvine, said of the procedure. 'He's basically a new man.' The mass caused by the condition, known as scrotal lymphedema, had grown to 132 pounds in less than two years. Warren, who has blood pressure problems and asthma, had previously spoken of his fear of dying during surgery. 'I'd say we put that fear to rest,' Gelman told the newspaper. The patient was hospitalized for two weeks, with one of those weeks spent in intensive care. The medical center told the Review Journal that he was able to get up, walk and start physical therapy within a week of surgery. Warren is now recuperating in housing near the hospital but it's not clear how long he'll have to stay in California. 'There is a lot of follow-up to do,' Gelman said. The Las Vegas man last year seemed to . be basking in the fame that his giant organ had brought him after an . initial interview with the Review Journal. It was even said the attention was . the reason he initially turned down Gelman's offer to perform the $1 . million corrective surgery because he would have had to give up the . rights to his story. A second doctor also agreed to waive . most of the cost for the procedure but Warren said he stalled because of . his fear of bleeding out on the operating table. The watermelon-size scrotum Warren . carried between his legs landed him on the Howard Stern Show and Comedy . Central and made him a local celebrity in his hometown. Firecracker Films, the company behind . 'Big Fat Gypsy Weddings' signed a contract to make a documentary about . him, which included the surgery. And he also shot a segment for TLC. When Warren spoke with a reporter for the Las Vegas Review-Journal in . October 2011, he became emotional as he described the pain and . humiliation of carrying the deformed genitals. He said he suffered from . deep bouts of depression and health complications. He had to wear a hooded sweatshirt on . his legs when he was out in public to contain his enormous scrotum. His . penis was buried so deeply in the abnormal growth that he was forced to . urinate on himself. He only wanted to urinate like a normal man and have a romantic relationship with a woman, he said. Warren claimed he was going public to . raise money so he could afford the operation -- which required the trip . to the special surgeon. 'I don't like being a freak, who would?' he told the Review-Journal. But his reaction to an offer he received from Dr Mehmet Oz, the celebrity physician whom Oprah made famous, was disturbing. Warren claimed the Dr Oz Show said it would pay for the entire surgery at a top-notch hospital. However, the show would keep exclusive rights to tell his story. He said he didn't take the TV program up on its offer because Howard Stern wanted him on his show again. But he also said the highly complicated surgery had him fearing he could die on the operating table. The . massive swelling is caused by fluid building up in his scrotum. Doctors . had to remove the excess tissue and then completely rebuild his . scrotum. There was . also a chance that complications could force the surgeons to cut off his . genitals if his scrotum didn't stop bleeding. 'I still haven't lost a patient or a testicle (in patients with problems similar to Warren's),' Gelman told the Review Journal. The extremely rare condition is much more common in Africa and Southeast Asia, where it is caused by parasites, than it is in the western world. Warren says he contracted it somehow when he hit his testicle with his own leg while turning in bed one morning but Gelman said he 'had no idea' how the man contracted it.","Wesley Warren Jr. drew international attention last year for the mass that made his day-to-day life a nightmare .

"Councillor Louise Hughes protest took her 30 miles across North Wales . By her own admission her feet were killing her by the end. But for Louise Hughes dragging a wheelie bin 30 miles across roads in North Wales to make a point was entirely worth it. The councillor is so incensed at plans to force residents into waiting three weeks for their rubbish to be collected that she took to the streets in protest. Yesterday she told bureaucrats that the majority of residents in Gwynedd, which includes the popular seaside resorts of Abersoch, Pwllheli and Barmouth, were against the proposals, as she presented a 5,000 name petition to a meeting of the full council. ‘The saying goes that you are never more than a few feet from a rat, but do we really want that to become a few inches?’ Councillor Hughes said. ‘I’ve walked about 30 miles across the county in the past few days – my feet are killing me, but it is worth it because this is a very serious issue. ‘Experts say there will be a huge increase in the rat population, their faeces and urine can produce very dangerous diseases. ‘Going to three weekly collections poses a real threat to public health.’ The plan to move from fortnightly to three weekly bin collections was rubber stamped by the Welsh Nationalist dominated cabinet, of the Plaid Cymru-run council in April. They will be the first local authority in Wales to move to three weekly collections when it comes into operation in October. The move follows Falkirk in Scotland last month and Bury, in Greater Manchester, which voted to do the same on Wednesday evening. Gwynedd claims the move is in response to tough targets from the Labour-run Welsh Government, which fines councils who dump too much waste in landfill sites, and will save them around £350,000 a year. But locals say they weren’t properly consulted and are ‘disgusted’ by the proposals, which they claim could see rotting rubbish left out on the streets for weeks on end. Waiting three weeks between rubbish collections posed a 'real threat to public health', Councillor Hughes said . They say the move will attract rats, see . seagulls scavenging around their homes and lead to a rise in fly . tipping. As many as 12 binmen could also be made redundant as a result . of the changes. Local businessman Gwyndaf Jones, 49, was among 20 locals who turned up outside Caernarfon council chamber to add his support for councillor Hughes’ protest yesterday. Waving a placard with the slogan ‘Syniad Sothach’ or ‘Rubbish Idea’ in Welsh, he said: ‘I’m very worried about the health risks. ‘We live close to terraced houses, with multiple occupants, and bin bags are already left out on the street for rats and seagulls to get at, that’s only going to get worse if we go to three weekly collections. ‘We’re just not getting value for money from our council tax.’ Another protestor, semi-retired nurse Mary Cartwright, 59, said: ‘We recycle, but there are some things that just have to go in the bin. ‘On a day like today (when it is hot) and our bins are full we have flies buzzing around already, so to have rotting food around for three weeks will be disgusting.’ About 5,000 residents of the Gwynedd region (pictured) signed a petition opposing the new collection times . Her husband, Jerry, 65, a retired Merchant Navy captain, added: ‘When I was a lad the binmen came around the back of my house, lifted the bins up onto their shoulders and carried them to be emptied. Now we have to lug our own bin around the front, then the binmen have a machine to pick up the bin and put it into the lorry – it’s all about health and safety isn’t it? We’re doing their job for them and then the council tax goes up. It’s madness.’ But leader of the council Dyfed Edwards denied the plans were simply about cost saving. ‘We are doing this to increase recycling,’ Councillor Edwards said. ‘Fifty per cent of the county’s population do recycle, but that means fifty per cent do not. ‘We have to change things.’ Last year Gwynedd Council narrowly avoided being fined more than £120,000 by the Cardiff administration for the amount of rubbish sent to landfill. It has been told it must recycle at least 52 per cent of all refuse collected from homes, increasing to 58 per cent by 2016.","North Wales councillor so angry at decision to reduce rubbish collections to every three weeks she drags wheelie-bin 30 miles across Wales in protest .

"One of Britain’s most notorious cyber criminals hacked into a prison computer system from inside jail – after he was allowed to join an IT class. Nicholas Webber, 21, jailed for five years in 2011 for masterminding a multi-million-pound internet crime site, triggered the security scare during a lesson. It is understood his actions caused ‘major panic’ but it is not clear what, if anything, he managed to access. Internet mastermind: Public schoolboy Nicholas Webber, pictured posing with piles of euros, was sentenced to 5 years in prison for his website GhostMarket that sold stolen credit card details . The prison, HMP Isis in South London, blamed his teacher, Michael Fox, who was employed by Kensington and Chelsea  College. He was banned from the prison but the college cleared him of committing any security breaches at a disciplinary hearing last March. However, he was made redundant when no alternative work could be found for him. On Friday, Mr Fox, from Bromley, Kent, began a claim for unfair dismissal, arguing that it wasn’t his decision to put Webber, the son of a former member of Guernsey’s parliament, in his class. He says he had no idea he was a hacker. At a hearing at Croydon Employment Tribunal, Mr Fox accused the college of not doing enough  to find him another job. ‘The perceived problem was there was a tutor who had been excluded by the prison and charged with allowing a hacking expert to hack into the prison’s mainframe,’ he said. Living a criminal high life: Webber used fraudulent credit cards details to pay for a penthouse at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, London . In a statement, the college’s business development director, Shanie Jamieson, said: ‘He [Mr Fox] did not feel he had done anything wrong as the student concerned was in his view a convicted computer hacker and should not have been allowed in his classroom.’ Mr Fox’s tribunal hearing was adjourned until April. A Prison Service spokesman confirmed Webber was involved in the incident but declined to answer questions about it. He said: ‘At the time of this incident in 2011 the educational computer system at HMP Isis was a closed network. No access to personal information or wider access to the internet or other prison systems would have been possible.’ The incident happened a year after the opening of the £110 million prison, which houses 18 to  24-year-olds. It has been beset by a series of technological problems caused by breakdowns in its cutting-edge biometric roll-call system where inmates have to leave an electronic thumbprint whenever they move from one part of the jail to another. Webber was only 17 when he created an internet forum for computer hackers with the potential to fleece up to £15 million from individuals and firms. He was arrested for using fraudulent credit card details to pay for a penthouse suite at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London. Exclusive boarding school: Nicholas Webber started his hacking activity at Bradfield College in Berkshire, where he deleted friends' detentions from school records . A court was told he set up GhostMarket after leaving £24,000-a-year Bradfield College, Berkshire, where he got into trouble for deleting friends’ detention records from the school computer. GhostMarket – dubbed a global ‘crimebook’ with 8,000 members worldwide – gave tips on how to create computer viruses, harvest credit card data and use it to pay for goods on eBay, as well as offering to sell details of 100,000 stolen credit cards. Police have documented £473,000 losses from 3,500 of the cards, but estimate they could have been used to steal £15 million. Webber, of Southsea, Hampshire, who once boasted online that he was ‘probably the most wanted cyber criminal just now’, also used stolen details to buy computers, video games, iPhones and iPods worth £40,000, and to pay for stays in luxury hotels.","Nicholas Webber, 21, was jailed for five years for running a criminal website .

"A shocked couple found a dead bird in their Tesco salad - after they had started tucking into dinner. James, 30, and Jasmine Watson, 32, of Yate, Gloucestershire, made the grisly find in a £1.50 bag of the supermarket's Babyleaf Rocket Salad when they began eating in dimmed light. The five-inch bird, which Tesco later identified as a Blackcap European warbler, was inside the salad which Mrs Watson had ordered from the supermarket’s website three weeks ago on January 30. Shocking: James, 30, and Jasmine Watson, 32, of Yate, Gloucestershire, made the grisly find in a bag of the supermarket's Babyleaf Rocket Salad when they began eating in dimmed light . The couple went into their local Tesco Extra store to complain - and a manager visited their home to remove the bird. The supermarket later apologised and offered a £200 gift card as compensation. But sales director Mr Watson wants to know how the bird ended up in the salad. He said: ‘We could not believe it. We stood there, completely amazed, for at least two minutes.’ He added: ‘We had the food delivery a couple of days before and then had gone out for a few drinks on the Friday evening. We came back and were preparing dinner in the kitchen. ‘My wife was cooking some scallops and steak and I prepared the salad. I opened the bag, tipped it into a salad bowl and cut up some other salad bits and put them on top. In the bag: The five-inch bird, which Tesco later identified as a Blackcap European warbler, was inside the salad which Mrs Watson had ordered from the supermarket’s website three weeks ago on January 30 . ‘Then I served the salad on some plates. We sat down at the breakfast bar and only had a few low lights on so we were effectively eating by candlelight. ‘I took three mouthfuls and then saw it. My first reaction was why have I got a soggy fishcake on my plate? But this was a full-size dead bird.’ Unable to contact Tesco's customer services, the couple went to the local Tesco Extra store that evening. The store manager visited their home the following day and removed the food. Since then, the firm has apologised and offered a £200 gift card by way of compensation. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘We were concerned to learn of this issue and have investigated thoroughly with our supplier. ‘Both we and our suppliers have robust . measures in place to prevent incidents such as this, and our salad . leaves go through complex filtering and washing systems. ‘We have been in contact with our . customer to reassure them how seriously we have taken this matter, and . offered them a gesture of goodwill.’ But Mr Watson said he had not been offered any explanation as to how the dead bird got into the salad bag. He added: ‘I want to know how it . happened. I would really like someone from Tesco to sit down and explain . me how an animal so large got into a bag of salad not so large. Order: The couple went into their local Tesco Extra store to complain - and a manager visited their home to remove the bird. The supermarket later apologised and offered a £200 gift card as compensation . 'If it was a maggot or something I could almost understand it, but how a whole bird was not picked up - I have just been gobsmacked by the whole thing. 'The magnitude of this was disgraceful. I find the offer of compensation a bit of an insult.’ The gruesome find comes after horsemeat was discovered in four products sold at Tesco. Tests . on beef products revealed positive results on Frozen Everyday Value . Burgers and Spaghetti . Bolognese, Frozen Quarterpounders and Flamehouse Frozen Chargrilled Quarterpounders. Another couple found a dead bird inside the same type of Tesco salad just 15 months ago. Paul Streeter and his vegetarian partner Julia Flynn, of Brinscombe, Somerset, found the bird after serving a portion of the salad on a plate. The four-inch long dark coloured bird's skeletal remains were among the leaves, which were bought from a store in Burnham-on-Sea. Tesco said at the time that it was investigating. A company spokesman could not immediately comment with any update on the probe today. Last December a mother preparing a stuffing mix opened a Tesco bag of herbs when a six-legged live praying mantis jumped out. Linda Hebditch, of Poole, Dorset, found the insect scurrying amongst the leaves imported from Israel in the 30g packet that cost 80p.","James, 30, and Jasmine Watson, 32, made grisly find in Gloucestershire .

Then, the soldier touched the nation’s hearts when, despite devastating injuries from a bomb in Afghanistan, he left hospital to attend the funeral of his best friend, who died in the blast. Now Mr James is keeping the promise he made to live life to the maximum, despite losing his right arm and right eye when the Taliban IED exploded in Helmand province in August 2009.

Five weeks after his death, Mr James, from Coventry, was wheeled into his friend's funeral service to pay his respects. Images . of the wounded soldier wrapped in bandages and carrying medical . equipment were shared around the world and became synonymous with the . sacrifice given by British soldiers throughout the bloody conflict.

Mr . James was 20 when he was blown up alongside other soldiers from the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, in Afghanistan. His comrade and best friend, Mr Bush, was killed trying to rescue platoon commander Sergeant Simon Valentine. He was taken to the military hospital at Camp Bastion for emergency surgery with a broken leg and severe burns. From there he was flown to the Critical Care Unit in Birmingham, before being sent to Headley Court, the military's medical rehabilitation centre in Surrey. He added: 'I don’t really remember it happening - it only took an instant. 'Although . I was awake at the time, I had so much adrenaline rushing through me . that the first thing I remember is my mates giving me morphine. 'I knew straight away that my arm was gone and I came to terms with it there and then . 'My eye didn’t go until I got back to Birmingham. I had 12 hours in Camp Bastion first. 'When I was blown up, the lads were pulling me along by my legs, but they didn’t know that my leg was broken when they did it.' Despite . requiring round-the-clock medical care, Mr James left hospital to attend . the funeral in Coventry in his military uniform. Miss Boyle (left) said she didn't know who her boyfriend was when they first met but remembers seeing photographs of him at his friend's funeral in 2009. The couple had a daughter, Evie, last year (right) Mr James said his way of honouring his friends and colleagues killed in conflict was to live life 'to the full' 'Love at first sight': From the moment she met the soldier, Miss Boyle says she knew she wanted to marry him . Wearing . an eye patch and carrying medical equipment to keep his burned skin . from falling apart, his image became a humbling symbol for sacrifice in . the Middle East. His . fiancee, Kellie Boyle, said she had no idea who he was when she first . met him in a nightclub four years ago, though described him as a 'hero'. 'We . met a couple of times and it was love at first sight. I started . chatting to him and I just knew he was the one,' said Miss Boyle. 'He told me what had happened to him in Afghanistan and I was amazed he was so calm about it all. 'I . remember seeing the pictures of him on the front pages of the paper . being wheeled into the cathedral but it never clicked that it was him. 'I hadn't put a name to the face and didn't know much about him or what had happened.' The couple, who have a daughter, Evie, live together in Coventry with Miss Boyle's son, Brandon. 'He is so amazing, he is very brave and the way he deals with it is incredible. He tries to live life to the full and he is an inspiration. 'To do what he does and the way he always tries to help other people despite what happened to him is amazing. He is my hero. 'Tom . says he actually feels lucky that he was injured in the bomb because he . survived when others didn't and he met me soon afterwards. 'I've never met anyone with such a positive outlook,' she added. After struggling to find work, Mr James now works for a charity which raises money for wounded servicemen and women. Tears for a hero: Fusilier Bush's Sister Hannah (left), girlfriend Amy Taggart and brother Lewis at the service . The 25-year-old lost his right arm, right eye and several fingers in the explosion in Afghanistan five years ago . More than 1,000 mourners attended the funeral of his friend, Shaun Bush, in Coventry in 2009 (pictured) Mr James said he did what 'anyone else would have done' in attending the service and plans to live life to the full to honour those killed in combat . He is a keen golfer and regularly takes part in fundraising tournaments across the country. Speaking of returning to 'normal' life, Mr James said: 'At first it was very hard and everything was completely different. 'At that point, I was still in the army. When I got out, I thought ‘right, it’s time to knuckle down and get a job’. 'I applied for around 200 jobs - and they weren't rocket science, just ordinary jobs. I got none of them. 'Because of my disabilities, civilian employers wouldn't touch me.' 'I’d never played golf before I got injured, but sport has always been a big part of my life. 'Golf is the only sport in which disabled and able-bodied people can have a competitive game together. 'I had to learn to play with just one arm, and I’m now on a handicap of 26 now, which isn't too bad.'","Fusilier Tom James lost his right eye, arm and several fingers in combat .

"Executed: Jose Villegas was put to death Wednesday for killing his ex-girlfriend, her son and her mother, 13 years ago . A man convicted of fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend, her young son and her mother 13 years ago at a home in Corpus Christi was executed by Texas prison officials Wednesday. The lethal injection of Jose Villegas, 39, was carried out after his attorneys unsuccessfully argued to the U.S. Supreme Court that he was mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty.p . 'I would like to remind my children once again I love them,' Villegas said when asked if he had a statement before being put to death. 'Everything is OK. I love you all, and I love my children. I am at peace.' Just as the pentobarbital began taking effect, he said, 'It does kind of burn. Goodbye.' He gasped several times, then started to breathe quietly. Within less than a minute, all movement had stopped. Villegas was pronounced dead at 7:04pm CDT, 11 minutes after the lethal dose of the sedative began. He became the seventh prisoner executed this year in the nation's most active death penalty state. Six relatives of his victims witnessed the execution but declined to comment afterward. 'I was struck by the calm and peacefulness inside that room as opposed to the utter terror the victims must have been in as Jose Luis Villegas stabbed them,' Mark Skurka, the Nueces County district attorney who prosecuted Villegas, said after watching the execution. 'He made no attempt to make peace with the family, apologize to the family or show any remorse for taking the lives of three people,' Skurka said. 'The family expressed to me that they are glad that this is finally over and that justice has finally been done, even though it took a very long time in their minds for this to happen.' Villegas' lawyers filed a last-day appeal asking the Supreme Court to stop his punishment, saying testing in February showed he had an IQ of 59. The high court denied it several hours later, slightly delaying the punishment. Four of the nine justices indicated in the brief court order that they would have given him a reprieve. The Supreme Court has prohibited execution of mentally impaired people, although states have been allowed to devise procedures to make their own determinations. Courts also have embraced scientific studies that consider a 70 IQ a threshold for impairment, and the high court justices are reviewing a Florida law stipulating that number for death penalty eligibility. The Texas Attorney General's office disputed the IQ finding, saying previous examinations of Villegas showed no mental impairment and the number cited in his appeal was based on testing after he received an execution date and had no incentive to do well on the test. State attorneys also argued his lawyers had 10 years to raise impairment claims but didn't do so until days before his scheduled punishment. Villegas was convicted of fatally stabbing Erida Salazar, 23, her 3-year-old son, Jacob, and Salazar's mother, Alma Perez, 51, in January 2001. Their bodies were discovered by Salazar's father when he returned home after being excused from jury duty. Each had been stabbed at least 19 times. Villegas, a former cook, dishwasher and laborer, was free on bond for a sexual assault charge and was supposed to go on trial the day of the killings for an incident in which a woman said he punched her in the face. Police spotted Villegas driving Salazar's stolen car and he led them on a chase that ended with him on foot and urging officers to shoot him. When arresting him, police found three bags of cocaine in his baseball cap. Following his conviction for capital murder, Villegas was convicted of two counts of indecency with a child related to the daughter of the woman he was accused of punching in the face prior to the slayings. Relatives have said Salazar's mother had urged her daughter to break up with Villegas when she learned of the sex charges against him. Villegas also had convictions for making terroristic threats to kill women, burglary and possessing inhalants. Attorneys argued the slayings were not intentional and Villegas was mentally ill. A defense psychiatrist testified Villegas experienced 'intermittent explosive disorder,' a condition that led to uncontrollable rages. Villegas became the third Texas inmate executed with a new stock of pentobarbital from a provider corrections officials have refused to identify, citing the possibility of threats of violence against the supplier. The Supreme Court has upheld that stance.

"A Texas man dramatically turned the tables on two bank robbery suspects who had abducted him and his wife on Thursday, by pulling a gun on the duo and shooting them both, killing one. According to KHOU, the unnamed couple were targeted by brothers Jordan, 20, and Preston Kutach, 21, who knew that the woman worked at the First National Bank of Eagle Lake in Columbus, near Houston. The suspects kidnapped the couple at gunpoint in their own home, then made them drive to the bank where they forced the woman to withdraw cash. But then her husband struck back with deadly force. Scroll down for video . Terror: After kidnapping the couple in their own home the suspects forced the woman to withdraw money from the First National bank where she worked . Counter attack: After the husband fired back, officers responded to a 911 call and found both suspects lying on the ground near the truck suffering from gunshot wounds . Columbus County Sheriff's Sgt. Andrew Weido told KHOU that once the brothers had stolen an undisclosed amount of money they forced the husband to drive south on Route 71. It was then that the husband grabbed a gun that he had hidden in his truck and fired at the suspects, who were both residents of Rock Island, Texas. The man is reportedly a reserve officer with the local sheriff's department. Officers who responded to a 911 call found both suspects lying on the ground near the truck suffering from gunshot wounds. Fightback: The suspected kidnappers had forced the husband to drive south on Route 71 when he reached for the gun in his truck . Support: 'It's very positive to a community to hear that the good guy does win in the end,' local resident Evan Mullins said . The brothers were taken to different hospitals, where 21-year-old Preston was pronounced dead. Jordan remained hospitalized in critical condition over the weekend. Those who know the couple said that the community has their back. 'I'm sure that they're both going to be upset for a while,' resident Brenda Buehler said. 'It's a frightening thing to have happen, but I think everybody's going to tell them good job.'

"A 75-year-old woman was found dead and hogtied in her Georgia apartment, police have revealed. Florene Duke's grandchildren went in search of her on Monday after being unable to reach her for hours. Horrified, they found her lifeless body at the property in Douglas County at 6pm, and saw her TV had vanished. Killed: Florene Duke, 75, (pictured in her apartment earlier this year) was found dead and tied like a hog in her apartment by her granddaughter who couldn't get hold of her by phone. Two televisions were also missing . Police are now working to determine how she was killed and what the killer's motive was. Duke's grandson, Chris Duke, told WSBTV: 'I didn't believe it because my grandma wouldn't hurt a fly. 'She got a little dog and she just walked her dog every day; about twice a day and just sat on the couch and watched TV. 'They need to be off the street, whoever did this.' His grandmother had lived alone in the apartment for five years, Chris Duke explained. She was last seen alive at 9am on Monday. Shocked: Relatives say she looked after everybody in the neighborhood and police cannot find a motive . Douglasville police Chief Chris Womack told The AJC: 'The family member went through there and said they saw a couple of TVs missing,' gesturing to a window. 'From everyone we've talked to, from neighbors and family, [she] was like everybody's granny, that always took care of everybody, that would let people come in and stay with her if they didn't have a place to stay, so it's just senseless,' he said.

"Relations between the U.S. and Russia appeared to be as icy as ever Tuesday, as President Barack Obama attended a summit in Beijing alongside Vladimir Putin. The President of Russia was photographed sinisterly smirking at Mr Obama as the two arrived at a special session of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation on Tuesday. Putin also tried to make small talk with the Leader of the Free World, noting how beautiful the convention center where the summit was being held was, in English. 'Yes,' Obama coldly replied, according to journalists who witnessed the scene. Scroll down for video .

Can't take my eyes off of you: President Obama and Putin steal a glance at one another . Up close and personal: Putin enjoys a nice cold beverage while getting close to President Obama . The bumbling exchange comes just months after President Obama warned Putin directly, not to continue intervening in the turmoil in neighboring Ukraine, a warning that Putin did not heed. Sources say the pair actually spoke several times at the summit, but at no point delved into any of the issues that divide them. This week's conference has been filled with endless international relations entertainment, including strange Star Trek-style outfits the world leaders wore for a group photo. 'Obama wearing Star Trek jacket in China? Someone please beam him up,' wrote Steve Miller on Twitter. Jami_USA added: 'Is this a new Star Trek Episode?' However, AFP journalist Katy Lee pointed out that the APEC has a 'rich tradition' in dressing its members traditional clothing of the country holding the summit. 'Important to remember Obama's suit is part of rich tradition of flamboyant APEC fashion. See Kerry, 2013,' she wrote, referring to the Balinese 'endek' woven shirt worn by Secretary of State John Kerry and leaders attending the summit in Indonesia last year.

Star Trek: When the official photograph of the event was beamed around the world, many thought they better resembled the likes of Spock of Captain Kirk from the hit television and film franchise . Meanwhile at the shoot, U.S. president Barack Obama appeared in no mood to break the ice with his Russian counterpart, and even looked away when the two crossed paths. Putin took centre stage at the official photocall, placed at the middle of leaders next to Chinese president and event host Xi Jinping. Mr Obama, however, was left wedged between the wife of Indonesia's president and South Korea's leader, Park Geun-Hye, on the periphery of the photograph. When the photograph was taken and the heads of state filed off stage, Obama seemed to turn his head as Putin came past, rather than catch his eye. The two leaders last met in June, when they exchanged a few words during a ceremony in France marking the D-Day invasion anniversary. Meet and greet: Then came Barack Obama's turn to receive the compliment . With Russia-West ties at their lowest point since the Cold War, amid the dispute over Ukraine, the strain in their personal relations was clearly visible. And, as these pictures show, today was no different. However, Putin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, has said that no meeting has been set but that Putin and Obama have 'a good chance' to meet on the sidelines. Ushakov emphasized that Putin wasn't shunning such a meeting. In Washington, White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice said that while there were no plans for a formal meeting between Obama and Putin, 'I wouldn't be at all surprised if they had some informal communication.'

"It may snow on Venus - although it will be snow composed of carbon dioxide, or 'dry ice'. The European Space Agency's Venus Express satellite has spied a surprisingly cold region high in the planet’s atmosphere that may be frigid enough for carbon dioxide to freeze out as ice or snow. The planet Venus is well known for its thick, carbon dioxide atmosphere and oven-hot surface, and as a result is often portrayed as Earth’s inhospitable evil twin. But in a new analysis based on five years of observations using ESA’s Venus Express, scientists have uncovered a very chilly layer at temperatures of around -175C in the atmosphere 125 km above the planet’s surface. The curious cold layer is far frostier than any part of Earth’s atmosphere, for example, despite Venus being much closer to the sun. Scroll down for video . Cosmic flyby: The Venus Express, pictured here in an artist's impression, is a European Space Agency (ESA) mission to study the atmosphere and plasma environment of Venus from orbit . The discovery was made by watching as light from the Sun filtered through the atmosphere to reveal the concentration of carbon dioxide gas molecules at various altitudes along the terminator – the dividing line between the day and night sides of the planet. Armed with information about the concentration of carbon dioxide and combined with data on atmospheric pressure at each height, scientists could then calculate the corresponding temperatures. 'Since the temperature at some heights dips below the freezing temperature of carbon dioxide, we suspect that carbon dioxide ice might form there,' sayid Arnaud Mahieux of the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy and lead author of the paper. Clouds of small carbon dioxide ice or snow particles should be very reflective, perhaps leading to brighter than normal sunlight layers in the atmosphere. 'However, although Venus Express indeed occasionally observes very bright regions in the Venusian atmosphere that could be explained by ice, they could also be caused by other atmospheric disturbances, so we need to be cautious,' says Dr Mahieux. The study also found that the cold layer at the terminator is sandwiched between two comparatively warmer layers. 'The . temperature profiles on the hot dayside and cool night side at . altitudes above 120 km are extremely different, so at the terminator we . are in a regime of transition with effects coming from both sides. 'The . night side may be playing a greater role at one given altitude and the . dayside might be playing a larger role at other altitudes.' Venus, as pictured by the Venus Express, has curious clouds in its atmosphere which may be cold enough to lead to carbon dioxide snow . Temperature ranges: ESA spotted an anomolous cold region in the clouds of Venus, 140km above the surface . Similar temperature profiles along the terminator have been derived from other Venus Express datasets, including measurements taken during the transit of Venus earlier this year. Models are able to predict the observed profiles, but further confirmation will be provided by examining the role played by other atmospheric species, such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen and oxygen, which are more dominant than carbon dioxide at high altitudes. 'The finding is very new and we still need to think about and understand what the implications will be,' says Håkan Svedhem, ESA’s Venus Express project scientist. 'But it is special, as we do not see a similar temperature profile along the terminator in the atmospheres of Earth or Mars, which have different chemical compositions and temperature conditions.'","Temperatures of -175C in high atmosphere suggests carbion dioxide 'snow' on Venus .

"An Indiana mother high on drugs kidnapped her daughter during a supervised visit, placed the child on her lap, and led police on a high-speed chase with the woman's car reaching 75 miles per hour at times during the 7-mile chase. Aubrey Coy, 34, of Syracuse, took her five-year-old daughter during the visit in Warsaw, Indiana. After she kidnapped her daughter, police there were able to locate her in St. Joseph's County, Michigan, just across the border from Indiana using signals from her mobile phone. Kosciusko County police then notified the Michigan State Police. Once the police in Michigan spotted her driving along a road in White Pigeon, a state trooper pulled her over. Scroll down for video .

Even after other state troopers arrived at the scene, Coy refused to give up control of her daughter . In a shocking video taken from the dashcam on the police cruiser, the officer is seen trying to open the driver's side door. All of a sudden, Coy pulls away and the chase begins. 'He asked her to step out of the car and at that point she told him that ""He wasn't going to take her child,""' Detective Sergeant Todd Petersen of the Michigan State Police, White Pigeon Detachment, told WNDU. 'She put it in gear and took off, so the trooper initiated the pursuit.' During the chase, Coy is seen in the video weaving through traffic.

The officer and the mother struggle briefly, and the woman then gently falls to the ground. Later on in the video, as other officers are on the scene, she is still struggling with the officers and holding her child. 'She came to a stop...then attempted to jump out of the car with the child in her arms and run,' Petersen said. ""She kind of fell into the roadway and that's when the trooper that was in pursuit of her grabbed on to her. It was a prolonged 2 to 3 minutes to get the child away from her because she had her arms and was squeezing so tightly -- they didn't want to hurt the child.' He also backed the trooper's decision to chase Coy. 'At that point you have another jurisdiction saying she kidnapped her daughter and now is in another state,' Petersen said. 'How do you let that child go with that person and she takes her somewhere and does something to her? I think it was necessary to pursue.' Police found cocaine in the car.

"The judge who requested Jerry Sandusky be freed on $100,000 unsecured bail, undertook volunteer work for the retired American football coach’s charity, according to reports. District Judge Leslie Dutchcot, who previously volunteered for The Second Mile charity, ruled that the former Pennsylvania State University defensive coordinator be freed without posting any bail money unless he doesn't arrive for court. Her decision overruled a bid by prosecutors, who requested a $500,000 bail be set for the 67-year-old and for him to be fitted with a leg monitor, after being charged with 21 felony counts for alleged sexual abuse.

Meanwhile, over the weekend . Sandusky’s former daughter-in-law obtained a legal order barring the . ex-Penn State coach from seeing three of his grandchildren. Jill Jones was once married to Matt . Sandusky, 33, who is one of six now adult children that the former coach . and his wife Dorothy adopted through The Second Mile charity. Ms Jones went to court to stop the . accused paedophile from having access to their two daughters, aged nine . and seven, and one son, five, according to documents. Despite Sandusky’s wife Dorothy . trying to persuade Ms Jones that the children would be safe around her . husband, Ms Jones successfully obtained a restraining order forbidding . the children from sleeping over at their grandparents’ home and banning . Sandusky from seeing them unsupervised. There is no record however, of Ms Jones ever accusing her ex-father-in-law of abusing her children. Her former husband Matt was adopted . by the Sandusky’s in 1995 after having a trouble childhood during which . he had burnt down a barn. It has been reported that Matt . attempted suicide just four months after first going to live with the . couple, after being placed by Children and Youth Services at the . Sandusky family’s request. The probation officer, Terry Trude, . became concerned about Matt's well-being and mental health and together . with his biological mother Debra Long, wrote a letter to Centre County . Judge David Grine asking for his living situation to be reviewed, the . Patriot-News reported. Minnesota Republican Michele Bachman yesterday said that she would ‘beat Jerry Sandusky to a pulp’ if he had abused any of her children. The mother-of-five biological children, who has also raised 23 foster children over the years, said on NBC’s  Meet the Press segment that ‘justice will be done’ now that the Sandusky case has received national coverage. The presidential candidate said: ‘This is so horrific on the level of a parent. I think about my children – if that was my child – and I think my automatic reaction would be – even though I’m a small woman – I’d want to go find that guy and beat him to a pulp. ‘I think that’s what any parent would want to do when they think that about their child’, Fox news reported. However contemporary court records . include a letter written by Matt in which he implores the judge to allow . him to stay with the family. 'I would like to be placed back with . the Sanduskys. I feel that they have supported me even when I have . messed up. They are a loving caring group of people. I love both my . biological family and the Sandusky family,' he wrote at the time. Matt is not one of the eight victims . in the Grand Jury indictment, but he did testify before the . investigative panel at the attorney general’s office in the Strawberry . Square complex, Harrisburg,  the Patriot-News reported. Two of Matt’s adopted siblings followed their father into the world of football: Edward Joel, 41, a former Nittany Lions player, and now a football coach at West Chester University and Jon, who is Director of Player Personnel for the Cleveland Browns. Last week, Jon went on a leave of absence from the NFL club as the scandal involving his father exploded into the public domain. He and his wife, Kia, have an infant son. Over the years the Sanduskys also became the parents to Ray, now 46, a photographer and woodturner living in Brentwood, Tennesee, Kara, 38, a Penn State graduate, and Jeff, 35, a former Marine. In Sandusky's 2000 memoir titled 'Touched', Kara, named Sandusky Werner, wrote in the introduction: 'We were always proud of the things he did for kids.' On his website, Ray writes: 'I have always been creative and constructive. I can recall painting meaningful images as a child in kindergarten, throwing clay vessels on a wheel in junior high school and performing all manner of assembly and repairs around the house.' Last week saw people who believed they knew Sandusky come forward to express their shock at the allegations. 'A lot of people look at him as a monster now,' Kip Richeal, who co-authored Touched, told ESPN. 'I would've never, ever thought something like this about him. And how long did it go on? It never happened with me. When I met him, though, I was 18. I wasn't a little boy. 'If this is all true, and it looks like it's really stacking up, something took over his personality. Something changed, and it's not the Jerry I know.' Meanwhile ex-NFL player Jon Ritchie, who knew Sandusky since he was a 14-year-old, said on ESPN: 'I thought he was the most compassionate, altruistic, selfless man on the face of the planet. 'There were always kids around, Second Mile kids (the charity Sandusky set up and allegedly picked his victims from). 'And these tragedies that are coming out now have brought sports, have brought everyone, to the darkest place. I can’t fathom sports right now. I don’t even care about sports right now. Because this picture of what I thought was good has exploded.'

"Few countries can compete with the UK when it comes to television costume dramas .  .  . but American audiences, it seems, prefer our dramas without the costumes. A raunchy alternative version of the ten-part BBC1 series The White Queen has been created for screening in the US – including graphic sex and nude scenes which don’t appear here. The independent production company behind the medieval drama came up with two ‘edits’ – one for the BBC and the other for US cable Channel Starz, the company behind Spartacus and Da Vinci’s Demons. Raunchy: An alternative version of the ten-part BBC1 series The White Queen has been created for screening in the US - including graphic sex and nude scenes which don¿t appear here . Different: The production company behind the medieval drama came up with two 'edits'. This shows how the US version goes further than the BBC version above . Bedroom scenes in which actors appear in the BBC version partly clothed are sexed-up for the American market – and the actors complete the scenes naked. As lead actor Max Irons put it:  ‘There’s the BBC cut and the Starz cut. You get a lot more a*** in the Starz version – the cameras kept rolling after the BBC stopped the scene.’ The Mail on Sunday has seen the first three episodes of the US version – dubbed The Blue Queen – and can confirm the American version is more stripper than bodice ripper. In episode two, broadcast by the BBC on June 23, Queen Elizabeth, played by Rebecca Fergusson, was seen wearing a nightdress for her love scene with Edward IV, played by Irons. Cheeky:  Max Irons revealed only his naked chest to UK audiences. But in the U.S they see a good deal more of actor . But when the clinch is broadcast on American television later this summer, the same actress will be shown first topless and then completely naked in the marital bed. Several other passionate encounters are entirely missing from the BBC version, including one involving the King’s treacherous brother George, played by David Oakes, and new wife Isobel, played by Eleanor Tomlinson. The scene, which appears in episode two of the American series, includes a shot of the Duke’s naked bottom. Young actress Faye Marsay, who plays Anne Neville, has also spoken of the steamy scenes. ‘I looked at them and went “wow”,’ she said, ‘because it’s my first job and I’ve never done them before, but it’s important to the story.’ Steamy: There is no mistaking the passion between the King and Queen Elizabeth. In this scene from the BBC version, she is fully dressed . Passion: However, in the US version, the actress is completely topless . Episodes one, two and three of the . American version all contain nudity and the first programme includes at . least four shots of the Queen’s breasts and a scene showing her younger . sister topless in a bath. By contrast, the BBC version doesn’t include any nudity until episode three, and even then only fleetingly. One of the biggest contrasts between the two versions involves the King and Queen’s first night of passion in a hunting lodge in episode one. The BBC version contains no full nudity as a shirtless King starts to undress his wife before they make love in the marital bed. The scene ends when the King rises from the bed, telling his wife: ‘I must wash.’ One of Lady Elizabeth's younger sisters can be seen in the bath, with British audiences not seeing too much flesh . Revealing: But in the US version, viewers get to see a whole lot more . Instead, Americans will see a . five-second shot of the Queen topless and a shot of a naked King as he . walks down to the lake to wash. In the BBC’s episode two, the King . begins to undress his wife again and asks her: ‘How is it that I have . allowed you to wear so many clothes. Star: Elizabeth Woodville played by Rebecca Ferguson . 'What is the point of being King if I . cannot keep you naked all day?’ Yet the Queen remains clad in a . nightdress as the scene ends with a topless King climbing into bed with . her. American viewers, however, will see a love scene which features prolonged shots of the Queen’s breasts and the King’s naked bottom. The White Queen, based on a series of bestselling historical novels by Philippa Gregory, is a co-production between the BBC and Starz. Costume drama can cost as much as £1 million an hour to produce and co-productions between different broadcasters are nothing new. But it is rare that versions of the same show can be so radically different. A spokesman for the BBC said that Company Pictures, which produced the film for the BBC and Starz, created two versions to meet the broadcasters’ differing requirements. She said the BBC was delighted with the success of its Sunday night drama and had no idea what was in the American version. Starz, one of America’s most successful subscription channels, bills the drama as a ‘sizzling’ tale of ‘love and lust’ which follows the fortunes of three women ‘who seduce their way’ on to the English throne.","Raunchy version of BBC1 series The White Queen created for the US .

"The firebrand Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne said he has received death threats. It comes after reports Numan Haider, 18, who was shot dead after he allegedly stabbed two police officers on Tuesday night, is believed to have attended some of the cleric's lectures. Police believe Haider's failed murder plot was in response to a murderous call out by the Islamic State who, just hours before, urged its followers to kill Australians 'in any manner', The Australian reports. Scroll down for video . The teenage terror suspect shot dead by police in Melbourne is believed to have attended lectures led by firebrand Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne . The 18-year-old, who was once a member of radical Melbourne-based Muslim group, Al-Furqan, that was the target of police terrorism raids back in 2012, is understood to have radicalised within a matter of weeks. He is said to have attended lectures at the Al-Furqan Islamic Centre in Springvale by radical Perth -born preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne earlier this year. Thorne, who was filmed in front of an Islamic State flag urging people like Haider to show their 'might' against non-followers, took aim at police in a fiery Facebook statement on Wednesday night. 'He was murdered in cold blood, right in front of a police station, in front of a place that is supposed to be providing security and comfort to our youth,' Thorne told his social media followers. 'This boy was a normal good practicing (sic) young Muslim youth, with great character and kind moral. 'He was an average normal youth who spent his time hanging out with his friends, attending local mosques, and doing what every other youth does. 'Allah please accept him as a Shaheed (martyr) and have mercy on him.' The extremist's rants, which often include controversial comments about Australia, have attracted support from high school teens and university students online across the country. On Thursday, Thorne said he was 'on the way to police station to report death threats from Australians in Australia.' 'It would be very interesting to see how they respond.' Thorne, whose brother was jailed for terrorism related offences in Saudi Arabia, also yesterday accused police of cancelling Haider's passport for no reason and claimed authorities raided the teenager's home in Narre Warren without a warrant before he was shot. Before his death, Haider's Facebook page contained posts not dissimilar to Thorne. He posted a photo of himself on Facebook in military attire holding an Islamic State flag saying: 'Let's not put the focus on other things. The main message I'm sending with these statuses and photos is to the dogs of the Australian Federal Police and ASIO who are declaring war on Islam and Muslims'. Numan Haider, who was once a member of radical Melbourne-based Muslim group Al-Furqan that was the target of police terrorism raids back in 2012, is understood to have radicalised within a matter of weeks . Thorne, who has reportedly claimed to have memorised the Koran by age six, has recently made a number of controversial statements about Australia. Last Thursday, he issued a statement labelling the Australian government 'the real terrorists', following the largest ever counter-terrorism raids in the nation's history. He said the Australian government wants to 'destroy Islam by any means... closing down Islamic centres, raiding Muslim houses, arresting active Muslim youth and preachers, intimidating Muslims cancelling their passports... and creating a vibe of fear within the Australian community to make them afraid of Muslims'. In August, he posted to Facebook saying scholars who support the Islamic State terror group are 'on the front lines, in the battlefields, backing their words with actions'. He told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday it was a 'time of grief for us Muslims' following the shooting death of Haider in Melbourne. Thorne, who was filmed in front an Islamic State flag urging people like Haider to show their 'might' against non-followers, took aim at police in a fiery Facebook statement on Wednesday night . Thorne's Facebook page contains controversial posts, including claims police murdered Haider in 'cold blood'. The posts are being liked and shared by Australian high school and university students . His comments came as moderate Muslim leader Dr Jamal Rifi warned that the country must allow the authorities time to finish their investigations into the Tuesday night's stabbing. Justice Minister Michael Keenan praised the officers' 'bravery' and 'dedication' in a press conference on Wednesday morning. Mr Keenan said the police appeared to have acted in self-defence against a 'known terror suspect'. 'This incident occurred during a police investigation and it appears that the shooting by the police officer was in self-defence.' Victorian Premier Denis Napthine praised the officers. He said any death is 'tragic', irrespective of the circumstances, and that his thoughts were with the family of the deceased . Police take bags of evidence away from the scene of Tuesday night's incident . A crime scene was established near the Endeavour Hills Police Station . Prime Minister Tony Abbott described the attack  as 'fierce'. In a video statement, Mr Abbott said: 'Obviously this indicates there are people in our community who are capable of very extreme acts.' The Islamic Council of Victoria has called for a 'full and objective investigation' into how the incident came about so 'such a tragedy is never repeated'. Ghaith Krayem, the organisation's Secretary, said in a statement the organisation felt 'deep sorrow' about 'last night's tragic events'. 'Events that, on face value, should not have cost a young man his life and put two police officers in hospital. 'Our focus, at this time, is on supporting the family of the young man; ensuring that their needs are catered for.' Mr Krayem said the incident showed the 'real cost of a failure to deal with these serious issues which is why we have made numerous calls on the Australian government to deal with the root causes of alienation and disaffection of people such as this.' He said no one should try to 'inflame' the situation and 'everyone should be calling for calm'.","Firebrand Islamic preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne accused police of murdering Numan Haider in 'cold blood'

"An award-winning reporter has revealed how he fantasized about killing a former neighbour who had brutally raped him when he was seven. David Holthouse, 41, meticulously planned the murder and how he would get away with it - until his mother came across his childhood diary and revealed she finally knew about the abuse. Holthouse said at that point he was forced to give up on the killing as his motive for murder was revealed - so he enacted a different type of revenge: Publishing a story about the violent attack. He first shared the story about his desire for revenge in a 2004 article for the Denver Westword, and it was featured on This American Life. The story is now being turned into a play in New York. Scroll down for video . Struggle: David Holthouse has revealed how he was 'obsessed' with murdering his rapist 10 years ago . Speaking to ABC News, Holthouse said that murdering the man had just 'felt like the right thing to do'. 'I arrived at a point in my mind where it seemed to me that murder was entirely . rational, justifiable and even a morally responsible course of action,' he said. Innocent: He was just seven (pictured) when he was raped by the family friend, who was 17 . He recalled how he was abused when his family lived in Anchorage, Alaska and were having dinner with their best friends, who had a son - a high school football player - ten years older than Holthouse. One night in 1978, the parents were chatting and drinking wine, when the 17-year-old took David to his room in the basement, saying he would teach him some karate moves. But the older boy soon backed him into a corner, where Holthouse fell to his knees. At that point, the teenager forced him to give him oral sex before pushing the young boy to his bed. Holthouse sobbed through the pain, not knowing what had happened. The older boy told him never to tell anyone about the attack. 'Part of it was I didn't really have a . firm concept of what had happened,' he told ABC. 'Nobody ever . talked to me about sex or rape... I didn't have the words . to apply to it... It was easier to keep quiet.' In the following years, the older boy taunted him, grabbing his crotch when Holthouse was around as if he would attack him again. As he researched rape as a teenager, . he learned about the cycle of abuse and feared he would become a . pedophile. He decided to kill himself if he ever felt those feelings . emerge. Attacker: He said he looked up to the football star, who he has never named, but was left in fear of him . 'I felt like a werewolf had bitten me and it was only a matter of time before the full moon rose,' he wrote in his article. Following . college, Holthouse became a reporter and the job sent him across the . country before he eventually reached Denver, Colorado. His . mother revealed that the man - who she did not know had raped her son - . was living there too with his wife and children. Holthouse feared he . could be victimising them and knew he had to stop it. He . began stalking the man and learning his habits and routes. He bought an . untraceable gun and planned to shoot him in the crotch and then the . head during one of the man's late-night walks. Confused: Holthouse, with his mother, said he did not understand what had happened and told no one . Suffering in silence: It meant he believed he could get away with killing the man without becoming a suspect. Holthouse, pictured as a child, decided to murder the man when he learned he had moved nearby . Holthouse reasoned that because never told anyone about the abuse 'there was nothing in recent history to connect me to him,' and he would not be caught. But just ten days after buying the gun, he received a call from his mother. She had found his childhood diary and read about his horrific rape, which he had written about when he was 11. 'I know now that what he did to me is rape,' the entry wrote. 'I wonder what will happen when I grow up and see him when I am grown up. Will I smile and shake his hand and pretend nothing happened? Or will I punch him in the face? His mother immediately wrote to the family telling them that their son was a monster, and Holthouse said he was forced to call off the murder because he now had a motive. Sadness: But his mother called him after she found a childhood diary where he had written about the rape . But the following year, he wrote to his attacker and said they should meet. 'I don't want your blood or your money,' he wrote. 'Just one uncomfortable conversation.' The rapist agreed to meet him and Holthouse went armed with a gun and a tape recorder. The man told Holthouse that he had been his only victim. 'I've thought 100 times about contacting . you in the last 20 years to tell you that, and I just never had the . courage to pick up the phone,' he said as they met. 'I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you and . my parents and your parents.' Holthouse, who had been writing a story about his ordeal, decided that there was a chance the man was telling the truth, so he decided not to print his name. When the story was printed and aired . on This American Life, rape victims from across the country contacted . him to thank him. It was also heard by the artistic director of . NewYorkRep, Markus Potter. Exposed: He wrote the story for his paper and it is now becoming an off Broadway play in New York . 'I . just happened to be listening to a This American Life podcast and I . stopped in my tracks, kind of paralyzed,' he told ABC. 'Immediately, I thought this story needs to be told.' Holthouse, who is now married with a son, said he would encourage any other rape victims to enact their revenge. 'Not only do you have the right,' he said, but arguably, you have the obligation to exact some form of . revenge on the person who sexually assaulted you when you were a kid. 'You have that same special, critical knowledge that I had. You . know, beyond any doubt, the identity of a kiddie rapist.'","David Holthouse was raped by the teenage son of a family friend in 1978 .

"What tough times these must be for a son of toil such as Olympic supremo Jacques Rogge. Picked up in a chauffeur-driven limo from the airport, whisked through  traffic with a motorcycle police escort, then deposited into the luxury of a five-star hotel. Yesterday was just as hectic for the man who described himself on radio yesterday as ‘a working class person who lives in the real world’. 'I'm working class': At least he is working with class as he presents the Queen with a set of Olympic medals at last night's a reception for members of the International Olympic Committee at Buckingham Palace . A VIP tour of the Olympic village... a . visit to those nice chaps who made his £10,000 gold watch... tea and . canapés with the Queen at Buckingham Palace... a night at the opera... then back to the Hilton in London’s Park Lane, where a nightcap of fine . cognac can cost guests £695 if they happen to be settling their own bill . (which, incidentally, Dr Rogge is not). Alas, there wasn’t quite time earlier . in the day to nip down the pub for a pint and a jellied eel supper with . his other working class muckers from the International Olympic . Committee, of which he is president – even though he found himself in . the heart of what remains of the East End. So it was back to the grindstone for . the 70-year-old ex-surgeon and former Olympic yachtsman as he made sure . everything was running smoothly yesterday in the run-up to the opening . ceremony. Mr Rogge and his wife Anne are presented with gifts by Queen Elizabeth at the Buckingham Palace reception . Royal audience: Queen Elizabeth listens intently as Jacques Rogge holds a speech at the royal residence on Monday night . One element of that involved the . Belgian-born Count spending part of yesterday defending a decision to . accommodate IOC and other officials in the kind of opulence most . athletes could never afford. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Rogge said: 'The IOC members work very hard during the Olympic Games. 'This hotel where we are staying is a . kind of conference room, we have meetings here, so that is very . important, and IOC members fulfil an important duty within their own . nation, their own national Olympic committees, awarding medals, sitting . in various commissions, co-ordination, medical commission and others, so . we are working class people. 'We live in the real world, absolutely we do.' The International Olympic Committee President speaks to the Queen at Buckingham palace, left, and with Princess royal Anne at the  Royal Opera House last night during the opening of the IOC Session . Asked why the team could not stay in a . three-star star hotel, he added: 'I'm sorry but in a three-star hotel . you will not find the facilities there are in this hotel, conference . room, simultaneous translation - this is something only more upscale . hotels have.' The president of the International Olympic Committee arrived at Heathrow from Lausanne in Switzerland on Friday. He . was transported up the M4 into central London in a chauffeur-driven BMW . using the exclusive Olympic Lane and escorted by five police . motorcycles. Proving his 'working class' credentials: The President of the International Olympic Committee Dr Jacques Rogge takes a pool shot for Team GB volleyball player Nathan French in the athletes rest area . He . and around a dozen IOC grandees were ferried to the five-star 453-room . London Hilton on Park Lane, which has been block-booked by the London . Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG). The Hilton has been dubbed ‘Fortress . Hilton’ because of the heavy security in place, and staff and guests can . enter only after they have passed through airport-style scanners and . been frisked by guards. The Hilton Hotel’s restaurant and . bars include the famous rooftop bar on the 28th floor, providing . panoramic views across the capital. The . wine list in its 1930s-style Galvin at Windows cocktail bar and . restaurant includes Louis Roederer Cristal Rose at £1,053 a bottle and . Hennessy ‘Ellipse’ cognac at £695 a glass. Mr Rogge, pictured standing under the Olympic rings during a visit to the London 2012 Olympic Village in Stratford today, said he required a chauffeur-driven care throughout the Games to do his job . Mr Rogge taking a tour of the Village at the Olympic Park where plenty of fruit is on-hand for the thousands of athletes . Head chef Andre Garrett’s dishes on his ‘prestige menu’ at £65-a-head include Vendee pigeon or seared halibut. The VIPs do not have to produce their wallets, because all food and drink is ‘part of the package’. Yesterday part of his punishing . schedule involved visiting a shop selling watches by Omega, official . timekeepers for the Games. He already sports a rose gold De Ville Co . Axial, which staff estimated would cost in excess of £10,000. Clear path: Mr Rogge is escorted down the M4 in the special 'Olympic Lane' by five police on motorcycles . When asked by a . Daily Mail reporter why was it important to underline 'working class'  in the context . of the Olympics he replied: . ‘Because people running the IOC work extremely hard,’ he told our reporter Paul Harris. ‘From early hours in the morning to late hours in the evening. It’s very time consuming and a very difficult job.’ When asked if East Enders would . consider him working class he said that were it not for the security, he . would invite them to visit the Olympic park. ‘Then they would see how hard people are working,’ he said. Dr Rogge, who was born in Belgium but . moved to England at an early age, speaks five languages and is a . graduate of Ghent university. He represented Belgium at rugby and competed in yachting at a succession of Olympic events from 1968. He comes from a top sporting background – his grandfather was a cyclist and his father a track and field athlete and rower. He is married with two children, and – perhaps unlike fellow blue collar or manual workers – has an impressive art collection. Head office of the IOC, by the way, is a grand chateau in Lausanne, Switzerland. Mr Rogge sits with Mayor of the Olympic Games Village Sir Charles Allen in a Brazilian athletes accommodation during his walk-about before the official opening of the Village . Mr Rogge , right, chatting with Ukrainian former pole vault champion Sergey Bubka at the Olympic Village . Working class then? ‘That wasn’t really what he meant,’ said Mark Adams, IOC director of communications, who sat in on the radio interview. ‘His English is good but he didn’t mean working class as in hammer and sickle. He just meant he works very hard.’ Mr Rogge was welcomed at  Buckingham Palace by Her Majesty and Duke . of Edinburgh last night. The Queen officially launches the . Games on Friday during a spectacular £27million opening ceremony created . by Hollywood director Danny Boyle. Mr Rogge insisted last week that the G4S security shambles had not taken the shine off London 2012. Luxurious: Mr Rogge is staying at the Hilton on Park Lane, where guests can enjoy Louis Roederer Cristal Rose at £1,053 a bottle and £65-a-head Vendee pigeon . Here come the cars: Luixury vehicles cars queue in front of the Hilton hotel on Park Lane, which has been block-booked by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games . Olympic-sized venue: The heavy security presence surrounding the five-star hotel, where International Olympic Committee members are staying during the Games, has resulted in it being dubbed 'Fortress Hilton' Speaking about the thousands of troops that have been drafted in to help secure the Games, he said: 'They will not be running around with machine guns and very visible.' He added: 'They will be ready to intervene and this has been the policy in all Olympic Games since Munich '72 - there has always been security in place but not obtrusive and this will definitely not spoil the fun.' Around 17,000 athletes and officials will be involved in the 17-day long Games, which amount to 26 world championships. Mr Rogge this morning also defended strict rules to prevent ambush marketing by firms not signed up as sponsors to the games. He . said: 'We have to protect of course the sponsors, it goes without . saying. You cannot ask a company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars . and not be protected against ambush marketing. 'But . the fight against ambush marketing will be led with a lot of common . sense. Everything that is in good faith will not be affected and will . not be forbidden. 'If . you come with a T-shirt and it is not exactly the T-shirt of the sponsor . in the venue, they will not forbid you from entering the stadium. If it . is a major attempt to do ambush marketing on a major scale then, yes, . we will intervene.'

"When ten-year-old Alisa Selekh cries wolf the whole village comes running - but only to watch her ride on one's back like a horse through her front garden. It's just one of a handful of party tricks Alisa has up her sleeve that she performs with the pack of pet wolves her family keeps at home in the village of Zacherevye, some 250km north of Minsk, Russia. She can also roll about in the grass with them and even share a big kiss without a second thought for their razor-sharp fangs and ravenous appetite for flesh. She has become inseparable from the furry beasts since her father, Oleg, the local gamekeeper, took in a group of young wild wolves in 2009. Scroll down for video . Howl does she do it? When ten-year-old Alisa Selekh cries wolf the whole village comes running - but only to watch her ride on one's back like a horse through her front garden . Affection: She can also roll about in the grass with them and even take a kiss on the cheek without a second thought of their razor-sharp fangs and ravenous appetite for flesh . Five years on, the wolves are completely domesticated and live with the Selekhs as their beloved household pets. But the scenes completely contradict normal behaviour associated with the carnivorous beast. Unlike their cousins - dogs - wolves are instinctively wild, with a strict code of conduct based on hierarchy within their pack and are some of the most highly-social of all carnivores of the animal kingdom. Loving: Her father, Oleg (left), is gamekeeper to the village of Zacherevye, some 250km north of Minsk, Russia, and took a group of young wild wolves in in 2009. Here he and wife Yelena carry one of the pets in front of their house . Wolf kiss: Five years on, the wolves are completely domesticated and live with the Selekhs as their beloved pets . Unusual: But the scenes completely contradict normal behaviour associated with the carnivorous beast . Unlike many other species of pack animals, male and female wolves tend to operate on an equal footing within their group. So, rather than being dominated by a single 'leader', a wolf pack is led by an alpha couple - one alpha male and one alpha female. These two animals lead the pack during a hunt and often eat first when a kill is made. Generally, though not always, the alpha wolves are the only wolves in the pack to have pups. Second in command is the beta wolf, which can be male or female. At the bottom is the omega wolf - a scapegoat. Although there are leaders and weaklings, it is not always survival of the fittest. It is always the hungriest that gets to eat first, not necessarily the biggest. Working together, they ensure each member has a role to play and none are neglected. Contrary to popular belief, wild wolves are not dangerous and tend to flee at the first sight of humans. However, domesticated wolves and hybrid breeds can pose the biggest threat to people as they have lost their natural fear.","Alisa Selekh is inseparable from the wolves since her father, a gamekeeper, took in a group of wild wolves in 2009 .

"Paedophile Gary Glitter may be arrested over claims he raped a 13-year-old girl in Jimmy Savile's dressing room at the BBC. The 68-year-old former pop star, who was convicted of possessing child porn in 1999 and found guilty of molesting a pair of girls aged ten and 11 by a Vietnamese court in 2006, faces police questioning over a woman's claim she saw him rape a teenager in the 1970s, according to The People. A source told the paper that Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, will almost certainly be contacted by police, who know the identity of the alleged victim. Scroll down for video . Chilling: Gary Glitter appearing on Jim'll Fix It in 1991. A source says the disgraced pop star raped a girl in Jimmy Savile's dressing room in the 1970s. The source added: 'These are very serious offences and as long as the woman gives evidence to the police there is a very good chance Glitter will be nicked.' Earlier this week Karin Ward made claims that she was abused at 14, along with two fellow pupils of Duncroft Approved School for Girls, the Surrey school where Savile is accused of preying on under-age girls. She told ITV News the three girls were taken to Savile’s dressing room at BBC Television Centre after being invited to London by the DJ in the 1970s. Allegations: The video shows Glitter performing his hit Red Hot on Jim'll Fix It. A woman (not pictured) claimed Glitter and Savile sexually abused under age girls at the same time in Savile's dressing room at BBC Television . She recalled: ‘I saw Gary Glitter have sex with a girl in Jimmy Savile’s dressing room...in that little alcove bit. I didn’t see it completely but that’s what was going on and nobody batted an eyelid. ‘Jimmy Savile had a (14-year-old) girl on his lap and he had his hand up her skirt. The girl Gary Glitter was having sex with also came from Duncroft. I think she might have been not quite 14.’ Scotland Yard is looking into numerous allegations from men and women about Savile, who died last year at 84. A spokesman said: 'We do not comment on who we may or may not want to question.' Former detective Mark Williams-Thomas, who was behind the ITV documentary that first exposed claims of Savile's child abuse, told The Sun that a number of BBC staff knew about the abuse but did nothing to stop him. He is urging them to come forward and tell their story. Gadd (left) appears in court in Vietnam. he was jailed after being found guilty of molesting two children. (right) as his on-stage persona Gary Glitter at the height of his fame . He said: 'There are clearly people who knew what he was up to. Ultimately those people now have to ask, 'Did I do as much as could with what I saw or heard? 'I do feel we've lifted the stone. Now there is a need to properly investigate.' Mr Williams-Thomas also called Savile 'manipulative' and used his position and public image to gain access to and groom children. 'He would tell the girls he could get them jobs in media and get them on the radio and television,' he said. 'That was incredibly powerful for the children.' He is now investigating a soap star in a separate investigation sparked by information he has received since the Savile allegations came to light. Karin Ward says she saw Gary Glitter have sex with an underage girl in Jimmy Savile's dressing room . The BBC released a statement saying it is helping police officers with their enquiries. Miss Ward also claimed that she was groped by a drunken Freddie Starr in Savile’s dressing room, prompting Starr to make a statement angrily refuting the claim.He said: ‘I feel deeply sorry for them (his alleged victims) for having to go through what that scumbag put them through, I really do care for them. Prime Minister David Cameron today called for allegations of sexual abuse against former DJ Sir Jimmy Savile to be fully investigated. Mr Cameron said that the claims from a number of women which have emerged over recent weeks that they were abused by Savile as teenagers were 'truly shocking'. And he said that the allegations should be looked into by the BBC - which employed Savile at the time - and, if necessary, by the police. Mr Cameron told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: 'I think it is pretty shocking, the allegations that we are reading. They need to be properly looked at, properly investigated. 'It seems to me it is very important that the organisation, the BBC, does that itself. 'But also, if there are questions that should be pursued by the police and other organisations, everyone has to ask themselves the question: 'Is there new evidence that needs to be looked at?' 'But from what I have read - and that is just as a consumer of the media - truly shocking things have been said.' 'Don’t f******g tar me with the same brush as Jimmy Savile or Gary Glitter. If there is one thing I’ve always hated it’s paedophiles''If I see something on the TV about a kid getting hurt, I just have to turn it off.' It has also emerged that a new footpath named in honour of Jimmy Savile only last month was stripped of its connection with his tarnished memory yesterday. Workmen moved in yesterday morning to remove the two cliff-top signs directing visitors to Scarborough seafront along Savile’s View near the star's former flat on the Esplanade. Police had stepped up patrols around the footpath leading down to the resort’s Spa Bridge following a vandal attack on the gold coloured “bling” plaque outside Savile’s former home in Wessex Court. The plaque which was daubed with the words 'rapist' and 'paedophile' has also been taken down after Savile’s former neighbours threatened to take a sledgehammer to it. Security has also been tightened around Savile’s £4,000 memorial in the Scarborough cemetery amid fears the grave will be the next target. The previously unnamed path that Savile used regularly on his jogs around the South Bay was renamed only a couple of weeks ago. Tarnished legacy: A workman in Scarborough begin to take down the street sign dedicated to the late Jimmy Savile following paedophilia allegations made about the DJ . When the allegations became public, the resort’s Jimmy Savile Memorial Committee set up to honour his name was bullish that the star’s reputation would ride out the storm. But growing public anger has forced the committee to back-peddle and a sister project of raising thousands of pounds to create a life-sized statue of Savile has also been scrapped. Prime Minister David Cameron today called for allegations of sexual abuse against former DJ Sir Jimmy Savile to be fully investigated . TV and radio presenter Sandi Toksvig has told how she was groped on air by a ""famous individual"" 30 years ago. Ms Toksvig, who declined to name the celebrity, said when she informed other staff what had happened they thought it was funny. Sandi Toksvig on the Andrew Marr Show earlier today. She says she was groped by an unnamed star in the 1980s . The disclosure came as she reviewed the newspapers for the BBC's Andrew Marr show. Questions have been raised about the culture at the corporation in the 1980s after allegations emerged about the late Sir Jimmy Savile's conduct. Ms Toksvig, who starred in children's shows such as ITV's Number 73 during the 1980s and is now a regular on Radio 4, said the claims about abusive behaviour came as no surprise. She said: 'In the 80s, which is when I started in radio and television, things were very different. Not to name any names, but I was once very unpleasantly groped while I was broadcasting by a famous individual who shall remain nameless. 'When I told the staff afterwards what had happened everybody thought it was amusing. There was a sort of 'shrugged shoulder' approach to the whole thing.' She added that allegations of inappropriate behaviour 'did not surprise me at all and I had heard those stories when I was working at the BBC'. Former Radio 1 DJ Liz Kershaw described last week how she was routinely groped by a colleague.

"Like all beautiful, successful women Whitney Houston had more than her share of male admirers. But few stars could have provoked such unwanted attention as that which the singer received from one of history's most depraved and despicable men, terror chief Osama bin Laden. Extraordinary as it might seem, bin Laden is said to have lusted after Houston, dreamed of marrying her and at one point even plotted to murder her husband Bobby Brown. A world apart: In the mid 1990s terror chief Osama bin Laden was infatuated with singer Whitney Houston, according to an account by writer Kola Boof who is widely believed to have been his mistress . The incredible account of the terrorist's infatuation with Houston comes from Sudanese author Kola Boof, who it is widely accepted lived with him as his mistress. It was 1996, and just a few years later Bin Laden would mastermind the most appalling terrorist attack ever to happen on American soil. But holed-up in his Moroccan compound he had different things on his mind, namely sex, smoking cannabis and dancing to western pop groups like the B52s and Van Halen. Miss Boof, who claims she was kept as a 'sex slave' by bin Laden, said he thought the singer was 'the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen' and that he was desperate to marry her. In an autobiography released in 2006, Boof claims bin Laden plotted to have Bobby Brown murdered before wooing Houston by giving her a mansion he owned in the suburbs of Khartoum. And according to the her account, the strongly racist bin Laden puffed on cannabis before announcing he would be willing to 'break his colour rule' and make Houston one of his wives. Jealousy: Warped Bin Laden plotted to murder the singer's husband Bobby Brown before wooing her with a mansion in the Sudanese capital Khartoum . Inside his warped mind he believed Houston was truly Islamic but had been brainwashed by American culture. Ms Boof, 37, who is black, claimed bin Laden scolded her for braiding her hair and ordered her to model herself on Houston instead. She recalls in her book: 'He smoked a little marijuana from a gold hookah, sipping his tea and instructing me that I was always to keep hot tea for his 'kif-canbo,' to ease the burn in his chest. 'Osama said only monkeys braid their hair. He told me that the singer Whitney Houston was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen and that she never wore her hair braided. Drugs: Bin Laden puffed cannabis from a gold hookah pipe (file picture) '""I want you to fix your hair like hers from now on,” he said. “I can't put my fingers through it when it's braided."" 'Osama kept coming back to Whitney Houston. He asked if I knew her personally when I lived in America. I told him I didn't. 'He said that he had a paramount desire for Whitney Houston, and although he claimed music was evil, he spoke of someday spending vast amounts of money to go to America and try to arrange a meeting with the superstar. 'It didn't seem impossible to me. He said he wanted to give Whitney Houston a mansion that he owned in a suburb of Khartoum. He explained to me that to possess Whitney he would be willing to break his color rule and make her one of his wives. 'I tried to hide my outrage at his racist remarks, but it would come to pass that for the entire time that I would be trapped in his palm, Whitney Houston's was the one name that would be mentioned constantly. 'How beautiful she is, what a nice smile she has, how truly Islamic she is but is just brainwashed by American culture and her husband—Bobby Brown, whom Osama talked about having killed, as if it were normal to have women's husbands killed. 'In his briefcase I would come across photographs of the star, as well as copies of Playboy, but nobody in the West believes me when I tell them this. It's like they have this totally bogus image of Osama bin Laden. 'Anyway, it would soon come to the point where I was sick of hearing Whitney Houston's name.' Miss Boof's story first surfaced in 2002 when the Guardian newspaper published an article claiming she had had a forced sexual relationship with bin Laden. Later in a two-part interview with MSNBC she was billed as the 'Former Mistress of Osama Bin Laden'. Some claimed she had made up the story, and that it was impossible because of her afro-American heritage. But Boof has stood by her account and points out that yet two of bin Laden's twenty-five children are black and his Syrian grandmother also could be considered a Black woman. Earlier in her account she recalled how bin Ladem who she called 'Somi' would abuse her. She added: 'We would be lying there in bed and he'd say, “African women are only good for a man's lower pleasures. What need do you have for a womb?” 'I would feel insulted—not just to the heart, but to the soul. Send off: America celebrates the news of bin Laden's death last year (left) and mourns the loss of the tragic singer earlier this week . 'He would humiliate me by making me dance naked. It was such a strange thing, because for the most part he believed music was evil. If a guest at the estate played music, he would cover his ears until the 'poison' was silenced. 'But other times he would become this devout party boy who wanted to hear Van Halen or some B-52's. To this day I hear the song ""Rock Lobster” in my sleep. 'I would be jerking around like a white girl—“Dance like a Caucasoid girl!” he would say—and his eyes would track me from one side of the terrace to the other. “Your ass is too big, show me the front,” he said. 'Osama, you understand, did not know the difference between being vicious and being tender.' Recalling the time she first met bin Laden at a Moroccan restaurant she said: 'I ran out the door, gripped by terror, and drove home. Relieved that his henchmen hadn't followed me, I ran a bath, lounged in the cold bathwater, then changed into a flowing silk robe. 'There was a bang on the door, and I could hear shouting: “Hey, black girl!” When I opened the door, there was Osama bin Laden and his seven-man posse. A cold bolt of lightning went through me.' But Osama was trying to be charming, despite the fear in my eyes. “Why did you run? I just think you're lovely and I find you intriguing. I wanted to be your friend.”' Diary of a Lost Girl: The Autobiography of Kola Boof, is published by Door of Kush and available to order through most bookshops .","Terror boss said Houston was 'the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen'

"A 16-year-old girl is fighting for her life in hospital after being sexually assaulted, beaten and thrown into a frigid river in Canada, police have said. Rinelle Harper, a student at Southeast College in Winnipeg, was reportedly attacked as she walked along Assiniboine River, near the city's Midtown Bridge, last Friday night. She was allegedly subjected to a 'serious sexual assault' - the exact details of which remain unknown - before being hurled into the cold water and left for dead. Scene: Miss Harper was reportedly attacked as she walked along the river (pictured), near the city's Midtown Bridge, last Friday night.She was found lying unconscious on the ground at 7am on Saturday by a passerby . She was found only at 7am the next day by a passerby, who discovered her lying unconscious beside the river, just east of the bridge. It is unknown how the teenager got out of the water. Paramedics were called to the scene and Miss Harper was taken to hospital, according to CTV Winnipeg. She remains in a critical, but stable, condition. Her attacker remains at large. On Monday, Miss Harper's aunt, Holly, told the news station the entire family was shocked by the 'brutal' assault on her niece, who is from the Lake Narrows community. 'I can't even imagine what would provoke such an attack, such as brutal attack on my niece. Who in their right mind would do something so horrible?' she said. She added that doctors had initially thought Miss Harper was going to die, while the police's homicide unit were instructed to start investigating the incident. Shocked: On Monday, police took the rare move of releasing Miss Harper's name, with the consent of her family. Above, Supt Danny Smyth told a press conference he was 'appalled by the viciousness of the attack' However, the teenager - who is originally from Garden Hill, a remote First Nations community in northern Manitoba - is battling through and it is now believed she will survive, she said. 'She has a lot of support around her, a lot of love and support and people praying for her,' Ms Harper told CBC News. 'We want whoever is responsible to be held accountable for this.' On Monday, police took the rare move of releasing Miss Harper's name - with the consent of her family - in the hope that the violent nature of the attack would 'resonate' with the public. Killed: It comes just three months after the body of another aboriginal girl - Tina Fontaine (pictured), 15 - was found wrapped in a bag in Manitoba's Red River . 'As a member of the community myself, I'm appalled by the viciousness of this attack,' Winnipeg Police Superintendent Danny Smyth said in a press conference. 'It's important that people are aware that this is an unacceptable attack on our youth and we're hopeful that this will resonate with the community and  that people will come forward and help us.' Under Canadian law, survivors of sexual attacks - as well as minors who commit or are the victims of crimes - are typically not identified. It comes just three months after the body of another aboriginal girl - Tina Fontaine, 15 - was found wrapped in a bag in Manitoba's Red River. Both cases are being investigated separately. Miss Harper, whose high school caters for aboriginal students and is owned and operated by nine northern Manitoba First Nations, was allegedly attacked after she got separated from her friends. At the time, she was wearing black leggings, white runners, a dark-coloured North Face hooded jacket and a black 'WUTANG' hoodie, police said. She is described as being 5ft 8ins tall, 180 pounds with dark brown hair past her shoulders.

"David Cameron has revealed his struggle to keep in touch with world leaders while on holiday in Cornwall – because he can’t get a mobile signal. The Prime Minister has been forced to drive to the top of a hill to get a connection on his phone to deal with the fall of Gaddafi in Libya and the bloody civil war in Syria. Mr Cameron, who holidays in Cornwall every year, said it was ‘very frustrating’ that parts of the country were still left in ‘not-spots’ without a decent phone signal. David Cameron has revealed his struggle to make phone calls on his mobile while on holiday in Cornwall . While most people go on holiday to get away from the stress and strains of work, Mr Cameron’s trips to Cornwall are rarely uneventful. Last summer he was forced to cut it short his break to return to London to deal with the conflict in Syria. In 2011 his holiday was curtailed by a similar crisis in Libya. In 2010, weeks after he became Prime Minister, Mr Cameron’s holiday was interrupted by the early arrival of baby daughter Florence. Downing Street always insists that even while taking a break in the sunshine, Mr Cameron remains in touch and in charge of the country. But now he has revealed that as he drives into the North Cornwall surfing village of Polzeath, his mobile signal disappears. Mr Cameron and wife Samantha holidays in Cornwall every summer, but he admits it can be a struggle making a phone call . He told the WMN on Sunday that poor technology 'affects Prime Ministers making important calls wherever they are, but it affects everybody'. Asked if his phone has dropped out in Cornwall when on a call to President Obama, Mr Cameron replied: ‘As I go down a hill into Polzeath, I know exactly which bit of the road I lose my signal. So it is a problem. I know where to go to get a signal, but it can be very frustrating.’ Ministers are already discussing plans to negotiate with mobile phone operators and asking them to help increase coverage by sharing phone masts, which would allow for the introduction of national roaming in the UK. National roaming sees phones switching from one operator to another when service is not available through a particular provider, which is what happens when people travel abroad. It would address the problem of partial 'not-spots', areas where only some of the major networks are available. After struggling with his phone signal in Cornwall, Mr Cameron was forced to return to London in August last year to deal with the Syrian civil war . Mr Cameron added: ‘This is a really big issue for people all over the country - the ‘not-spots’,' he says of mobile phone coverage. ‘It’s not good enough to say here’s the mobile coverage for the whole country. You have got to recognise a lot of people are making important calls while they are on the move. We do need to improve the coverage of the mobile phone signal. ‘For rural communities not being connected to super-fast broadband is a bit like not being connected to the road network. It’s that bad. So much work is being done online and that it really is a ‘must-have’. We’ve got to crack this.’ Mr Cameron dashed back to London in August to deal with the Syrian crisis. After holding talks by phone with US President Barack Obama, the PM pushed for British military intervention. But he was humiliated when Labour and Tory MPs voted to block any British involvement in taking on the regime of Bashar al Assad .","Prime Minister says he has to go to the top of a hill to make a call in Polzeath .

"Its gentle comedy is said to be a firm favourite of The Queen, so perhaps that is the reason why Last of the Summer Wine has been repeated on television a mind-numbing 483 times so far this year. After an incredible 37-year run, the last of of the Yorkshire-set classic's 295 episodes screened three years ago. But far from fading into obscurity, the BBC-produced comedy, the longest-running sitcom in history, tops the list of programmes repeated in 2013, with a remarkable five episodes being shown every day on channels like Gold and Yesterday. Enduring favourite: Last of the Summer Wine, starring Robert Fyfe, Burt Kwouk, Brian Murphy and Russ Abbot,  has been repeated nearly 500 times already this year . Comedy legends: David Jason's Only Fools and Horses made the list of repeats, while The Good Life, starring the late Richard Briers, was also among the programmes showed most in the first three months of 2013 . Another seemingly timeless series to make the list is 'Allo 'Allo, set in a small town occupied during the Second World War, which had 108 repeats of its 85 episodes, which were made between 1982 and 1992. One of the greatest sitcoms of all time, Only Fools and Horses, starring David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst as the Trotter brothers, is on the list with 161 episodes. Of the top most-repeated shows, BBC-produced programmes dominated, with eight featuring in the table, produced after a survey by the British Comedy Guide. The only ITV series on the list are The Upper Hand, the 1990s sitcom starring Honor Blackman and Joe McGann, with 110 reruns, and children's programme My Parents Are Aliens which had 157 repeats. Old favourite: Gordon Kaye, Carmen Silvera, Vicki Michelle, Artur Bostrom Nicholas Frankau and John D Collins, starred in 'Allo 'Allo . Popular: My Family, starring Robert Lindsay and Zoe Wanamaker, aired for 11 series and is still being repeated heavily today . Odd ones out: The only ITV shows to feature in the repeat list were The Upper Hand and My Parents are Aliens . The second most-aired show this year is the ever-popular comedy, My Family, starring Robert Lindsay and Zoe Wanamaker, which ran for 11 series between 2000 and 2011. Shows still producing new episodes that feature are QI (179 repeats) and Have I Got News For You (126). Mark Boosey, editor of the British Comedy Guide website, said in the Daily Telegraph that Last of the Summer Wine retains a sizeable elderly fanbase, which is said to include the Queen and Afghan president Hamid Karzai. Ongoing: The only current shows to make the list were Have I Got News For You and QI, starring Stephen Fry . He said: 'Last of the Summer Wine still seems to have a fan base. It is gentle, very inclusive comedy which everyone can watch and which can be shown before the watershed. 'It appeals to an older generation and perhaps suggests there is not enough new comedy catering for them.' Last of the Summer Wine - 483 episodes . My Family - 233 repeats since the beginning of 2013 . QI - One of only two current shows on list, 179 times . Only Fools and Horses - Classic repeated 161 times .

The Upper Hand - Another ITV series, 110 repeats . 'Allo 'Allo - French-themed classic, repeated 108 times . He added: 'The list in general does seem to have a nostalgic feel to it.' Filmed in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, in its 1980s heyday, the Sunday night institution attracted audiences of 19 million. Its revolved around the misadventures of a group of elderly friends. Over the years, the cast changed as actors retired or died. After the death of Bill Owen, who played Compo, in 1999, his son, Tom, joined as Compo's son, Tom. Other notable characters included the battleaxe Nora Batty, played by Kathy Staff until her death in 2008. Another classic in the top 10 was The Good Life, which had just 30 original episodes for the BBC, but has already been repeated 132 times this year. Richard Briers, the star, died earlier this year and some episodes were shown in tribute, but even before his death, repeats were regularly shown on Gold. The original run, from 1973 to 2010, made it the world's longest-running sitcom.","Yorkshire-based comedy re-run incredible 483 times so far this year .

Real estate agent Maria Pantazopoulos, 30, drowned after her dress got wet and she was dragged into the river near a 'violently' rushing waterfall in Canada. Friends said she had been taking part in an increasingly popular ritual called 'Trash the Dress', in which brides pose for pictures while playfully destroying their wedding gowns. Horror: Maria Pantazopoulos' wedding dress and shoes remain on the rocks after she was dragged into a river to her death while posing for pictures . Ms Pantazopoulos slipped and fell into the Ouareau . River near Dorwin Falls, north of Montreal, on Friday afternoon. Her . body was found about two and a half hours later. The newly-wed yelled 'I'm slipping, I'm . slipping, I'm slipping,' before falling off the rock she was perched on for her wedding pictures, according to CBC. Ms Pantazopoulos had commissioned the shoot . following her June 9 wedding. Family friend Leeza Pousoulidis said: 'She’s a really fun girl, and she just didn’t want her wedding dress sitting in a box in the closet. Tragedy: Maria Pantazopoulos, 30, died while posing for photographs in her wedding gown. She drowned after her dress got wet and dragged her into a river near a 'violently' rushing waterfall in Canada . 'She said ""I want to have fun with my wedding dress. I want to have great pictures and memories of me in my wedding dress.""' Ms Pousoulidis said her friend was 'a strong, tough girl'. 'She was very petite, but she was strong in character and in physical strength as well,' Ms Pousoulidis told the Montreal Gazette. 'She was very happy and caring. She had a big heart.' Ms Pantazopoulos slipped while she was being photographed by Louis Pagakis, who told CTV Montreal that he did everything he could to save her. 'She . had her wedding dress on and she said, ""take some pictures of me while I . swim a little bit in the lake,""' he said. 'She went in and her dress got heavy, I . tried everything I could to save her.' Quebec provincial police spokesman . Sgt. Ronald McInnis described the site as being elevated and rocky, with . water 'violently' rushing below. 'She . was doing the photo shoot in about six inches or one foot of water when . part of her wedding dress got soaked and became extremely heavy,' Mr McInnis told MailOnline. 'She . started slipping and falling down when the photographer grabbed her but . she was too heavy that he couldn't pull her from the edge. 'Another person tried to grab her but also was unable to save her from falling into the river.' Mr McInnis . said Ms Pantazopoulos, from Laval, a small Island north of Montreal, was . found 100 feet from where she fell by a private diver who knows the . river and volunteered to help with the search. Rescue: Search teams scour the river in an attempt to save Ms Pantazopoulos . The . diver pulled the young woman’s body from an area of the river which was 20 feet deep. 'She had sunk to the bottom,' Mr McInnis said. Two witnesses, believed to be the photographer and an assistant, were hospitalised for extreme shock. Mr McInnis . said the bride's husband was not present for the photo-shoot and . neither were any family members. However, her cousins and her brother went to the site when they heard that she had fallen. 'It's horrible,' Mr McInnis said. 'This is the first time I've heard of a . story like that. I told my partner, this is a story that is going to go . all around the world.' Ms Pantazopoulos wanted the fun photos taken at the falls, perched on the rocks in her gown, Marco Michaud, a colleague of the photographer taking the pictures told CBC. She chose the beautiful site, located . near the small city of Rawdon, as the backdrop. Ms Pantazopoulos's family have declined to speak to the media. Police discovered the woman's body about two and a half hours after she went missing . Slipped: Ms Pantazopoulos was standing on a rock when she got into difficulty .

"A puffer fish that developed cataracts has undergone surgery to have its eye removed, in what is thought to be one of the first operations of its kind in Britain. Vets at Bristol Zoo operated on Mini the puffer fish when its right eye became painfully swollen. The fish had to be kept out of the water for the duration of the painstaking hour-long operation, so the team constantly passed medicated water over Mini's gills to keep its skin wet.

"A landmark but unflown aircraft, dubbed the 'Bugatti Veyron of the skies', is being recreated by a Scottish engineer working with a team in Oklahoma. The Bugatti 100P was described as one of the most advanced planes of its era and if it had flown, its designers believed it would have reached 500mph. At the time the air speed record, set by a German Messerschmitt in 1939, was 469mph. Scroll down for video . A British engineer is behind ambitious plans to recreate a landmark but tragic aircraft, the Bugatti 100P Pictured is the original Bugatti 100P which was mothballed in 1940 to conceal it from the Germans . But in 1940, and near completion, Bugatti - the Italian car designer - was forced to conceal the elegant aircraft in the hope it would not be discovered by the German military. Ettore Bugatti was keen to avoid the Nazis getting hold of the plane's cutting-edge technology, so the aircraft was packed in crates and hid in a barn in the French countryside. Mr Bugatti, who became a French citizen in between the wars, was known to dislike the Germans and had wanted to take them on in an aircraft race known as the Coupe Deutsch. The French government knew about the . plane, but it could not be made in time for a deadline of September 1939 . to enter the race. As the Second World War began, he decided to hide . the aircraft. The only aircraft built by Bugatti was resigned to history until a team of engineers and enthusiasts sets about recreating the plane. A model is pictured here . It . is thought that Albert Speer, one of Hitler'­s ministers, was aware of the . plane and if the Nazis had got hold of the technology it could have . eliminated the Spitfire. The . 100P featured a twin, mid-mounted engine design. Both engines would be . eight cylinder 4.9 litre race car engines producing 450hp each. The . power would be transmitted to the propellers using twin drive-shafts . located just under the pilot’s elbows and attached to the double, . counter-spinning propellers via  nose-mounted transmission. The . wings and fuselage were designed to provide high strength at a low . weight and were constructed from a multi-layer wood laminate - a concept . still used by many planes today. The plane also featured cutting-edge aerodynamics with forward pitched wings, a . zero-drag cooling system, and computer-directed flight control. It would have approached speeds of 500mph, a feat previously only achieved by . aircraft with twice the horsepower. The . 100P was also much more compact than most aircraft of the era, with a . wingspan of nearly 27 ft (8.2m) and an overall length of approximately . 25.25 ft (7.7m). The plane survived the war but never flew and, 70 years later, found itself in a U.S. museum too fragile to ever be restored. Aeronautical . enthusiasts have long thought it was an industry tragedy that the 100P, . with its stunning design and ground-breaking performance, never got the . chance to fly. The only . aircraft built by Bugatti was resigned to history until a team of . engineers and enthusiasts sets about recreating the plane. Musselburgh-born John Lawson, the engineering director, is one of the driving forces behind the project dubbed Le Reve Bleu. Mr . Lawson, 59, who runs his own model making company in Nottingham, is a . former RAF engineer and used to work on the Vulcan bomber. The trained pilot has played a vital role in designing and building the complex gearbox for the model Bugatti plane. He said: ‘The Bugatti 100P was 85 per cent complete when the Germans invaded. ‘If it had flown in 1940 then it would . have been a revolution. It was an incredible aeroplane and Louis de . Monge, who worked on it with Ettore Bugatti, was a brilliant engineer.' Designed in collaboration with Ettore Bugatti and Belgian engineer Louis de Monge, the original 1937 Bugatti 100P is considered by many to be one of the most technologically advanced aircrafts of the era . The . 100P featured a twin, mid-mounted engine design. Both engines would be . eight cylinder 4.9 litre race car engines producing 450hp each. The . 100P featured a twin, mid-mounted engine design.

The hope is for the model plane to be flying by October, and appearing across Europe at prestigious events like the Farnborough Air Show and Goodwood Revival . Bugatti was forced to conceal the elegant aircraft by packing it up and hiding it in a French barn to prevent the German military discovering it.  It is thought Albert Steer, one of Hitler'­s ministers, was aware of the plane and if they got hold of the technology it could have eliminated the Spitfire . ‘I . got in touch with Scotty Wilson and he asked me if I could build a . gearbox. It is a very complicated drivetrain but I thought I could have a . go at reverse engineering it from the plans and photos. ‘The . plane was designed to fly very fast in a straight line but the gearbox . wouldn't have much longevity. So I set about seeing what was needed to . give it a few hundred hours of flight. ‘It . took a while but I managed to design one in computer aided design (CAD) software. I also had help from a group of engineering friends who were . gearbox experts.’ After suffering some setbacks which delayed completion, a gearbox was finally manufactured before being sent out to the U.S. Ettore Bugatti, who helped build the Bugatti 100p, is pictured with his son Roland in 1933. The plane would have been fitted with two 450 horsepower engines and was designed to reach speeds approaching 500mph, a feat which had never at the time been achieved . Mr Lawson then met up with managing . director Scotty Wilson, from Tulsa, Oklahoma and Simon Birney, a Brit . who is the commercial director, in Oklahoma. They hooked the gearbox up to the plane and, to the delight of everyone involved, it ran perfectly. Designed . in collaboration with Ettore Bugatti and Belgian engineer Louis de . Monge, the original 1937 Bugatti 100P is considered by many to be one of . the most technologically advanced aircrafts of the era. Handcrafted using largely the same materials and processes as the original, the recreation is dimensionally and aerodynamically identical to the original plane and includes elements of the five patents that Bugatti was originally awarded for the 100P. But instead of replicating the original engine, the team opted to fix their 100P with two Suzuki Hayabusa motorbike engines which develop 200bhp each - giving it a speed of more than 200mph. The aircraft will make its official . global debut next month at The Mullin Automotive Museum, a Southern . California institution devoted to the preservation of French art and . automobiles from the Art Deco era. Musselburgh-born John Lawson, the engineering director, is one of the driving forces behind the project dubbed Le Reve Bleu. The trained pilot has played a vital role in designing and building the complex gearbox for the model Bugatti plane . It will be part of the Art of Bugatti exhibition and will stay there until the autumn when it will return to Oklahoma when the engines will be installed. The hope is for it to be flying by October, and appearing across Europe at prestigious events like the Farnborough Air Show and Goodwood Revival. Scotty Wilson, Le Reve Bleu managing director, said: ‘For the first time, this incredible piece of engineering and design will receive the broad recognition it deserves, 77 years later.’ Father-of-six Ettore Bugatti, born in Milan in 1881, was a pioneering sports car designer. He built his first car before his 20th birthday and started his own company in 1910. He died in Paris in 1947. According to the European Automotive Hall of Fame, ‘Bugatti's work was characterized by a unique combination of advanced yet simple engineering and artistic execution of all technical details.’ He was known for creating every Bugatti model with parts that were used in other Bugatti models - meaning they were made not just in series. His company, founded in 1909, survives to this day.","Near completion in 1940, Bugatti was forced to conceal the aircraft .

"A man's body was rejected from organ donation because he was gay, his partner has claimed. Rohn Neugebauer, was just 48 and otherwise healthy when he died suddenly from a heart attack in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 16. Just months before, he and his partner had held a fundraiser for the Center for Organ Recovery and Education at their hair salon, so his loved ones knew he'd want to donate his body to save others. So they were stunned when CORE officials said he could not be a donor because of his sexuality. Rejected: Rohn Neugebauer, 48, died suddenly from a heart attack two weeks ago - and his loved ones were shocked when they learned that he could not donate his tissue because he was gay . 'It truly has me speechless,' his partner Dan Burda told CBS. 'I feel my corneas, . skin and tissues are no different from any others... so why I'm different or why Rohn was any different is unacceptable.' Neugebauer's sister, Sandy Schultheis, said that a CORE representative had asked her questions after the death, including if he had been in a homosexual relationship in the past five years. When she revealed he had been in a relationship for the past eight, she learned that her brother would not be able to be a donor. As Neugebauer suffered a heart attack, he would not have been able to donate his organs anyway - but he would still have been able to give his tissues, such as his skin and corneas, CBS reported. 'Offensive': His partner Dan Burda, left, said he was 'truly speechless' after hearing the rule . Missed: The couple, who had been together for 8 years, filmed videos about their hair salon business . CORE does accept organs from gay people because organs are considered life saving, but it does not accept tissues because they are considered 'life enhancing' - and therefore not worth the risk of infecting the recipient, CBS reported. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 'men who have had sex with another man in the preceding 5 years' should be excluded 'regardless of their HIV antibody test results'. The CDC states that the risk for disease transmission is so high that donations from gay men should be rejected unless the situation is 'deemed to be greater than the risk of HIV transmission and disease' and the gay donor is the only option available. Heterosexual donors do not face similar scrutiny over their sexual history. CORE told WPXI that they could not comment specifically on the case but cited the FDA-mandated guidelines. Rules: The Center for Organ Recovery and Education accepts organs from gay men but does not accept tissues from any man who has had sex with another man in the five years before their death . Fight: Neugebauer's loved ones are now hoping to change the rule, which they call prejudiced and outdated . After hearing the decision, Burda . wrote on Facebook: 'I think it's very prejudiced, implying that . basically that gay people all have AIDS and HIV.' Burda, who raised $7,000 for CORE with Neugebauer before his death, is now fighting for a change in what he called an outdated policy. 'His strength is pushing me forward to do this,' he told CBS. On a Change.org petition, he wrote: 'Rohn was my partner for 8 years, My Soul Mate. To have him not live on through others kills me. It's what he would have wanted. Shame on this Prejudice law.' Neugebauer, who passed away in his . partner's arms, was a decorated veteran, stock broker and realtor before . setting up Studio Raw with Burda, according to his business bio. CORE has more than 120,000 people waiting for life-saving organs.","Rohn Neugebauer, 48, suffered a fatal heart attack on March 16 .

"Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick is set to be out for a month after suffering a muscle injury. The 33-year-old, who has filled in at centre-half for the club, is the latest victim in a season that has been ravaged by injury. United manager Louis van Gaal revealed the news on Friday as his side prepared for a home clash with Leicester City on Saturday. Michael Carrick has been ruled out of action for a month with a muscle rupture . The Dutchman described the injury as a 'muscle rupture' and said that the England international could be out for around four weeks. Van Gaal added that there was better news surrounding winger Ashley Young. The former Aston Villa man has revelled in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 system and has been missed since tearing a hamstring in the New Year's Day draw with Stoke City. But the manager said he is now nearing full fitness, but would not be ready in time for the visit of Nigel Pearson's bottom-of-the-table Foxes. Van Gaal will be hoping United can end a run of two goals in the last three matches. But he says opponents are making it hard for his expensively assembled side. 'We have to play against teams who make the space very narrow, defending with 10 people behind the ball then it is always difficult,' he explained. Carrick's injury is just one of dozens of injuries the Manchester club have had this season . 'We have to play more quickly with high ball speed and disorganise the opponent. We have to improve our ball speed.' Van Gaal refused to blame his misfiring frontline for the problem. 'You have criticised our defence, now we have one of the best defences in the Premier League,' he said. 'Now you are talking about the attack and we are still a force in the attack. I’ve said before it’s not the defence, it’s the team organisation. The strikers have a big part in it but it is not only them.' Van Gaal added that he hoped his side would learn from the previous encounter with Leicester when United let a 3-1 lead turn into a 5-3 humbling. 'We don’t control the match even when we are three against one,' he said. 'That is happening always in football. That is also the beauty of football but as a top club you have to control a match and when you are in a good result like 3 or 2-1 you have to finish the match.'

"The father behind hit Tumblr photo blog Reasons My Son Is Crying is accepting photographic contributions from parents worldwide in attempt to explore the 'universal culture of toddler' - and the best ones will be entered into a contest to win a camera. Greg Pembroke, from Rochester, New York, began taking mid-tantrum photos of his infant sons Charlie, 22 months, and William, three-and-a-half, and captioning the images with the (mostly unreasonable) reasons for the boys' tears. The hilarious tags range from 'I broke his cheese in half' and 'I wiped the dirt off his pear', to 'we asked him to stop hitting his brother with a plastic wand' and 'his milk was in the wrong cup'.

Pembroke - who writes commercials for . radio stations and is married to Charity, a physical therapist - . initially began his light-hearted hobby by posting images and captions . on his personal Facebook page. But when friends began telling him they wanted to share his jokes with their own friends, they encouraged him to launch a blog. Within five days his Tumblr page had . gone viral, and was being featured in news outlets, websites and . magazines all over the world. The family were invited to talk on Good . Morning America. We would not let him drive this Porsche - submitted by Chris . We took away his baby powder - submitted by Jessica T, Texas, USA, left; and her mother didn't pick her up quickly enough - submitted by Cherry, Shunde, China, right . Speaking to MailOnline, Pembroke . said: 'It's so interesting. I started it for a bit of fun, and it got . big completely by accident. The first photo we did was the cheese one. I . broke it in half after he asked me to, and when he got upset I thought . his reaction was so hilariously unreasonable. It went from there. 'The . best bit is that I've been getting emails from all over the world from . people saying they find it so relatable. It doesn't matter where in the . world you are, the universal culture of toddler is the same.' He continued: 'Some . of the funniest contributions I've had are one from Australia with a . picture . of a little boy crying his face off because his mother unwrapped a . chocolate biscuit. Then there's a little girl in China whose mum didn't . pick her up quickly enouigh, and a girl in South Korea who is literally . crying over . spilled milk.' I broke his cheese in half . I asked him to thank his brother for sharing Buzz Lightyear, left, and I closed the refrigerator door, right . Pembroke is now publishing global . contributions to his site, and has launched a contest to find the . funniest reason for a child crying, with the best one winning a digital . camera, donated to him by Sony. He said: 'I have gotten so many great pictures that I wanted to find a way to recognize some of them.' Greg and his wife will pick the 10 best submissions and put them to a vote on Tumblr. Submissions can be entered until 15 May. We gave him delicious pudding . I made him the jam sandwich he wanted, left, and the neighbour's dog isn't outside, right . While Pembroke's Tumblr site has . attracted mostly praise, there have been instances of online critics . branding it unethical, and wondering how the father-of-two thinks his . sons will feel about his project once they grow up. But Pembroke . dismisses suggestions that his blog is in some way damaging to his . children. 'Of . course there will be people with negative things to say,' he said. 'But . I don't listen to them. I'm sharing roughly a quarter of a second of my . day with the world, and I know how happy my kids are the rest of the time. 'I . know how I'm raising my boys, and I don't think they cry any more than . anyone else's children - that's why I opened the blog up to other . parents. It started out just for fun, but now it's bringing everyone together and reminding us that while we're all so different in so many ways, some things are universal.' I wouldn't let him eat mud . Speaking about how his blog might make the boys feel as adults, Pembroke is convinced they'll love it. He . said: 'They have no idea what's going on now, but I'm going to put . together a scrapbook for them of newspaper cuttings and screengrabs from . all over the world.

"A handwritten letter by Albert Einstein in which he calls religion 'childish' is to be sold at auction - with a starting price of £1.85million. The Nobel Prize-winning scientist questions the existence of God in a letter penned to philosopher Eric Gutkind in 1954. In the private letter, which was a response to Gutkind’s book ‘Choose Life: The Biblical Call to Revolt’, the genius says the word God is 'nothing more than the expression of human weaknesses'. The God delusion: Einstein calls God 'nothing more than the expression of human weaknesses' in the 1954 letter . The agnostic Jew goes on to say the Bible is a 'collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish'. He adds: 'For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. 'And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. He added: 'As far as my experience goes, they are also no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. 'Otherwise I cannot see anything ‘chosen’ about them.' Science vs the divine: Despite being agnostic, Einstein felt an 'affinity' to the Jewish people . The letter, written one year before the German’s death in 1955, is commonly known as ‘The God Letter’. When it was offered by Bloomsbury Auctions in 2008 it had an estimate of just £8,000. But a bidding frenzy resulted in one anonymous person eventually paying a staggering £170,000. The letter has been stored in a temperature-controlled vault and will be sold through LA-based Auction Cause with a starting bid of $3 million (£1.85million). However, it has been estimated the letter could fetch as much as twice this figure. Eric Gazin, president of Auction Cause, said: 'This letter, in my opinion, is really of historical and cultural significance as these are the personal and private thoughts of arguably the smartest man of the 20th century. 'The letter was written near the end of his life, after a lifetime of learning and thought.' Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the general theory of relativity, effecting a revolution in physics. For this achievement, Einstein is often regarded as the father of modern physics.","Ground-breaking physicist and cultural icon calls the Bible 'primitive legends'

"Transformation: Sarah Hicks Williams was born in the North but married a Southern physician who owned a plantation . A Civil War-era abolitionist woman went from supporting the end of slavery to calling the race ‘ungrateful’ and people who ‘drive me to be tight and stingy with them.’ This is the stunning story of Sarah Hicks Williams, who was originally from New Hartford, New York, and eventually married Benjamin Franklin Williams, a physician who owned a plantation in North Carolina. The woman from the North wrote a series of letters from the time of her marriage in 1853 until 1867, two years after the end of the Civil War. Mrs Williams’ letters will be put on display in Norwich, UK, in honour of Britain’s Black History Month, and show her gradual shift of opinions on slavery and of those oppressed. In 1853, a 26-year-old Sarah Hicks married Benjamin Williams and entered into a new life in the South. The plantation owner had courted her for some eight years, as she was extremely reluctant to marry him and move to the South, according to the book Root Of Bitterness: Documents of the Social History of American Women. Once she was settled at Clifton Grove, a working plantation, she wrote her parents to describe that the 37 slaves on the property were ‘treated with more familiarity than many Northern servants.’ She confided to her parents: ‘I feel confused. Everything is so different that I do not know which way to stir for fear of making a blunder. Settling in: In a series of letters written over several years, Mrs Williams detailed her new life on a Southern plantation . Change of heart? Though she began as an abolitionist, Mrs Williams' views on blacks gradually shifted . 'I have seen enough to convince me that the ill-treatment of the Slaves is exaggerated at the North but I have not seen enough to make me like the institution.’ According to the Guardian, Ms Hicks had wrestled with only two things about Mr Williams before marrying him. ‘One is his owning slaves,’ she wrote. ‘I cannot make it seem right and yet perhaps there may be my sphere of usefulness. ‘The other is not being a professing Christian.’ However, neither stopped her from marrying Mr Williams, and indeed, she wrote in several letters that his love of her was great. ‘My husband is all kindness and loves me more than I am worthy,’ she wrote. They went on to have five children together. Oppressed: A group of slaves outside their log cabin between 1860 and 1864 (file photo); when she married, Mrs Williams became the mistress of 37 slaves . When tensions were rising and the nation . was on the threshold of the Civil War, Mrs Williams said she’d rather . go barefoot or wear homemade stockings than buy them from slaves. But living in the South seemed to gradually alter her perceptions. In 1862, she commented: ‘The little folks and “contrabands” are oppressing themselves with sugarcane.’ In August of 1867, Mrs Williams wrote of her experiences with newly-freed hired help. ‘Three have run away during the last few months,’ she told her parents. ‘They came to us naked (all but) they are an ungrateful race, they drive me to be tight and stingy with them.’ Author Rebecca Fraser of the University of East Anglia’s School of American Studies will publish a book about her dramatic change of heart, entitled Gender, Race And Family In Nineteenth Century America: From Northern Woman To Plantation Mistress. As any historian would say, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation did free the slaves, though the societal and cultural norms were much more difficult to overcome. And as these letters reveal, geography and influence can speak in volumes to one's paradigms.","Sarah Hicks Williams was raised in New York but married southern plantation owner .

"Cameroon is home to a bizarre creature, Trichobatrachus robustus, that’s straight out of a sci-fi or horror film. The bizarre, hairy frog with cat-like extendable claws can break its own bones to produce talons that puncture their way out of the frog’s toe pads. David Blackburn and scientists at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology, think the gruesome behaviour is a defence mechanism. Party trick: Hairy frogs from the Cameroon have revealed a remarkable mechanism that causes thorn-like claws to burst through the skin when it is threatened . The researchers say there are salamanders that push their ribs through their skin to produce protective barbs on demand, but the mechanism on this frog has never been seen before. The feature is also found in nine of the 11 frogs belonging to the Astylosternus genus, most of which live in Cameroon. 'Some other frogs have bony spines that project from their wrist, but in those species it appears that the bones grow through the skin rather than pierce it when needed for defence,' Blackburn told New Scientist. The claws of T. robustus, which are found only on the hind feet, are nestled inside a mass of connective tissue. A chunk of collagen forms a bond between the claw's sharp point and a small piece of bone at the tip of the frog's toe. The other end of the claw is connected to a muscle. Researchers believe that when the animal is under threat, it contracts this muscle, which pulls the claw downwards. The sharp point then breaks away from the bony tip and cuts through the toe pad, emerging on the underside. Thorny problem: The foot of a living Trichobatrachus robustus frog, which is one of the 11 species of African frogs, shows the white bony claws protruding from the tips of the toes . The mechanism is unique among vertebrates, as is the fact that the claw is just bone - without an outer coating of keratin as other claws do. But only studied dead specimens have been studies, so it is unknown what happens when the claw retracts - or even how it retracts. It does not appear to have a muscle to pull it back inside so it’s thought that it may passively slide back into the toe pad when its muscle relaxes. 'Being amphibians, it would not be surprising if some parts of the wound heal and the tissue is regenerated,' says Blackburn. Cutting edge: Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, has retractable claws. He also has a healing factor that allows him to recover from virtually any wound, disease, or toxin at an accelerated rate . Males of the species, which grows to about 11 centimetres, also produce long hair-like strands of skin and arteries when they breed. The ‘hairs’ allow them to take in more oxygen through their skin while they take care of their brood. In Cameroon, they roasted and eaten. Hunters use long spears and machetes to kill the frogs, apparently to . avoid being hurt by their claws. ‘This is an incredible story,’ says Ian Stephen, curator of herpetology at the Zoological Society of London, UK. 'Some frogs grown spines on their thumbs during breeding season, but this is entirely different. ‘For me, it highlights the need for a . lot more research on amphibians especially in light of the threat of . mass extinctions,’ he adds. The existence of frogs with erectile . claws like cats was first described by Belgian zoologist George . Boulenger in 1900 in frogs found in the French Congo, now the Republic . of Congo. David Cannatella, a herpetologist at . the University of Texas, Austin, questions whether the bony protrusions . are meant for fighting. They could allow a frog's feet 'to get a better . grip on whatever rocky habitat they might be in,' he says . The Bakossi people of Cameroon . traditionally believed that the frogs fall from the sky and, when eaten, . help childless human couples become fertile. The males have a paired internal vocal sac and three short ridges of small black spines along the inner surface of the first manual digit. Breeding males also develop – somewhat hair-like – dermal papillae that extend along the flanks and thighs. These contain arteries and are thought to increase the surface for the purpose of absorbing oxygen (comparably to external gills of the aquatic stage), which is useful as the male stays with his eggs for an extended period of time after they have been laid in the water by the female. The species is terrestrial, but returns to the water for breeding, where egg masses are laid onto rocks in streams. The quite muscular tadpoles are carnivorous and feature several rows of horned teeth. Adults feed on slugs, myriapods, spiders, beetles and grasshoppers. Amphibian researcher and biologist David Wake of the University of California, says that this type of weaponry appears to be unique in the animal kingdom.","The Cameroon frog is unique as the claw is just bone without an outer coating of keratin, as other claws do .

"A retired teacher died in a ‘one-in-a-million’ accident after he was trampled by an elephant while pursuing his love of photography on holiday in India, an inquest heard today. Colin Manvell, 67, of Havant, Hampshire, was travelling on the latest of several trips to visit local friends in the Tamil Nadu area of southern India to go on safari with the aim of seeing a tiger. It was believed Mr Manvell was alone when he was trampled by the elephant at the Masinagudi National Park, said David Horsley, coroner for Portsmouth and South East Hampshire. Retired teacher: Colin Manvell (left), 67, of Havant, Hampshire, was travelling on the latest of several trips to visit local friends in the Tamil Nadu area of southern India to go on safari with the aim of seeing a tiger . He said that he had received very little information from the Indian authorities about the incident and the only report sent to him had been photocopied badly and was incomplete. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mr Horsley said: ‘We do not know any more than an elephant must have come out of the undergrowth making trumpeting sounds and he was in its way. I have no more information than that.’ He added: ‘He has been out on holiday photographing wildlife, in not necessarily a remote area because there was a hospital, but he has been out in an area where there are wild animals and unfortunately he has been in the way of a stampeding elephant. ‘It is the first time I have encountered anything like this as a coroner, he was clearly out in India doing what he loved. It was maybe the way he would have wanted to go.’ His nephew, Roger Manvell, said that his uncle died on September 19 last year ‘doing something that he loved’. He added that the family did not have any more information about how his uncle died. Holiday: Mr Manvell was a retired geography teacher and he also worked at a tennis and squash club . The 48-year-old tennis coach from Hill Head, Hampshire, said that his uncle had been a frequent visitor to India and would stay with local friends he had made there. Evidence: His nephew, Roger Manvell (pictured), said that his uncle died 'doing something that he loved' Mr Manvell said: ‘He had always travelled a lot ever since I can remember. I think he had been there a week or so before he had died. ‘On the last number of occasions he had been (in India), he always goes out with some friends on what we would call a safari. ‘He’s very keen on his photography, particularly birds, flowers, he was always on the pretence of looking for a tiger, always intent on tracking or seeing a tiger in the wild but every time he came back he was a bit closer to seeing one but he never got to see a tiger. ‘He was very happy taking photographs of everything. He was not a thrill-seeker or anything, just enjoyed seeing the culture out there and spending time with friends he met there.’ Speaking of the incident, he added: ‘I would assume that he was taking some photos of some wild birds by a water hole, it sounds like he was on his own because if there had been someone else there this might not have happened.’ Mr Manvell said that his uncle appeared to have good eyesight and hearing, contradicting reports following his death that he had difficulty with his hearing. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Manvell and his sister Karen Clark, 46, said that his death had been a ‘one-in-a-million’ accident. Mr Manvell said: ‘We have known our uncle Colin all our lives and we have always known him as a traveller who gave his time generously to his school and tennis clubs and all his other friends and family. Abroad: An elephant training camp at Masinagudi National Park in the Tamil Nadu area of southern India . ‘When I heard last September it was a . big shock to us and the family. He was always a very keen traveller and . died doing something he loved and we still have his photographs from his . travels which we will hold very dear to us. 'It was quite unbelievable when it happened at the time, it’s a one-in-a-million' Roger Manvell, nephew . ‘It was quite unbelievable when it happened at the time, it’s a one-in-a-million.’ He said that the lack of information . from India was understandable and added: ‘The Foreign Office were very . good at the time, they helped us out with the repatriation. ‘The details they got were sketchy, unless we actually speak to his friends out in India face-to-face, it’s very difficult.’ Trampled to death: Mr Manvell appeared to have good eyesight and hearing, his nephew told the inquest . Mr Manvell was a retired geography teacher at Warblington School in Havant, and he also worked at the Avenue Tennis and Squash Club in the town. 'He was clearly out in India doing what he loved. It was maybe the way he would have wanted to go' David Horsley, coroner . Mr Manvell joined Warblington School in 1988 and retired 10 years later. Headteacher Julia Vincent said: ‘Mr Manvell retired from head of geography at Warblington School a number of years ago. ‘Although I did not know him personally, he was well-known to the school community and has kindly donated a trophy for academic achievement in geography. ‘We were saddened to hear of this tragic accident and our thoughts and prayers go out to his friends and family at this sad time.’ Location: He was visiting friends in the Tamil Nadu area of India and went to the Masinagudi National Park .","Colin Manvell was visiting local friends in Tamil Nadu, southern India .

"A man suspected of spraying a 73-year-old woman with gasoline and setting her on fire in an elevator has been charged with murder and arson. Jerome Isaac, from New York, said nothing as he appeared in court yesterday with the left side of his face badly burned and peeling. He is being held without bail. His lawyer requested the 47-year-old be placed in solitary confinement and receive medical attention for his burns. Police say Isaac is a disgruntled handyman who was so angry that Delores Gillespie, a former employer, had failed to pay a $2,000 bill that he killed her on Saturday. Tragic: Delores Gillespie (left) died after her former handyman Jerome Isaac (right) allegedly soaked her in gasoline and then set her on fire in an elevator in her Brooklyn apartment building . The left side of Isaac's face is visibly singed. He was yesterday charged with murder and arson . He was yesterday charged with . first-degree murder and arson, hours after he turned himself in to . police reeking of gasoline with the entire left-side of his face clearly . singed by flames. Isaac waited for Ms . Gillespie to return to her Brooklyn home from shopping. When the elevator door opened, . he sprayed gasoline across her face and body before setting her . on fire with a Molotov cocktail, according to police. The . elderly woman cowered in the corner of the elevator and tried to shield . herself, but neighbours said they heard her screams of agony as she . burned to death while her alleged killer fled the scene. Isaac had lived with Ms Gillespie while he worked for her doing odd jobs, according to reports. When Ms Gillespie found . out Isaac was stealing from her, she fired him, Rickey Causey, the victim's . 52-year-old nephew, told the New York Post. 'He was doing more stealing than cleaning,' he said. Caught on camera: A still from surveillance video allegedly shows Isaac spraying Ms Gillespie with a flammable liquid in an elevator, before lighting a Molotov cocktail and setting her alight . Crime scene: This is the hallway where police say Isaac waited for his victim before attacking her . Charred: The elevator where Ms Gillespie died in a ball of flames . Isaac left a note on Ms Gillespie's door demanding payment for chores he had done, but the elderly woman didn't want to pay him after she caught him taking things from her, Mr Causey said. The horrifying attack lasted one minute and was caught on two surveillance cameras at the apartment block. Ms Gillespie, who had just returned from . grocery shopping, turned and crouched in an attempt to protect herself, . according to police. But . Isaac, who was wearing a protective mask on top of his head, sprayed her . directly in the face and over her head and body as she retreated to the . back of the elevator, it is claimed. He then pulled out a long, barbecue-style lighter and used it to ignite a rag in a bottle. Isaac . waited for a few seconds before using the flames to set her alight and . throwing the bottle inside the lift, according to police. The attacker ran away, using the apartment block's staircase, leaving the woman to die in agony. Handle with care: Isaac emerges from a police station in Brooklyn flanked by two officers following his arrest . Horror: Police guard the Brooklyn apartment block where Ms Gillespie lived on the fifth floor . Shock: Neighbours, who believe Gillespie suffered from a mental illness, said they heard her screams .

Her son had been staying with her in recent months. Another neighbour said the woman was a postal worker. One neighbour, who identified himself to the Daily News as 'John', said he heard loud screams before smoke started filling the hallways. ‘It was high-pitched yelling,’ he said. He then ran downstairs and heard ‘popping sounds’ from the elevator shaft. ‘The elevator sounded like it was boiling paint,’ he said. ‘You could see the flames in the elevator shaft and hear crackling,’ he added.

"A body pulled from Lake Washington has been identified as that of Richard Sweezey, 67, who vanished while out on his boat more than two years ago . A body pulled from Lake Washington has been identified as that of a man who vanished while out on his boat more than two years ago. Richard Sweezey, 67, was last seen leaving Seattle's Queen City Yacht Club in his yacht on July 20, 2012 . Police began an investigation after his boat was found grounded later that day. When King County Marine Unit Deputies searched the boat, a 48-foot 1965 Chris Craft Roamer, they found it unoccupied. 'When deputies got there they found that nobody was in the boat but there was a generator inside there that was running, and a tool that was hooked to it via an extension cord was hanging over the side of the boat and into the water,' King County Sheriff's Sergeant Cindi West told KOMO at the time. The King County Sheriff’s Office Guardian 1 Helicopter, the U.S. Coast Guard and Seattle Police Marine Patrol all participated in a search for Sweezey's body but without finding anything. After the investigation was called off, Sweezey’s friends and family raises tens of thousands of dollars for their own search of the lake, using sonar technology. But that too proved unsuccessful. The King County Medical Examiner’s Office later classified Sweezey’s death as an accident. Sweezey left behind a wife, Rae Ann Engdahl, and two step-children, Jeremy and Kinley.

"Pepe shouldn't have become embroiled in an altercation with Thomas Muller and ought to have been more responsible - particularly because he's not even Portuguese. That's Jose Mourinho's synopsis after his country's dismal 4-0 defeat against Germany on Monday as he laid the blame squarely at the central defender's door. Portugal were already two down when Pepe - who Mourinho claims is 'not even a Portuguese man' and should therefore 'behave in a certain way' - pushed his head towards Muller after the pair became tangled in a needless spat. Gone! Pepe was sent off by referee Molirad Mazic during Portugal's 4-0 defeat against Germany on Monday . You're wrong! Jose Mourinho claimed the defender should have been more mindful of his responsibilities . Ouch! Pepe leaned into Muller after the pair had begun a spat with Portugal already two goals down . Muller exaggerated the contact before the Real Madrid defender received his marching orders - a reputation of playacting and cheating seemingly going before him. Mourinho argues that even though the red card appeared harsh, Pepe - born in Brazil - needed to be mindful of letting his adopted country down. 'I think obviously the second goal is his fault. He's on a zone but he has to make contact with the opponents and he left Hummels and Sami [Khedira] completely on his own and nobody contacted him, no challenge and Hummels scored the second goal,' Yahoo’s Global Football Ambassador said. 'After that I think the frustration of the mistake comes up and after that loses possession with the pressure of Muller and after that we can say is not a real aggression. 'Maybe he doesn't deserve a direct red card but because, in spite of not being a clear aggression, there is a body language that many, many times pushes the referees to have these kind of decisions. 'To leave a team playing with ten men for such a long time is obviously a big handicap for the team. 'The fact that is not even a Portuguese man, I think that should put even more pressure on him to behave in a certain way, which he didn't.' Laying down the gauntlet: Muller ended up netting a hat-trick for Germany in their opening game win .","Portugal defender was sent off for headbutt against Germany .

"Liverpool have opened preliminary talks with Bayern Munich over a proposed £16m deal for Xherdan Shaqiri. Manager Brendan Rodgers is growing impatient over Southampton's reluctance to bend on a deal for Adam Lallana, with sporting director Les Reed saying the England international should stay 'a little longer' at St Mary's. Liverpool have checked on Lazar Markovic too at Benfica but Swiss international Shaqiri offers better market value. VIDEO Scroll down to see Shaqiri in training with his Swiss and Bayern teammates . Negotiations: Liverpool have started preliminary talks with Bayern Munich over £16m-rated Xherdan Shaqiri . International duty: Shaqiri is currently in action for Switzerland at the World Cup in Brazil . The 22-year-old had been earmarked to replace Franck Ribery at Bayern but has grown impatient at his lack of playing time and is keen to move to Anfield. Shaqiri started just 10 matches in the Bundesliga last season, contributing to Bayern's title win mainly from the bench. He is currently on international duty with Switzerland at the World Cup in Brazil and completed the full 90 minutes in their opening 2-1 win over Ecuador. Limited opportunities: Shaqiri scores for Bayern Munich against Freiburg last season, but his game time has been limited at the German champions . Hard ball: Southampton are not prepared to budge on the sale of star asset Adam Lallana . Liverpool will also target the Wolfsburg left-back Ricardo Rodriguez if they fail to agree a deal for Alberto Moreno. The Sevilla star has been a long-term target for Rodgers but a move to Anfield appears to have hit the rocks. Liverpool thought they had thrashed out terms with the La Liga side, who have upped their asking price and are now demanding around £20million for the 21-year-old. Wanted: Shaqiri's Switzerland team-mate Ricardo Rodriguez is also been monitored by Liverpool . That means Rodgers could turn his attention to Swiss international Rodriguez instead. The Reds were linked with the 21-year-old in January, but could reignite their interest if a deal for Moreno falls through. The potential signing of Xherdan Shaqiri is sure to excite Liverpool fans, with the midfield maestro long considered one of the brightest prospects to come out of Swiss football. At just 22-years-old, Shaqiri is already a key figure in the national side and played the full 90 minutes in Switzerland’s 2-1 opening match victory over Ecuador in the World Cup. Shaqiri burst on the scene as a teenager after making his debut for Basle in 2009, where he quickly cemented his place in the starting line-up over the next three seasons. To the delight of Reds fans he already has pedigree when it comes to sticking the knife into rivals Manchester United. Surrounded: Shaqiri, then playing for FC Basel, takes on the Manchester United defence in a 2011 Champions League tie . The Swiss star provided two assists for Basle in a 2-1 victory over Manchester United in 2011 which helped dump the Red Devils out of the Champions League group stage. His performances soon caught the eye of a number of European clubs, but it was Bayern Munich which won the race to sign him in the summer of 2012. Despite his promising talent, Shaqiri has struggled to break into an all-conquering Bayern Munich side that have eased to the German title for the past two seasons, as well as the Champions League  crown  in 2013. Due to a lack of consistent playing time, the German side haven’t got the best out of Shaqiri who is sure to rediscover his excellent potential with an opportunity of first-team football. On target: Shaqiri (left) celebrates with Haris Seferovic after scoring for Switzerland in a friendly with Peru . Nicknamed the ‘Alpine Messi’ Shaqiri made his international debut at just 18-years-old, scoring his first international goal shortly after in a 2-1 Euro 2012 qualifying defeat by England. Shaqiri’s not going to win many headers standing at just 1.69m, but his weight of 70kg helps provide a low centre of gravity which can make him difficult to shrug off the ball. Adept at using both feet and possessing excellent vision, Shaqiri can play anywhere across the attacking areas of midfield and would add talent and depth to a Liverpool side back in Europe this term.

"A mysterious illness which has killed 13 dogs since December has claimed the life of another. The deadly canine disease - which so far has no name - begins with lesions on the lower legs and feet, followed by kidney failure between two and seven days later. There have been five confirmed and seven unconfirmed toxin cases in the New Forest since December. A mysterious deadly toxin which has killed 13 dogs in the New Forest since December has claimed another life. Flat-coated retriever Erin contracted the illness - which is similar to Alabama Rot . Erin contracted the illness at St Catherine's Hill near Christchurch, Dorset. Owner Tracy Graham said she had walked her pet there, with its mother Holly, her entire life - yet Holly has not been affected by the toxin . It . is similar to Alabama Rot, which was first seen in the USA in the 1980s, because . the symptoms suggest it was related to a toxin produced by E.coli . bacteria. The unexplained illness is triggered by the toxin which then causes acute kidney failure in dogs. Flat-coated retriever Erin contracted the illness at St Catherine's Hill near Christchurch, Dorset. Owner Tracy Graham said she had walked her pet there, with its mother Holly, her entire life - yet Holly has not been affected by the toxin. But Ms Graham, from Christchurch, began to panic when she saw lesions appear on five-year-old Erin's skin under her foot. She contacted the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) straight away and went directly to the vets where Erin had a blood test - but nothing showed. But a follow up test came back positive for a high level of toxicity in her blood when they were told to go to a specialist centre in Winchester. They put her straight onto a drip, but her condition worsened over the next couple of days. Experts told Ms Graham that Erin would have to be taken to London to be placed on kidney dialysis, but by the time she had travelled to the centre to pick her beloved pet up, her condition had deteriorated even further. It was then that mother-of-two Ms Graham made the heartbreaking decision to have her put down. Ms Graham, from Christchurch, began to panic when she saw lesions appear on five-year-old Erin's skin under her foot . Erin (right) with Ms Graham's other dog, Holly (left). Erin was put on a kidney dialysis machine in a last effort to save her . She said: 'It was a real shock. It was so sudden and unexpected. 'Her sore became really nasty but I couldn't find a thorn or anything anywhere as I thought she had become infected. 'Unfortunately nobody told me to get her blood tested every day after she became ill. 'It may have picked up the toxin earlier and who knows - she could have been saved. 'When she began vomiting I just said 'Please, put her down now'. It wasn't fair on poor Erin. 'We will go back up to the hill again but not until the summer - this Alabama Rot-like toxin seems to be a winter thing. 'Nobody thought this area would be affected but more and more places are starting to have it. I've been going there since I was a kid. 'You just don't know where you can go to walk your dog any more.' Vet David Walker, of Anderson Moores in Winchester, Hampshire, said he had been in touch with military sources. He is looking into whether the deaths were caused by leaked toxins from former RAF bases - but said it was 'unlikely' as the issue was widespread. He said: 'Unfortunately, Erin didn't survive and the pathology was the same as other dogs that have died. 'The toxin is more a triggering agent and the lesions are generally a manifestation of the illness.'","Deadly disease - which so far has no name - begins with lesions on legs .

"When you first see Alien Disclosure UK's 'evidence' of life on the Red Planet, all you can see is a mass of rocks. But as the camera zooms in and then pulls back, you cannot help but make out the form of a little green man scuttling forward to pick up what appears to be an iconic Dr Martens boot lying on the dusty floor. The video is the latest in a long line of curious and quirky images from the Red Planet that internet users have jumped to interpret. Scroll down for video . That's where we left it! A 'boot' is visible, sitting on the surface of Mars, and just behind it, a little hominid appears to be tracking forward . On the right foot: The alien looks too small to get any use out of the boot - just one of the many mysteries of Mars . However, it is unlikely to be the smoking gun (or boot) that NASA has been looking for to announce the existence of extra-terrestrial existence. In the early days, the planet was throwing up curiosities. In the 1800s, earthbound observers were certain they could see canals - and even cities - through their telescopes. But as we became better with our optics, so did our understanding of Mars, and this belief was put to bed as newer images showed no trace of life. Then, in 1976, Mars was back with a new mystery - the famous Face on Mars, taken by the Viking 1 during a flyby in 1976. This was later shown to be just another light and perspective trick by Mars, but the haunting visage captured the world's attention. More recently, YouTube user StephenHannardADGUK, part of Alien Disclosure UK, has been gazing at the latest images from the Curiosity Rover, and has collected a fine collection of oddities. These include white 'flying objects' zooming across the Martian sky - and then a . collection of mysterious 'items' he spotted in a video from Gale Crater. The . image shows what appears to be a rock shaped like a digit with a faint . outline at one end that vaguely resembles a fingernail. Another . rock found nearby resembles an overturned sandal, and a crevice on . another geological formation looks like a smiling Martian critter. He announced: 'Mars Curiosity captures a . possible ancient finger, a dome shaped object, a shoe or sandal and a . possible Martian creature. 'Are . these anomalies real, tricks of the light or something else, as always . you decide.' Ancient digit: From the Face on Mars, captured by NASA in 1976, to the 'finger' found just last week, Mars likes to tease us with suggestions of life . Martian footwear: Another rock that caught the attention of the UFO enthusiast made him think of a long-forgotten shoe or sandal on the surface of the Red Planet . Martian life form: An image of a rock with a crevice in the middle vaguely resembles a grinning extra-terrestrial critter . Incredible: Nasa's Curiosity shows the base of Mount Sharp, the rover's eventual science destination, in its latest image release . UFO or camera snafu: The same relentless web user posted footage in which he applied a series of filters to a Curiosity image, revealing what he claimed to be four objects resembling flying saucers . Theory debunked: Experts came out saying that the four 'saucers' are actually just dead pixels in the rover's camera . The YouTube video - posted by a Stephen Hannard - puts the photograph through many different filters to try to find more clues as to their existence. A fourth blob can be seen to the top of this image . Two lights are seen on Mars.

"It is known as the City of Love, where couples flock to capture the magic of their romance. But a set of gritty photographs almost 100-years-old captures a side of Paris that most people will never know existed. The 1914 pictures, taken from a collection at the Albert Kahn Museum in Paris, paint a vivid picture of everyday life in the French capital. Cabaret: The original version of the famous club, pictured a year before it burnt down, is part of the 1914 collection taken from the Albert Kahn Museum . Picturesque: A young boy pushes a cart through an open Parisian square as men in bowler hats watch on . The Moulin Rouge, now one of the city's favourite tourist destinations, is captured in its original form only a year before it was burnt down in 1915. The picture shows the cabaret club's famous red windmill long before the venue was widely popularised in the 2001 Hollywood film starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor. Among the collection is another picture of an old Parisian cinema, the Aubert Palace. But away from the city's bright lights, . the most revealing aspect of the collection is the portrayal of life for . Parisians during the early twentieth century. Family Life: A Parisian family poses for a photographer outside their home . A moment of rest: A horse stops on a road under a brooding Paris sky as it carries a cart filled with rubble .

Retro: A desolate shopping street reveals the beautiful colours and typography on the shopfronts . Paused for thought: A uniformed soldier with a wooden leg looks into the distance as he stands beside a cannon . Mr Kahn, a French millionaire banker and philanthropist, undertook an ambitious project in 1909 to create a vast photographic collection. He sent a group of photographers to more than fifty countries around the world, capturing images, often from important points in their history, to be shared with others. Kahn's love affair with colour photography was brought to an end by the Wall Street Crisis, which caused his fortunes to vanish and forced him to terminate the project in 1931. His legacy of more than 72,000 photographs, including the early shots of his beloved Paris, are now available for people to view at the Albert Kahn Museum on the grounds of his estate in Paris. Kahn's photographs were the basis of a ten-part BBC documentary The Wonderful World of Albert Kahn released in 2009. Bright lights: Old cinema the Aubert palace captured at night .
