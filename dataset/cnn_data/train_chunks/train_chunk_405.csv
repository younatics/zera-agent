"The Obama administration finalized rules on Friday that allow religious-affiliated organizations opposing the use of contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control. The mandates give women at nonprofit, religious-based organizations, like certain hospitals and universities, the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge. The rules, which were first proposed in February and then open for comment through April, have undergone only minor changes. Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, deputy director for policy and regulations at  the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a call with reporters that the rules were ""very similar"" to the administration's original proposal. One of the few noticeable changes is the process by which insurance companies reimburse nonprofit religious organizations -- such as nonprofit religious hospitals and institutions of higher education -- that object to contraceptive coverage. This process, officials from HHS said, has provided more distance between the groups that disapprove of contraceptive use and the insurance companies that will be supplying contraceptives to their employees at no cost. These slight changes, said one HHS representative, came after hearing from stakeholders during a public comment period this year. In total, more than 400,000 comments were sent to the department on the rule. Objecting organizations and insurers will have until January 1, 2014, to comply with the new rules. This date was extended from August 1, 2013. ""The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a Friday news release. ""Today's announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other non-profit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage, while helping to ensure that women get the care they need, regardless of where they work."" Since Obamacare was signed into law in 2010, administration officials have said the administration has attempted to work out how nonprofit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty. In a news release about the finalized plans, administration officials say these final rules ""strike the appropriate"" balance. In February, the health agency said that while it could not provide a final cost of the plan, offering free coverage would lower expenses over the long term, partly because of improvements in women's health and fewer childbirths. As part of the new rules, groups that are insured -- such as with student health plans at religious colleges -- would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage. Because the insurer would be covering the costs, the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it. Although many religious groups applauded the compromise, not everyone heralded it as a success. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops said in February that it does not support the Obama administration's proposals because they  fall short of addressing concerns about religious freedom. ""Because the stakes are so high, we will not cease from our effort to assure that health care for all does not mean freedom for few,"" Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, president of the conference, said in a February statement. ""We will continue to stand united with brother bishops, religious institutions, and individual citizens who seek redress in the courts for as long as this is necessary."" Those calls of disapproval continued after Friday's finalization of the contraceptive plans. ""This latest rule shows the administration is tone-deaf to religious freedom,"" said Anna Higgins, director at the Family Research Council. ""Family Research Council strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life-ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered, with no copay, by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections."" Michael Hash, director of the Office of Health Reform for HHS, said the changes that were made took into account suggestions from religious organizations that objected to the rules. ""I think there is a much brighter line, simpler line, and we think that responds to the good many comments that we got,"" he said. An original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal health care law spearheaded by President Obama, the Affordable Care Act. It required that insurers provide, at no cost to those insured, all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Houses of worship were exempt immediately, and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations, like universities and hospitals. That still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths -- many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong -- covered by the mandate. They denounced it as an infringement on religious liberty. A group of 43 Catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in May. The administration had long defended the mandate, saying that it did not violate religious liberties. The finalized proposal also clarified the definition of a religious employer. Instead of using a multipart test that required an employer to show ""religious values as its purpose"" and to ""employ persons who share its religious tenets,"" the proposal followed the Internal Revenue Code's definition that includes ""churches, other houses of worship, and their affiliated organizations."" After an uproar among religious institutions that didn't want to pay for contraceptives, the Obama administration offered several alternatives in March 2012. These plans are a continuation of those efforts. The issue of Obama's health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot-button political issue during last year's presidential race. In August 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney released a television ad that attacked the Obama administration. ""President Obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion, forcing religious institutions to go against their faith,"" the ad said. ""Mitt Romney believes that is wrong."" Although the ad did not specifically mention the contraception rule, a news release that accompanied the ad justified the ""war on religion"" claim using an editorial published in the San Antonio Express-News in February about the health care law's rule on providing contraception.","Rules let groups like religious hospitals, schools to decline to provide contraception coverage .
But women would still get coverage; outside provider would pay for contraception .

"A senior Iranian naval official said Iran is sending warships toward U.S. maritime borders to send a message -- a move a U.S. defense official characterized as an announcement, not a deployment. ""Iran's military fleet is approaching the United States' maritime borders, and this move has a message,"" Adm. Afshin Rezayee Haddad said, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Saturday. The plan, according to Fars, is a response to the United States beefing up its naval presence in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain. Haddad said the Iranian fleet was approaching the Atlantic Ocean ""via the waters near South Africa,"" a claim that has not been confirmed. A U.S. military official told CNN there was no operational information to support the claim. ""They do send some ships from time to time to the Gulf of Aden for unilateral counter piracy operations. In theory, a couple of ships could go there and then off south down towards the cape,"" the official said. ""Announcement not deployment"" It's not the first time Iran has made such a threat, a U.S. defense official said. ""It's important to understand that, at this point, we have an announcement not a deployment. They've stated this aspiration before,"" said the defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. In 2011, Iran twice announced plans to send ships toward the U.S. maritime borders. ""Freedom of the seas doesn't just apply to fish. It applies to all maritime nations, all navies, everywhere -- so long as they understand the responsibilities which come with that freedom,"" the defense official said. ""So if they chose to send their ships to the Atlantic, I'm sure they won't be surprised to find many, many others already there."" The Iranian navy is the smallest of its military forces, according to GlobalSecurity.org, which tracks defense and intelligence issues.","Iran's move is meant as a message, a senior Iranian naval official says .

"How cute was our universe as a baby? We now know better than ever: The picture of our early universe just got sharper and tells scientists with greater precision many important facts about how the universe evolved. This new photogenic moment, released Thursday, comes courtesy of the European Space Agency's Planck space telescope, which detects cosmic microwave background radiation -- the light left over from the Big Bang. Scientists used data from Planck to create an artificially colored map of temperature variations across the sky in the early universe, in more detail than ever before. ""It's a big deal,"" said Charles Lawrence, Planck project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a news briefing. He added, ""We can tie together a whole range of phenomena that couldn't be tied together so well before, and the sum total of that, the impact, is felt in many, many ways."" The light is technically from 380,000 years after the Big Bang, but that's still infancy when you consider that, according to the new data, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years. ""By the matching observations from Planck to predictions from models, we can assemble a surprisingly detailed picture of the universe as it was one nano-nano-nano-nanosecond after the Big Bang,"" said Marc Kamionkowski, professor of physics and astronomy at John Hopkins University. Kamionkowski compared the Planck map to the Human Genome Project in terms of its importance for cosmology. After analyzing the new data, scientists now believe that the universe is about 100 million years older than they thought. The universe's light started out as a white hot glow and would have been blindingly bright if anyone had been around to see it, Lawrence said. But since the Big Bang, that hot light has cooled significantly, and the universe itself has expanded by a factor of 1,100. The light has cooled so much that we can't see it, but Planck can detect subtle variations in temperature, which give scientists a wealth of information. By subtle, we mean about one-hundred-millionth of a degree. The colors in the temperature map image that scientists released Thursday were arbitrarily chosen to show these intensity variations, Lawrence said. Red means a little bit warmer than average, blue means cooler than average, and white is average. Planck data also suggest that our universe has more dark matter than previously thought. A full 26.8% appears to be dark matter, an invisible phenomenon that scientists have only been able to detect indirectly; experiments both in space and at the Large Hadron Collider are hoping to pin it down. How particle smasher and space telescopes relate . It appears that ordinary matter -- all of the stuff that we can see, such as planets and stars -- makes up only 4.9% of all the universe. The rest of the universe is an even more mysterious phenomenon called dark energy, which has also never been detected and appears to be in less abundance than researchers thought. Scientists said the rate at which the universe is expanding, based on these observations, is 67.15 kilometers per second per megaparsec, a unit of vast distance in space (1 megaparsec = 3.3 million light years). That's significantly less than what had been calculated previously (73.8 km/sec/Mpc). This number, known as the Hubble constant, describes the acceleration of the stretching of spacetime. The discrepancy between these Hubble constants will likely attract a lot of attention in the scientific community and is one of the most exciting parts of the new data, said Martin White, a  scientist with the Planck mission based at the University of California, Berkeley. ""The hope would be that this is actually pointing toward some deficiency in the models, or some extra physics that we're not aware of, and maybe spark a whole new research direction,"" White said. One theory that could be explored is that the nature of dark energy, which scientists think is causing the accelerated expansion of the universe, is different from the simplest human-calculated models. Is dark energy increasing with time over some volume of space? That's a radical theory, though, White said, and there are other possibilities. Another anomaly of these results is that temperature fluctuations are not uniform across the sky map. There are more variations in one direction than in another. ""Perhaps we could say that our universe has thrown us a curve ball, and it rarely fails to surprise us,"" said Krzysztof Gorski, Planck scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Scientists ran 10 million computer simulations and chose from among them the best match to the new data, White said. Out of those, they found a good match describing important statistics about the universe. The Planck telescope is aboard a spacecraft that launched in May 2009. It is not circling the Earth but orbits a point in the Sun-Earth system called the second Lagrange point. The Planck mission helps to nail down many of the parameters that other experiments must know to explore aspects of the universe, such as its expansion history, White said. New analyses are based on the first 15.5 months of data from this mission, which is run principally by the European Space Agency. NASA  is a partner of the project. Planck represents the third generation of attempts to map the cosmic microwave background. The first was COBE, launched in 1989, followed by WMAP, launched in 2001. Comparing the resulting maps shows just how much better the maps have gotten with each successive satellite. ""This is a beautiful illustration of how science works,"" Lawrence said. ""Make a measurement, learn from it, make a better measurement, learn from it.""

"(CNN)He's a football star, a fashion mogul and a prospective sport team owner, but David Beckham is in no doubt as to his most pressing concern. It's a charitable collaboration with UNICEF -- the world's leading organisation for children -- providing help to kids in danger zones across the globe. ""My number one priority is the '7' fund,"" Beckham told CNN at the launch in London. Seven was the number emblazoned on the back of Beckham's shirt as he shot to stardom and he now hopes it will now bring hope to children who are at risk from numerous dangers, including those effected by the Ebola crisis. Beckham, who retired from playing in May 2013, is keen for his own children -- Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper -- to understand the plight of others across the globe. ""Children need to be aware of what is going on around the world and the emergencies that are happening,"" said Beckham of the disasters that millions of children face worldwide. ""My little girl is obviously too young to understand... Daddy goes away and Daddy comes home and shows her pictures of people that he has helped while he has been away... You protect them, you shelter them but there are certain things you can't hide from them."" It's been 10 years since Beckham first took up role as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, describing himself as very proud of this ""next phase of my life."" Through ""7,"" Beckham also hopes to fund counseling and support for children in El Salvador, a country which is battling the world's highest homicide rate. The project could also provide clean water for kids in Burkina Faso, among other initiatives. Beckham's career saw him play for Manchester United, Real Madrid, AC Milan, Los Angeles Galaxy and Paris Saint-Germain, while he also captained the England team. ""Obviously I have worked hard on the field for the last 22 years,"" said Beckham of his success. His contribution was lauded by Paloma Escudero of UNICEF's global management team, who said in a statement: ""David Beckham has dedicated his 10 years as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador to speaking up for those who need it most -- the world's most vulnerable children. ""Through 7: The David Beckham UNICEF Fund, we can act together to drive positive change for children.""","David Beckham makes charity work his top priority as he launches the ""7"" campaign alongside UNICEF .

"(CNN)Is there pixie dust mixed into the food and drink of the happiest places on Earth? Or is it something in the crisp clear air of many of the world's happiest nations? When the United Nations declared March 20 the International Day of Happiness, it recognized the relevance of ""happiness and well-being as universal goals and aspirations in the lives of human beings around the world."" This officially-designated happy date is marking its third year. The happiest of countries -- many of which are in Scandinavia according to the most recent World Happiness Report -- have a robust combination of higher life expectancy, gross domestic product per capita, social support, generosity, freedom to make life choices and lower perceptions of corruption. By analyzing happiness data, officials hope to improve the world's social, economic and environmental well-being. The report is sponsored by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network for the United Nations. The network published the last World Happiness Report in 2013 and expects to release its next report in April. World Happiness Report 2013 (PDF) What about those of us who don't live in the top 10 happiest countries in the world? We can't wave a magic wand and improve our home country's economy or reduce corruption. And the world's greatest beach is ... Maybe if you travel to happy countries with an open mind and a loving heart, you can pick up on that Danish spirit of ""hygge,"" which is sometimes translated too simply as the Danish need for ""coziness.""  It's really a more complex sense of intimacy, community and contentment that generally happens with friends and family. Lest you doubt the Danes and their hygge, remember they live in the happiest country in the world. 1. Denmark . Denmark came in first place as the happiest country in the world in the 2013 happiness report and one of the happiest places in Denmark must surely be Tivoli Gardens. One of the world's oldest amusement parks, Tivoli Gardens will reopen on April 10 for the season to throngs of native and foreign visitors. If a calmer Copenhagen is more your preference, visit the King's Garden at Rosenborg Castle, a popular spot for locals to picnic during the summertime. 10 record-setting U.S. natural wonders . 2. Norway . Dining in the Norwegian capital city of Oslo will make any gourmand smile with joy. The esteemed Michelin food guide 2014 awarded five stars among four restaurants: Ylajali, Statholdergaarden and Fauna each received one star each, while Maeemo held onto two stars. For a more natural experience in Norway, head to Dovrefjell National Park in the Dovrefjell mountain area to spot musk oxen, those shaggy arctic creatures, on a guided tour. You might also spot reindeer at the mountain area, which is the barrier between southern and central Norway. 3. Switzerland . The Swiss town of Zermatt and the 200 miles of ski slopes in the region will delight any avid skier. And serious hikers will enjoy the famous Matterhorn. Even in summer the slopes welcome some of the world's national ski teams to train -- and you, on your relaxing vacation. For a quieter Switzerland experience, head to the car-free village of Appenzell (population 7,000) and its extensive network of hiking trails. Take a warm whey bath and nibble a piece of Alpine cheese. 4. Netherlands . The tulip -- the happiest and most iconic of Dutch flowers -- has already started to bloom at the Keukenhof gardens, which opens March 20 for Holland's spring season. Visitors come from all over Europe to see the different varieties of tulips and other flowers. (Make sure to visit before the gardens close on May 18.) For a more active view of the tulips, take a bike tour through Holland's flower growing region. Fit travelers can bike the Ijsselmeer tour, which winds through the country for about 400 kilometers (about 250 miles) over eight days. If you don't want to stay on your bike for a week, there are shorter trips or you can plan your own. 5. Sweden . Stockholm's Gamla Stan is one of the largest and best preserved medieval city centers in Europe, and one of the top attractions in the city.  After exploring Stockholm's medieval past, stroll through the city's Royal National City Park, the world's first urban national park. For a more peaceful attempt at happiness in Sweden, why not book a paddling trip through Western Sweden? Kosterhavet Marine National Park on the Bohuslän coast is an ideal spot for exploration, and the park can be reached from several towns along the coast. No matter where you are, make sure to take a fika, a coffee break, with your new Swedish friends (it's not something Swedes do alone). If you don't drink coffee, any drink will do. It's about relaxing together as a community. 6. Canada . Protecting the land of Banff National Park is one of Canada's happiest and smartest decisions and it is certainly worth your time to explore on skis. Check out Skoki Lodge to see the first commercial ski lodge built in Canada. If you want to go off the beaten path in Canada, consider exploring the Haida Gwaii (Islands of the People), formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands and the home of the Haida Nation. Just a two-hour flight from Vancouver, there's plenty of outdoor activities and exploration of the culture and history of one of Canada's First Nations. 7. Finland . Of course you should see the Northern Lights and even Santa Claus Village (open year round for your convenience). Want to make your trip to Finland a little more special? How about sleeping in a glass igloo at Kakslauttanen? Enjoy an amazing view of the Northern Lights and a starry sky above in your room temperature two-person igloo. (Toilet included. Showers are in a separate building.) If you prefer a small seaside town, head to Hanko where cycling, surfing and diving are all possible during the warmer months. There's a saying in the Finnish language (or so we are told) that when you're really happy, you smile like a cookie from Hanko. (Explanation for that in this pdf.) You can't not be happy in Hanko. 8. Austria . The music at Vienna's Musikverein's famous Golden Hall, is happiness for the ears and having the famed chocolate Sacher torte at the Café Sacher in Vienna is music for the mouth. If you prefer to get away from the hustle and bustle of Vienna, have a meal at the Pogusch Country Inn, the sister restaurant of the famous Steirereck in Vienna. To extend your pleasure, book a room at the inn and enjoy a weekend in the country. 9. Iceland . No one should visit Iceland without taking a dip at the country's famous Blue Lagoon. The airport bus sometimes even offers paying passengers a stop there on the way to and from the airport, and the waters (and food) are divine. Or make sure you take a soak at any of the county's other naturally heated swimming pools. If you're up for an adventure, head to Snæfellsjökull National Park to see a glacier on top of a still active volcano (although the last time it erupted was 1,900 years ago). You will spot Snæfellsjökull (Snæfell Glacier), Saxhóll volcano crater, Lóndrangar massive lava formations and Rauðfeldargjá the hidden waterfall. Snæfellsjökull was made famous by Jules Verne's ""A Journey to the Center of the Earth."" 10. Australia . One of the seven natural wonders of the world and a site on the UNESCO World Heritage List, the Great Barrier Reef is a must-see site for any first-time visitor to Australia. The Great Barrier Reef covers 344,400 kilometers in area and includes the largest coral reef ecosystem in the world. Some 600 continental islands, 3,000 coral reefs and about 150 inshore mangrove islands are included in the area. Yet it could be argued that the residents of Wollongong are among the nation's happiest. Bypass the area's hang gliding and golf (unless they make you happy) and head straight to the Nan Tien (""Paradise of the South"" in Chinese) Temple, the biggest Buddhist temple in the Southern Hemisphere. Try one-day or weekend retreats for a better chance at going home more enlightened -- maybe even happier.","March 20 is the United Nations-designated International Day of Happiness .

"With his country grappling with the damage from ""hell-storm"" Haiyan, a Philippines official launched a hunger strike Tuesday to pressure a U.N. climate change conference for concrete steps to fight global warming. Naderev Sano, a member of the Philippines Climate Change Commission, said he was fasting ""in solidarity with my countrymen who are now struggling for food back home"" -- including his own brother, whom Sano said ""has been gathering bodies of the dead with his own two hands."" ""What my country is going through as a result of this extreme climate event is madness. The climate crisis is madness,"" he said. ""Mr. President, we can stop this madness, right here in Warsaw."" Sano leads the Philippines delegation to the 19th Conference of the Parties in Poland's capital. He got a standing ovation after he spoke, four days after Super Typhoon Haiyan struck his island nation with estimated winds of 315 kph (195 mph). The storm has left nearly 1,800 people at the latest count. ""Despite the massive efforts that my country had exerted in preparing for the onslaught of this storm, it was just a force too powerful, and even as a nation familiar with storms, Haiyan was nothing we have ever experienced before,"" Sano said. But he said the Philippines refuses to accept that ""running away from storms, evacuating our families, suffering the devastation and misery, counting our dead, (will) become a way of life."" Sano said he will refrain from eating during the 12-day conference ""until a meaningful outcome is in sight."" He called for ""concrete pledges"" to the Green Climate Fund -- a U.N. fund aimed at helping developing nations reduce their climate change emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change -- and said he will continue to fast ""until we see real ambition on climate action in accordance with the principles of the convention."" He told CNN's Connect the World that while the complete picture of climate change is still being studied, the highest increase in measured sea levels over the past seven decades ""has been in the waters just east of the Philippines."" ""The precautionary principle tells you you shouldn't wait for full scientific certainty before doing something or taking action,"" he said. ""How many lives do we want to lose, not just in the Philippines but in communities that have other climate impacts?"" Read more: Projected Typhoon Haiyan death toll falls, but tensions rise . The idea of long-term climate change driven largely by the use of fossil fuels, which release heat-trapping carbon emissions into the atmosphere, is controversial politically but accepted as fact by most researchers. Scientists say they can't pin any particular storm on the process, but that the warming of the air and oceans ""loads the dice"" in favor of more extreme weather. ""When it's a very rare event, we have a challenge scientifically in distinguishing between the rare chance event and the possible effects of global warming. So for these individual storms, that's a particular challenge,"" said Noah Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford University in California. But Diffenbaugh added, ""Even though that's challenging science, we do know that global warming is occurring, we do know that human emissions of greenhouse gases are the primary cause of that global warming, and we do know that a number of extreme events have increased in likelihood as a result of that."" James Elsner, a climate and statistics expert at Florida State University, said that doesn't necessarily mean more hurricanes or typhoons. ""We could see fewer storms, but the ones that do form could be stronger,"" Elsner said. That appears to be the trend over the past 30 years, he said. An October study in the scientific journal Nature noted that more than 5 billion people live in areas that would be affected by climate change by 2050, and the countries that will first see its effects are the ones least capable of responding. And a June report by the World Bank noted that the Philippines is already seeing the effects of a warming climate, ranking 16 of its provinces among the most vulnerable regions in southeast Asia. Watch the opening session of the 19th COP . The Philippines has launched efforts to better prepare for the impact of climate change, President Benigno Aquino III told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday. But he said addressing the issue is a global problem. ""We all live on one planet,"" Aquino said. ""Either we come up with a solution that everybody adheres to and cooperates with, or let us be prepared to meet disasters."" On the table in Warsaw is the issue of compensating countries that suffer from the effects of climate change and can't afford to adapt on their own. ""The poorest people of the world are at greater risk because of our vulnerability and decades of maldevelopment, which I also must assert is connected to the kind of pursuit of economic growth that has led to an altered climate system,"" Sano said. In his remarks to the conference, Sano challenged climate change skeptics to ""get off their ivory towers and away from the comfort of their armchairs"" to see the communities battling flooding, hurricanes and fires. ""And if that is not enough, they may want to see what has happened to Philippines now,"" he said. This year's Warsaw conference brings together countries that have signed onto the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. The annual meetings review the parties' progress in limiting global temperature increases. Sano said that at the last conference, held in Qatar less than a year ago, he appealed to the world to open its eyes as the Philippines had confronted another catastrophic storm -- Typhoon Bopha, then the costliest in its history. Read more: December 2012: Bopha death toll rises . ""Less than a year hence, we cannot imagine that a disaster much bigger would come. With an apparent cruel twist of fate, my country is being tested by this hell-storm called Super Typhoon Haiyan,"" he said. He said he spoke on behalf of his delegation as well as ""the countless people who will no longer be able to speak for themselves after perishing from the storm."" Sano's protest prompted Twitter users to begin using the hashtag #fastfortheclimate in support. The Climate Action Network -- a body of 850 nongovernmental organizations -- later announced that members of ""civil society"" were joining Sano in fasting, in a move it said is ""unprecedented within the history of the climate movement."" Climate Action Network spokeswoman Ria Voorhaar said the protest is spreading ""far and wide,"" with at least 100 people in Warsaw for the conference also fasting. ""A lot of climate-focused youth groups have jumped on it immediately to show solidarity,"" she said. Voorhaar said the hunger strikers want the Warsaw conference to take ""concrete steps"" toward reducing carbon emissions before 2020, enacting an international mechanism for damages and financing efforts to adapt to a warming world.","""How many lives do we want to lose?"" hunger-striking official asks .

"Michael Brown was shot at least six times, according to the preliminary results of a private autopsy that his family requested. The independent autopsy was conducted by high-profile pathologist Michael Baden. Baden testified in the O.J. Simpson, Phil Spector and Drew Peterson murder trials. Family attorney Daryl Parks did not provide additional details about the preliminary results. However, the New York Times, reporting on the same independent autopsy, reported that two of the bullets struck Brown in the head. The other four struck him in the right arm -- and all six were fired into his front. ""This is bound to escalate tensions,"" the Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN. ""This is a very provocative report."" Even before the release of this latest information, the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson has been a racially charged tinderbox. Clashes once again . Late Sunday night, a day of peaceful protests devolved into a night of gunfire, Molotov cocktails and tear gas . Officers fired tear gas into a crowd of hundreds of protester, including children, who were marching toward a police command post despite an impending midnight curfew. Authorities also struck at least one defiant protester with rubber bullets. St. Louis County police said several protesters had thrown Molotov cocktails toward the officers before authorities shot tear gas toward them. The violence escalated through the night as shots were fired toward police. Officers had to take up a defensive position behind vehicles. ""That is a lie. It was no fight, it was no shots fired,"" a very upset protester, Lisha Williams, told CNN. ""The only ones who fired was police. All we did was march to the command center to fall to our knees and say, 'Don't shoot.' And they started shooting."" The scene was a far cry from a packed church earlier Sunday, where hundreds of people gathered for a two-hour rally demanding justice for Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager shot dead eight days ago by a white police officer. ""I'm astonished at this reversal of mood,"" Jackson said. ""The mood was so positive."" Cousin: Brown killed without reason . A cousin of Brown told the church audience that Brown was killed without reason. ""What I want y'all to remember is that Michael Brown was not just some young black boy. He was a human being ... ,"" Ty Pruitt said. ""He was not a suspect. He was not an object. He was not an animal. But that's how he was killed."" Michael Brown's parents -- Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr.  -- appeared on stage at the rally at Greater Grace Church with attorney Benjamin Crump but didn't address the audience. ""What we're really asking for is simple justice,"" Crump said. ""We're not asking for anything extraordinary. They just want what anybody else would want if their children were shot down in broad daylight."" Crump said there would be an independent investigation in addition to the federal and local probes already under way. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson spoke to the 1,300 people in the congregation and said he had a heavy heart. ""The past 24 hours have been tough for me,"" said Johnson, who took over security in the town on Thursday after what many saw as an overly aggressive police response by the local authorities. Johnson said he met with members of the Brown family and was moved to tears. Protests had turned violent on Saturday night as well after a curfew began. One male was shot overnight Saturday, authorities said. It was unclear how old he was or who shot him. The victim was in critical condition Sunday. Officials said state highway patrol officers didn't fire any shots. They did fire tear gas to get to the wounded victim, Johnson said early Sunday. A third autopsy . Brown was shot to death August 9 by a police officer after a confrontation as the teen walked down the street. Accounts of exactly what happened when Officer Darren Wilson stopped Brown vary widely. Witnesses said they saw a scuffle between the officer and Brown at the police car before the young man was shot.  Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has approved another autopsy on Brown's body, the Justice Department said. The autopsy will be conducted by a federal medical examiner. In tense Ferguson, trying to balance security, protesters' rights . 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting .

"(CNN)Florida State University students huddled together in the aisles of a packed campus library early Thursday after a gunman opened fire, injuring three. Two of the shooting victims were taken to Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare. One was in critical condition; the other was stable, the hospital said. The third victim was treated and released at the scene. All three are students. Campus officers later shot the gunman to death after they asked him to drop his handgun, and he opened fire at them, authorities said. ""This is an isolated incident and one person acting alone,"" Tallahassee police Chief Michael DeLeo said later. ""There's no indication of any further threat to anybody."" ""Obviously everyone wants to know why,"" DeLeo added. ""That's the hard answer we're going to continue to investigate."" Officials would not say whether the gunman was a student. The five officers involved in the shooting were placed on routine paid administrative leave. Gunfire at 'packed' library . The shooting started shortly after midnight either inside or near the library at the school in Tallahassee. The library is open 24 hours. ""The library was packed,"" said Mary Coburn, the vice president of student affairs. About 300-400 students were inside, studying for final exams. ""If there's any positive news we can take from this occurrence is that the victim count was not greater,"" said the city's Mayor-elect Andrew Gillum. The school sent out a text to students, warning them to take refuge and stay away from windows. ""FSU alert dangerous situation main campus-Tallahassee,"" it read. ""Seek shelter immediately, away from doors and windows."" Students shoved tables and book shelves against doors to barricade themselves. 'The entire campus is empty' A cell phone video posted online -- purportedly from inside the library -- showed students sitting in library aisle listening intently to a voice over the loudspeakers. ""There has been a shooting in the library,"" the voice says. ""Stay where you are. We will be coming to each floor and clearing and taking care of anybody."" Perry Kostidakis, a sports editor for the campus newspaper, told CNN the library was surrounded for a time. ""The entire campus is empty; I've seen one or two people come up and look at the scene. Everyone who is in a campus building is under lockdown right now. Policemen are still surrounding the library."" 'It was very scary' Graduate student Alex Lauren said students were escorted from the library to the first floor of a nearby building, where they continued hearing gunshots. They were told to wait for a bus to take them away from campus as armed police  stood nearby. ""It was very scary ... I'm more heartbroken more than anything else,"" she said.   ""It's sad, my heart goes out to the people affected."" Florida State is one of the top research universities in the nation. It has about 40,000 students spread out in various campuses in the city, and is also considered one of the nation's top-ranked football teams. As the incident unfolded, anxious students sent tweets and text messages to loved ones. ""There's a man with a gun in the library,"" Samantha Sillick said in a text to her father. ""I love you."" In the aftermath of the shooting, FSU canceled all Thursday classes and testing, the school's Twitter account said. ""The Florida State University community is extremely saddened by the shootings that took place early this morning at Strozier Library, in the very heart of campus, and our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of all those who have been affected,"" University President John Thrasher said. . CNN's  Rick Martin, Anjali Tsui, Ed Payne, and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","Campus police killed the gunman after he refused to put down his weapon .

"Congress is debating legislation that will limit Americans' right to keep and bear arms and infringe on the right to privacy. The Bill of Rights was made part of our Constitution explicitly to protect freedoms: the freedom of speech, protection against searches without a warrant, the right to trial by jury and the right to protect oneself with a firearm. I am compelled to stand up for every amendment and right enumerated in the Constitution. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is attempting to push forward with gun control legislation. The chief problem I have is that nothing in this legislation would have prevented the terrible massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. I am open to ideas that would help prevent tragedies, but this legislation would not have saved us from the national heartbreak of the December school shooting. I oppose legislation that undermines Americans' constitutional right to bear arms. I worry that legislation mandating more regulations on law-abiding citizens will lead to an infringement on the ability to exercise constitutional rights without being subject to government surveillance. I also worry that these efforts will merely disarm the people who follow the law and empower those who ignore it. Along with Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz of Texas, I circulated a letter promising to ""oppose any legislation that would infringe on the American people's constitutional right to bear arms, or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance.""  We have been joined by Sens. Marco Rubio, Jim Inhofe, Jerry Moran, Richard Burr, Ron Johnson, Mike Enzi, James Risch, Mike Crapo, Dan Coats and Pat Roberts. But more senators need to stand up for our Second Amendment rights or the rights will be lost. Both the left-leaning American Civil Liberties Union and the right-leaning Heritage Foundation have raised privacy concerns about the legislation pending before Congress. Chris Calabrese of the ACLU was quoted recently saying that he worries about submitted gun control legislation that may lead to the ""creation of government databases and collections of personal information on all of us."" David Addington of the Heritage Foundation worries that ""loose language"" in the submitted legislation may lead to the government keeping ""centralized records of who received what guns and where."" These are privacy concerns that I share. Potentially on the table are new laws that would outlaw firearms and magazines that hold more than 10  rounds as well as require universal background checks, which effectively restrict the right of law-abiding citizens to buy guns at gun shows and give or sell them to friends and family without having to get the government's permission. One version of the legislation pending before the Senate goes so far as to empower the attorney general to tax gun transactions and creates a new felony crime for knowingly failing to report for more than 24 hours that a gun has been lost or stolen. Legislation being pushed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California arbitrarily bans certain weapons. President Barack Obama has conceded that this idea may not pass during a comprehensive gun debate, yet I worry that the idea may come up again once Congress passes the first round of gun control. Americans exercise their right every day to protect themselves and their families. Recently, a 14-year-old Phoenix boy shot an armed intruder who broke into his home while he was baby-sitting his three younger siblings. The children were home alone on a Saturday afternoon when an unrecognized woman rang their doorbell. After the teenager refused to open the door, he heard someone trying to break into the house. The boy hurried his younger siblings upstairs and collected a handgun from his parents' room. When the boy rounded the top of the stairs, a man was standing in the doorway with a gun pointed at him. The boy shot the intruder and possibly saved the lives of his three siblings. It is terrible that a young boy had to go through this experience, but it is just one example among many of armed citizens protecting themselves and the public from very bad people. I stood up for the Fourth and Fifth amendments during a filibuster a few weeks ago to address the president's constitutional authority to use drones against American citizens and the limits of executive power. Now I am prepared to protect the Second Amendment ""right of the people to keep and bear arms."" I stand ready to stand up for the Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, as I will stand up for any other infringement of our Bill of Rights. Our rights are not subjected to polls. Whether it is popular or not popular, I took an oath to the Constitution, and I am prepared to stand with other senators or alone to protect the freedoms that our Founding Fathers fought to preserve.","Rand Paul says he vowed to uphold all constitutional rights, including gun ownership .
Paul: Nothing in proposed gun laws would prevent tragedies such as the Newtown massacre .
Paul: More regulations could lead to government surveillance, disarm law-abiding people .

"How would you like to do a search without touching a computer or phone? Or have your next question answered before you even ask it? Or get a reminder to pick up a carton of milk when you drive by a grocery store? These are some of the new upgrades to Google's search tools that the company announced Wednesday at Google I/O, its annual developers' conference. About two-thirds of Web searches in the United States are done through Google, with Bing and Yahoo trailing far behind. We spoke to Google Senior Vice President Amit Singhal last week about the new search changes and his excitement for a certain fictional starship computer. Google Chrome gets voice commands . Google is adding voice-activated search to its Chrome browser, allowing people in audible distance of a computer's microphone to start a search by saying, ""OK Google,"" out loud followed by their terms. Google's search team is obsessed with the ""Star Trek"" computer, the fictional, omnipresent and invisible voice-activated system that answered questions and obeyed orders when Enterprise crew members began a sentence with the word ""computer."" Singhal called it the ""ideal system."" Swap out ""Computer"" for ""OK"" and you get a clear picture of where the company is steering its search engine. To activate Google Glass, wearers say, ""OK Glass,"" followed by a request such as ""record a video"" or ""Google the life span of lemurs."" Now that voice-activated, natural-language interface is spreading across all devices. ""I can't wait to put my kitchen computer in this mode and settle all of our questions over dinner without having to pull our screens out,"" Singhal said. The new feature will roll out to Chrome users across platforms over the next few weeks. Search results add more context . Google processes more than 1 billion searches every day, 85% of which have been Googled before. All that experience means the search engine knows more than just the answer; it knows what searches commonly happen next. Now the search engine is integrating that predictive content into the answer, potentially saving people a step. ""We would pretty much anticipate the next question you are going to ask,"" Singhal said. Looking up the population of Canada? According to past searches, the most common follow-up search is for the population of California (if you're wondering, California has slightly more people than Canada). A population search could also show charts comparing similar locations and related statistics such as life expectancy and gross domestic product. The new feature also taps into Google's Knowledge Graph to make the necessary connections. The Knowledge Graph is Google's growing database of things -- you may have noticed its items showing up on the right-hand side of a common list of search results. Where searches used to be largely based on the presence of keywords, the graph makes more concrete connections and detects relationships. For example, it knows ""Warren Harding"" isn't just two words. Google has associated the name with the 29th president and added it to a collection of U.S. presidents. Google Now adds reminders . Google Now is Google's predictive search tool found in the Android and iOS Google search apps. The tool pulls information from your calendar, Gmail account, search history and phone's location to serve up relevant information before you can search for it. These bites of data, called cards, might show the traffic for the morning commute to work, Zagat reviews for a restaurant where you have reservations, and sports scores for the teams you look up the most. This week Google is adding reminders to the mix. Using your phone's location, the reminders will pop up when you need them. A reminder to pick up frozen peas could appear when you are near the local grocery store, while a reminder to put gym clothes in the car could show up on your phone before you leave the house in the morning. These types of reminders are common in mobile apps. Apple, for example, has its own location-based reminders tool on the iPhone and iPad. The new reminders feature will be available for Android first before eventually coming to iOS. Google also is rolling out a few more Google Now cards, including ones that provide updates on music and movies. Taken alone, these new features might seem minor. But together they add up to a new era of intuitive and predictive Google search across devices, platforms and locations.","Google announces new features for its search engine at its Google I/O conference .

"(CNN) A developer who spent three years helping create Google+ has written a brutal blog post declaring the tech giant's social network a failure. In a lengthy, at times profane breakdown on blogging platform Medium, Chris Messina, the man credited as inventor of the hashtag, writes that Google missed a chance to make the service a one-stop home for its users' online identities and, instead, created a less-popular Facebook copycat. ""Lately, I just feel like Google+ is confused and adrift at sea,"" Messina wrote. ""It's so far behind, how can it possibly catch up?"" The November 28 post was a follow-up to a tweet in which he had mistakenly called out a bug on Google+ that was actually caused by an external app. Even as he corrected himself, he called out Google for the network's missed opportunity. ""I f---ed up,"" Messina wrote. ""So has Google."" Messina left Google over a year ago to join a startup. Before that, he had worked on the short-lived Google Buzz social product, then Google+. He wrote that while it was being developed under the code name ""Emerald Sea,"" Google+ was internally being called ""Google Me."" The idea at the time, he said, was to make the site a sort of home base for users, where they would decide which information they'd like to share about themselves and with whom they'd like to share it. ""It was like Google was saying, 'We're going to be your trusted partner in cyberspace, and we'll help you surface the right information to the people you choose, at the right time',"" Messina wrote. ""It was a functional search-oriented value proposition, rather than a social networking one. ""Thus, for me, when I searched for my mom's phone number on Google, I actually find it -- because it would be on her profile and she would have shared it with me. Suddenly a query like 'mom phone number' would work."" Instead, he wrote, Google+ became ""a kind of Facebook-lite."" ""Why did the world need another Facebook, unless to benefit Google by making their ad targeting more effective?"" Messina wrote. Google did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this article. Messina wrote that innovation appears to be slowing for the Web tool. In a chart, he said Google+ and Hangouts, its well-liked video chat tool, have been updated with six apps each in 2014, compared with 15 for YouTube and 16 for Chrome, both of which are also Google properties, and 19 for Facebook, 29 for Instagram and 33 for Twitter. Aside from his personal interest, Messina said he's disappointed because Facebook, with its more than 1.3 billion users, needs competition. ""The future of digital identity should not be determined by one company (namely, Facebook),"" he said. ""I still believe that competition in this space is better for consumers, for startups, and for the industry. And Google still remains one of the few companies (besides Apple, perhaps) that stands a chance to take on Facebook in this arena -- but Google+, as I see it, has lost its way.""","Former Google+ developer says the social tool has failed .

"Student protesters pack the streets. Violence surges. Tear gas billows. Opposition leaders and government officials blame each other for the unrest, and both sides show no sign of backing down. No matter who you believe, it's clear that tensions are running high in Venezuela. The anti-government demonstrations are the biggest threat President Nicolas Maduro has faced since his election last year. And inside and outside the South American country's borders, there's a major question many are asking: Could this be the beginning of the end for Venezuela's socialist government? Searching for truth in Venezuela . The situation doesn't look pretty. Inflation topped 56% last year. Crime rates are high. Goods shortages have left store shelves bare. But the next election is years away, and experts say it's likely too soon to start ringing the death knell for Hugo Chavez's revolution just yet. A variety of scenarios could play out in the coming days, depending on the steps authorities and protesters take. And, with so many factors in flux, it's difficult to guess what's next. ""Anything can happen now,"" said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College. ""This is a real crisis on all fronts. The government has ways to survive...but at the same time, it can lose this battle."" Here are some possible game-changers to keep an eye on: . Government crackdowns on protesters . Leopoldo Lopez, the opposition politician accused by the government of inciting violence and leading the recent protests, is behind bars, facing charges of arson and conspiracy. Maduro has vowed to crack down on other opposition leaders like him, calling them fascists and comparing them to a disease that must be cured. He's defended that approach in national television broadcasts, accusing protesters of violence, vandalism and plotting a slow-motion coup. ""Is capturing these people repression? Or is it justice?"" Maduro said after airing videos during a national broadcast that he said showed opposition attacks on government buildings. Any ratcheting up of repression could have a major cost for the government, possibly turning supporters at home and abroad against it, said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. ""In contrast to Venezuela's serious problem with street crime, for which the government does not traditionally pay a political price, for this kind of repression it will,"" Smilde wrote in an analysis of the situation this week. ""At best, it reveals a government that cannot control its guns. At worst, it reveals a government that is as violent as its opponents have long claimed."" On the other hand, the government could defuse the situation. ""If the government responds in some way and deals with the situation by relieving some of the distress and trying not to clamp down further, and showing some flexibility and some willingness to engage in some dialogue and moderation, then I think it could weather this period,"" said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank. Support from Chavistas . There's one major reason analysts point to when they say that Venezuela's socialist government isn't approaching any sort of imminent collapse: Many people in the country are still behind the President. ""Maduro has a lot of support,"" said George Ciccariello-Maher, an assistant professor of political science at Drexel University. ""He's not Chavez, but he's seen as a relatively faithful representative of what Chavez stood for."" The cornerstone of Chavez's presidency was the Bolivarian Revolution, his ambitious plan to turn Venezuela into a socialist state. Social ""missions"" aimed at eradicating illiteracy, distributing staple foods and providing health care popped up across the country. Chavez was elected and re-elected in large part thanks to support from the country's poor, who felt marginalized by previous governments. He tapped into their needs and frustrations -- often through confrontations with the Venezuelan elite. Maduro -- who Chavez tapped as his successor before he died -- has taken a similar tack. His narrow election victory last year was closer than supporters had hoped, but he still won. Throngs of Maduro's dedicated followers still call themselves Chavistas in devotion to the former president. Even though Maduro is nowhere near as charismatic as Chavez, for many, he's still better than the alternative, Shifter said. ""They perceive that there are parts of the opposition that want to go back to pre-Chavez Venezuela, which basically ignored the concerns of the poor,"" Shifter said. ""They don't want to lose what they think they've gained."" A key challenge for the opposition is chipping away at Chavistas' support for the government. If they can win over Chavez loyalists, that could tip the scales. Ciccariello-Maher, who authored ""We Created Chavez: A People's History of the Venezuelan Revolution,"" argues that's not likely. The revolution, he says, is much bigger than Chavez or Maduro. ""The Chavista government has been in power for more than 14 years and has won a larger number of elections than any other government essentially on earth because they mobilized the poor and have a strong support base among the poor, and also a chunk of the middle class,"" Ciccariello-Maher said. ""This support base is not going anywhere, and it's not going to disintegrate because a relatively small number of students are protesting in relatively middle class areas of the country."" Follow the money . For months, major goods shortages have left shelves bare in Venezuelan stores. The government accuses distributors of orchestrating the shortages as part of an ""economic war"" to fuel unrest. The opposition says that's one of many painful examples that show the government's mishandling of the country's finances. While the populist platform of sharing Venezuela's vast oil wealth with the poor and disenfranchised has helped reduce poverty, critics have warned that flawed economic policies -- such as currency controls and expropriation of private companies -- set the country on a crash course toward financial ruin. Despite government efforts to stem inflation with price controls, analysts have said the economic picture looks bleak. It's no coincidence that tensions are running high while Venezuela faces significant economic problems, experts say. ""This has been sort of a cyclical phenomenon of protests in Venezuela,"" Shifter said. ""But I think we're at a different point in the evolution of a situation, a point where the economic situation is what's driving what's happening...more than anything else, just the shear economic desperation for many people and the shortages and the rising inflation."" And if those problems worsen, it's not good for the government. ""If Venezuela experiences a serious economic meltdown, the opposition movement could grow, despite not making any efforts to reach beyond its traditional base,"" Smilde said. Military might . Right now, analysts say the military seems to be squarely behind Maduro. That wasn't the case in 2002, when Chavez was briefly ousted from power by a military coup. ""The military is much more Chavista than it was in 2002,"" Ciccariello-Maher said. But there could come a moment, Corrales said, when the military's loyalties are challenged. ""If they are asked to be repressive,"" he said, ""they will face a difficult choice of whether to comply or not."" Who's protesting? The recent protests have highlighted growing discontent with Venezuela's government, but also rifts within the opposition -- a disparate group of parties that banded together in an attempt to defeat Chavez at the polls and now hope Maduro's government will fall. Henrique Capriles Radonski, a leading opposition politician who lost his bid for the presidency last year, has been trying to take a more moderate approach and build a broader support base. But Lopez and other opposition leaders have pushed for protests in the streets. A looming question is whether the opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable -- which includes parties with a wide range of ideologies within its ranks -- can stick together for a common political goal. ""Behind the scenes, the opposition is very much cracking,"" Ciccariello-Maher said. If more militant members of the opposition attempt a coup, he said, that will only backfire the next time Venezuelans head to the polls. Smilde said he's seen how much Lopez's impassioned speeches have fired up crowds. ""This movement is energizing the opposition base in a way they haven't been in eight years,"" Smilde said. ""But there seems to be little effort to reach out to disgruntled Chavistas, or broaden the message towards issues of equality and poverty reduction that might mobilize a broader coalition."" The toughest challenge the opposition faces might be keeping up the momentum they've started. ""It's very hard to sustain protests. There have been other moments when there have been protests in Venezuela, and they come and they go,"" Shifter said. ""If this one goes and sort of dies down, then I think Lopez, his star may fade, and this whole episode may pass.""","Experts say it's too soon to ring the death knell for Hugo Chavez's revolution .

"No nation is immune to the impact of climate change but it is the world's poorest that will be hit the hardest. A fair and inclusive global agreement to combat climate change is a moral imperative. Time is of the essence for Africa. World leaders are gathering today in New York for the Climate Summit in an attempt to breathe new life into climate talks, which are now approaching their 21st round. With the Kyoto Protocol deadline fast approaching, it remains to be seen how much international support Africa can leverage to advance its agenda. We all know that enlightened leadership is essential. Politicians must think beyond their tenure. Countries must look beyond their borders. We need a radical rethink of how the world makes and uses energy. But with China and India -- which together account for almost a third of global emissions -- deciding not to attend, it will be a challenge for the Summit to fulfill its potential. In China and India's absence, small, developing nations must unite. It is they that bear the greatest burden of climate change. We can no longer wait for the world's dominant powers to act benevolently for the benefit of all humanity. All countries, regardless of their level of development, must look to reduce their own CO2 emissions. We must prevent further warming and reverse the trend. We must act to mitigate the effects of climate change that are already being felt throughout the world. There is no doubt that climate change threatens to derail Africa's impressive recent growth and compromise the socio-economic gains made over the last decade. Africa's development relies heavily on climate-sensitive sectors including agriculture, fishing and tourism. Agriculture alone accounts for 30% of Africa's GDP and 50% of the continent's total exports. Even if the present pledges to limit emissions by 2020 are fulfilled, global temperature is still predicted to increase by 3.5 to 4 degrees Celsius by 2100. This would lead to a 30% reduction in rainfall in sub-Saharan Africa, which would be disastrous on a continent in which 96% of agriculture is rain fed. Persistent drought and flooding are already exacerbating food and water insecurity, threatening livelihoods and health. Severe droughts in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel between 2011 and 2012 saw crops fail and livestock die, leaving 13 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. The effectiveness with which Africa addresses the link between food production, water and energy will determine how many millions are pulled out of poverty in the coming decades. No less than a climate-smart agricultural revolution is needed to guarantee food security. Water management strategies must be developed to protect and rehabilitate groundwater sources and river basins. The energy sector should be geared towards the promotion and adoption of clean and renewable sources of power. And African governments and business leaders must make significant investments in science and technology to support mitigation and adaptation efforts. While international assistance is vital, effective and sustainable solutions must be developed locally. Developing nations have the opportunity to 'do it right.' Partnerships must be created to share technology and best practice. We must end the specter of national self-interest in a world where climate change knows no boundaries. If emerging economies focus on growth at all costs we risk handing future generations a terrible legacy. There is a wealth of evidence to show that the impact of climate change will be more expensive than the changes needed to halt it. But what is clear is that for the first time Africa is not on the back foot. The continent is beginning to adopt a proactive approach to tackling climate change, empowering its people and strengthening its institutions. The continent's impressive economic growth, buoyed by an export boom, improved governance and increased foreign investment has fueled the 'Africa Rising' narrative. By 2050, a quarter of the global population will be African, and 60% of Africans will live in cities. The continent is on the cusp of a transformation. Policy makers are developing ambitious plans to create clean and green economies across Africa. Partnerships are being forged between government, the private sector and civil society for the swift implementation of national climate action plans. In the absence of global leadership from those countries which contribute most to climate change, small, developing nations must do what they can to ensure that their interests are represented before it's too late. Ahead of next year's crucial U.N. Climate Change Conference in Paris, which will set a new agenda to replace the Kyoto Protocol, it is essential that African countries not only make their voices heard, but they make them count.

"TV's Judge Joe Brown was jailed on a contempt of court charge issued by a Tennessee juvenile judge Monday, according to a court spokesman. Brown, 66, was sentenced to five days in jail after he became ""pretty raucous"" and ""challenged the authority"" of Magistrate Harold Horne, another judge told CNN. He was later released on his own recognizance, CNN Memphis affiliate WMC-TV reported, citing the Shelby County Sheriff's Office. Brown, a former Shelby County criminal judge, was in court to represent a client in a child-support case. He apparently became upset when he was told the case was not on the afternoon docket, Chief Magistrate Dan Michael said. Horne, who ""is a real laid-back guy,"" gave Brown several chances to calm down before finding him in contempt, Michael said. Horne held Brown was in contempt five times ""before they were able to get him out of the courtroom, Michael said. The court staff and judges ""were all kind of floored"" by Brown's behavior, Michael said. Brown was booked into the Shelby County jail in Memphis Monday afternoon, sheriff's spokesman Chip Washington said. Brown presided over a syndicated reality TV show based on court case arbitration for 15 years until it was canceled last year. He announced his candidacy for the Shelby County district attorney post last month. CNN reached out to Brown's representatives but has not yet received a response. CNN was first alerted to Brown's arrest by a Twitter posting.","Brown is released from jail on his own recognizance, CNN affiliate reports .

"What do you give the sheik who's already checked palaces and private planes off his royal wish list? How about a menagerie of exotic animals? That's partly the story of how a Noah's Ark of indigenous and introduced species came to populate Sir Bani Yas, once an inhospitable salt dome island in the Arabian Gulf. Part of Abu Dhabi emirate, the previously private royal playground now welcomes visitors seeking an Arabian safari experience combined with an encounter with that non-indigenous desert species, the multi-star luxury hotel. Animal-loving emir . The founder and first ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan started collecting many of the species now thriving in the island's huge wildlife park after, so the story goes, being given a bevy of exotic creatures as a gift when exploring Africa as a young royal. Long before cheetahs, giraffes, Ethiopian hedgehogs -- and well-heeled tourists -- were introduced to Sir Bani Yas, however, Sheik Zayed was transforming the island with a particular aim: to save a native species that had virtually been wiped out. The Arabian oryx, a kind of antelope, was officially declared extinct in the wild in the late 1960s. Its plight moved the animal-loving emir to begin developing Sir Bani Yas (named after the local Bani Yas tribe) as a place to protect it. Only the oryx . ""The oryx is the main reason the island is the way it is today,"" says Matt Bottomer, an adventure guide who familiarizes visitors staying on Sir Bani Yas with its many resident creatures. ""Sheikh Zayed searched the world to see if there were any oryx in captivity. ""He found a handful and started a breeding program here."" To prepare the island for those few remaining antelope in the early 1970s, the late sheik launched an extravagant project that might now be seen as a precursor to other slightly incongruous Middle Eastern behemoths, such as Dubai's indoor ski resort. He decided literally to make the desert bloom. Once desert, now forest . Hundreds of thousands of trees, including acacia, ghaf (the national tree of the UAE), frankincense, gum and mangrove were planted in the desert scrubland of the 87-square-kilometer island to create a habitat for the oryx and other animals. The first trees didn't fare so well. The antelope nibbled away at them a bit too eagerly, and they had to be replanted. They've since grown to a forest of 4 million, irrigated by desalinated water pumped through an undersea pipeline from the mainland, giving the island an improbably green sheen in this desert environment. As for the oryx, ""now we have around 500 on Sir Bani Yas,"" Bottomer explains. The herd has become healthy enough that animals bred on the island are released into the desert wilds of the mainland. Indeed, some species have come to feel so at home in the wildlife park that other animals have been brought in to keep their numbers down. Cheetahs were shipped over to eat the Arabian sand gazelle, which they hunt in the wild, Hyenas and jackals were brought in to clean up anything the big cats left. Animal spectacle . All of this makes for a great spectacle. Only a limited number of visitors were allowed on the island when the wildlife park was established in the 1970s. The weekend tours became so popular they had to be booked more than a year in advance. Since Sheik Zayed's death, in 2004, Sir Bani Yas has gradually become more accessible. Reached by a 50-seat plane from Dubai or Abu Dhabi, or a 250-kilometer drive from the UAE capital followed by a ferry crossing, Sir Bani Yas recreates a wilderness, but you won't be staying in a tent. Accommodation is in one of three luxury resorts, meaning the wind-down from exploring the wildlife park on a safari-style drive, by foot on a guided walk or by mountain bike, is pretty pampered. Wild drives . ""You can get really close to the animals on the wildlife drives,"" Bottomer says. ""I've driven along and the cheetahs have been five meters from the car."" Guided wadi hikes in the mountains, nature walks on the southeast of the island and mountain biking inside and outside the park are even more direct ways of experiencing the territory. ""Each offers the chance to find different animals in different habitats,"" Bottomer says. The animals are the main attraction for most visitors, but you can also kayak along the mangrove shores or scuba dive off the island. Funnily enough, one of animal you won't spot on Sir Bani Yas is a camel. These ships of the desert do well enough on the mainland without needing the island's  protection . They were also probably never a terribly original idea as a gift for a royal sheik. Getting there . Rotana Jet (+971 2 444 3366) flies from Abu Dhabi and Dubai to Sir Bani Yas Island, with single fares starting from $54. Become chummy enough with the Abu Dhabi royal family and you might get an invitation to one of two palaces they maintain in the island's southern section. Failing that there are three resorts on the island, with accommodation ranging from rooms in a former royal palace to upscale villas, all run by Anantara (+971 2 801 5400), which can also arrange day trip tours. Rooms from around $220 a night. Find out more about visiting Bani Yas at Desert Islands Abu Dhabi.","UAE founder Sheik Zayed ""made the desert bloom"" on Sir Bani Yas island .

"SEDONA, Arizona (CNN) -- Instead of appealing for votes on the campaign trail, Sen. John McCain spent the weekend playing host at his rustic Arizona home -- and on Sunday members of the traveling press corps were his guests. It was a news-free zone, and a charm offensive to be sure -- but also a window into the private setting and self-described oasis of the man who may be days away from mathematically clinching the GOP nomination, months after being left for political dead. McCain greeted reporters as he tended to the grill -- tongs in hand -- on the deck of his ranch house. Clad in a green Maine Maritime Academy baseball hat, white sweat shirt with a photograph of his family on it, faded Levis jeans and New Balance sneakers, the presidential candidate stood over two large, sizzling barbecues, preparing baby back ribs and grilled chicken. McCain revealed that barbecuing for guests is one of the few ways he relaxes, especially during the grueling campaign, and was eager to share his carefully honed recipe on the gas grill: baby back ribs (bought at Costco), cooked bones down with a dry rub that's a third garlic powder, a third salt and a third pepper. The trick to not letting it dry out? Keep putting lemon juice on, the senator said. When a print journalist tried to switch gears to more substantive issues, the candidate who tends to take questions from reporters on the road multiple times a day responded, ""No interviews, this is a social event,"" which also meant no news pictures or video. McCain's wife, Cindy, and daughter Meghan also were milling around as well as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina; former Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and his wife, Wendy; Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. and his wife, Mary Kaye; top McCain aide Mark Salter; and senior adviser Charlie Black. McCain took a break from the barbecue, where he was constantly cutting the sizzling meat and feeding reporters right from the grill, to give a short tour around his Hidden Valley property. McCain said the valley was settled by Mormons and that the Hidden Valley Ranch got its name from the horseshoe shape of the creek that runs through the property. He said he built the first house on his property 24 years ago and now there are six houses on his lot. During a tour of the grounds, he peppered guests with wildlife information -- pointing out the black hawk nest overlooking the creek while talking about watching the mother teach the baby how to fly and joking about the woodpecker ""condominium,"" telling reporters that woodpeckers had to peck a different nest every year. He said there were 67 kinds of birds on the property and that they also had the occasional coyote or cougar. Dinner was served on tables by Oak Creek, which runs through the property. The menu included ribs, grilled chicken, hot dogs, bratwurst, hamburgers, beef tamales, couscous and pasta salad. A day earlier McCain hosted some of his closest political friends whose public endorsements and private advice helped propel his candidacy. That guest list included Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty. McCain was mum about his political guests, except to say he enjoyed sharing the ranch with people and that he didn't like solitude. After dinner, McCain showed the press into his living room, decorated with leather sofas, a painting of the Grand Canyon and a Navajo rug tapestry. On the coffee table sat the Profile in Courage Award he received in 1999, and the July 2005 Architectural Digest that featured the senator and his wife on the cover in their Phoenix home. Also on the walls are framed paintings and pictures drawn by his children when they were young, something McCain said he very much enjoys and was ""all Cindy's idea."" McCain said the original architect went through some changes in fortune during construction that were evident in the structure of the house: when he was doing well, he would put in things such as a stained-glass window, but when times were lean, he would use exposed plywood. Dessert was served on the deck to Frank Sinatra tunes, one of the senator's favorites, and McCain held court with reporters for a few more minutes, recalling some of the highlights of the 2008 campaign trail but not revealing anything about his future plans.

"London (CNN)Germany's Cologne Cathedral turned off its lights Monday in a symbolic rejection of an anti-Islamification rally taking place in its shadow. The protest group ""Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West,""  or PEGIDA, called for people to take to the streets at 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. GMT) Monday  in the cities of Cologne, Kassel and the German capital Berlin. It follows a December 22 protest in Dresden during which the city's opera house -- Semperoper -- turned its lights on and off to signify its rejection of PEGIDA. Semperoper has a banner reading ""Refugees are welcome here"" as its main profile image on Facebook. In a Facebook post December 30, Cologne Cathedral Provost Norbert Feldhoff said Monday's protest would ""certainly not take place in the light of the cathedral."" Following the example of the Semperoper, Feldhoff said, ""the Cologne Cathedral will be shrouded in darkness."" ""The High Cathedral will not be a backdrop for this demonstration,"" he said. ""As a highly visible protest against xenophobia, racism and exclusion, the outdoor lighting of Cologne Cathedral will therefore be turned off on January 5 for the period of the demonstration."" On its Facebook page, PEGIDA says citizens should ""wake from their slumber"" and recognize the ""danger in the Islamic ideology."" ""Stop the radical Salfists' Islamization"" it urges. ""As a society, we should give people the chance to integrate, but we should not allow ourselves to be Islamized thereby losing our freedom and democracy!"" German state broadcaster Deutsche Welle reported that more than 17,000 people participated in the Dresden rally last month, where they were met by some 4,000 counterprotesters. Police in Cologne said they would have an increased presence in light of Monday's planned protests, with several hundred officers set to be on the city's streets. Meanwhile, CNN's Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin said that PEGIDA protesters in the capital were likely to number in the hundreds and be met by thousands of counterprotesters. A poll by German newspaper Der Speigel in December found that 34% of respondents believed their country was becoming ""increasingly Islamicized."" German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Monday that he was ""worried by this tendency"" but the significance of the protests should not be overestimated. ""It's new, it's concerning, but we should not be dominated by PEGIDA when we discuss our political agenda,"" he said. On the other hand, he said protesters posed some questions that needed to be answered. ""They ask: 'Is there an end of asylum seekers, how dangerous is Islam for our society, what about the fight against IS (ISIS) -- can this be successful?' These critical questions have to be faced, have to be answered,"" de Maziere said. But he said he did not fear a rise of ugly nationalism in Germany again. ""I'm confident we are strong,"" he said. ""We learned our lessons from the Nazi years and you can see it's very interesting that the organizations of PEGIDA, they know exactly where the red line is which they should not cross --  this makes me more skeptical but they know where the taboos are in Germany so I don't see a renewal of the NPD (the far-right National Democratic Party) -- it's less than in other European countries. And we are very well aware of it and we will fight against every tendency."" De Maziere said Germany was in the process of changing its asylum laws: ""We say yes to immigration in our interests, we say yes to our humanitarian responsibility towards asylum seekers and we say no to those who only come  because of economic reasons,"" he said. De Maiziere said the criminal organizations trafficking people into Europe needed to be stopped. ""We have to get the people ready to welcome real refugees and we have to fight against these criminal organizations."" In her New Year's speech, German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed the issue of xenophobia, urging citizens not to attend such rallies. Such demonstrations encourage the exclusion of people because of their skin color or religion, she said. Merkel urged people not to attend such demonstrations, where people have ""hatred in their hearts,"" she said. ""We know the value of unity in our country,"" she said. ""It is the foundation of our success.""","Cologne Cathedral turns off its lights to protest against anti-Islamization rally on Monday .

"NASA's rover Curiosity successfully carried out a highly challenging landing on Mars early Monday, transmitting images back to Earth after traveling hundreds of millions of miles through space to explore the red planet. Scientists praised the landing Monday. ""This is a stunning achievement. The engineering went flawlessly,"" said Scott Hubbard, who was the first Mars program director at NASA headquarters and is now a consulting professor at Stanford University. The 10 science instruments aboard Curiosity are in ""perfect health,"" and testing and calibration are under way, NASA said Monday. Some rover team specialists are analyzing the data from the landing, while others are preparing Curiosity for exploring Gale Crater, where it landed, NASA said. On its first full day on Mars, the rover is tasked with raising its high-gain antenna, enabling it to communicate directly with Earth at higher data rates. The primary method of transmitting data is through the orbiters, because that is more energy-efficient. When asked whether anything had gone wrong during the landing, Jennifer Trosper, a mission manager with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, said simply, ""No."" ""There's a lot ahead of us, but so far we are just ecstatic about the performance of the vehicle,"" she told reporters at an afternoon news conference. She said the rover will start sending weather data Tuesday but some of the ""exciting science"" won't begin for about nine Mars days. ""It does take time to check out the vehicle,"" she said. Social media sites were bubbling with posts from enthusiastic Earthlings on Monday. The rover even has its own Twitter account, @MarsCuriosity. It informs readers: ""FYI, I aim to send bigger, color pictures from Mars later this week once I've got my head up & Mastcam active #MSL"" Meet a rover driver: His car is on Mars . The $2.6 billion Curiosity made its dramatic arrival on Martian terrain in a spectacle popularly known as the ""seven minutes of terror."" This jaw-dropping landing process, involving a sky crane and the world's largest supersonic parachute, allowed the spacecraft carrying Curiosity to target the landing area that scientists had meticulously chosen. The mission control in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory burst into cheers as the rover touched down Monday morning. Team members hugged and high-fived one another as Curiosity beamed back the first pictures from the planet, while some shed tears. At the news conference, NASA showed off some of the initial images, including one of Mount Sharp, which rises 3.4 miles above the floor of the Gale Crater, according to NASA. ""We can see more clearly these pebbles all over the ground,"" said Joy Crisp, a deputy project scientist with the mission. ""We can see that it is very flat. ... There are no obstacles for driving [the few miles from the landing site]"" to Mount Sharp. Scientists cannot tell yet how easy it will be to scoop up the surface material, she said. ""I think the science team has a lot of work to do to figure out how were these materials put there,"" she said. ""Was water involved? We don't know yet."" President Barack Obama weighed in on the historic moment. ""The successful landing of Curiosity -- the most sophisticated roving laboratory ever to land on another planet -- marks an unprecedented feat of technology that will stand as a point of national pride far into the future,"" Obama said in a statement congratulating the NASA employees who had worked on the project. The scientific community reacted with a mixture of elation and relief. ""Rationally I know it was supposed to work all along, but emotionally it always seemed completely crazy,"" said James Wray, assistant professor at Georgia Tech, who is affiliated with the science team of Curiosity. ""So to see all those steps being ticked off and actually working, it's a huge relief."" The initial images the SUV-size rover sent back to Earth were black and white and grainy, but one showed its wheel resting on the stony ground, and the vehicle's shadow appeared in another. More space and science news from CNN Light Years . A camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter captured an image of the 2,000-pound rover with its parachute still attached as it made its way down toward Gale Crater. At that point, the rover was about two miles from the planet's surface. The spacecraft had been traveling away from Earth since November 26 on a journey of about 352 million miles (567 million kilometers), according to NASA. Curiosity, which will be controlled from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has a full suite of sophisticated tools for exploring Mars. They include 17 cameras, a laser that can survey the composition of rocks from a distance and instruments that can analyze samples from soil or rocks. The aim of its work is ""to assess whether Mars ever had an environment able to support small life forms,"" NASA said. Curiosity's first stop was Gale Crater, which may have once contained a lake.  After at least a year, the rover will arrive at Mount Sharp, in the center of the crater. The rover will drive up the mountain examining layers of sediment. This process is like looking at a historical record because each layer represents an era of the planet's history, scientists said. The phenomenon of sedimentary layers is remarkably similar to what is seen on Earth, in California's Death Valley or in Glacier National Park in Montana, said John Grotzinger, chief scientist of the Mars Science Laboratory mission. Rocks and minerals found on Earth are different than on Mars, but the idea of a mountain made of layers is familiar to scientists. Unlike on Earth, however, Mars has no plate tectonics, so the Martian layers are flat and not disrupted as they would be on Earth. That also means that Mount Sharp was formed in a different way than how mountains are created on Earth -- no one knows how. Images: Exploring Mars . In these layers, scientists are looking for organic molecules, which are necessary to create life. But even if Curiosity finds them, that's not proof that life existed -- after all, these molecules are found in bus exhaust and meteorites, too, said Steve Squyres, part of the Mars Science Laboratory science team. If there aren't any organics, that may suggest there's something on the planet destroying these molecules, said Georgia Tech's Wray. But if Curiosity detects them, Wray said, that might help scientists move from asking, ""Was Mars ever habitable?"" to ""Did Mars actually host life?"" Curiosity's mission is also significant in an era when NASA's budgets are shrinking and China is becoming more ambitious in its space exploration program. ""I feel like it's a signal that we have the capability to do big and exciting things in the future."" said Carol Paty, assistant professor at Georgia Tech's School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences. ""You can't not be excited."" Liquid water is not something scientists expect to be apparent on Mars because the planet is so cold and dry, Squyres said. If the planet does harbor liquid water today, it would have to be deep below the surface, perhaps peeking out in a few special places, but not likely to be seen by Curiosity, Squyres said. Rover to search for clues to life on Mars . It's hard to know how long ago liquid water would have been there because there's no mechanism to date the rocks that rovers find on Mars, Squyres said. Evidence from the spacecraft NASA has sent to Mars so far suggests that the ""warm and wet"" period on the planet lasted for the first billion years of the planet's history. ""In order to create life, you need both the right environmental conditions -- which include liquid water -- and you need the building blocks from which life is built, which includes organics,"" Squyres said. The Mars Science Laboratory is a precursor mission to sharper technology that could do life detection, Grotzinger said. There aren't specific molecules that scientists are looking for with Curiosity. The attitude is: ""Let's go to an interesting place with good tools and find out what's there,"" Squyres said. What do you think about the Mars mission? Go to iReport . Curiosity is supposed to last for two years on Mars, but it may operate longer -- after all, Spirit and Opportunity, which arrived on Mars in 2004, were each only supposed to last 90 Martian days. Spirit stopped communicating with NASA in 2010 after getting stuck in sand, and Opportunity is still going. ""You take what Mars gives you,"" said Squyres, also the lead scientist on the Mars Exploration Rover Mission, which includes Spirit and Opportunity. ""If we knew what we were going to find, it wouldn't be this much fun.""","Testing and calibration are under way, NASA says .

"Authorities have imposed a curfew in Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city, following nights of deadly communal violence between Buddhists and Muslims. Two people have been killed and 14 injured since rioting erupted Tuesday, Col. Aung Kyaw Moe, Mandalay Region's Border Affairs and Security Minister, told CNN Friday. The rioting began when a mob attacked a tea shop owned by a Muslim man accused of raping a Buddhist woman, and continued the following night. Citing officials, the state-run New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported that eight separate conflicts took place in the region on Tuesday and Wednesday night, involving gangs of as many as 450 people, some armed with weapons including swords, firearms, knives, rods and ""incendiary materials."" One of the victims was Muslim and one Buddhist, officials said. Myanmar is a predominantly Buddhist country, with Muslims estimated to account for about 5% of the population. Myanmar has witnessed several outbreaks of violence targeting Muslims in recent years as the country emerges from decades of authoritarian military rule, threatening the country's fragile political reforms. Extremist Buddhist nationalist elements, such as the 969 Movement, have been accused of fanning the flames of hatred, and pushing for discriminatory laws, including a proposed ban on interfaith marriage. Fears of new unrest as Myanmar ponders monk-backed interfaith marriage ban . Radical Buddhist monks, including the 969 Movement's spiritual leader, Ashin Wirathu, appeared to have played ""a pivotal role"" in contributing to the latest unrest, said David Mathieson, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. Anger against the Muslim tea shop owner, a Muslim, had escalated after Wirathu had circulated a report of the alleged rape on his Facebook page, and called for a harsh government response to ""jihadist Muslims."" There had also been a significant monk presence among the mob, said Mathieson. ""The area where this happened is 5-10 minute drive from where Wirathu's monastery is,"" he said. ""This really is his heartland."" Matthew Smith, executive director of rights group Fortify Rights, said extremists were ""using social media as a platform to spread hateful anti-Muslim rhetoric and in some cases to incite violence."" Myanmar's government had temporarily suspended Facebook in an attempt to tamp down the unrest, he said. ""It's a tinderbox that could erupt to unprecedented levels of violence,"" he said. ""The authorities haven't done nearly enough to stem the rising tide of anti-Muslim sentiment, and in some cases the government is contributing to its growth, lending public support to extremists and inflammatory draft legislation while failing to protect at-risk Muslim communities."" However, one positive sign was that activists in Myanmar were beginning to stand up against online hate speech and racial violence, he said. One of the most influential voices in this movement is Nay Phone Latt, a blogger and former political prisoner who in April launched a campaign to counter hate speech with ""panzagar,"" or ""flower speech."" ""Our campaign is trying to change the people's mindset and trying to create a good culture,"" he said, adding that allowing religious and ethnic conflicts to fester had been a technique of Myanmar's rulers since colonial days. In the case of the Mandalay unrest, he said, ""we clearly saw that this conflict started from online incitements."" The government's failure to prevent the violence also needed to be questioned, he said. Religious violence has left hundreds of people dead and close to 150,000 homeless since unrest broke out in in the western state of Rakhine in June 2012, with the stateless Rohingya Muslim minority bearing the brunt of the violence. Outbreaks of anti-Muslim violence have occurred elsewhere in the country. Aung said nine people had been arrested over the violence. Five were Muslim and four Buddhist, he said.

"Only a few people would feel at ease to send Hillary Clinton cartoon clippings. Diane Blair was one of them. Throughout much of Bill Clinton's eight years in the White House, Blair -- a political science professor and longtime Clinton friend -- exchanged political and humor cartoons with the first lady. Nothing, it seemed, was too small or inconsequential to send back and forth. In May 1996, Hillary Clinton clipped a ""Mixed Media"" cartoon and sent it to Blair and her husband, Jim, with a note that read, ""It is rare that I can send you a comic strip you and Jim haven't seen -- but this one is too good not to share."" It showed a cow lying on a psychologist's chair with a thought bubble reading, ""I'm not a mad cow. ... I just have issues ..."" -- a reference to the mad cow scare at the time and the criticism of Hillary Clinton's role in her husband's failed health care reform effort in his first term. Romney: Hillary Clinton won't be judged by her husband's legacy . In the reliably loyal and closely protective Clinton inner circle, Blair was a power center for most of the former first lady's life. She counseled Clinton -- her friend since 1972 -- during the failed push for health care reform and was there for her through her husband's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. She had the first lady's ear on everything from Supreme Court nominees to relations with Capitol Hill. During all of these exchanges, Blair took copious notes and kept a sporadic diary of her interactions with the Clinton White House. Those documents, which were donated to the University of Arkansas after Blair's death in 2000, give an unguarded and detailed view into Clinton's life. (CNN reached out to Clinton's office for comment about the documents, but a spokesman did not respond.) Inside Politics: Eleanor Roosevelt's advice for Hillary Clinton . The comfort of old friends . The documents also show Blair's relationship with Clinton was one of trust, love and the comfort of old friends. Blair was born in Washington in 1938 and raised in the District until she went to Cornell University for a political science degree. She came back to Washington after graduation and worked as a legislative secretary and speechwriter for Sen. Stuart Symington of Missouri. Aside from a love of politics, both Clinton and Blair were Arkansas transplants, moving to the state because of the men they married. Clinton on critics: 'Don't get dragged down' In 1963, Blair married Hugh Kincaid, a member of the Arkansas Legislature, and the couple settled in Fayetteville, where Blair taught political science at the University of Arkansas. Skip Rutherford, a close friend of both women, called Blair a ""very welcoming person."" Rutherford, who is mentioned throughout Blair's documents, is now dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in Little Rock. ""When you were around her, you knew the conversation was going to be exhilarating,"" he said. In ""Living History,"" Clinton's 2003 memoir, the former first lady described Blair as the ""closest friend"" she had during those early years in northwest Arkansas. ""We played tennis and traded favorite books,"" Clinton wrote. ""Diane regularly met for lunch in the Student Union"" to ""share stories and gossip."" The fact that Blair and Clinton had arrived in Fayetteville by fate led her to call it ""Fate-ville"" in notes to Clinton. The Clintons and Blairs shared many of their most important moments together. After Diane and her first husband divorced, she married James Blair, a lawyer at Tysons Food, in 1979. Then-Gov. Bill Clinton performed their marriage and Hillary was the ""best person,"" as Clinton described in her book. Jim and Diane Blair stayed at the White House on the Clintons' first night there in 1993. And when the Democratic Party renominated Clinton in 1996, Blair was in the skybox with Hillary Clinton's family and closest friends. An unguarded look into the Clintons . Blair's documents give an unguarded look into the lives of Hillary and Bill Clinton, from Bill Clinton's days as Arkansas governor and rising Democratic star to the couple's time in the White House, warts and all. Blair wrote in her diary that Hillary Clinton called Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern who nearly brought down her husband's presidency, a ""narcissistic loony toon."" Hillary Clinton defended her husband's adultery by saying it was caused, partly, because ""the ugly forces started making up hateful things about them, pounding on them."" Blair also noted a 1994 conversation in which the first lady asked her for advice on ""how best to preserve her general memories of the administration and of health care in particular."" When asked why she wanted to keep the documents, Clinton replied, ""Revenge."" Confidante's diary: Hillary wanted to preserve records for 'revenge' During all of these times, Blair used her background as a historian and a researcher to document her interactions with Clinton. She kept fastidious notes, and her journal entries were incredibly detailed. Her boxes of documents are chock-full of White House letterhead, invites to Washington parties and internal campaign memos. Blair worked on both of Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns, and throughout much of it, the historian would document the ups and downs in polls, the stories that critiqued him and the positive moments the campaign experienced. After the 1992 race, Blair received permission to interview most of the campaign staff for a possible book, and now historians at the University of Arkansas are cataloging the interviews for an oral history collection. An inside view of a presidential campaign . ""What you really do get is this inside view of a political campaign,"" said Andrew Dowdle, the political science professor overseeing the oral history project. ""It is one of those really interesting situations where you have somebody that is an academic who is obviously thinking about the historical record about what is happening and at the same time is Hillary Clinton's best friend."" Blair papers offer insight into Hillary Clinton . In a sign of the times, Blair clipped magazine and newspaper stories about the Clintons. In the 16 boxes of documents housed at the University of Arkansas, dozens of folders were filled with newspaper clippings from Bill Clinton's time as governor and president. A Time magazine cover story was folded among those from Arkansas newspapers. These clippings also regularly made their way to the White House, where Blair's letters were expedited to go right to the Clintons and not to the White House correspondence office. After news of what Blair's notes revealed emerged last week, some columnists questioned her motivation for allowing the notes to be released. ""One might at least wonder whether Blair told Hillary she was taking notes that she would release posthumously,"" The Washington Post's Kathleen Parker wrote. ""That's certainly one form of life insurance. But wouldn't it have been more close-friendish to wait until all parties concerned were enjoying the hereafter before publishing notes that could damage the living?"" Friends in Arkansas close to both Clinton and Blair reject that notion, with one saying there was nothing ""sinister or Machiavellian about the notes that everyone are interested in."" ""I don't buy it. Knowing them both, I don't buy it,"" said Rutherford, the dean at the Clinton School of Public Service. ""I think her motive was history and political science."" He added, ""These are just two ordinary human beings, both brilliant, both smart, but who are above all personal buddies."" Hillary Clinton was a supporter of making the Blair records public in 2010. Blair's ""contributions will grow and live on, enlarging our understanding of history, politics and culture,"" Clinton said then. ""I hope also that some young scholar will come along and write the story of Diane,"" she said. ""We miss her still but this, along with so many of her contributions to us, lives on."" In May 2000, Blair was diagnosed with lung cancer. That year, the University of Arkansas awarded her an honorary doctor of laws degree, and she spoke at the commencement. Blair died a little more than a month after learning of her illness. She left behind her husband and two children. ""The tragic part in all this is that she got sick and she died, and the process was left unfulfilled,"" Rutherford said. ""It is tragedy for history, for Arkansas, and it is a personal tragedy for her friends.""","Longtime friend kept fastidious records of all things Clinton .

"Whether it's learning how to read and write or setting up your own farm, a Zambian computer tablet -- known as the ZEduPad -- is trying to open up the country's information highway. The brain child of British tech entrepreneur Mark Bennett, the ZEduPad principally teaches users basic numeracy and literacy skills, aimed at primary school children. ""It became clear that there was a huge need for this kind of technology,"" Bennett said, ""particularly tablet technology, which has come a long way in Africa in recent years."" After arriving in Zambia 30 years ago under the British Aid Program, Bennett worked in the computer department at the country's national university for over a decade before deciding to go it alone. ""We can really do something very major for the first time,"" he said. ""We've invested about $5 million to date... It's totally all-encompassing and quite prescriptive so we are aiming at being able to get to an untrained teacher in a deep rural area in the African bush."" Interactive learning . The ZEduPad is programmed in eight different languages native to Zambia with over 12,000 preloaded classes and lesson plans for untrained teachers in rural areas, according to Bennett. Approved by the Zambian Ministry of Education, the educational tablet allows children to create a personal profile on its seven-inch screen to keep track of their progress as well as exposing them to e-mail and Wikipedia. Bennett said the ZEduPad is set up to teach grades one to seven through interactive learning in every subject from math to PE, art and music. The technology comes at a time when Zambia's educational system is undergoing sweeping changes. Since 2001, the government has increased primary school enrollment rates by 90%. As a result, the World Bank has identified the landlocked southern African nation as having one of the most improved primary school education systems in the developing world. Bennett added: ""For years there was a problem with funding, education was not keeping up with population growth. Young people coming out of school and not being well suited or prepared to enter the job market.... We're trying to change that."" The ZEduPad gives children a grasp of vital technology skills in a landlocked country where broadband is scarce and only 18% of the nation's 14 million people have access to electricity, according to the World Bank. In addition to following the national curriculum, the tablet also contains farming and health information designed for adults to help prevent the spread of killer diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria. Outsourcing to China . The ZEduPad is currently manufactured, assembled and branded in China. The devices are then loaded onto a plane and transported to Zambia, where Bennett and his team install the software onto each tablet. ""It costs roughly $100 to have them made and landed here in this country,"" Bennett said. ""We sell them to teachers and schools for $200 at the moment. We hope to bring that price down. One of the other things we're trying to do is provide significant tech support."" After teachers purchase the ZEduPad, Bennett said his team of experts go into schools and provide tutorials for staff so that they can maximize the tablets' functions while learning how to deliver lessons to pupils. Bennett said the tablet has, at one time or another,  helped employ over 250 staff working in the development and distribution of the software from the company's base in the Zambian capital, Lusaka. He says he has approached the government over hiring assembly workers in Zambia but to no avail. He said that at a time when few companies are manufacturing technology outside of the Far East, production in China is ""the cheapest and most cost-effective thing to do."" 'Huge change' Looking ahead, Bennett doesn't want to stop at Zambia but hopes to roll the educational tablet out to a raft of other nations on the continent. He believes that as countries in the developed world continue to transition from desktop computers to smart devices, Africa has a real chance to leapfrog ahead. ""I think the next big challenge is going to come from a lot of people who have got very cheap mobile phones. We'll gradually see Android smartphones coming out for $70 or so... Huge change is happening at the moment,"" Bennett said. READ THIS: Africa's super telescopes .

"(CNN)Another of the dogs rescued in 2007 from NFL star Michael Vick's dog-fighting compound has died after spending her final years in an adoptive household in suburban Richmond, Virginia. Gracie, a black pit bull, died Monday morning, according to Amy McCracken, executive director of the Richmond Animal League. ""This morning, little, old, bow-legged Gracie passed away and got her angel wings. Any words we write here could never begin to express the profound, positive and lasting impact that this little, black pit bull had on so many people who encountered her or heard the story of her suffering and triumph,"" said a post on the animal's league's ""Gracie's Guardians"" Facebook page. ""We are and will be forever grateful for this little, broken black dog and everything she personified."" The dog arrived at the Richmond no-kill shelter in 2007 and was quickly adopted by the group's board president, Sharon Cornett, who renamed her Gracie. ""She had been used (at the Vick compound) as a breeding dog ... not as a fighter,"" McCracken told CNN. ""She was in pretty good shape when she got here."" According to McCracken, Gracie attended conferences and meetings about animal welfare and visited schools to show people they have nothing to fear from most pit bulls. ""Gracie was very, very friendly,"" said McCracken, who estimated Gracie was 12 or 13 years old. ""She loved people and was never aggressive to other dogs."" Gracie was one of some 50 pit bulls seized by authorities in April 2007 amid charges that Vick, then a quarterback with the Atlanta Falcons, was operating an illegal dog-fighting ring on his Virginia property. The case sparked an outcry over brutal treatment of the dogs, some of which showed signs of injuries and other abuse. A federal judge determined the fate of Gracie and the other surviving dogs, who were taken in by animal sanctuaries, shelters, foster homes and adopters throughout the country. Twenty-two of the dogs were sent for rehabilitation and long-term care at Best Friends Animal Society's sanctuary in Kanab, Utah, while another large group went to a San Francisco pet shelter. One, named Georgia, made an appearance on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show before dying in 2013. Another, Hector, became a therapy dog and died of cancer in October. Vick pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges involving illegal dog fighting and spent 18 months in prison before resuming his NFL career. Created by the Richmond animal shelter, Gracie's Guardians is an initiative dedicated to the welfare of pit bulls, which have attracted controversy because of isolated attacks on humans and the breed's ties to dog fighting. The group chose Gracie as their namesake ""in tribute to her perseverance and that of countless other pit bulls who have suffered or continue to suffer at the hands of people, yet whose spirits and love for humans remains untarnished.""","Gracie the pit bull became something of a goodwill ambassador for her breed .

"Eleven years ago, Brenda Heist dropped off her young kids at school -- and never returned. Not to pick them up later, and not to their Pennsylvania home. The family thought she was dead. That something terrible had happened to her. What else could explain the sudden disappearance of a woman her daughter, then 8, later described as a ""great"" mom? But then last week, after more than a decade, Heist turned up in Florida, revealing to police that she hadn't been kidnapped or killed. She had, she said, been stressed. Most mothers are familiar with the feeling -- for some it's more fleeting than for others -- of total exhaustion, frustration, a sense of being overwhelmed by duty and the responsibility of raising children. Maybe some indulge in a momentary fantasy of running away. Though there are no hard numbers, reports would seem to indicate that the number of moms who actually do run away -- or at least walk away -- is increasing. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of single fathers has been rising steadily, from more than 600,000 in 1982 to more than 2 million in 2011. Anecdotally, too, we're hearing more from mothers who leave their children due to choice or circumstance. There's Rahna Reiko Rizzuto, who wrote in an essay for Salon.com that she realized, when her sons were 3 and 5 that she didn't want to be a full-time mother anymore. There are even support groups now for women who decide to leave their children. What is happening? It's hard to say, but our increasingly me-first world might have something to do with it. According to a study published in the journal Social Psychology and Personality Science, clinical narcissism --defined by heightened feelings of entitlement, decreased morality and a dog-eat-dog mentality -- has increased by 30% over the past 20 years. Two out of every three people now measure high for the disorder. In her book ""The Narcissism Epidemic,"" Jean Twenge argues that we live in a culture that not only tolerates, but also encourages, ""being true to ourselves"" and ""never compromising."" This can extend to parenthood, as more and more mothers and fathers resist the notion that parenthood is necessarily life changing -- and perhaps not all it's cracked up to be. A 2010 New York magazine story titled ""All Joy and No Fun: Why parents hate parenting,"" for example, cited a 2004 study by behavioral economic Daniel Kahneman that found that child care ranked 16th in pleasure out of 19 activities among the Texas women surveyed. Except, of course, parenting isn't always supposed to be fun. Whoever said it was? Mothers who abandon their children tend to be judged far more harshly by society, and by their children, than fathers who do the same -- though not because of outcome. According to various studies, including a 1994 report in the Journal of Family Issues, children raised in single-father homes as a whole fare as well as those in single-mother homes. From an emotional standpoint, there are no studies to show that children of absentee mothers are angrier than those of absentee fathers. But anecdotally, this seems to be the case. If this is true, it has to do with the fact that although stereotypical gender roles for women have changed, with more men staying home to raise the kids as mom brings home the bacon and father cooks it, societal expectations for mothers remain rooted firmly in the traditional. Case in point: Although the number of stay-at-home fathers -- about 154,000 according to the 2010 census -- is on the rise, women still carry out more of the domestic work, according to a report by Pew Research Center. American culture, meanwhile, is still conditioned --through the media and pop culture -- to believe that many women's greatest desire is to have a baby. When mothers abandon their children, it's seen as unnatural. Could this imbalance of responsibility and expectation be another reason more women are abandoning their children? It's possible. As one married mother of two, Janelle, told me, ""My husband doesn't do much. I have to do and plan for everything myself."" It's easy to see where resentment could come in. The positive spin: Most experts, myself included, agree that it's better for a child to have an absent parent than a parent who's present but neglectful -- or worse. And in my experience, children who come to accept the abandonment of a parent, specifically a mother, tend to be more forgiving when they believe that in doing so they were given a better life, whether that was the mother's intent or not. Of course, every single case is different and there are few generalizations to be made. Brenda Heist's children, for their part, want nothing to do with their mother. The good news is that being raised by a single parent does not condemn a child to a disadvantaged life. These days, the unconventional family is the norm. Thankfully, when it comes to parenting, it's quality over quantity.","After disappearing for more than a decade, Brenda Heist turned up in Florida .

"If we want to see a live Martian, even a tiny microbial one, we may be billions of years too late. Two new studies in the journal Science this week suggest that the Martian atmosphere hasn't changed much in terms of chemical composition in the past 4 billion years. It's much thinner than our planet's atmosphere, and the mix of ingredients isn't friendly to living organisms that are known to us. On the plus side, scientists are excited that the atmospheric analyses from instruments on board the Mars rover Curiosity square with what has been seen from meteorites that have landed on Earth from Mars. ""In a sense our measurements confirm that those meteorites are from Mars,"" said Chris Webster, program manager of the Planetary Science Instruments Office at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who led one of the studies. The main gas in Mars' atmosphere is carbon dioxide, at a whopping 96%, according to the scientists. Earth's atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, at 78%. The Martian atmosphere also has very low oxygen content -- 0.1% -- especially compared with our own atmosphere, which has 19%. More bad news for those who are eager to find life on the Red Planet: The rover has not detected methane so far, Webster said. This colorless gas is released by organisms as they digest nutrients, so it is an indicator of life, although it can also be produced in geological processes. Because of the harsh environment on Mars, the assumption is that any life that might be there is below the surface, and that it's microbial. ""By definition, if we don't detect methane, it means the probability that that's happening today is reduced significantly,"" he said. Still, the hunt for methane will continue as Curiosity, the most technologically advanced rover to explore Mars, continues its journey. Where did all that atmosphere go? Mars formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Scientists believe that, initially, the planet's atmosphere was 100 times denser than the Earth's atmosphere, Webster said. Now it's only about 1% as thick as Earth's atmosphere. So what happened? Sometime more than 4 billion years ago, scientists say, much of the atmosphere was stripped away. A leading theory is that the planet was hit hard during the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period in which comets, asteroids and other celestial objects were flying all over the solar system, delivering water to both Earth and Mars. One possible idea is that Mars was hit by a Pluto-sized planet, Webster said, which knocked out a lot of the atmosphere. The sun was also younger and more intense in its output of solar wind and certain kinds of high-energy radiation at that time. Without a protective magnetic field, Mars was vulnerable to high-energy particles from the sun, which is thought to have blown out a lot of the atmosphere, Webster said. ""It was lot of action in the first hundred million years or so, and then it settled down to be the atmosphere that we see today,"" he said. The Curiosity rover has given scientists better evidence than ever that Mars was once habitable; NASA announced in March that, based on the chemical analysis of a drilling sample from the rover, life could have existed there in the past. The rover found traces of clay that forms in the presence of water, indicating that water once flowed in Gale Crater, where the rover landed on August 6, 2012. Scientists cannot yet say how long that water sloshed around -- was it hundreds of thousands of years? Millions of years? Even hundreds of millions? ""The heavier the atmosphere would be back then, the easier it would be to maintain stable surface temperatures and for water to persist longer,"" said Paul Mahaffy, Chief of the Atmospheric Experiments Laboratory in the Solar System Exploration Division at NASA Goddard, who led the second Science study. What we've done on Mars and what's next . How isotopes tell the story . In the studies, scientists used instruments in Curiosity's onboard laboratory to study ratios of isotopes' key elements, such as the carbon and oxygen in carbon dioxide. Isotopes are different versions of a single chemical element but differ in the number of neutrons, which gives them unique atomic weights. Isotope ratios indicate a temperature history and other characteristics about the history of a substance, Webster said. ""If the gases in the atmosphere are the fingers on your hands, then the isotope ratios are the individual fingerprints; they're very high-resolution detail about the gas,"" he said. Scientists found a higher proportion of heavy isotopes of carbon and oxygen in the Martian atmosphere compared with what scientists believe was present in the raw material that went into forming the planet. In other words, there has been a loss of lighter isotopes over time. That indicates that much of the atmosphere has been lost over time, and that it happened from the top of the atmosphere rather than through interactions with the ground. ""Evidence in the atmosphere of loss of the lighter species -- in carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and so on -- kind of all point toward a process where the top of the atmosphere is eroding away into space,"" Mahaffy said. Webster and Mahaffy each used a different SAM instrument but came up with nearly the same ratios of carbon-12 to carbon-13, indicating accuracy. What else to come . Curiosity has a sophisticated suite of instruments on board, but other probes may be able to get a better handle on what's going on with the planet's atmosphere. In November, NASA will launch the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission (MAVEN) orbiter, which will try to measure the current rate of loss of the atmosphere, Mahaffy said. With that information, scientists can extrapolate back billions of years and calculate more precisely when it was that the atmosphere was thick and hospitable to life. There are also plans for a 2020 NASA rover mission. That mission's science team said in a recent report that it should look for indications that life once existed on the planet, collect samples for potential return to Earth and test technology relevant to human exploration. As of Wednesday, Curiosity had driven a total of more than a kilometer (0.62 miles) since landing last year. It is currently progressing toward Mount Sharp, which is composed of many layers that represent a record of geological time. By climbing this mountain and sampling layers along the way, the rover will unearth more clues about how the Martian environment evolved in the course of the planet's history. The $2.5 billion mission has already fulfilled the goal of showing that Mars was once habitable. The question remains: For whom?

"Pope Francis has unleashed a blistering critique of the Vatican bureaucracy -- or Curia -- criticizing its ""illnesses"" ranging from the ""disease of feeling immortal"" to vainglory and excessive planning. In his annual Christmas address to the Curia at the Vatican Monday, the Pontiff warned that ""a church that doesn't try to improve is like a sick body."" Francis said suggested that it would be helpful to the Vatican bureaucrats to have a catalog of their illnesses beginning with ""this disease of feeling immortal or indispensable."" The ""pathology of power,"" he said, could lead to people believing ""they are superior to others and not here for the service to others."" Francis warned against the disease of loss of compassion, which he said afflicted ""those who have a heart of stone."" ""Those who lose their inner serenity, their vivacity and audacity, to hide behind their papers, becoming like procedural machines rather than men of God. This is dangerous to lose human sensitivity, so necessary in order to cry with those who cry and enjoy with those who enjoy,"" the Pope said. Pope Francis referred to the diseases of ""excessive planning and functionalism"" and of ""bad coordination,"" which he said could occur when members did not collaborate with each other. There was also the risk of succumbing to spiritual Alzheimer's disease and ""forgetting the story of salvation,"" he said, warning that sufferers ""lost memory of their encounter with God."" The Pope described the diseases of rivalry and vainglory, and rebuked those who try to court their superiors ""inspired by their own egotism."" The disease of gossip, Francis said, he had addressed before -- but insufficiently. ""This is a serious disease that begins simply when people chatter, and it takes over the person, turning the person as a Satan, and in so many cases people are speaking ill about their own colleagues and brothers and sisters. These people haven't got the courage to speak directly, and they speak about others behind their backs,"" he said. ""Dear brothers, let us be aware and guard against the terrorism of gossip."" Pope Francis also appeared to speak to the child abuse scandal that has rocked the Catholic Church, referring to it as the ""disease of a closeness."" ""This disease also begins from good intentions, but with the passing of time enslaves its members, becoming a cancer which threatens the harmony of the body and causes a lot of evil and scandal, especially towards our small brothers and sisters,"" Francis said. Finally, Francis warned against the disease of the mundane -- ""of the exhibitionism when the apostle transforms his service in power."" ""This is a disease of people who seek tirelessly to multiply power only aimed at calumny, and to defame and discredit others,"" he said. Pope Francis concluded: ""Dear brothers, such diseases and such temptations are a naturally a danger for each Christian and for each Curia. For each community, for any ecclesiastical movement. They can damage both individually and the community. We have to say that only the Holy Spirit and the soul of Christ, only he can protect us from the disease. ""We have to cure ourselves of these. Let us try to grow together and close to Christ."" In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour that aired earlier this month, veteran Vatican watcher Marco Politi said Pope Francis had been encountering growing opposition within his own church. This was mainly due to Francis' efforts at reform since becoming Pope in March 2013, Politi said. ""Within the Church, there is a tough group of conservative bishops and priests and cardinals, and also very traditionalist bishops and cardinals who are practically against the Pope, who are working against the Pope,"" he said. ""They don't like what he wanted to do with the synod about family, to give new possibilities to remarried and divorced people to get the communion, or to have a new look on the homosexual union.""","Pope Francis addressed the Vatican bureaucracy -- or Curia -- on Monday .

One passenger, Thomas Piani, told CNN affiliate KGO that the crew ""kept telling us that we were going to leave, you know 15 minutes from now, 20 minutes from now, 30 minutes for now, for 12 hours,"" which ratcheted frustrations higher and higher. Tension was obvious in the tone of passenger tweets. ""...crew won't serve food,"" tweeted @SuzeTwtr . Passenger Venkatesh Pahwa told KGO, ""Everybody was fighting with each other, and the flight attendants were fighting with us, and we were fighting with the flights attendants."" ""Stuck in an @EtihadAirways flight on the ground for 10+ hours. And not allowed to get off. I feel like I'm in a 'Seinfeld' episode,"" passenger Ravali Reddy tweeted. In a statement, Etihad said that when the plane was on the ground awaiting permission to take off, ""passengers were provided with refreshments and were updated about the reasons for the rolling delay caused by the extreme weather conditions."" The airline said replacing the crew before taking off also contributed to the delay. A fresh crew had to be brought in because of rules that limit flight-time. The non-stop route from the Abu Dhabi to San Francisco is an ultra-long haul lasting 16 hours. The situation, Etihad said, was ""impacted by circumstances which were largely beyond our control."" Bad weather costs airlines and passengers flying into and out of the U.S. billions of dollars because of canceled and delayed flights. In the United States, federal regulations forbid airlines with 30 or more passenger seats on their domestic flights to allow their planes to remain on the tarmac for more than three hours without giving passengers the opportunity to disembark. Violators are subject to federal fines. Read more: High cost of flight delays . In July 2012, passengers on 13 United Airlines flights were stuck on their planes during severe thunderstorms at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for stretches ranging from just over three hours to nearly four-and-a-half hours.

"(CNN)Bill Cosby made things uncomfortable Sunday night on ""Celebrity Apprentice."" The beleaguered star isn't a contestant this season on the NBC reality show, which pits teams of celebs against each other for business-related tasks, but his name became embroiled in the season premiere's storyline. On Sunday NBC aired the first episode, which was filmed before rape and sexual assault allegations began mounting against Cosby. One of the competitors, Keshia Knight Pulliam, is famous for playing beloved youngest daughter Rudy Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show."" The actress served as project manager for her all-female team in which the women were trying to raise money for her charity Kamp Kizzy, which seeks to empower girls. After her team failed to fare as well as they could have in the challenge, they faced a grilling in the boardroom from host Donald Trump. ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" cast member Kenya Moore told Trump her teammate declined to reach out to former co-star Cosby for a donation. ""I have not talked to Bill Cosby on the phone in I don't know how long,"" Knight Pulliam said emotionally. ""So for me to pick up the phone, having not talked to you for five years, except for when we run into each other for a Cosby event, I feel that's not my place to do."" Her explanation was unacceptable to Trump, who said, ""I really believe, if you'd called that gentleman he would've helped you, even if you hadn't spoken to him in years. Because you were an amazing team with one of the most successful shows ever. So I think it would've been a very good call to make for charity."" Trump ""fired"" her from the show. While not directly commenting on her ousting from the series, the actress did tweet: ""Ohhh the deception of editing... Smh!!"" For his part, Trump tweeted to his followers after that: ""This show was taped just before the terrible Bill Cosby revelations came to light. She still should have asked him for money-goes to charity.""","Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Rudy on the 'Cosby' show, starred in 'Celebrity Apprentice'

"(CNN)It is difficult to know at what point things of horror become forgotten and slip out of the world's view. Perhaps it is when they are eclipsed by another, seemingly more pressing crisis. Or when it becomes almost impossible -- for safety or other reasons -- for outside observers to bear witness to their daily toll. Aleppo has, somehow, sometime between late 2012 when it was the open sore of the Syrian civil war, and today -- when the fight against ISIS has completely grabbed the world's attention span -- slipped off the radar screen. But here is why it must not: there remain an estimated 300,000 civilians there, in rebel-held areas alone. These are people who suffer any one -- or all -- of the following litany of afflictions daily: Barrel bombs -- randomly dropped, crudely made devices intended to maim, kill and terrify; warring rebel militia, also fighting with the regime; radical Islamic groups; shortages of food and water; people cutting down whatever trees they can find for fuel. And above all a sense, for months now, of hopelessness that their world has only worsened since the fight for Aleppo began in June 2012. That their fight has been deemed by some to be so incurable and intractable that the outside world has left Aleppo to its own devices -- willing to help the winner, but not to assist a victory. Aleppo is the greatest prize in the fight for Syria's north, but also its greatest victim. Aleppo, the biggest city, its commercial hub, its cultural heart, is a skeleton of what stood proudly merely three years ago. It is very difficult to gain independent access to Aleppo. You can count on one hand the number of western TV channels who have done so in the past year. CNN last entered in June, for six hours. Kidnapping is now the major hazard. After months of hospitality and risking themselves to assist journalists, rebels now find their ranks bedevilled by radicals and criminals who see foreign media often as a form of currency to help with boosting funds or dealing with another scourge: ISIS. There are a few exceptions who, through luck of contacts, manage to evade the various hazards. Brazilian photojournalist Gabriel Chaim managed to spend a month in Aleppo with some of the more moderate rebel groups. They provided him access to their world. Access to a school hidden away in a house where children still learn English. To an artist who commemorates the war's dead with paintings he etches out in a cave underground, that also serves as a bomb shelter. And to the front lines where the battle for Syria's largest city is being fought with a desperation not seen before. Chaim gained access to one key battle currently under way. And as in so much of Syria's war, it has been that way for months and will probably go on so, as the outcome is so vital that nobody is prepared to give up: the fight for a small hill called Handarat. The hill and its associated settlement lies to the northeast of Aleppo city, on a vital road into the rebel-held areas. The regime has a strong presence to its west and has been pushing up to the east for the past weeks. Daily, hourly, they push towards this raised bit of geography, which, if it were to fall into their control, would allow them to shell the only roads in and out of rebel-held areas, effectively denying the rebels, and the civilians who live among them, their use. Then, many fear, the siege of Aleppo would begin. The regime has tried this tactic -- dubbed ""Starve or Surrender"" -- before, namely in Homs. They besiege an area, deny its fighters and civilians food, medicine, everything. Eventually, the regime presents a deal: leave or surrender. The fear is that the fall of Handarat might present a similar opportunity for the regime. And then the humanitarian catastrophe currently brewing inside rebel areas would mushroom. Hanaa Singer, a spokesperson for UNICEF, says the situation this winter in Aleppo ""is very desperate, regardless whether areas are control of the government control or armed opposition groups."" Waterborne diseases continue to spread, partly because often as many as 50 to 70 displaced people share the same toilet. ""There is no electricity or fuel for heating which leaves many people with the only choice of cutting trees from the public spaces and use them to heat the houses"" she says, adding the situation is even harder for the displaced as many live in ""unfinished buildings or collective shelters where they have no windows, doors or even walls."" UNICEF estimates that 65,000 families risk being cut off from any assistance should the regime take Handarat hill -- that's about 300,000 people. Another 100,000 children simply need warm clothes for this winter, Singer adds. That is around Aleppo alone. This is the nightmare of being caught between a regime trying to besiege them on one side, and on the other, the evil of ISIS trying to impose their radical worldview.","An estimated 300,000 civilians are stuck in rebel-held areas around Aleppo .
They are at risk of barrel bombs and warring militias and are short of food, water and fuel .

"Washington (CNN)Like father, like son. Marion Christopher Barry, the 34-year-old son of Marion Barry, the iconic former D.C. mayor and council member who died last year, is running for his father's seat on the district's council. Barry -- who goes by Christopher -- declared his candidacy Monday, according to the D.C. Board of Elections. A special election to fill the late Barry's seat will be held on April 28, 2015. The newly minted candidate, whose candidacy has been rumored since shortly after his father died, later sent a tweet about making his bid official. In December, Barry told The Washington Post that he was ""just listening to what the people want,"" adding that ""God will send me the message"" about whether to run or not. Despite his name recognition, the path to the council will not be an easy one for Barry. He enters into a race with 24 declared candidates, including a number of prominent Democrats in Ward 8. During his years of power in D.C., the older Marion Barry became a national symbol of African-American political leadership. Barry was infamously busted in 1990 on law enforcement surveillance tape smoking crack cocaine in a drug sting involving the FBI and Washington police. That footage was televised. Barry was convicted of possession and served six months in prison. Barry, however, made a comeback and was elected to a fourth term as mayor in 1995. After leaving the mayor's office, the older Barry was elected to the council of the District of Columbia where he served until his death. Christopher Barry avoided prison in 2011 by pleading guilty for one felony PCP charge and another misdemeanor marijuana charge, according to the Washington Post. Barry received 18 months of supervised probation for the plea.

"New York (CNN)A man who started a biotech hedge fund was found shot to death in his upscale Manhattan apartment. His son, Thomas Gilbert Jr., was arrested on suspicion of homicide and criminal possession of a weapon. His father, Thomas Gilbert Sr., 70, founded the biotech and health care-focused hedge fund, Wainscott Capital Partners Fund, in 2011. His wife found his body in their eighth-floor apartment about 3:30 p.m Sunday. He had been shot in the head. At the scene, officers found a gun resting on Gilbert Sr.'s chest, with his left hand covering it, NYPD Chief of Detectives Bob Boyce told reporters. They saw what they perceived to be a staged crime scene, Boyce said, and set up surveillance at the son's apartment. Officers executed a search warrant at the son's apartment and found several pieces of potential evidence: magazine clips, loose rounds, a manufacturer's box of a Glock .40 caliber and a shell casing envelope with the serial number of the gun recovered at the crime scene, according to Boyce. Gilbert Sr.'s Beeckman Place apartment sits on a quiet street that houses several diplomats. ""Something just kaboom, just hit the floor loudly,"" said Christopher Kelly, who lives below Gilbert Sr.'s apartment, describing what he heard to CNN affiliate WABC.

"(CNN)After the Boston Marathon bombings, she slipped from public view, disappearing with her small child into the suburban Rhode Island home of her parents. To her neighbors, Katherine Russell was living like a ghost, rarely seen and never heard after her husband and brother-in-law were accused of plotting together and planting bombs that killed three people and injured more than 260 near the marathon's finish line. Federal investigators have questioned Russell, who married Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2010, but they haven't revealed what she told them. It's one of many questions looming as the trial for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,  her brother-in-law, starts this week. Federal prosecutors will not say if Russell, 25, is a suspect, a witness or simply a noninvolved widow. There have been no charges filed against her. Here are five things we know about Russell. 1. She has said she was in the dark about the Tsaranaev brothers' alleged plans. Investigators believe the pressure cooker bombs that went off at the marathon were at least partially made on the kitchen table of the tiny apartment she shared with Tamerlan Tsarnaev. The last time Russell saw her husband alive was just hours before he died in a gunbattle with police, a source close to the family told CNN shortly after the bombings. Her attorney told CNN that she learned through news reports that her husband and brother-in-law were suspects in the attacks. It was devastating news for the whole family, he said. ""The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all,"" attorney Amato DeLuca said in a 2013 statement. ""As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims -- students, law enforcement, families and our community.  In the aftermath of this tragedy, she, her daughter and her family are trying to come to terms with these events."" 2. She was arrested for theft. Before the bombings, Russell had one run-in with the law. In June 2007, she was arrested for stealing $67 in goods from Old Navy. According to court records, she acknowledged the theft and gave back the merchandise. Last year, she appeared in court over a traffic ticket. 3. Her last known address was near her in-laws. By all indications, Russell has chosen to be near -- and with -- her dead husband's family living in New Jersey, rather than with her parents in Rhode Island. Her last known apartment was just blocks from the last listed address of Ailina and Bella Tsarnaeva, her sisters-in-law. And she was last seen holding the newest child in the Tsarnaev family, her niece. Ailina Tsarnaeva recently appeared in court on unrelated charges of threatening a romantic rival with a bomb. She has pleaded not guilty. 4. Russell was raised Christian. She converted to Islam before she married Tsarnaev at a Massachusetts mosque in June 2010. 5. She and Tamerlan Tsarnaev had one child together. Their daughter was a toddler at the time of the bombings. The last time Russell saw her husband alive, the family source said, she was handing off their daughter to stay with him while she went to work as a home health aide. CNN's Kristi Ramsay, Deborah Feyerick and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev's widow has kept a low profile since the bombings .
Federal prosecutors won't say if she's a suspect or a witness; she hasn't been charged .
It's unknown whether she'll play a role in her brother-in-law's trial ."
"(CNN)Mark Zuckerberg likes to make resolutions for the New Year.  Once he decided he must only eat meat that he had killed himself -- an admirable, if quirky, resolution for any vigorous young man with a rifle. Another time he decided to learn Mandarin Chinese -- not a simple task.  I wonder how that turned out?  Now he's vowed to start a book club, hoping to channel the reading attention of the millions who follow him on Facebook.  I like his latest idea a lot:  Anything that gets people reading and talking about books is a good thing. If I were Mr. Zuckerberg, I would aim for books that can be read slowly and carefully by busy people in their spare time, choosing ones with the capacity to enlarge their sense of what it means to be human and to live respectfully and generously among others.  Which ones would you pick? Here are 10 books that have meant a good deal to me  -- a mix of fiction and nonfiction: . 1.""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" by Mark Twain.  This is the primary text of American literature, high on any serious list of world classics.  It's a book about the American soul, about race and community, and about the urgent need to ""light out for the territory.""  As Huck and Jim float down the Mississippi on their quest for freedom, they take every reader of this truly great novel with them, forever. 2.""The Death of Ivan Ilyich,"" by Leo Tolstoy. Written after Tolstoy's conversion to his own idiosyncratic version of Christianity, this short Russian novel brings us face to face with mortality.  Each of us, sooner or later, will die.  In the process of dying, Tolstoy's lead character comes to terms with his life and its meaning, which is made all the more vivid as it fades. 3.""July's People,"" by Nadine Gordimer. This slim, intense novel appeared in 1981, not so long before apartheid had ended in South Africa.  It imagined a violent finale to that conflict between blacks and whites -- an ending that (fortunately) didn't materialize.  Yet this novel remains a strong evocation of cultural and racial differences; the sort of book that helps to explain racial divides that continues to haunt us. 4.""Walden,"" by Henry David Thoreau.  Another great American book, one that makes the vital connection between spirit and nature.  It's an autobiographical masterpiece as well; the story of one man's quest for meaning in the wilderness.  It's a wry, touching, eloquent evocation of human consciousness as well as conscience.  Nobody can afford NOT to read this book slowly, carefully, more than once. 5.""Things Fall Apart,"" by Chinua Achebe.   This fine African novel has been justifiably chosen by millions of readers as a book that gloriously summons the social, cultural and intensely personal situation of modern Africans living in the wake of colonial power.  Achebe saw his fellow Nigerians as individuals caught in a web of social relations, delineated here with clarity and confidence. 6.""Tao Te Ching,"" by Laozi, translated by Stephen Mitchell.  This Chinese classic is one of the most influential books I have encountered in half a century of reading.  The art of living is beautifully unfolded here in 81 tiny chapters.  The author invites us to conform to the Tao itself, the universal principle of being, and his book teaches us how to live with ourselves and with others, how to govern a nation, a family, ourselves.  It is a book to live with and learn from, decade after decade. 7.""Pilgrim at Tinker Creek,"" by Annie Dillard.  This lovely work of American autobiography is about paying attention to one's surroundings.  Dillard explores the natural world around her home in the Blue Ridge Mountains, moving through the seasons, coming to terms with her own solitude, her sense of vocation as a writer, and her understanding of what faith means.  It's a book that should be read in tandem with Thoreau's ""Walden."" 8.""What Is God?"" by Jacob Needleman.  A philosopher and religious scholar, Needleman writes about his own spiritual journey from atheism to a more complex understanding of the source of all being.  Needleman asks:  ""Who is wise?""  His answer is:   ""one who learn from everything and everyone.""  This book asks, even answers, many of the basic questions about being human, drawing on a wide range of religious traditions. 9.""Of Woman Born:  Motherhood as Experience and Institution,"" by Adrienne Rich.  Published in 1976, this eloquent meditation on motherhood is told from the viewpoint of one of the finest American poets of the 20th century.  It's a landmark study, a foundational book in modern feminist thought, and well worth reading, then rereading. 10.""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" by Gabriel García Márquez. The longest book on my list, but nobody can afford to ignore it.  My old mentor, the Scottish poet Alastair Reid, used to say that anyone who hasn't read this book is still an intellectual virgin.  Márquez tells the story of a single family in a remote village in Colombia.  But this story is the human story writ small, the story of history itself, with its inevitable repetitions, its recurring ghosts, grounded in the nearly untranslatable poetry of human feeling.","Jay Parini: Zuckerberg starting book club.

"Java Sea, West Borneo (CNN)The start of our 15-hour trip is stunning. Idyllic white sand beaches stretch along the coast of West Borneo, Indonesia. An occasional fishing boat is the only interruption to this part of the largely untouched coastline. A peaceful tranquility that makes the horrors some 100 nautical miles from here seem implausible. As we head out into open waters with an Indonesian Search and Rescue boat, the winds pick up and the waves increase. The weather forecast Sunday was better than previous days -- the crew confirms it is an improvement -- but conditions are still rough. Looking out at the vast expanse of the Java Sea, the crew tries to spot bodies or debris from AirAsia Flight QZ8501. As I think I might have seen something, it disappears beneath a wave and does not always resurface. Pieces of wood, rubbish or seaweed confuse the naked eye. The challenge of spotting debris or a beloved member of a distraught family in these waters is immense. One crew member thinks he spots something, then loses sight of it. But he is convinced enough of its import for the captain to call it in so a larger ship nearby can investigate. Hunt for black box . This ship has a very specific mission.  On board is a pinger locator that needs to be delivered to a vessel stationed in Sector 4 of the search zone.  A crucial piece of equipment to hunt for the flight data recorder, or so-called black box, without which the mystery of the crash of this airliner may never be solved. But the captain is nervous. Captain Ahmad tells me his boat is not large enough to be in waters this choppy. ""I feel a heavy moral burden,"" he says.  ""I have a responsibility to keep those on board safe, but it is so important to help find bodies and debris."" Ahmad says he's proud to be a part of this operation, but would not normally bring his boat out for so long in such conditions. Yet the mood is upbeat among the crew.  In recent days the weather has forced them to stay along the coastline, scouring for bodies or debris that may have drifted from the crash site. They now seem happy to be able to deliver much-needed supplies to colleagues out at sea. By late afternoon, the target ship comes into view. The Baruna Jaya has been here for days and relies heavily on these deliveries. Transferring equipment from one boat to the other may sound like the most straightforward part of the long day. Far from it. The swell of the sea pushes the ships together with a dull thud as boat-side buoys collide.  A crudely taped cardboard box holding the precious acoustic cargo is hastily handed over before the waves push the boats apart again.  It is deemed too dangerous for the expert accompanying the equipment to make the jump between ships. An hour-long attempt to transfer the inflatable boat needed to help operate the locator ends in frustration amid rough seas and fading light. As night falls with only half a mission accomplished, the deflated crew turns for port determined to try again tomorrow. They'll have a few hours sleep ahead of another long day.​ .","Paula Hancocks heads out to the search zone off West Borneo in rough seas looking for any debris or remains of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 .

"(CNN)In the first week of 2014, I wrote a column suggesting that it was going to be ""the year of China."" By that, I meant that China was going to shape the news in powerful ways, economic and political. For a start, China's 30-year economic superboom (with growth rates averaging around 10%) was going to slow, with global consequences. Also, China would begin to face a more complex set of political challenges, with its growing middle class, worsening environment and rising nationalist sentiment. I'd give myself a decent grade for the prediction, but not perfect by any means. China did face political challenges, particularly in Hong Kong, and ones that suggest something about the future for all of China. (Remember, Hong Kong is far richer than the rest of China and so, perhaps, is a window into the country's future.) And China's economy has slowed. Even the official numbers put growth around 7%, and many believe that's a pumped-up number. But the central sense in which the prediction proved true was that as China's growth slowed, so did its enormous appetite. ""That giant sucking sound"" over the last decade has been the sound of China importing all kinds of raw materials to fuel its industrialization. Foremost among those was oil, since China's energy needs have grown by leaps and bounds. Morgan Stanley's Ruchir Sharma has pointed out that over the last decade, China's demand for oil has grown 7%, year on year. In 2014 China's growth in demand for oil was zero -- nada. The great global gas guzzler went quiet. That single fact is probably the main explanation for the collapse of oil prices in 2014 (along with the steady rise of oil and gas production in the United States). This decline in the price of oil is the signature trend coming out of 2014, and if it persists will shape the economics and politics of the world in 2015 and beyond. What I did not predict in any way about the last year was Russia's rising belligerence -- most dramatically seen in its determined efforts to keep Ukraine as an ""allied"" country, using military means, and in the process risking economic sanctions and diplomatic isolation. But in a sense, this is also a story with oil as its backdrop. Over the past decade, as oil prices quadrupled, so did Russia's per capita GDP -- and President Vladimir Putin's popularity. His rising confidence, and the swelling resources of the Russian government, emboldened him to act aggressively in Georgia in 2008, and last year in Ukraine. Economic sanctions have hurt Russia, but the greatest blow has been the sudden drop in oil prices, which will shape the next chapter of this tale. The drop in oil prices has had effects on every continent, in direct and indirect ways. Cuban President Raul Castro's decision to try to make amends with the United States is an important example. After Cuba lost its Cold War patron, the Soviet Union, it found a new one in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, which subsidized the ailing Castro regime. But Venezuela has been troubled for a while, and Chavez's successors do not have his political skills, which makes them rely even more on patronage and repression. All this has become more difficult as Venezuela's oil revenues dry up. The Cuban regime must have recognized that its sugar daddy was unlikely to keep sending it subsidies, which might explain its efforts to have the U.S. embargo relaxed. The general rule about falling oil prices has been simple: Producing countries like Russia and Venezuela will suffer, while consuming countries like China, India and Indonesia will benefit. And that's a very useful guide with one important exception -- the United States is both the top producer and consumer of oil. For most Americans, the effect is clearly positive. Falling gas prices are like a huge tax cut, money that stays with consumers and is likely to be spent on other things. For American oil producers, it's not such good news, though they will try to lower costs and become more efficient. Economics aside, the trends look pretty positive for America. Many of the complications it faces in the world are fueled by high oil prices. From Russia to Iran to Venezuela, lower oil prices could make combative countries more cautious. Meanwhile, the American economy continues to grow, with a recovery that appears sustainable and increasingly robust. American technology companies continue to dominate the industries of the future. American society remains vibrant, fueled by immigration. Even American government -- certainly compared with its peers in Europe and Japan -- has performed extremely well. It's quite possible that 2015 will turn out to be the year of America. Watch Fareed Zakaria GPS Sundays at 10am and 1pm ET.

"(CNN)The private spaceflight company SpaceX will launch another mission to the International Space Station on Tuesday, but the real highlight of the event could be back on Earth. A Falcon 9 rocket will lift the cargo into orbit, and for the first time, the company will try to land the rocket's first stage on a floating platform. Traditionally, rockets have been designed to fall back to Earth after separating from the spacecraft they lifted, and then burn up on reentry or crash into the ocean. The millions of dollars that go into the production of the rockets burn, too. SpaceX wants to pioneer a reusable rocket, a development that could change the economics of space travel. ""A fully and rapidly reusable rocket -- which has never been done before -- is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access,"" SpaceX said in a news release. The company has twice attempted soft landings of the Falcon 9's first stage on water. Those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from hypersonic to nearly zero, and deploy landing legs. In those tests, the rocket tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean, causing damage that made the rocket unusable. That was according to plan, SpaceX said. On Tuesday, the company will try the same soft landing for the Falcon 9's first stage, but this time on a custom-built floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship. Landing on the platform ""is significantly more challenging"" than the water landings, the company said. For one, the platform is not anchored, and while the platform looks large from the ground, it is a rather small target for the 14-story-tall rocket. SpaceX described reentry and landing as ""trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm."" The company puts the odds of success at 50% at best. It adds, however, that this is just the first of a number of tests toward the goal of landing a rocket stage for reuse. As for Tuesday's target, ""X"" marks the spot: The company will try to land the rocket stage on the SpaceX logo painted on the center of the floating platform.","SpaceX is scheduled to launch a rocket Tuesday .

"As pro bono lawyers for Jonathan Pollard for 12 years, we continue to be amazed at how people opposed to executive clemency for our client invariably withhold, distort, and even fabricate facts to justify their position. The most recent manifestation of this phenomenon is the June 16 opinion piece by Roland Martin, ""Israel wrong to demand release of American traitor."" Mr. Pollard is serving his 27th year of an unprecedented sentence of life in prison for delivering classified information to the state of Israel, a close ally of the United States. Martin does a disservice to his readers by fabricating facts. For example, Martin refers confidently to Pollard's ""trial,"" and says that during his ""trial,"" Pollard was accused of attempting to pass classified information to Pakistan and other countries. Perhaps Martin doesn't know that Pollard never had a trial. This fact could have easily been found through a Google search.  And Pollard was never charged by the United States with passing (or attempting to pass) classified information to any country other than Israel, for the very simple reason that he never attempted to do so. Martin invents putative facts to support his opinion. Likewise, Martin writes of Pollard's purported ""treason."" But he was never charged with (much less convicted of) treason. Nor could he have been, as treason requires aid to an enemy of the United States. Martin notes gravely that ""treason"" is addressed in the U.S. Constitution. If Martin had bothered to read that document, he would have seen that the Constitution says that ""Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort."" Israel is not an enemy of the United States. Once again, a basic check of the facts would have revealed that Pollard did not commit treason. What should be equally disturbing to Martin's readers are the critical facts he withholds. Martin makes it seem as if it is mostly the people and leaders of Israel who want Pollard to receive clemency. Martin fails to mention that George Shultz, the U.S. secretary of state at the time of Pollard's activities, has come out publicly in favor of clemency.  Similarly, Robert ""Bud"" McFarlane, who was U.S. national security adviser at that time, has also come out publicly in favor of clemency. It is safe to say that these gentlemen know more than anyone about Pollard's conduct. The fact that they have come out in favor of clemency speaks volumes. But Martin chooses not to mention this. Nor does he mention that numerous distinguished Americans have come out publicly in favor of clemency, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, former Vice President Dan Quayle, former CIA Director James Woolsey, former Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini, dozens of members of Congress and many others. Perhaps Martin claims to know more than they do about the Pollard case.  Then again, Martin claims Mr. Pollard had a trial and committed treason. Martin is entitled to hold any opinion he wishes. But his readers are entitled to an honest presentation of the facts, not a series of falsehoods buttressed by material omissions.","Jonathan Pollard is serving his 27th year of imprisonment for conspiracy to commit espionage .

"Washington (CNN)Conservative momentum to oust John Boehner from House leadership during Tuesday's election for speaker continued to build through the weekend, with two alternatives emerging and a national conservative group joining the effort. On Monday, Virginia Rep.-elect Dave Brat became the latest to confirm his intention to vote against Boehner for speaker. On Sunday night, Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Iowa Rep. Steve King also came out opposed to Boehner. In an op-ed published on Breitbart.com, King outlined a litany of complaints with the Speaker, arguing Boehner hasn't done enough to oppose President Barack Obama's signature health care law or the President's executive action on immigration and pointing to passage of the recent government funding bill, which tackled neither, as evidence. Leadership aides, however, remain confident that Boehner will hold onto his position as the top Republican in the House. Conservatives need to gather nearly 30 lawmakers opposed to him to force a second round of voting in the race. But the developing coup attempt is the latest reminder for the Ohio Republican that conservatives remain a troublesome and unpredictable force in his caucus that can cause public embarrassment if not out-and-out regime change. ""We need a Speaker who will help us all keep our oath, including his own, to the Constitution, not one who has consistently blocked our efforts to keep ours. I will vote for an alternative candidate for Speaker,"" King wrote. Those frustrations are shared by many of his fellow conservatives, and the passage of the cromnibus last month pushed already simmering tensions with Boehner to a boiling point. And it threatens to start things off on precisely the wrong foot for Republicans as they take full control of Congress and seek to prove to Americans they're the party that can govern in time for 2016. There are at least 10 lawmakers who have publicly said they'll oppose Boehner or vote ""present"" in the election for speaker. GOP Reps. Ted Yoho of Florida and Louie Gohmert of Texas both offered themselves up as alternatives to Boehner this weekend, after two prominent conservatives in the House — Rep. Jim Bridenstine of Oklahoma and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — came out publicly opposed to him. North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones, an early organizer of the effort to unseat Boehner, told a local North Carolina paper that he plans to support Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida, whose name will also be offered as an alternative to Boehner on Tuesday. ""I want us to have a leader who is willing to stand up for conservative, religious principles I believe in. It is to make a statement and it's based on many months of consideration,"" Jones said. National conservative group FreedomWorks has launched a national campaign in support of the effort, urging its members to call their lawmaker and tell them to vote against the Ohio Republican as speaker. And Bridenstine launched a short-lived website pitching Gohmert as speaker that included endorsements from both himself and Massie for the Texas Republican, which was soon after wiped of its content. Still, none of the lawmakers who have offered themselves as potential alternatives are favorites of the far-right. Other prominent conservatives,  including Fox News host Sean Hannity, have offered Rep. Trey Gowdy up for the job, but Gowdy has declined. A coup attempt orchestrated by many of the same lawmakers two years ago fell short of the votes needed to force a second ballot, with only a dozen conservatives voting against Boehner. And since then, many of those have expressed a change of heart, coming out in support of the Ohio Republican as Speaker — including prominent conservative Reps. Mick Mulvaney, Tim Huelskamp and Raul Labrador. But conservatives say they're confident now that alternative options have stepped forward, they can corral the needed votes to at least force the election to a second ballot, where they hope Boehner will drop out of the race. They also note that many members of the freshman class promised to vote against Boehner on the campaign trail — including Dave Brat, the Republican who ousted former Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a primary -- and are looking to them to round out their numbers. On Monday morning, Brat stood by that promise, also in an op-ed on Breitbart. It's unclear what efforts leadership has undertaken to whip support for the speaker. Colorado Rep.-elect Ken Buck, the GOP freshman class president, said he hasn't heard from the speaker — but he has heard from Boehner's opponents. ""I have not talked to anybody in the Speaker's office. I have not talked to the Speaker. I have not heard that he is reaching out to anybody in the freshman class,"" Buck told CNN in an interview Monday. ""On the other end, I have received some calls."" Daniel Horowitz, a conservative strategist and editor of ConservativeReview.com, said that the situation is ""very fluid"" but expressed cautious optimism. ""This is a much more robust effort than any of us ever hoped,"" he said. He noted, however, that ""things could still fall apart"" in the final day before the election, and that he expects Boehner and his allies are applying heavy pressure on the incoming freshmen to make sure they fall in line. Following the last coup attempt, a handful of the members who voted against Boehner were removed from their positions on plum House committees. This time around, conservatives say they're not worried about punishment. Yoho said on Monday during an interview on Fox News that ""I fear no man."" ""There should not be any retribution. We're doing what my voters want me to do,"" he said. But he promised to support whomever eventually wins the election for speaker — at least for the next session. ""I'll go up to 'em, I'll thank 'em and I'll tell 'em, you're the speaker for the next two years, and I look forward to working with you to solve America's problems,"" he said.

"Miami (CNN)Rumors of another major change in U.S.-Cuba policy are sparking a surge in Cuban migrants in recent days, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Agency officials tell CNN that Cubans are being told the decades-old ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy is going away on January 15, and that has many of them attempting to reach the United States. The policy, which was enacted in 1995, grants asylum to any Cuban who reaches U.S. soil, or ""dry foots."" But most Cubans found at sea would be sent back to Cuba. Any change to that policy, which is part of the Cuban Adjustment Act, would need approval by Congress, which is highly unlikely to happen. ""We recognize that when these rumors continue to perpetuate, they grow. People believe it. They may get desperate. They may try and take to the sea,"" said Capt. Mark Fedor, the chief of response for the Coast Guard's 7th District, which patrols most of the waters around the island nation. Since the Obama administration announced a renewal of diplomatic relations with the Castro government on December 16, the Coast Guard says there has been a 235% increase in the number of Cubans found at sea, compared with the first two weeks of December. Overall, the final month of 2014 saw a 117% jump year to year in the number of migrants from the Communist island. ""Having this many people at sea, in very unseaworthy vessels -- it just makes for a very dangerous environment,"" said Fedor. The source of the rumors is unknown. But, Coast Guard officials believe human smugglers and builders of makeshift boats may be partly to blame. ""These boats aren't just laying around. These people are getting paid to build these boats. That's the profit motive behind all this,"" said Fedor. ""There are people making money off of this. And they don't care about the safety of these folks. I think it's in their benefit to perpetuate these rumors. And we're trying to combat that."" Ever since Fidel Castro took power in Cuba in 1959, there have been incidents of mass migration from Cuba -- the most famous of which was the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when roughly 125,000 Cubans landed on Florida's shores within a six-month span. Although the recent surge is not considered a mass migration, Fedor says, ""We're always attentive to that. There's a variety of factors that could lead to a mass migration. But right now, we're not at that level."" But, just in case, Fedor says the Coast Guard has put additional resources in the Florida Straits to deal with the current situation.","Rumors in Cuba suggest it may soon be harder to get asylum in U.S.

"(CNN)Now that the holidays are over, there's a lot of activity bubbling up in the 2016 presidential race, especially on the Republican side. Here's a brief look at what's been happening and what we can expect to see from prospective candidates in coming weeks. Bush says same-sex marriage fight already decided . The state of Florida is gearing up to start issuing same-sex marriages as early as this week after a federal judge ruled in August that the state's voter-approved same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional. But former governor, Jeb Bush, said Sunday the decision should have been left to the states, appearing to stand by the 2008 amendment that defines marriage as between a man and a woman. ""It ought be a local decision. I mean, a state decision,"" Bush told the Miami Herald. ""The state decided. The people of the state decided. But it's been overturned by the courts, I guess."" His comments were consistent with previous measured statements by Bush, who left office in 2007. As governor, he was against same-sex marriage, but he didn't try lobby too hard at the time to back the same-sex marriage amendment of 2008. And in 2013, Bush warned in a speech that Republicans were becoming known for being ""anti-gay,"" as well as ""anti-immigrant, anti-woman, anti-science"" and ""anti-worker."" ""The face of the Republican Party needs to be the face of every American, and we need to be the party of inclusion and acceptance,"" Bush said at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Can Christie turn his love for the Cowboys into campaign cash? New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie schmoozed with (and bear-hugged) Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones in the owner's box Sunday night. While Christie has said the two have been developing a friendship over the past five years, their relationship is coming under renewed attention now that Christie is angling for a possible presidential bid. Christie's friendship with Jones could help expand his donor network in Texas, a state where Gov. Rick Perry and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- two potential competitors -- have deep ties to many wealthy contributors. Asked on WFAN's ""Boomer & Carton"" radio show Monday if he thinks he can carry Texas now, should he run for president, Christie joked: ""I think our chances have improved."" He said he hopes to go to the Cowboys playoff game next weekend against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in Wisconsin. Asked if he'll pay a visit to Gov. Scott Walker, a potential 2016 rival for the GOP presidential nomination, while he's there, Christie said: ""Of course. Scott and I are friends, and I'll see Scott."" Christie will have to squeeze the football games into his busy schedule this month as the former Republican Governors Association chairman travels to multiple states for gubernatorial inaugurations. He's already slated to visit ceremonies in Florida, Maryland, Iowa, South Carolina, Massachusetts, Illinois and Ohio. He's also attending a social conservative gathering in Iowa on Jan. 24 along with other potential 2016 Republican contenders. And on February 12, he's speaking at a Lincoln Day Dinner in the Chicago area hosted by Northwest Suburban Republican. Bobby Jindal going to Iowa . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal isn't attending the Iowa event on Jan. 24, but he's still grabbing some face time with Iowa evangelical leaders when he heads to the Hawkeye State on Tuesday. First reported by the Des Moines Register, Jindal will meet with pastors in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines at closed-door events sponsored by the American Renewal Project. Jindal's political spokesman said Jindal plans to talk about the prayer and fasting event he's leading in Louisiana on Jan. 24, the same day as the freedom summit in Iowa. Rand Paul's wife hitting the (Kentucky) road . Kelley Paul, the wife of Republican Sen. Rand Paul, is set to start her book tour of her upcoming title, ""True and Constant Friends,"" scheduled to release in April. Paul will make multiple stops in Kentucky this week to talk about her book, a collection of essays about women, including her grandmother. As he gears up for a likely presidential bid, Rand Paul has frequently mentioned that he's still waiting for his wife to sign off on a White House run. We'll be watching this week to see if she's asked about her husband's aspirations. In August, she cautioned in a radio interview that launching a presidential campaign is ""something that you don't go into lightly."" ""Being in the public eye is hard on a family and a marriage,"" she added. ""It's not a typical job where you just go to work and do your job, there are huge demands on your time and, obviously, there are going to be a lot of people attacking you...and that's part of it, that's part of politics, but it's on such a high scale when you're running for President, so we're thinking about it but not 100% there yet obviously."" Kelley Paul, a former political consultant, has worked with her husband on speeches and other writings. Her husband is also set to release a book this spring. Huckabee takes big step toward presidential bid . Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee announced Saturday that he's ending his weekly Fox News to explore the idea of a presidential bid, a final decision he says he won't make until the spring. The move marked yet another serious step taken by a potential contender, following Jeb Bush's announcement last month that he'd be actively exploring a bid and was stepping down from his corporate board memberships. A source close to Huckabee's political operation said the decision to leave Fox has been long in the works and argued Bush's timing had ""zero"" impact on Huckabee's strategy. Huckabee, who ran for president in 2008 and won the Iowa caucuses, will spend the next few months promoting his new book and focusing on securing the financial footing that he lacked in 2008 to sustain a prolonged campaign. ""If he decides to run this time, I think that's something we will be able to remedy,"" the source said. ""It's one of the things that he learned eight years ago: make sure you have the financial resources to compete."" He's also attending to the Iowa Freedom Summit later this month and stopping in the early primary state of South Carolina for his book tour. CNN's Maeve Reston and Dan Merica contributed to this report.","Jeb Bush says same-sex marriage decisions should be left to voters, not judges .

"(CNN)Sailor Gutzler is back in her tiny hometown in Illinois with family members Monday. They are doing everything they can to make the 7-year-old feel safe and loved -- a simple but critical act that mental health experts say can help the child begin grappling with being the sole survivor of a plane crash that killed her parents, sister and cousin. Family members will raise Sailor, and money from a family-sanctioned online fund will help, said Gutzler family spokesman Kent Plotner, an attorney who personally knows the family. But out of concern for the girl's healing, Plotner said there will be no more details released about her. ""Our total focus is protecting her,"" he said. Sailor's father was a longtime pilot, Plotner said, and his children flew with him many times. On Friday, a Piper PA-34 that was carrying the family went down in western Kentucky. Even though the aircraft was upside down, Sailor managed to make it out and walk three-quarters of a mile in the dark through very rough terrain, across fallen trees and ditches. She navigated around creeks and over blackberry briars despite wearing only one sock, a T-shirt and shorts, and no coat. Mother remembers last moments with daughter lost in Kentucky plane crash . She knocked on Larry Wilkins' door. ""She said, 'My mom and dad are dead. We had a plane crash. The plane was upside down.'"" On CNN Monday, Wilkins said the girls' legs were cut and scratched from the bottom of her shorts to the tips of her toes. She was a little wet because it was drizzling. Wilkins put her on his couch and called 911, alerting authorities that a plane had gone down and there was at least one survivor. Wilkins said his two Dachshunds helped calm the girl down. The child's grandfather later told him that she had a Dachshund. ""I know she's having an extremely hard time and probably in her mind she doesn't understand everything that's going on,"" said Wilkins. Though she was trembling and crying, the little girl seemed ""amazingly composed,"" he said, given the circumstances. Grief in a child's mind . Children who experience the sudden loss of a family member process that grief in ways that are specific to their age, say mental health specialists who treat young patients. Losing one relative elicits complex feelings; losing several relatives, particularly parents, is uniquely overwhelming. On top of her grief, Sailor will also have to grapple with the trauma she endured being part of the event that killed them. ""It's critical that Sailor feel safe and loved -- that has to happen right away,"" said Dr. J. William Worden, a psychologist who has treated grieving children and co-directed Harvard's seminal study on childhood bereavement. The Gutzler family is not saying where the child is living, and that's a very good move, Worden said. Journalists camping outside her door could scare and traumatize her, he said. Other mental health experts who specialize in treating children advise that the family try to keep as normal a routine as possible. They must keep in mind that grief is a process. It's not a problem to be fixed. There's no rush, they say, for her to see a counselor. And it could be damaging for an interviewer without training in child trauma to question her now, said Dr. Donald Freedheim, a professor emeritus of psychology at Case Western University. He has treated children after disasters. ""If they called me, I wouldn't say, 'Send her to my office.' I'd go to her home and we'd just sit down. I would be a friend. She can't feel threatened in any way,"" he said. Let the child lead . Sailor should be allowed to provide cues as to how adults behave around her. ""If she wants to talk about what happened, let her. If she doesn't, then let her be for a little while,"" Worden said. ""When you have too many losses in too short a period of time, in children, their grieving process can shut down."" Sometimes, children develop somatic symptoms in place of grieving. Young children act out because they don't have the developmental tools yet to articulate how they feel. Older children and teenagers sometimes get headaches, stomachaches or anxiety disorders, he said. Each of Sailor's relatives' deaths should be addressed separately, experts advise. The way Sailor will process the loss of her sister is apart from the way she will grieve for her mother. Sailor will deal with those losses differently as she gets older. She will feel them differently from the way she felt them at ages 12, 18 and 25, said Dr. Therese Rando of The Institute for the Study and Treatment of Loss in Rhode Island. A 7-year-old generally understands what death is but doesn't yet have the ability to comprehend the implications of it, experts say. A common coping mechanism at that age is denial, said Rando. The adult world is stunned and impressed that Sailor managed to get up from the wreckage site, walk in the dark, in frigid temperatures, across a rough, wooded area to get to a man's house, knock on the door, tell that stranger what happened and ask for help. But that action shouldn't be interpreted as a sign that Sailor is somehow more capable of recovering than any other child who faces such a horrific tragedy. ""She may have acted amazingly composed,"" said Rando. ""But what might be happening on the outside isn't necessarily what's happening on the inside. She will have to deal with this trauma in a way that unfolds over a lot of time. She will have to work this for the rest of her life."" Still, AC Morgan, who survived a small plane crash himself in 1998, encouraged Sailor to draw on that same strength she showed after the crash as she faces a challenging healing process. ""If you ever question if you can do it, look back at what you did -- you were able to get out of a plane, you were able to walk three-quarters of a mile in the dark, by yourself and find safety. You can do it, no matter what."" I was the sole survivor: 4 stories of plane crash survival .","Adults around Sailor Gutzler should allow her to give cues; if she wants to talk, she will, mental health experts say .
Therapist: A child of 7 understands what death is but doesn't have the tools to comprehend its implications .
The most important thing adults around Sailor should do immediately: Make her feel safe and loved ."
"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- In the central plaza, there was once an orgy of music, street dancing and revelry unmatched by any other nation in the Americas, Haitians say. But where there was joy now sits a vast settlement of people left without loved ones, without homes, without life's belongings. Haitians have celebrated Carnival through dictatorships, military coups and bloodshed. Popular belief was that if a government failed to deliver on Carnival, Haiti's equivalent of Mardi Gras, it was sure to fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti's minister of culture and information. But this year, the three-day festival has been canceled, another indication of the enormity of the earthquake's devastation. Musicians fell silent, seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and ghostly skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. A month after the devastating January 12 earthquake, the Champs de Mars plaza is home to the capital's displaced, where thousands of people have eked out a tiny space in which to survive. Full coverage of the earthquake's aftermath . ""This is the first time Carnival is not happening,"" said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice. ""I don't even think about music anymore."" Less than a week ahead of Carnival's start on Sunday, revelry is replaced with mourning. The nation's foremost concert producer, Charles Jubert, died. So did members of four bands who were practicing inside a studio that collapsed. Other musicians lost legs, arms and hands. They will not be able to play again. ""I don't think we have time to think of Carnival,"" Lassegue said. ""Maybe when we are finished crying."" Carnival's three days of deliverance and celebration has tremendous importance in the lives of Haitians, Lassegue said. ""But this year? I don't even remember when it is."" Instead, the displaced are planning days of prayer. ""We're living in a city that's like a cemetery,"" said Ronide Baduel, a nurse who lost her home and all her belongings in the quake. Her brother died and suddenly, she found herself far from her middle-class existence, relegated to a makeshift tent and burlap bags she uses for pillows at night. ""I had four good walls around me. Now I have four sheets,"" she said. She goes to work with a big, black faux-leather purse containing toothpaste, soap and a change of underwear. There, she can bathe properly. ""We don't know how many days, how many months, how long we will be this way,"" she said. ""I am always stressed. It's like living in a jungle. How can I dance at Carnival?"" Baduel and her tent community neighbors said the money that would have been spent on Carnival ought to be used to build housing. Nearby, the 44 members of Relax Band, who normally would be revving up their street performances in the days before Carnival, worried about their next meal. They played the Sunday before the earthquake, marching through the streets, getting ready for the big performance. Now, everything was gone,­ including all their instruments that were crushed when band coordinator Ernst Beauvais' house collapsed. A small stage emblazoned with the red and white logo of Relax Band now harbors a massive water bladder tank dropped off by an aid group and a few mattresses for slumber under the stars. ""It is one of the greatest tragedies to befall our country,"" Beauvais said, pointing to the rubble of his house. He said it was the street band's 30th anniversary; the musicians were looking forward to showcasing their new song. Almost every band in Haiti debuts new pieces at Carnival. On the outskirts of town, the skeletons of three floats sit like ghosts, reminders of what might have come next week. One of the floats belongs to T-Vice. Brothers Roberto Martino and Eddy Viau would have been practicing with the rest of the band for their Carnival performance ­-- it's an honor to win top prize. ""If you have a good showing at Carnival, you're set for the rest of the year,"" Martino said. This year, the band had planned a soccer-themed show with a song called ""The End of the Match."" Instead it recently released ""Nou Pap Lage'' (We Won't Give Up""), dedicated to the victims of the earthquake. iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti . Martino tried to sing a few verses. ""There are so many things going through my head,"" he said. Overcome by emotion, he had to compose himself and start again. ""People are saying Haiti is finished, but no, no, no, we will rise up,'' he sang softly. ""We will strive. We will rebuild Haiti. We will stand united."" ""Don't be discouraged. There will be light at the end of the tunnel. My Haitian people. I will not let go."" iReport: Discussion of the carnival route . Proceeds from downloads of the song are going to the nonprofit organizations Sow A Seed and MedShare. Music, Martino said, was so essential to Haitian life. But he didn't know when this rare silence would end; when he would be able to write lyrics, put them to melody. ""We're all so traumatized,"" he said. Carnival, he said, was Haiti's musical showcase. ""We've lost our biggest tradition. Carnival was part of us.""","Less than week before Haiti's Carnival celebration, revelry replaced with mourning .

"(CNN)An avalanche in Austria claimed the lives of two promising young ski racers Monday, the U.S. Ski Team said. Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, were among a group of six athletes freeskiing at an Austrian resort. The four others managed to ski out of the slide, the team said on its website. ""Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport,"" U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association President and CEO Tiger Shaw said in a statement. ""Both of them loved what they did and conveyed that to those around them."" Berlack, from Franconia, New Hampshire, was named to the U.S. Ski Team's Development Team after a spring 2013 tryout camp. He finished 11th in downhill and 17th in super G at the 2013 U.S. Alpine Championships in Squaw Valley, California. Berlack had been a student at Vermont's Burke Mountain Academy, where he trained as recently as last week. ""Ronnie has been a vital part of BMA since he was a young boy,"" headmaster Kirk Dwyer said in a statement. ""He had a huge spirit. There is no one who better represents our core values than Ronnie. Our hearts go out to his parents Steve and Cindy, and his sister Carolyn."" Dwyer said that Berlack's father is a coach at BMA and that Berlack enrolled at the school when he was 11. The headmaster coached Berlack when he was 13 and 14 years old. He visited the Berlack home Monday. ""It's a devastating loss ... but the family has remarkable perspective. Ronnie was doing what he loved to do. He was chasing his dreams,"" Dwyer told CNN. Astle, from Sandy, Utah, had been invited to train with the development team. He was 13th in giant slalom at the U.S. Alpine Championships last March, ending as the top junior. Messages are being left at the team's official Facebook page. The avalanche occurred at around 2,800 meters (about 9,200 feet)  in elevation. There was a level-three avalanche risk in the area (out of five) for places above 2,200 meters (7,200 feet). The U.S. Ski Team is not sharing the names of the four survivors, none of whom suffered injuries, a spokesman said.

"(CNN)Futuristic superstructures, shimmering glass facades and fuzzier lines between indoor and outdoor spaces. These are some of the major trends expected in the coming year as the global aviation industry strives to meet ever-increasing demands. With few major projects scheduled for completion in 2015, it's likely to be seen as a transition year as many airports upgrade facilities or begin new building projects to cope with a forecast 3.6 billion global air passengers in 2016. Here's what to expect over the next 12 months. China . China's efforts to rapidly expand its airport infrastructure are expected to reach a peak in 2015 with scores of regional airstrips scheduled for opening. Official government plans have previously claimed that the number of airports will expand from 175 in 2010 to 230 in 2015 as the country ramps up its aviation industry in step with economic expansion. While many of these are smaller facilities have yet to be officially announced, several larger projects have been widely publicized. In Beijing, work gets underway in earnest this year on a $14 billion international airport in the city's southern Daxing district. The facility is scheduled to come online in 2017 and is reportedly expected to handle up to 72 million passengers annually by 2025. Meanwhile, at Chongqing Jianbei International Airport, serving the largest city in southwestern China, a new terminal three is expected to become operational this year. It's claimed the facility, designed for further expansion to meet expected growing demand, will be able to handle up to 55 million people annually, the largest capacity of any single terminal. In the same Chinese province, the city of Wulong is expected to get to work on its own airport scheduled for completion in 2017. Japan . With low-cost carriers on the rise in Japan, Tokyo's Narita International Airport is adding a new terminal dedicated to exclusively to no-frills flights. Terminal 3, designed to handle 50 million passengers a year, is expected to open in March or April. It'll contain plenty of places where those budget passengers can spend their savings, including a vast duty free shopping area and Japan's largest airport food court. Singapore . Once again Changi Airport Singapore, considered by many to be the world's best, appears to be raising the bar with a futuristic new complex that's likely to revolutionize terminal design. After breaking ground in December, work begins in earnest this year on Jewel Changi Airport, an impressive-looking palace of glass that will shroud retail, entertainment and leisure outlets as well as a multi-level gardens and walking trails. The centerpiece will be the Rain Vortex, a 40-meter-tall waterfall cascading from the roof of the glass dome. Mexico . Construction on another eagerly anticipated international airport gets underway in 2015 in Mexico City. Mexico City International Airport, a collaboration between world-renowned architects, Briton Norman Foster and Mexico's Fernando Romero, is designed to be the world's most sustainable when it opens in 2018. Foster & Partners says that because the structure will be one massive terminal housed under vast canopies of glass, it'll require fewer materials and less energy than the standard multi-building airport. Brazil . New management is taking over and re-branding Rio Galeao -- Tom Jobim International Airport. The country's second-busiest airport after Sao Paolo is undergoing a long overdue facelift in anticipation of the 2016 Olympics. About $2 billion is going into infrastructure construction, which covers everything from restrooms to runways. The upgrade to four decades-old facilities should allow the airport to increase annual capacity from 18 million passengers to 30 million without the need for an extra runway. The Netherlands . Mainly aimed at increasing retail opportunities, a revamp of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol's Terminal 2 departure lounge is scheduled for completion in the summer of 2015. Without going into detail, information from the airport trumpets the renovated area's six themed sections, titled ""luxury,"" ""family,"" ""travel and culture,"" ""modern Dutch,"" ""see buy fly,"" ""fashion and lifestyle"" and ""care and wellness."" On a more boozy note, it'll get Europe's first Johnnie Walker House luxury retail concept store and, naturally, a Heineken bar. Germany . Munich Airport's new satellite facility to expand its Terminal 2 should be complete by the third quarter of 2015, potentially increasing annual capacity to 17 million passengers. After work is complete, there'll be an operational test phase to make sure everything's working. If it is, Star Alliance member airlines (including Lufthansa, Air China, Singapore Airlines and United) will move some flights over to the new building. During similar test phases, safety concerns emerged at Berlin's Brandenburg International Airport, originally slated to open around 2011 or 2012. Despite appearances of having been completed, it's still not open. A string of management and engineering setbacks have dogged the project and doubled its initial projected cost. Brandenburg will not open in 2015, and latest reports say it may be 2017 before it's fully up and running. Saudi Arabia . Also not opening in 2015 is an expansion project at Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International Airport, now slated for completion early in 2016 after originally being scheduled for a 2014 delivery. The expansion is part of a project to up Saudi Arabia's passenger capacity to 100 million passengers annually by 2020. Jeddah's airport was recently ranked the world's second worst in an annual survey by the Sleeping In Airports website. Trends . As these facilities come on line, passengers may begin to notice new trends emerging in airport design -- chiefly a greater sense of space and place. Angela Gittens, director general of Airports Council International, says the changes are all about meeting passenger demands, with surveys indicating they're looking for a greater sense of orientation, control, safety, visibility and openness. In real terms this means bringing the outdoors into the picture. Changi Airport Singapore has been a leader in this area, with its butterfly garden and rooftop green spaces, while passengers with a stopover at Munich Airport can wander through an outdoor plaza hosting exhibits and performances, or visit an outdoor terrace. Updated facilities are also incorporating glass facades to bring natural light inside. This strategy, says Gittens, also improves energy efficiency. ""Not only do these new windows allow for the use of natural light,"" she adds ""but they are made with energy efficient materials that can repel heat and insulate against cold."" 'A sense of place' David Stewart, head of airport development for the International Air Transport Association, says airport authorities are increasingly understanding that passengers want to get a feel of what's local. ""They're craving a sense of place,"" he says. Gittens says fashioning an airport to better represent the city it serves is becoming an important point of differentiation. One of the easiest ways to do this is with food and big name chefs. While McDonald's and Starbucks outlets will continue to exist, more airports are dishing out regional cuisine made by local chefs, such as Gordon Ramsay's Plane Food at London Heathrow and Carles Gaig's Catalan-inspired Porta Gaig in Barcelona. It's not just high-end eateries bringing local to the airport. Hung's Delicacies in Hong Kong International favors braised meats and regional dishes. Airbrau in Munich Airport Plaza is a Bavarian brewery that serves its own beer, along with time-honored dishes like schnitzel, suckling pig and sauerkraut. New music, old masters . National culture is also making its way into airports. While many international airports have at least a little space devoted to displays of art, some are taking it up a notch. At the Traditional Korean Cultural Experience Zone at Seoul's Incheon Airport, passengers can learn about calligraphy or fan-making, or check out handicrafts while listening to live musicians. Workshops, demonstrations and performances are scheduled on a regular basis. Amsterdam's Schiphol was the first airport to house its own art museum beyond passport control. Currently under renovation, the pioneering Schiphol outpost of the Rijksmuseum provides a glimpse into local life through special exhibitions and the artworks of Dutch masters. Airports are also literally being connected to the cities they serve by modern mass transit. Airports as far flung from the cities they serve, including Washington Dulles and Xian Xianyang (among the 10 busiest airports in China), are developing linking train lines in order to accommodate travelers looking to make local connections.","China said to be increasing its operational airports to 230 in 2015 .

"(CNN)Divers searching in the depths of the Java Sea for wreckage from AirAsia Flight QZ8501 say big waves on the surface aren't the only difficulty they're facing. They also can't see in front of them down on the sea floor. The diving teams who made their way to the bottom of the sea Sunday encountered muddy waters with zero visibility, according to officials. The Indonesian Navy has sent special equipment to try to tackle the muddy conditions, Indonesian military chief Gen. Moeldoko said Monday. U.S. Navy divers assisting in the search have already been using side-scan sonar gear, which is designed to map the sea floor and capture accurate images for analysis. When they find submerged wreckage, divers could also face challenges like ""jagged edges, torn fuselage, things hanging all over the place,"" said Geno Gargiulo, an experienced commercial diver in the United States. ""It's going to be dark inside -- a lot of things for a diver to get snagged on, for its umbilical to get caught up on, to get disoriented,"" said Gargiulo, who says he's helped in the aftermath of recent catastrophes, including the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Highlighting the complexity of the challenge, Moeldoko said Monday that one large piece of wreckage initially believed to be part of the aircraft turned out to actually be from a ship. Objects obscured by waves . The ships and aircraft looking for remains from Flight QZ8501 have so far detected several large pieces of wreckage believed to be from the commercial jet, according to Indonesian officials. But they still haven't located the main body of the plane and the all-important flight recorders. Some of the bodies found over the weekend were still wearing seat-belts, search officials said. The bad weather conditions brought about by Indonesia's monsoon -- including strong winds, thick clouds, heavy rain and big waves -- have hindered the teams' efforts during nine days of searching. • Hayati Lutfiah Hamid . • Grayson Herbert Linaksita . • Kevin Alexander Soetjipto . • The Meiji Thejakusuma . • Hendra Gunawan Syawal . • Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi . • Jie Stevie Gunawan . • Juanita Limantara . • Wismoyo Ari Prambudi . • Tony Linaksita . • Shiane Josal . • Lim Yan Koen . • Yongki Jou . • Indra Yulianto . • Hindarto Halim . • Jou Brian Youvito . ""As soon as you see something in the distance, it disappears behind a wave -- and then it's very difficult to try and spot it again,"" said CNN's Paula Hancocks, who spent 15 hours out on a search vessel Sunday. Flight QZ8501 went down over the Java Sea on December 28 with 162 people on board. It lost contact with air traffic controllers during a scheduled flight from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore. The cause of the disaster is still under investigation. How can a modern airliner vanish? Initial compensation offers . So far, searchers have recovered 37 bodies and identified 19 of them. Families who'd been holding out hope are coming to terms with a devastating reality. ""I am very sad,"" The Ie Hua Thejakusuma said Monday as she sat near a candlelit altar in front of a pair of coffins -- two of seven of her family members who were aboard the flight. Five of them are still missing. ""Even up until now,"" she said, ""I can't accept it."" Details emerged over the weekend of initial compensation packages from AirAsia to the families of the victims. Many family members have been waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones in Surabaya, where officials have set up a crisis center to keep them updated as bodies are gradually recovered from the waves and identified on land. Several relatives told CNN on Sunday that families of those on board the plane were presented with a draft letter from AirAsia outlining details of preliminary compensation of about $24,000 for each family member who was on the plane. While some families signed the letters, others requested revisions to the wording. This compensation money is for any ""financial hardships"" during this period of the search, and in the letters AirAsia stressed that it was not a confirmation that the people on the plane were deceased. Who was on the plane . Search area extended . Taking advantage of better weather, the surface search area was extended to the east, Bambang Sulistyo, head of the Indonesian Search and Rescue agency, told reporters Sunday. The surface search's extension was based on predictions that the remains of the victims, along with wreckage from the aircraft, have drifted with the current. The priority surface and underwater search areas remained the same, he added. Officials on Friday had said they were concentrating on a 1,575-square-nautical-mile zone that they believe is the most probable area to find the remains of the aircraft. Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak . Suspension of flight route . AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate, which operated Flight QZ8501, didn't have a license to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route on the day that the plane disappeared, authorities said. The airline was approved to fly the route four days a week but that did not include Sunday, Indonesia's Ministry of Transport said as it announced a full investigation and suspended AirAsia Indonesia flights between the two cities. AirAsia Indonesia has said it will cooperate fully with the investigation and would not be releasing any statement until the results were known, local media reported. But aviation authorities in Singapore said there was no issue on their end. The Singapore Civil Aviation Authority said it had given AirAsia permission to fly the Surabaya-to-Singapore route daily through March 28. It added that AirAsia was operating the flight four days a week, including Sundays, but that ""airlines may adjust their flight frequencies in the course of a season in response to market demand or operational requirements.""

"(CNN)I am a Muslim, but I wasn't always. I converted to Islam in November 2001, two months after 9/11. I was 21 and living in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. It was a bad time to be a Muslim. But after four years of studying, poking and prodding at world religions and their adherents, I decided to take the plunge. Questions and answers . I am the product of a Creole Catholic and an Irish atheist. I grew up Catholic, then was agnostic, now I'm Muslim. My journey to Islam began when I was about 15 years old in mass, and had questions about my faith. The answers from teachers and clergymen -- don't worry your pretty little head about it -- didn't satisfy me. So I did what any red-blooded American would do: the opposite. I worried about it. For many years. I questioned the nature of religion, man, and the universe. After questioning everything I was taught to be true and digging through rhetoric, history and dogma, I found out about this strange thing called Islam. I learned that Islam is neither a culture nor a cult, nor could it be represented by one part of the world. I came to realize Islam is a world religion that teaches tolerance, justice and honor, and promotes patience, modesty and balance. As I studied the faith, I was surprised many of the tenants resonated with me. I was pleased to find that Islam teaches its adherents to honor all prophets, from Moses to Jesus to Muhammad, all of whom taught mankind to worship one God and to conduct ourselves with higher purpose. I was drawn to Islam's appeal to intellect and heartened by the prophet Muhammad's quote, ""The acquisition of knowledge is compulsory for every Muslim, whether male or female."" I was astounded that science and rationality were embraced by Muslim thinkers like Al-Khawarizmi, who invented algebra; Ibn Firnas, who developed the mechanics of flight before DaVinci; and Al-Zahravi, who is the father of modern surgery. Here was a religion telling me to seek out answers and use my intellect to question the world around me. Taking the plunge . It was 2001 and I had been putting off converting for a while. I feared what people would think, but was utterly miserable. When 9/11 happened, the actions of the hijackers horrified me. But in its aftermath, I spent most of my time defending Muslims and their religion to people who were all too eager to paint a group of 1.6 billion people with one brush because of the actions of a few. I was done being held hostage by the opinions of others. In defending Islam, I got over my fear and decided to join my brothers and sisters in the faith I believed in. My family did not understand, but it wasn't a surprise to them since I had been studying religion. Most were very concerned for my safety. Luckily, most of my friends were cool about it, and even curious to learn more. The scarf . These days, I am a proud wearer of hijab. You can call it a scarf. My scarf does not tie my hands behind my back, and it is not a tool of oppression. It doesn't prevent thoughts from entering my head and leaving my mouth. But I didn't always know this. Studying Islam didn't immediately dispel all my cultural misconceptions. I had been raised on imagery of women in the East being treated like chattel by men who forced them to cover their bodies out of shame or a sense of ownership. But when I asked a Muslim woman ""Why do you wear that?"", her answer was obvious, and appealing: ""To please God. To be recognized as a woman who is to be respected and not harassed. So that I can protect myself from the male gaze."" She explained how dressing modestly is a symbol to the world that a woman's body is not meant for mass consumption or critique. I still wasn't convinced and replied, ""Yeah, but women are like second class citizens in your faith?"" The very patient Muslim lady explained that, during a time when the Western world treated women like property, Islam taught that men and women were equal in the eyes of God. Islam made the woman's consent to marriage mandatory and gave women the opportunity to inherit, own property, run businesses and participate in government. She listed right after right that women in Islam held nearly 1250 years before women's lib was ever thought of in the West. Surprisingly, Islam turned out to be the religion that appealed to my feminist ideals. Getting married . It might shock you to know that I had an arranged marriage. That doesn't mean I was forced to marry my father's first choice suitor, like Jasmine from Aladdin. Dad didn't even have a say. When I converted, it wasn't a good time to be a Muslim. Feeling isolated, alienated and rejected by my own society pushed me to want to start a family of my own. Even before converting I had always wanted a serious relationship, but found few men looking for the same. As a new Muslim, I knew there was a better way to look for love and a lifelong partnership. I decided that if I wanted a serious relationship, it was time to get serious about finding one. I wanted an arranged marriage. I made a list of ""30 Rock""-style deal breakers. I searched. I interviewed. I interrogated friends and families of prospects. I decided I wanted to marry another convert, someone who had been where I was and wanted to go where I wanted to go. Thanks to parents of friends, I found my now-husband, a convert to Islam, in Mobile, Alabama, two hours from my New Orleans home. Twelve years later, we are living happily ever after. Not every Muslim finds a mate in this manner, and I didn't always see this for my life. But I am glad Islam afforded me this option. Living in a post-9/11 world . I never had to give up my personality, American identity or culture to be a Muslim. I have, at times, had to give up on being treated with dignity. I have been spat on, had eggs thrown at me, and been cursed at from passing cars. And I have felt terror when the mosque I attended in Savannah, Georgia, was first shot at, then burned down. In August 2012, I moved back home to New Orleans, where being different is the norm. I finally felt safe -- for a while. But now, with the continuous news coverage of the un-Islamic group known as ISIS, I have been subjected to much of the same treatment I received in other cities. And I now feel less safe than I ever have. It enrages me to know there are some who call themselves Muslims and who distort and misappropriate Islam for political gains. It weighs on me knowing that millions of my countrymen see only these images as a representative of my religion. It is unbearable to know that I am passionately hated for my beliefs, when those hating me don't even know what my beliefs are. In my journey to Islam, I came to learn that Muslims come in all shapes, sizes, attitudes, ethnicities, cultures and nationalities. I came to know that Islam teaches disagreement and that shouldn't lead to disrespect, as most Muslims want peace. Most of all, I have faith that my fellow Americans can rise above fear and hatred and come to learn the same. The opinions expressed in this story are solely those of Theresa Corbin.","Theresa Corbin converted to Islam at age 21 .

"Idiotic TV shows and all the latest apps bumming you out on the 21st century? Ready for some ""me time"" on the world's remotest islands? Forget golden sands and swaying palms -- the reality of solitude is different as these terrifyingly distant landfalls demonstrate. Tristan da Cunha1,750 miles from South Africa . The British island group of Tristan da Cunha stands profoundly alone in the South Atlantic. The nearest landfall is South Africa, 1,750 miles east, and to the west, South America is more than 2,000 miles. It's the world's most remote inhabited island chain -- so precariously occupied that when a volcanic vent erupted in 1961, the whole population was evacuated to England. Reaching Tristan da Cunha: This is no easygoing excursion. To quote the official website, ""There are no package tours for independent travelers, no hotels, no airport, no holiday reps, no night clubs, no restaurants, no jet skis nor safe sea swimming."" All visitors need to clear their arrivals in advance through the Island Council, and they also need to obtain a police certificate. (A 40-day wait is typical.) There are around 10 sailings a year from Cape Town, South Africa, and Namibia, each taking five to six days to reach the islands; it costs $800-$1,500 for a round trip. A list of available ships can be found on the official website: www.tristandc.com. Bear Island400 miles off Europe's north coast . Bjornoya, better known as Bear Island, is the southernmost island in the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard, 400 miles north of mainland Europe -- but only on paper, given that it's almost 150 miles south of the Norwegian island chain with which it's lumped. It's been a nature reserve since 2002 and has a lively history of failed occupation -- hard to believe for a place of barren cliffs, near-zero precipitation and risk of leaks of radioactive material from the nearby wreck of a nuclear submarine. Reaching Bear Island: Getting to the heart of Svalbard is a relatively simple matter -- there are daily flights from Oslo and Tromso to Svalbard's capital, Longyearbyen, on the west coast of Spitsbergen. Now it gets tricky. Research vessels infrequently call on Bear Island (the Norwegian Polar Institute makes an occasional appearance), while individually chartered boats and the occasional adventure cruise (such as this one from Polar Quest) haul in the remaining visitors. Bouvet1,000 miles from Antarctica . Tristan da Cunha is the remotest inhabited island in the world -- now, welcome to its uninhabited, far bleaker counterpart. Its cliffs are sheer. It's almost entirely covered by a glacier. In winter, its seas are pack ice. And its nearest neighbor is Antarctica, 1,000 miles to the south. In short, idyllic. Reaching Bouvet: The entire island is a nature reserve -- so unless you can make a compelling case for visiting, you'll be blocked by Norwegian authorities. Get permission, and it's now a simple matter of finding a research vessel, quickly mastering a valuable skill such as arctic geological surveying or marine biology and then getting someone to land you via helicopter. (There are no ports or harbors.) If all else fails, try becoming an amateur radio enthusiast: In 1990, a multinational expedition of operators spent 16 days on the island. Bishop Rock30 miles from England . Regarded by Guinness as the world's smallest island with a building on it, Bishop Rock stands at the end of Britain's Isles of Scilly, where coastal waters give way to the fury of the Atlantic. In 1847, engineers started building an iron lighthouse there -- and it washed away in a storm. Its extraordinary successor, first lit in 1858, stands to this day. Reaching Bishop Rock: Visiting the most southwesterly point in Britain is surprisingly easy -- the St. Mary's Boatsmen's Association runs day trips. But as Martin Hesp notes, even on a ""calm"" day you're in for serious chop. Boreray60 miles off mainland Scotland . Love the Scottish islands, but want something with a little more bite? Head west of the Outer Hebrides, and you'll find the archipelago of St. Kilda, 40 miles into the Atlantic. It's one of Scotland's five World Heritage sites, with a main island that was abandoned in the 1930s when crops failed. Imagine the surprise of archaeologists when they found that one of the least hospitable islands, Boreray, was occupied in prehistoric times. Reaching Boreray: Since Boreray comes under the protection of the National Trust for Scotland, you need its permission to visit. Then? Lots of time and lots of luck -- with a rugged shoreline and savage sea swell, this isn't an island built for landings. According to one guide, more people have reached the summit of Everest than have landed at Boreray since the National Trust took ownership in 1957. North Sentinel Island . 400 miles from Myanmar . North Sentinel is one of the 572 islands making up the Andaman chain in the Indian Ocean's Bay of Bengal. It's surrounded by dangerous reefs, but North Sentinel is intimidating because of its inhabitants. The Sentinelese want nothing to do with the modern world and have repeatedly rebuffed attempts to make peaceful contact. Reaching North Sentinel Island: You're kidding, right? If the above description didn't put you off, this article about a pair of fishermen who strayed onto the island certainly should. Rockall270 miles from Ireland . If you think Boreray sounds forbidding, try sailing 187 miles west of it. Rockall is the tip of an extinct volcano reaching 20 meters (about 65 feet) above sea level, in seas with waves recorded as high as 29 meters (95 feet). In 1955, the British Empire, in its final territorial acquisition, seized Rockall -- allegedly due to fears the Soviets would build a missile battery on it. Reaching Rockall: In the words of the recently minted Rockall Club, ""visiting Rockall is difficult, completely weather dependent and not cheap."" Your best bet is contacting Kilda Cruises and arranging a tailor-made excursion. Or you could sail there, lash yourself to the rock and claim it as your very own micronation -- but you wouldn't be the first.","Forget swaying palms; these islands offer real solitude .

"(CNN)An Oklahoma lawmaker says people will not be fined $500 for wearing hooded sweatshirts in public, despite some interpretations of a proposed law concerning hoods and masks. It is already against the law in Oklahoma to wear a ""mask, hood or covering"" that conceals the wearer's identity during the commission of a crime or for the purpose of harassment or intimidation. Republican state Sen. Don Barrington's SB 13 would make it a crime to wear a ""robe, mask or other disguise"" in public that would ""intentionally conceal the wearer's identity."" Violators would face fines from $50 to $500. Since the bill was introduced in December, some have interpreted it to include hooded sweatshirts, or ""hoodies."" Media reports have also said that the bill includes ""hoodies,"" though it is not immediately clear from where this interpretation came. But Barrington points out that the word ""hoodie"" is not mentioned in the legislation, except for the reference to hoods in the first section. ""The bill is not designed to ban hoodies, but to prevent the wearing of masks or disguises in the commission of a crime,"" Barrington said in a statement. The measure provides a number of exceptions, including religious garments, Halloween celebrations, parades, weather protection and other circumstances. Because hooded garments, or hoodies, are often worn as weather protection and not for the purposes of intentional concealment, it is unlikely they would be considered a disguise under the bill, he said in an email. ""The proposal is intended to protect law abiding citizens, not limit their rights,"" he said. ""This is simply an attempt to combat crime and make businesses and public spaces safer for everyone."" No states or counties have active legislation banning hooded sweatshirts or ""hoodies."" But schools, businesses and government buildings have been able to institute their own bans on hooded sweatshirts. The bill will be considered when Oklahoma's legislative session begins in February. It has to be heard and passed out of committee during the early weeks of February to move onto to the full Senate and then the Oklahoma House.","Some interpret bill banning robes or masks in public spaces to include hooded sweatshirts .

"When first revealed, Morten Storm's account of his life as a double agent inside al Qaeda sent shockwaves through Denmark's political and intelligence establishment. The first accounts came in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten in October 2012. In those articles, and in his new memoir ""Agent Storm: My Life Inside al Qaeda and the CIA,"" which we co-authored, Storm recounted how after being recruited by Danish intelligence agency PET, he helped the CIA target several al Qaeda terrorists for assassination, most notably the American terrorist cleric Anwar a-Awlaki, who was killed in a CIA drone strike in September 2011. The allegations have proven explosive in Denmark, where it is illegal for the government to take part in targeted killings. Storm says his Danish handlers set up and attended meetings he had with the CIA in Denmark and overseas at which plans to track down terrorists were set in motion. He says Danish intelligence was fully aware the Americans planned to use lethal force. Storm has significant corroborating evidence to back up his claim. He provided us with several hours of secret iPhone recordings of meetings and phone calls with his Danish and American intelligence handlers during which several of the kill missions were discussed. CNN has not been able to independently authenticate the recordings, but the time the electronic files were first created were consistent with his account. One of the recordings was of a meeting he says was set up with his PET and CIA handlers at a Danish resort a week after al-Awlaki was killed. On the tape, Storm makes clear to an American interlocutor that he and Danish intelligence had been key to getting al-Awlaki: . ""We took initiative to create this because the Americans failed in their attempt to hit Anwar, they failed in their attempts to trace Anwar al-Awlaki, the Americans have failed in every single attempt to arrest or kill Anwar al-Awlaki, except when we went in, we traced him down again, created contacts with him, now he is dead, because of the work we have done."" Agent claims he had been promised $5 million . In the same recording, the American can be heard telling Storm that President Barack Obama knew about his contribution to the al-Awlaki mission, ""We had our whole project going forward -- of which you played the highest role,' he said. But the American denied Storm provided the critical breakthrough, frustrating Storm, who told CNN he had been promised $5 million if he led the CIA to the terrorist cleric. It was after this meeting he first made contact with the Danish newspaper. After Jyllands-Posten first broke the story, PET refused to confirm or deny Storm's claims. ""Out of consideration for PET's operational work, the PET neither can nor will confirm publicly that specific persons have been used as sources by the PET,"" it said. ""However, the PET does not participate in or support operations where the objective is to kill civilians. The PET did therefore not contribute to the military operation that led to the killing of al-Awlaki in Yemen,"" then-PET director Jakob Scharf stated. Neither PET nor the CIA responded to CNN's requests for further comment. Storm's revelations led Danish parliamentarians to demand new oversight rules for PET. In January 2013, Storm met with several of them in Copenhagen. Denmark's Ministry of Justice announced it would set up a supervisory board to oversee the Danish intelligence agency, without acknowledging Storm was the reason. Then-Justice Minister Morten Bodskov said the new board would strike ""the right balance that will ensure that we have an effective intelligence agency and a good rule of law."" But the government resisted calls from opposition MP's for a full parliamentary inquiry. After the publication of another Jyllands-Posten article in March 2013, with fresh evidence retrieved from Storm's cell phones, Storm's account received heavyweight backing from Denmark's former spy chief. Hans Jorgen Bonnichsen, Scharf's predecessor as head of PET, told Danish television that the corroborating evidence presented in the Danish media suggested the PET had used Storm to track down terrorist operatives overseas to help the U.S. target them for assassination. Bonnischen was at the helm of the intelligence agency in the period before Storm says he was recruited as an agent. In late 2013, a political scandal forced the resignations of PET Director Scharf and Interior Minister Bodskov after it emerged Scharf had instructed subordinates to obtain information on the movements of a Danish MP. Reforms may be coming in Denmark . The revelations put Storm's story back in the public spotlight. Bonnichsen sharpened his criticism of PET, asserting the disclosures on Danish involvement in assassination plans overseas were so serious there was a basis for a criminal investigation. At the end of the year the beleaguered agency was put under more pressure when Jyllands-Posten disclosed PET's refusal to offer Storm protection after ISIS linked militants in Syria threatened his life in a video. ""Is it really a satisfactory way for the security services to carry out their task in that it takes three weeks before you answer a former employee who -- rightly -- felt threatened by Islamists?' the chairman of the Danish People's Party told the newspaper. Storm now lives in hiding in an undisclosed location in the UK, and says he currently receives no protection from any Western intelligence service. In April 2014, the pressure on Denmark increased further when the Open Society Foundation, a New York based legal advocacy group, called on Denmark to acknowledge its role in al-Awlaki's killing and announced it had filed freedom of information requests with the Danish government regarding Storm. ""Danish officials have refused to respond specifically and meaningfully to numerous questions posed on this subject by the legal affairs committee of Denmark's parliament,"" a press release by the group stated. ""The evidence that has been revealed by Jyllands-Posten, is very worrying. They show that PET actively cooperated with the CIA in the operation to track down and kill Anwar al-Awlaki. They show that PET was eager to cover up his role in the program. They show that PET was trying to hide the truth from the Danish public. The evidence suggests that PET may have violated the Danish Criminal Code provisions relating to murder and international legal prohibitions on, among others, the right to life, among other laws. These are very serious offenses,"" Amrit Singh, the senior legal officer for national security and counterterrorism for the Open Society Justice Initiative, told Jyllands Posten. Bonnischen told CNN new oversight rules for PET are now being discussed which would require the agency to submit an annual report to a parliamentary oversight committee on how many agents it was running and how they were being run. Magnus Ranstorp, one of Scandinavia's leading counterterrorism academics, told CNN Storm's revelations had ""opened a Pandora's box of ethical problems which will probably lead in the future to PET's ability or leeway to act being restricted."" It is rare indeed for an intelligence informant to go public about his work. In Storm's case the disclosures may change the law -- and radically change the way his former employer works.

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder said Sunday that the Justice Department was considering a federal lawsuit against Arizona's new immigration law. ""We are considering all of our options. One possibility is filing a lawsuit,"" Holder told NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Possible grounds for the lawsuit would be whether the Arizona law could lead to civil rights violations, he said. The recently enacted Arizona law initially allowed police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency, based solely on a police officer's suspicion that the person might be in the country illegally. Arizona lawmakers soon amended the law so that officers could check a person's status only if the person had been stopped or arrested for another reason. Critics say the law will lead to racial profiling, while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants. In Arizona, the city councils of Tucson and Flagstaff have decided to challenge the new immigration law in court. Holder told ABC's ""This Week"" program that one concern about the Arizona law is that ""you'll end up in a situation where people are racially profiled, and that could lead to a wedge drawn between certain communities and law enforcement, which leads to the problem of people in those communities not willing to interact with people in law enforcement, not willing to share information, not willing to be witnesses where law enforcement needs them."" ""I think we could potentially get on a slippery slope where people will be picked on because of how they look as opposed to what they have done, and that is, I think, something that we have to try to avoid at all costs,"" Holder added. Holder said comprehensive federal immigration reform is the best approach for the problem of illegal immigrants crossing U.S. borders. His stance echoed the approach favored by President Obama, who last week criticized the Arizona law and said he wants Congress to work on the issue this year. Comprehensive immigration reform would include continuing government efforts to secure borders from illegal immigrants, as well as steps to crack down on businesses that employ them, Obama said at a Cinco de Mayo celebration at the White House. In addition, he said, those living illegally in the United States would have to pay a penalty and any taxes they owe, learn English and ""make themselves right with the law"" before starting the process of gaining U.S. citizenship.","""We are considering all our options"" against Arizona law, Eric Holder says .

"The parents of Kendrick Johnson, whose death this year created a mystery that has gripped a South Georgia town, held a rally at the state Capitol on Wednesday, a day after filing a complaint with the state about the handling of their son's body. The ""Who Killed K.J."" rally had several scheduled speakers, according to a news release from the Johnson family, but the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Joseph Lowery -- both of whom were slated to address the demonstrators, the family said -- never spoke. That didn't stop more than 100 protesters from assembling at the Capitol before noon. Johnson was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at his high school in Valdosta, Georgia, on January 11. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation conducted an autopsy and ruled the death accidental, but his family questioned the ruling and had his body exhumed for a second autopsy. At the second autopsy, it was discovered that his organs were missing and his body cavity was filled with newspapers, contrary to industry practice. The family's complaint, filed Tuesday with the Georgia Board of Funeral Service, a division of the secretary of state's office, alleges that Harrington Funeral Home mishandled Johnson's body and specifically accuses director Antonio Harrington of helping obscure the teen's cause of death. However, the funeral home's attorney, Roy Copeland, said in an October letter to CNN that coroner Bill Watson has already stated that ""the accusations and innuendo regarding Mr. Harrington's involvement in the disposition of young Mr. Johnson's internal organs are baseless."" According to ""The Principles and Practices of Embalming,"" a sentence of which was included in an October letter Copeland sent to CNN, when the organs have been removed in an autopsy, the person handling the body should dry the cavity, ""dusting it with hardening compound or embalming powder and then filling it with dry, clean sawdust or cotton mixed with a small quantity of hardening compound or embalming powder."" Copeland conceded at a November interview that newspaper was not listed, but he added, ""nor is it precluded as one type of foreign substance that may be introduced into a body for purposes of building it up for public display."" Gov. Nathan Deal's office did not respond to questions about whether Deal had faith in the local investigation into Johnson's death or the subsequent GBI autopsy. Asked whether Deal would call for a special investigation, spokeswoman Sasha Dlugolenski said, ""We have been told that the U.S. Attorney's Office is looking into the case. ""This is such a tragedy, and we extend our deepest sympathy to this young man's family and friends. It is our hope that the U.S. Attorney's Office will be able to shed some light on the situation."" Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said in October that federal authorities would investigate the circumstances behind Johnson's death. The family's complaint alleges that when Johnson's body was exhumed for a second autopsy, ""all of our son's inner organs, including his brain, were missing."" CNN was the first to report the development in October. Harrington has previously told the family that the organs were missing when he took custody of the body after the GBI autopsy, and Copeland said last month that the funeral home  ""absolutely, positively"" did not receive the organs. ""There is no collusion between Mr. Harrington and any law enforcement. In fact, I'm appalled that anyone would even suggest that,"" Copeland told CNN. William Anderson, a pathologist hired by the Johnson family's attorney, further told the family ""that our son was stuffed with newspaper. At no time did we ever authorize the removal of our son's inner organs for any purpose whatsoever,"" the complaint says. Harrington Funeral Home never informed the family the organs were missing, and the GBI said it replaced all of the organs after the autopsy, the complaint alleges. Harrington initially said ""one or two organs might be missing,"" according to the complaint, but in an October 4 letter to the family's attorney, C.B. King Jr., Harrington said the organs had been ""destroyed"" and ""discarded ... before the body was sent back to Valdosta,"" where the funeral home took custody of the body. ""It is our belief that Mr. Harrington, at best, misled us as to the condition of our son's body, and at worse, is responsible for the removal and destruction of his organs, and, thus, desecration of our son's body,"" the complaint says. The family concludes by requesting an investigation and alleging that Harrington engaged in fraud by misleading the family into believing Johnson's remains were intact and ""facilitated a coverup"" that deprived pathologists of ""the means by which to determine how he may have died,"" the complaint says. The funeral home has not commented to CNN in the past, but Harrington said in the October letter to the Johnsons' attorney that the prosector -- an agent who prepares bodies for pathological examination -- discarded the organs. The secretary of state's office confirmed receiving the Johnsons' complaint Tuesday, but would not comment. The Georgia Board of Funeral Service says all investigations are confidential, but after a formal hearing, several resolutions are possible: It can close the probe and take no action; it can issue a ""letter of concern,"" which won't be made public; it can issue a public inspection report; or it can publicly or privately handle any violation with the funeral home.","Rally at Capitol draws scores of protesters wanting answers about teen's death .

"The arrests occurred thousands of miles apart, but the scenes were similar in Oregon and Texas early Sunday: In the dark of night, police told Occupy demonstrators to leave protest sites. Those who refused were handcuffed and arrested. Authorities in Portland, Oregon, and Austin, Texas, say protesters were trespassing and violating city rules. Demonstrators say authorities were infringing on protesters' rights to assemble. Police arrested more than two dozen people who refused to leave a park in northwest Portland, Oregon, after warnings that the park closed at midnight, police said. Authorities in Portland ""gave protesters numerous opportunities to simply walk away or choose to be arrested,"" Mayor Sam Adams told CNN affiliate KPTV. ""This tonight was, I think, an unnecessary confrontation that we worked really hard to minimize,"" he said. Occupy Portland offered a different take. ""Six mounted police and approximately 65 police in riot gear pushed supporters to the sidewalks and conducted the arrests over a period of several hours,"" the group said in a statement. A Twitter post from the group as police entered the park said, ""This is what a police state looks like."" Police also arrested 38 people in Austin, Texas, who had set up a table with food and other items outside City Hall two days after the city issued rules saying food tables at the event must be put away between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. When the group was asked to leave the area, the 38 refused and were arrested, police said. ""A number of individuals decided to try to prevent the police from taking the food table, so they formed a ring around it. That's when they (police) started pulling people out arresting them,"" Occupy Austin member Ronnie Garza told CNN affiliate YNN. Group members questioned the legitimacy of the city's new guidelines, saying they were not passed by a City Council vote, YNN reported. ""These were arbitrary rules that came from City Hall which is what spurred people to resist in a non-violent way,"" Garza said. Austin Police Chief Aft Acevedo told YNN police were doing their jobs. ""We steam clean the plaza for health and safety reasons three times a week. The Occupy Austin members have always been very cooperative,"" he said. ""Tonight, it looks like a few people decided to exercise civil disobedience and have been arrested."" Austin police arrested four more people Sunday afternoon, according to officer Dennis Farris. Of the 38 arrested earlier, he said they are in the process of being released. If they return to the protest, they will be given ""every opportunity to leave,"" said Farris. ""We're going to bend over backwards."" Demonstrators across the country are protesting corporate greed and corruption. Many say the nation's wealthiest 1% hold inordinate sway over the remaining 99% of the population. Scores of protesters have been arrested nationwide during the weeks-long ""Occupy"" movement. On Friday, police said 51 demonstrators in San Diego, California, were arrested for various charges, including encroachment, unlawful assembly, illegal lodging and/or some form of obstruction of officers. Three others were arrested on similar charges in Tampa, Florida, according to a police statement. In Atlanta, police arrested demonstrators at a downtown park overnight Tuesday. The arrests came after Mayor Kasim Reed said he sent ministers to the park ""to see if we can find a way to resolve this amicably."" In Nashville, Tennessee, authorities arrested more than two dozen protesters overnight Saturday, after they again defied a curfew imposed by the state's governor. Twenty-six people received citations for trespassing, while two others were cited for public intoxication, according to Tennessee public safety spokeswoman Dalya Qualls. On Thursday, Oakland, California, Mayor Jean Quan apologized for authorities' confrontations with demonstrators, who were tear-gassed. The clashes led to the hospitalization of an Iraq war veteran. Marine veteran Scott Olsen suffered a skull fracture Tuesday night after allegedly being struck by a tear gas canister in Oakland, according to witnesses. Despite recent crackdowns against demonstrators nationwide, the loosely defined ""Occupy"" movement does not appear to be losing steam. In New York, where the Occupy movement was born, protesters braved snow, sleet and rain during an unusually early snowstorm in the Northeast this weekend. Activist Angela Davis addressed the crowd on Sunday, stressing the importance of taking time to build real community. ""I'm persuaded that this is the beginning of something really wonderful, really vast, really great. And I should say that it connects with movements that are happening in other parts of the world,"" she told CNN's Don Lemon.","Four more protesters are arrested in Austin, Texas .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Lamborghinis and Bentleys still cruise Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Beverly Hills officials say they expect tax revenues to drop by about $24 million over the next 16 months. But these days, visitors to California's most famous ZIP code are more likely to take note of the empty storefronts and deep-discount signs. Call it recession, 90210 style. Fewer sales have meant fewer tax dollars even for this well-funded city. City officials say they expect tax revenues to drop by about $24 million over the next 16 months. They say, as far as they know, that's the biggest single blow to the city budget in Beverly Hills' 93-year history. Budget cuts being considered to cover the shortfall include reducing police overtime. Extreme wealth often cushions cities, just as it does individuals, during recessions. But Beverly Hills business owners say they're feeling the impact this time. Jordan Tabach-Bank owns The Beverly Loan Co., which bills itself as ""Pawn Shop to The Stars."" Since the 1930s, three generations of his family have offered socialites, businesspeople and celebrities confidential loans for precious jewels and artwork. He says now he's giving more loans and they're bigger than ever, including ones to local business owners needing money to cover payroll and keep their businesses afloat. ""Doctors, lawyers, accountants,"" he said. ""I recently had a hedge-fund manager in here getting a large loan on his collection of diamonds."" Nearby, boutique owner Parvin Yonani said she's slashed prices by as much as 85 percent. She says tourists are staying home and Beverly Hills residents are holding on to their money. She cut the price on a pair of shoes from $1,800 to $245. ""Still I couldn't sell it,"" she said. ""I paid about $800. So you're taking a loss."" Another local business owner, Thomas Blumenthal of Geary's Beverly Hills, said there are still signs of life in the West Coast mecca of the well-to-do. He's had to trim some of his employees' hours, but hasn't made any other major changes, he said. ""The wealthy still have money,"" he said. ""We're still seeing people coming in, spending money on new homes, redoing their homes, buying new jewelry and statement pieces. ""It's just not happening as much as it was last year."" Jerry Nickelsburg, an economist at University of California, Los Angeles, said that considering measures like home foreclosures, the downturn hasn't been as bleak in Beverly Hills as other cities. But he said that in one crucial way, this recession cuts across income lines. He said a collapse in consumer spending last September has continued until now. ""That collapse in consumption was widespread and based on a fear -- uncertainty -- about the future,"" he said. ""So that really crossed all income classes.""

"(CNN) -- The agreement between President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the most important advance in the several decades-long history of international climate negotiations. It has been greeted with rage by those in Congress whose positions on the science are denialist or evasive (""I am not a scientist""). Their criticisms are specious and predictable. But while most climate scientists I know are still sharing a period of joy following its announcement, some substantive criticisms of the agreement have also been raised. I want to address two of them here. One is that the agreement doesn't do enough to solve the problem of global warming. The other is that it doesn't promise anything that wasn't likely to happen anyway. Both of these criticisms have some truth, but neither diminishes the importance of what Presidents Obama and Xi have achieved. First, critics say the agreement doesn't go far enough. The argument here is that the emissions cuts will not be enough to limit the global mean surface temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius, the benchmark beyond which climate change will be ""dangerous,"" according to the nonbinding international agreement reached in Copenhagen in 2009. The new U.S.-China agreement alone is indeed very unlikely to keep future warming below 2C. To achieve 2C, further cuts beyond those spelled out in the agreement will be needed. Or -- or better, and -- we need Earth's climate sensitivity (how much warming we'll get for a given level of greenhouse gas increases) not to be at the high end of the range that the best current science, with its attendant uncertainties, has it. The first is within the control of the world's politicians. On the second, we all just have to hope -- and we scientists have to keep working hard to try to reduce the uncertainties. But we have to take success where we can get it. After decades of failed climate talks -- in which the U.S. was often a big part of the reason for failure and China was a big part of our excuse for dragging our feet -- this is every bit the political breakthrough it appears to be. While it's not enough on its own, the momentum couldn't be more welcome after so many years of inaction and bad news. It was gratifying to see President Obama pushing the issue at the G20 summit in Australia, a country with as much denialism in its current government as the United States. Further, while we need goals, and 2C is an important one, we have to understand that we don't get to give up if we miss them. If 2C is dangerous, 3C or 4C is more so. Emissions reductions that don't get us where we want to be are still a lot better than none at all. The second big criticism is that the emissions cuts might have happened anyway. The argument here is that Obama had already committed to cuts putting us along the trajectory in the agreement until 2020 (with the EPA regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant and the new rules on power plants) and has now just extended the same trajectory to 2025. Similarly, some argue that the Chinese too would be aiming for their targets in the agreement even without it. On the U.S. side, at least, the howls from Congress show that this argument isn't completely true. It will take real political capital for Obama, or any future U.S. president, to fight off the attacks of the deniers and fossil fuel industry shills. And the new targets certainly represent a major policy change for China as well - even if it's one they were ready to make, recognizing a need to cut back on coal for air pollution as well as climate reasons. But for the sake of argument, let's accept this criticism as true. This is not something wrong; history suggests that it's how these agreements work, when they work. The most successful global environmental agreement to date is the 1987 Montreal Protocol, which began the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in order to stop the depletion of stratospheric ozone. The Montreal Protocol didn't happen because politicians found a way to force recalcitrant factions in government and industry to go along with it. It happened because the chemical manufacturers had already come up with CFC substitutes. They were not just ready to accept the protocol's restrictions; they were looking forward to selling a whole lot of new air conditioners and refrigerators. Unfortunately, the currently available alternatives to fossil fuels are not as ready to take over our energy systems now as the CFC substitutes were ready to take over our refrigeration systems in 1987. And neither government nor the private sector has made the large-scale investments in getting them ready that the scale of the problem warrants. Under the circumstances, this new agreement couldn't realistically solve climate as completely as the Montreal Protocol solved ozone. But it's a sign that things have started to move. If the United States and China had reached an agreement now that everyone could agree was definitely enough to keep us below 2C -- despite the political challenges, the technical challenges and the possibility of a more rather than less sensitive climate -- it would have been at best highly aspirational, at worst simply unrealistic. So indeed, the actual agreement is far from a complete solution to the climate problem. But it's a huge step forward. And it is one not despite the fact that its goals are attainable, but because of that. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Adam Sobel.","U.S.-China accord on curbing carbon emissions is a huge step, says Adam Sobel .
He says critics who say it doesn't go far enough are in danger of missing key points .

"Simran Mahant's excitement is palpable ahead of heading to the nearby polling booth in a small village in northern India. This is the first time that the 23-year-old transgender dancer will vote in the country's parliamentary election. With an official identity stamp, Simran will also be able to get a passport and travel abroad. The first destination? ""Singapore,"" says the dancer. ""Seeing everyone vote made me feel there is something abnormal about me,"" says Simran, through an interpreter. ""Now, I have my own identity."" Simran is among the three million transgender Indians who will now be entitled to the same rights and welfare support given to other socially and economically disadvantaged classes. Transgender is a broad community encompassing people whose gender identity does not align to their assigned sex. In a landmark judgment passed on Tuesday, the country's highest court has recognized transgender people as a third sex, allowing them equal access to education, healthcare and employment, and prohibiting discrimination against them. Third gender . The move reflects a growing wave of recognition of the rights of transgender for equal recognition internationally. Earlier this month, the Australian High Court also ruled that the government should legally recognize a third gender, in response to a case filed by a sexual equality campaigner in Sydney. Even social networking site Facebook has announced plans to offer users new gender options. ""Even though we are at a very early stage, there is an unstoppable movement in the world towards recognition of their rights,"" says Hong Kong-based Michael Vidler, a human rights lawyer. According to a 2012 report by the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, 20 countries have recently passed progressive legislation on the issue, including Argentina, Uruguay, and Portugal. Last year, Germany became the first European country to allow parents of intersex children -- those born with both genitals -- to mark their birth certificates with an ""X."" Asian countries including Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh have also been visible in their efforts in the last few years to implement policies recognizing ""third gender"" people. In India, this is the first time citizens can choose an ""others"" option on voter ID cards. Simran, who makes a living by dancing at weddings and festivals, was adamant about not ticking a female or male option on the voter ID card. ""The authorities wanted documents to prove my gender,"" said Simran. ""The doctor refused to give me a medical certificate. I was asked to get a police inquiry done, but no one agreed to take responsibility."" Having their gender recognized will help transgender people access government schemes. For some, it finally means getting something as basic as an electricity connection or a bank account. ""Till now, many departments didn't even know something like a third gender existed,"" says Dhananjay Chauhan, who runs Saksham Trust, an NGO working for LGBT rights in India. Right to marriage versus identity recognition . However, even as transgender people are no longer coerced to conform to specific genders in certain countries, they are still denied acceptance in most. Same-sex marriage remains illegal in countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. India's historic ruling now prohibits discrimination against transgender people on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation, but activists say it conflicts with the country's existing stance on homosexuality. Last December, the Indian Supreme Court reinstated Section 377 of the Indian penal code, making gay sex a punishable offense. ""This new judgment contradicts Section 377, which has been used and misused to harass sexual minorities,"" said Delhi-based Shaleen Rakesh, a gay rights activist and director of the India HIV/Aids Alliance. ""If the government wants to synchronize the law with this judgment, the perfect timing and opportunity is now here."" In other countries, the fight is centered on legal recognition of transgender people. In the United States, laws vary depending on the state as some prohibit gender-based discrimination. As the LGBT community continues its struggle for equality, the nature of the fight remains specific to each country. In India, Simran's battle is with the word used in official documents. ""What do you mean by 'others'? I am a transgender. I should be known by just that.""","India has given a third-gender status to transgender people, recognizing them as citizens .

"(CNN)Bess Myerson, the 1945 Miss America winner who became a celebrated media personality and public servant and then was brought down by scandal, has died. She was 90. According to a statement from the Miss America Organization, she died in Santa Monica, California, on December 14. No cause of death was given. Myerson's rise to fame was a classic rags-to-riches American success story: a bright Bronx girl from a housing project, the daughter of a house painter, who won the nation's most famous beauty contest and parlayed her renown into a media career. She became a model and spokesperson and spent many years on the game show ""I've Got a Secret."" The path to celebrity was one followed by such pageant winners as Lee Meriwether, Mary Ann Mobley, Phyllis George and Vanessa Williams. Later Myerson became part of New York's city government, serving as both commissioner of consumer affairs and commissioner of cultural affairs. Myerson was also a role model in the Jewish community. If Jewish baseball players Hank Greenberg and Sandy Koufax were celebrated for their athletic abilities -- a response to jokes about Jews' lack of athletic skills -- Myerson was celebrated for her role as the first (and, to this day, only) Jewish Miss America. She won her pageant title in early September 1945 just after the end of World War II, a time when the horrors of the Holocaust were just being revealed. ""Her victory was seen by many as a symbolic statement of America's post-war rejection of the crimes and prejudices that ravaged Europe as well as a representation of the vitality of the American Jewish community,"" noted a biography on the Jewish Women's Archive site. Myerson had even been asked to change her name for the pageant -- an idea she refused. ""It was the most important decision I ever made,"" she recalled. ""It told me who I was, that I was first and foremost a Jew."" It was a decision with consequences, as some Miss America sponsors refused to have her represent them. Nonetheless, the talented and intelligent Myerson -- who played the flute and piano at the pageant and used her Miss America scholarship money to pay for graduate studies at Juilliard and Columbia -- landed on her feet, becoming a popular TV personality in the '50s and '60s. Members of the Jewish community looked up to her. ""Bess Myerson was the most important female image in your life,"" said a 1940s teenager quoted in Edward S. Shapiro's ""We Are Many: Reflections On American Jewish History And Identity."" ""We didn't just know about her. We felt her."" For decades, Myerson was a well-known and beloved figure around New York. During Ed Koch's 1977 campaign for New York mayor, she was often at his side, giving rise to rumors of a romance with the bachelor politician. ""Koch wouldn't have won without Bess,"" Koch's campaign strategist, David Garth, told New York magazine. But she fell short of higher office herself, losing a U.S. Senate primary in 1980. After Koch named her to the city's Cultural Affairs department in 1983, she saw her name tarred by the ""Bess Mess,"" a mid-'80s scandal involving a romantic affair with a married contractor and an alleged quid pro quo with the judge in his divorce trial. Myerson was eventually acquitted, but she was forced to resign her job. Moreover, other revelations about her life came to light, including another affair and a shoplifting charge. She lived out the remainder of her life quietly, devoting her energy to charitable causes. Myerson was married three times. Her first marriage, to Navy veteran Allan Wayne, ended in divorce in 1956. She was married twice to lawyer Arnold Grant before finally divorcing him in 1971. She is survived by a daughter.","Bess Myerson was noted Miss America winner, New York figure .

Galavis, in an apology posted on his Facebook page Saturday, said he meant to say that gay and bisexuals are too ""affectionate and intense"" for television. TheTV network called his comments ""careless, thoughtless and insensitive,"" saying the opinions ""in no way reflect the views of the network, the show's producers or studio."" Galavis made the comments in response to TheTVPage.com writer Sean Daly's question at a network party: ""Do you think it would be good at some point to have a gay or bisexual bachelor?"" He began by saying ""I respect them, but honestly I don't think it's a good example for kids to watch that on TV."" ""I respect that 100%,"" he said, before launching into a rambling response about how ""now there's fathers having kids and all that, and it is hard for me to understand that, too, in the sense of a household having peoples. Two parents sleeping in the same bed and the kid going into bed, and you know it's confusing in a sense. But I respect them because they want to have kids. They want to be parents. So it is a scale. Where do you put it on the scale? Where's the thin line to cross or not? You have to respect everybody's desires, opinions and way of living. But it would be too hard for TV."" But the comment that caused the most uproar was: ""There's this thing about gay people. It seems to me, you know, and I don't know if I'm mistaken or not. I have a lot of friends like that, but they're more pervert in a sense and to me the show will be too strong, too hard to watch on TV."" In his apology ""to all the people I may have offended,"" Galavis said he ""would never disrespect anyone"" and he has ""nothing but respect for gay people and their families."" In fact, he said, ""one of my closest friends"" who is gay is ""like a brother."" ""The word pervert was not what I meant to say and I am very sorry about it,"" he said. ""Everyone knows English is my second language and my vocabulary is not as broad as it is in Spanish and, because of this, sometimes I use the wrong words to express myself. What I meant to say was that gay people are more affectionate and intense and for a segment of the TV audience this would be too racy to accept."" His own show is ""very racy"" and he does not allow his 5-year-old daughter to watch, he said. GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) announced that Galavis will meet with gay and lesbian Latino families this week in Los Angeles. Monica Trasandes, GLAAD's director of Spanish language and Latino media and a lesbian mom, who will attend the meeting, said she hopes this will be an opportunity for ""Bachelor"" fans to learn more about gay families. ""At a time when Latino support for gay and lesbian people and our families is growing, we look forward to continuing the conversation with Juan Pablo and working with him to help educate his fans about who gay and lesbian parents are,"" she said. ""Study after study shows that young people raised by gay parents are as happy and healthy as other young people."" Does Hollywood have a Latino problem?

"The death of 17-year-old Kendrick Johnson was awful enough for his parents. Then came the doubts about investigators' conclusion that it was an accident. But the discovery that their son's body and skull had been stuffed with newspaper before burial added a horrific new dimension to their anguish and further fueled their skepticism of the official findings. ""We have been let down again,"" his father, Kenneth Johnson, told CNN. ""When we buried Kendrick, we thought we were burying Kendrick, not half of Kendrick."" Kendrick Johnson was found dead in a gym at Lowndes County High School in January. State medical examiners concluded that the three-sport athlete suffocated after getting stuck in a rolled-up gym mat while reaching for a sneaker. Death was not accidental, family's autopsy finds . His parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, never have bought that explanation. They won a court order to have their son's body exhumed and a second autopsy performed in June. During an autopsy, internal organs are removed and examined before being returned for burial. But when Dr. Bill Anderson, the private pathologist who conducted the second autopsy, opened up the teen's remains, the brain, heart, lungs, liver and other viscera were missing. Every organ from the pelvis to the skull was gone. ""I'm not sure at this point who did not return the organs to the body,"" Anderson said. ""But I know when we got the body, the organs were not there."" Two entities had custody of Kendrick Johnson's body after his death -- the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which conducted the first autopsy in January; and the Harrington Funeral Home in Valdosta, which handled the teen's embalming and burial. GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang told CNN that after the autopsy, ""the organs were placed in Johnson's body, the body was closed, then the body was released to the funeral home."" That's normal practice, Lang said. The funeral home would not comment to CNN. But in a letter to the Johnsons' attorney, funeral home owner Antonio Harrington said his firm never received the teen's organs. Harrington wrote that the organs ""were destroyed through natural process"" due to the position of Kendrick Johnson's body when he died, and ""discarded by the prosector before the body was sent back to Valdosta."" A prosector dissects the body for pathological examination. Scene points to foul play . Stuffing a body with old newsprint and department-store circulars -- ""like he was a garbage can,"" as Jacquelyn Johnson put it -- isn't exactly standard practice in forensic pathology or the mortician's trade. Vernie Fountain, the founder of a Missouri embalming school, called it ""not consistent with the standards of care"" in the industry. And Dr. Gregory Schmunk, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners, told CNN, ""I have never heard of this practice."" Organs are typically placed in plastic bag, which is then put back into the body cavity after an autopsy, Schmunk told CNN in an e-mail. While individual organs may be kept back for further testing, he wrote, ""This would not amount to all of the organs in any circumstance that I can imagine."" Funeral homes are licensed by the Georgia Secretary of State's office, which has opened an investigation into how Johnson's body was treated, said Jared Thomas, a spokesman for the agency. Anderson, who was hired by the Johnson family for a second autopsy, found Kendrick Johnson had sustained a blow to the right side of his neck that was ""consistent with inflicted injury."" Challenging the state autopsy's finding of positional asphyxiation, he concluded the teen died as the result of ""unexplained, apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma."" And death scene imagery obtained exclusively by CNN has led a former FBI agent to question how Johnson died: ""I think this young man met with foul play,"" said Harold Copus, now an Atlanta private investigator. Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine refused to discuss the matter with CNN, calling Johnson's death a closed case. The U.S. Justice Department announced in September that it wouldn't open a civil rights investigation into the case. But federal prosecutors in south Georgia have met with the family's representatives and are weighing whether to open their own probe, said Michael Moore, the U.S. attorney whose district includes Valdosta. ""This is about getting to the facts and the truth, and we want the Johnson family and the community of Valdosta to have confidence in the process,"" Moore said. ""I am cognizant of time, and we continue to move the process along."" Moore urged anyone with information about Johnson's death to contact his office. Johnson's parents have come to believe their son's death was no accident, and the macabre discovery about their son's body has only deepened that belief. ""It's unbearable, just about,"" Jacquelyn Johnson said. ""The only thing that wakes you up in the morning is to just keep pushing.""","Autopsy shock: Teen's organs removed, cavity filled with newspaper .

"London (CNN)The condition of a health worker battling Ebola in London has stabilized, but she remains in critical condition, Britain's health secretary told lawmakers Monday. On December 29, Pauline Cafferkey, 39, of Glasgow, Scotland, became the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on UK soil, after returning from Sierra Leone the day before. On Saturday, the London hospital where she is being treated said that her condition had deteriorated over two days to critical. In a statement to the British House of Commons Monday, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt commended Cafferkey and 69 other National Health Service volunteers who had spent Christmas in Sierra Leone for ""the exceptional bravery and compassion they showed in joining the battle against Ebola."" He said the doctor leading the team caring for Cafferkey at the Royal Free had updated him on her condition Monday morning. ""As has been reported, Pauline's condition has deteriorated to a critical state, although she stabilized yesterday and continues to receive the best possible care,"" Hunt said. Screening . The Health Secretary described Cafferkey's journey from Sierra Leone -- where she had worked for six weeks --  to Glasgow and London via Casablanca and Heathrow airports. Having been screened and cleared in Sierra Leone and Casablanca, Morocco, Cafferkey arrived at Heathrow where she was again screened. ""As her temperature was in the acceptable range she was cleared to fly home to Scotland,"" Hunt said.  ""While still at Heathrow, a reassessment was triggered because of concerns she may have had an elevated temperature. She was reassessed and her temperature taken a further six times over 30 minutes. As her temperature was within the acceptable range, she was again cleared to travel."" However, once in Glasgow, Cafferkey became feverish overnight and was admitted to an isolation unit on December 29. After testing positive for Ebola she was transferred to London Royal Free Hospital, Hunt said. ""Some have asked whether it was appropriate for her to be allowed to travel onto Glasgow after she raised concerns about her health at Heathrow. The clinical advice on this is clear: You can only contract Ebola by coming into contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person  -- that means blood, vomit or diarrhea -- which becomes a risk when a patient is exhibiting feverish symptoms. ""Because she didn't have a high temperature, the clinical judgment was made to allow her to continue her journey home,"" he said. The Health Secretary said clinical protocols appeared to have been followed when Cafferkey returned to the UK but in terms of screening, ""I don't think organizationally, it was as smooth as it could be."" Review of procedures . Cafferkey had been working at Save the Children's Kerry Town Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone. On Monday, the charity said it was ""doing everything possible"" to establish how Cafferkey contracted Ebola and has been conducting a review since she was confirmed as having the virus on December 29. ""The Serious Event Review (SER) is looking at how the patient might have contracted Ebola by reviewing training, safety protocols, how protective equipment is used, and working practices,"" it said in a statement. A panel that would include independent health experts would consider the review's findings, which would be made available as soon as possible, it said. ""As with other Ebola infections in health facilities, it may never be possible to be 100% sure how the patient was infected. The work of these brave health workers is never risk-free, but we are committed to doing everything possible to learn what happened and, if necessary, to make changes to our protocols and practice,"" Save the Children said. ""Staff safety is our No. 1 priority and our thoughts are with Pauline and her family at this very difficult time."" Britain's health secretary told lawmakers that Save the Children's review was being conducted in conjunction with Public Health England staff and it was hoped that it would report back ""in the next few days."" ""Obviously we're keen for them to report as quickly as possible but on the other hand we don't want to put them under pressure not to do a thorough report,"" he said. Hunt said it was not believed that the protective suits worn by the workers had been breached, but that officials were continuing to ""keep an open mind."" Hospital treatment . The Royal Free Hospital said Wednesday that Cafferkey had decided to have blood plasma treatment -- using plasma from Ebola survivors -- and to take an experimental antiviral drug. The hospital is equipped with a high-level isolation unit where access is restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent with controlled ventilation is over the patient's bed. Another British volunteer nurse, William Pooley, was treated in the unit after his return home from Sierra Leone in August after being diagnosed with Ebola. He was later cleared of the virus.

"Omaha, Nebraska (CNN) -- A Nebraska high school senior had been called out of class to speak with an assistant principal just hours before he returned to school and fatally shot her, Omaha police said Thursday. Robert Butler Jr., 17, also wounded the school principal and was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Millard South High School Assistant Principal Vicki Kaspar, 58, died at Creighton University Medical Center several hours after she was life-flighted away from the school with critical wounds. Principal Curtis Case, 43, remains hospitalized at the same facility in serious but stable condition. Emotions still raw as classes resume Friday . In a statement, Omaha Police Lt. Darci Tierney said Butler, the son of an Omaha Police detective, was called out of class to speak with Kaspar shortly after the Wednesday morning session began, apparently to discuss a criminal trespass citation he received on New Year's Day for driving his vehicle on the school's track and football field. An hour and 15 minutes later, a security guard escorted Butler out of the building, but he returned 3 1/2 hours later and signed in to speak with Kaspar. Tierney said police believe he was in her office for about four minutes before he shot Kaspar and Case. An unarmed security officer, after hearing the gunshots, recognized Butler as he walked out. Butler pointed his weapon at the security guard, who took cover. Less than an hour later, police got a call about a suspicious vehicle less than two miles away matching the description of Butler's car. They found Butler's body in the still-running vehicle. Butler's family has extended their ""sympathy and prayers"" to the families of those affected. ""Our family is shocked and confused about Robert Jr.'s actions,"" the statement, released by the Omaha Police Department, read. ""We want the community to know that we care deeply about the students and staff of Millard South and their families. We thank those who have called for their support in this very difficult time."" Police say the gun used in the incidents belonged to Butler's father, a detective with the Omaha Police Department. Butler had brief conversations with his father after he was sent home Wednesday morning, but police said there were no signs anything was particularly out of the ordinary. ""All indicators were that he was acting normal,"" Police Chief Alex Hayes said. ""He was disappointed about the discipline, but he was not acting in any kind of manner that he was upset, acting frustrated or angry or anything like that."" Nonetheless, Butler posted a Facebook status update -- prior to returning to the school, Hayes believes -- implying he would be ruining families' lives and apologizing in advance. ""Everybody that used to know me I'm sry,"" he wrote on his profile, unedited except for the profanity. ""Omaha changed me and f***ed me up and the school I know attend is even worse ur gonna here about the evil s**t I did but that f**kn school drove me to.this I wont u guys to remember me for who I was b4 this ik I greatly affected the lives of the families I ruined but I'm sorry.goodbye."" During the school's lockdown on Wednesday, senior Shelby Piniarski, a friend of Butler's, remembered that when word started to spread that it was Butler, she didn't believe it. ""I kind of was hoping that it was just one of those high school rumors, like 'Oh I know who did it, I know who shot whatever,'"" Piniarski said. ""But it wasn't. It was real."" It wasn't until she read his post that she gave in to the chatter. ""I got a text message of his Facebook status, and that's about the time my heart broke."" Butler had only been a student at the Omaha school for a couple of months, previously living with his mother in Lincoln, Nebraska. ""We believe that he was having some disciplinary problems with being tardy at school, maybe not listening to Mom -- that kind of thing -- thinking that Dad may be able to help him out better than Mom was,"" Hayes said. ""Hopefully we can come to a point where we think we know exactly what happened."" Hayes said the police department's safety committee will review the incident. The department's firearms policy says that officers ""will not store or leave a firearm in any place within the reach or each access of a minor or unauthorized individual.""","Police believe Robert Butler Jr. used a gun belonging to his father, a police detective .

"Longtime New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, a Democrat, says he is ""OK"" with the ruling not to indict the white police officer whose July chokehold during an arrest killed Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, because ""it's not going to stand."" ""It's such a ridiculous scenario that I'm OK with it -- because it's not going to stand,"" Rangel said on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" Earlier Thursday, the court released details about the evidence given to the grand jury, including the number of witnesses and pieces of evidence involved in the case. But Rangel says the court has made a ""terrible mistake"" by not explaining exactly how the grand jury reached their verdict. ""Releasing this is releasing absolutely nothing,"" Rangel said. ""We want to find out just one thing: A group of people were there, one of them got killed, and the rest of them were police. Simple as that."" The medical examiner affirmed it was a homicide, Rangel added. ""Now, setting aside suicide, something happened in that room to convince the people that were there that nothing happened,"" he said. ""And we just want to find out: How could they have possibly reached that conclusion?"" Rangel, a former New York prosecutor, also said it was a ""stupid mistake"" that the other police officers involved in the incident were granted immunity because not enough details about their involvement in Garner's death have been explained. ""Immunity is given in order to gain the cooperation of witnesses in order to further the indictment that brings the case to court,"" Rangel said. ""Here police officers shouldn't need immunity to tell the truth. If you insist on immunity, it means you think you should be indicted for a crime."" Rangel said he hopes the pending federal investigation illuminates what went on during the grand jury proceedings. On Wednesday, the President said he and outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder are ""not going to let up"" in the effort to solve the problem of racial tensions that exists between law enforcement officers and minorities in communities nationwide.","New York Rep.

"Many of our immediate responses to Hurricane Sandy were successful. Scientists accurately forecast the storm; authorities ordered the proper actions; many people heeded the orders; and there was a massive government response in the aftermath. What went most wrong, and continues to go wrong, is our handling of environmental risks in the long term. Even when the present has delivered an unprecedented shock, we still have trouble accepting that the future will bring new ones, unlike those before. It will. Sandy was forecast with remarkable precision. Some models saw the storm coming more than a week ahead of time. Five days before it made landfall, the National Hurricane Center predicted the rest of the storm's track confidently, and almost perfectly. Forecasts this accurate are the result of decades of research and development, much of it done by government-funded scientists and engineers. Their remarkable achievement should not be taken for granted. Many aspects of the immediate government response to Sandy were also successful. Having learned from his predecessor's failure with Katrina in 2005, President Obama took Sandy seriously from the outset. A battered community, an unexpected angel . The Federal Emergency Management Administration had people and assets in place early, and mobilized reinforcements quickly after the storm to bring help to those in need. There were many successes at the local level as well. New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority did a remarkable job restoring subway service so quickly. Our real problems are long-term. Our infrastructure is not prepared for the climate we've had in the past, let alone the one we'll have in the future. It was clear for years that the New York City subways were dangerously vulnerable to hurricane flooding. Waterproofing was never undertaken. It was considered too expensive a response to a problem that would arrive at an unspecified future time. One of the storm's most expensive casualties was the new, half-billion dollar station at South Ferry, built in the flood zone. This is not to single out the MTA. Similar examples line our coastline -- houses and businesses built on the beach and in coastal wetlands, power lines vulnerable to trees that come down even in tropical storm-force winds.  The consequences of poor planning will become all the more serious as climate warms and sea level rises. CNN iReport: Photographer revisits Sandy's path . New York City is actually a world leader in urban environmentalism. Mayor Bloomberg and PlaNYC's post-Sandy ""Proposal for a Stronger, More Resilient New York"" may be the most serious proposal by any city yet to become more climate-ready. I hope that it survives the end of Bloomberg's term, and that we find the funds and political will to implement it, or something like it. But political and economic pressures discourage long-term investment. This is more true at the federal level than the local, and becomes still more frightening when we consider the most large-scale and long-term problem: human-induced global warming itself. Floods like Sandy's will become more common as sea level rises. Rain-driven floods like those in Colorado a few weeks ago will also happen more often, as warmer air holds more water vapor. Less dramatic, but perhaps ultimately more harmful, the coolest summers in a hundred years will be hotter than even the hottest summers that have occurred in our lifetimes. This has still not sunk in. It is outside our experience, and hard to grasp. But we know these things will happen. This, too, is a confident forecast. The changes are already under way, results of human greenhouse gas emissions, and consistent with the predictions of climate scientists decades ago. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions takes long-term vision. It also takes faith in science. Science, at its heart, is just the practice of taking reality seriously. Under Obama, the United States has taken some modest measures. But we need to do much more. So far, the long-term costs of inaction have not been taken as seriously as the short-term costs of action. Most disturbing, the primary tactic of those opposed to action has not been to argue about the real costs and benefits, but to pretend that reality is not what it is. We human beings are all a little shortsighted by nature, but there is no excuse for willful ignorance, or for conscious, intellectually dishonest denial. When science delivers a threatening forecast, action is the only responsible course. Our leaders have shown great capacity to act upon a forecast for a Superstorm in a few days' time.  We need to convince them to take the climate change forecast equally seriously.","Adam Sobel: The short-term responses to Hurricane Sandy were successful .
Forecasts were very accurate, FEMA and MTA responded effectively, he says .
Sobel says the one failure was that it hasn't prompted sufficient concern about climate change .

"(CNN)You know it's going to be bad when 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17 Celsius) will be the high temperature. But that's what parts of Minnesota will experience this week. And plenty of others will be freezing as well. ""We're looking at 50 million people in 24 states that are going to see some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time,"" CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said. Here's what to expect across the country: . THE MIDWEST: Unfathomable chill . If you want to know what 50 below zero (-45 degrees Celsius) feels like, just go to northern Wisconsin or Minnesota on Monday. Wind chills will dip to negative 25 to 50 (-32 to -45 degrees Celsius) there and in parts of North Dakota. ""This arctic cold is potentially deadly and dangerous,"" Maginnis said. ""And a second blast of cold air will reinforce the deep freeze on Tuesday."" By Monday night, Antarctica was downright balmy compared to the bone-chilling temperatures across the Midwest. A temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 degrees Celsius) was recorded at McMurdo Station, a U.S. research center in Antarctica, while in Duluth, Wisconsin, it was a mere -2 degrees (-19 degrees Celsius). Not much better was Green Bay, where a temperature of 1 degree (-17 degrees Celsius) was recorded, and 7 degrees (-14 degrees Celsius) in Chicago. Of course, it is summer in Antarctica. The Midwest is far from alone. ""About 70% of the United States is going to feel very cold temperatures in the coming couple of days,"" CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. No more snow days: School at home? THE NORTHEAST: A cocktail of nasty precipitation . Snow, sleet and freezing rain will pummel parts of upstate New York and New England. ""An Arctic airmass that already invaded the north central U.S. will spread southeastward, plunging temperatures from the Mississippi Valley to East Coast,"" the National Weather Service said. New York City temperatures will dive to about 8 degrees (-13 degrees Celsius) Thursday morning. Oh, and there will be blustery winds to boot. THE WEST: Snow from Washington to the Grand Canyon . Get ready for widespread precipitation across the Northwest early this week. ""Heavy rains are expected along the Washington coast while snowfall accumulations in excess of a foot will be possible in the Cascades and northern Rockies,"" the National Weather Service said. Nearly 12 inches of rain was recorded in 24 hours on the southwest slopes of the Olympic Mountains, the National Weather Service in Seattle tweeted Monday. Residents in the Seattle region were keeping a wary eye on nearby rivers, rapidly rising with the heavy rain. ""We don't know what is still yet to come,"" said Mark Stewart, spokesman for the State Emergency Operations Center. In Hoquiam, 7 inches of rain over the past 24 hours triggered a mudslide that knocked at least three homes off their foundations, according to Lt. David Porter of the Grays Harbor County Sheriff's Department. No one was injured. ""They heard the loud crashing of trees and were able to get out,"" Porter said. Hoquiam residents were being urged to evacuate for at least 24 hours. Up to 300 people in the Beacon Hill area of the city were being escorted out of their neighborhood Monday evening because of a mudslide. Several other slides were reported elsewhere in the county, blocking roads. Farther south, snow has already blanketed Southern Californian mountains, cacti in the Southwest and parts of the Grand Canyon. THE SOUTHEAST: From tornadoes to bitter cold . Fresh off a spate of weekend tornadoes, the Southeast will now have to deal with an onslaught of frigid air. Mississippi is cleaning up from four tornadoes Saturday, and two other twisters struck Alabama. Up next: A midweek freeze that will leave even Floridians shivering. Atlanta will get well below freezing, culminating in a dip to 16 degrees (-9 degrees Celsius) on Wednesday morning.

"For the first time since detailed records began being kept in 1992, undocumented immigrants from Mexico made up less than half of those apprehended by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. More Central Americans were caught crossing into the United States illegally than Mexicans, according to statistics released Friday by the Department of Homeland Security. While Mexicans made up the single largest nationality apprehended by CBP, the combined number of Hondurans, El Salvadorans and Guatemalans apprehended was even larger. ""It's the first time in recent history where (migrants other than Mexicans) exceeded Mexican nationals,"" a DHS official said. But the big picture remains the same: Statistics show that the number of apprehensions of undocumented immigrants remains low, compared to a peak in 2000. The debate over illegal immigration in the United States is often tied to the relationship the country has with Mexico, but the flow of migration are slowing from Mexico and increasing from Central America. ""This year's statistics are informed by a number of complex and shifting factors, most notably the 68% increase in migration from countries other than Mexico, predominately from Central America, and a 14% drop in Mexican migration since fiscal year 2013,"" Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement. While the statistics released Friday, which cover fiscal year 2014, show result of changing migration trends, it was not a surprise for officials. For at least four years, the trend has been the similar -- decreases in Mexican migration and increases in migrants from Central America, the official said. In 2014, migrants from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador represented 49% of all apprehensions. Mexican nationals made up 47% and migrants of other nationalities made up the rest. The changes in migration reflect the improving economic situation in Mexico, and the worsening security situation in Central America. Unaccompanied minors . The number of apprehensions this year -- 486,651 -- was slightly higher than the 420,789 migrants apprehended in 2013. CBP cites the surge in unaccompanied children and families who crossed illegally and turner themselves in to Border Patrol agents earlier this year. Some 68,631 unaccompanied children were apprehended in 2014, an increase of 76% compared to 2013. The number of family units apprehended in 2014 was 68,684, an increase of 356%. Officials say the surge, which spiked over the summer, was controlled by September. For immigrant children, fate in U.S. a roll of the dice . Deportation priorities . During his term, President Barack Obama has used executive action to provide relief from deportation for some undocumented immigrants and set priorities for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). These moves have postponed deportation proceedings against some who were brought illegally into the United States as children, and focused efforts of deporting those with criminal records. 24 states now suing Obama over immigration . Still, immigrant advocates say families continue to be separated, even when there is no criminal conviction, by immigration enforcement measures. ICE reported that it is meeting the priorities with more success than before. Most of the undocumented immigrants removed or returned by ICE were apprehended at the border. About one-third of of those removed or returned by ICE were caught in the interior of the country. This year, 85% of those who were apprehended in the interior and deported had been convicted of a criminal offense, compared to 67% in 2011. According to the agency, 98% of the immigrants it returned or removed fell under one of the categories for priority deportation. ICE noted that its removals reflected the same trend of more Central Americans and less Mexicans. Removals of Central Americans increased in 2014, the agency reported, while removals of Mexicans decreased.","This year, the majority of undocumented immigrants caught were from Central America .
Typically, most of the apprehensions are of Mexican nationals .

"Afghanistan's presidential election season is underway.  In a sign of genuine political progress, the government has begun accepting nominations for candidates to succeed President Hamid Karzai. This process started just weeks after the nation's Assembly passed legislation providing a legal framework for the presidential, provincial council and parliamentary elections. Nothing is more important for Afghanistan than building on the liberalizing achievements of the past decade and preventing a slide back toward repression. This is why it is crucial to retain and expand the hard-won rights of Afghan women. Gender equality isn't just a matter of moral fairness -- it's essential to the country's economic and political health and to ensuring that the nation has a secure, peaceful and stable future. Since the fall of the Taliban, Afghan women's rights have expanded significantly. The country's current constitution affords equal protection to men and women, guaranteeing women the right to education, political participation and economic opportunity.  Afghan women are now employed at jobs ranging from doctor to police officer -- unthinkable under the Taliban.  An Oxfam report found that school enrollment among girls has increased from roughly 5,000 to 2.4 million. These are encouraging developments. But there is so much more progress to be made. Afghan women are still the targets of institutional discrimination and gender-based violence. Here in the last half of 2013, two consecutive Ministry of Women's Affairs chiefs were assassinated. In August, female parliamentarian Fariba Ahmadi Kakar was kidnapped by Taliban militants.   A few days later, the vehicle envoy of female Sen. Roh Gul Khairzad was ambushed, leading to the death of her 8-year-old daughter. And in mid-September, Afghanistan's top female police officer was shot as she left her home. This violence is organized. Sima Samar, head of the Independent Human Rights Commission of Afghanistan, has noted that by targeting high-profile women, the Taliban seeks to ""limit the active presence and activities of women in their society."" Indeed, a new United Nations report finds that in the first six months of 2013, the deaths of women and children jumped 38 compared to the same period last year. American forces will be drawn down next year. It's absolutely imperative that their exit not bring on a backslide. The country's government must be expected to keep its commitments to women and girls. Gender equality is about affirming human dignity, and it starts with improving access to education. The statistics tell the story. Mortality rates for children younger than 5 are 50% lower for mothers who have attended primary school.  Educated women are less likely to die during childbirth and more likely to send their own children to school. These children then grow up to be the educated young citizens essential to sustained economic growth. These facts shouldn't be surprising. Education is a basic human right and its impact is transformative in any society. Educated women are major contributors to Afghanistan's economy. Each additional year of primary school improves a woman's earning potential by 10% to 20%. Women also provide an indispensable voice in political institutions. Here in the United States, after gaining the right to vote, women drew attention to underappreciated issues such as maternal health and child care, resulting in policy shifts that significantly reduced child mortality rates. Given the enormous challenges that Afghanistan faces, the country cannot afford to regress back to a system in which some of its brightest minds are left out of the political process or any part of society. Afghanistan's elections and the impending drawdown of American troops mark a new era in the country's development. The international community must work to ensure that women's gains in recent years are protected and that Afghan women continue to make political and economic progress. Any future support for the country's government must be explicitly tied to continued defense of equal rights and continued progress of female citizens. For peace and prosperity, we must not abandon the women of Afghanistan.","Paula Dobriansky, Melanne Verveer:  Afghanistan vote must preserve gains by women .

"Nearly 10 months after their son died, the parents of Kendrick Johnson are finally getting what they've been asking for: another investigation into the teen's mysterious death in the gym of Lowndes High School in Valdosta, Georgia. Michael Moore, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said Thursday that federal authorities will investigate the circumstances behind the death of Johnson, whose bloody body was found inside a rolled-up gym mat on January 11. Johnson's family suspects the 17-year-old was murdered and that someone has tried to cover up evidence in the case. While warning his jurisdiction is limited as a federal prosecutor, Moore said that after lengthy review of evidence collected by authorities and the family's own investigator that ""sufficient basis exists"" to warrant a formal review of the facts. Should evidence gathered in the investigation warrant criminal or civil rights charges, he said he would recommend them. ""I will follow the facts wherever they lead. My objective is to discover the truth,"" he said. Who was Kendrick Johnson? In addition to suspicions of a coverup, the family's lawyer has also raised civil rights concerns, questioning whether officials in the predominantly white county took the investigation of an African-American teenager's death seriously enough. Authorities say they did. ""We're happy that a fresh pair of eyes is starting to look at Kendrick's case,"" Kendrick's father, Kenneth Johnson, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday. ""We're just waiting on the truth to really come out."" CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin called the announcement ""a significant development for this family and this case."" ""Now you have the resources of the federal government, in particular the FBI,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""With that type of resources directed at this investigation, there will be more answers to be found."" The announcement comes a day after a judge granted the family and CNN access to surveillance images and investigative files related to the case, which the Lowndes County sheriff's office had declared accidental. CNN has been reporting on the case for months, uncovering new details of the teen's death and raising questions about the sheriff's office handling of the case. Among other things, CNN obtained death-scene images that led outside exerts to question the official explanation that Kendrick had suffocated reaching for a sneaker. ""His parents never accepted this explanation that he climbed into a wrestling mat got stuck and died. It flew in the face of all common sense,"" Benjamin Crump, a family attorney, told CNN's Tapper. ""This is a murder-mystery and we're going to get to the bottom of it,"" he said. Gym mat death shocker: Body stuffed with newspaper . A mysterious death . Authorities found Kendrick's body on January 11, wedged into a rolled-up wrestling mat in the high school gym. Imagery obtained by CNN -- a 15-minute video and nearly 700 photos taken by sheriff's investigators -- show his body clad in jeans and layered orange and white T-shirts. His face was bloated with pooled blood, some of which had poured out of his body, soaking his dreadlocks and spilling onto the floor. Within 24 hours of finding the body, Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine announced that investigators had no reason to suspect foul play in the death. On Thursday, Prine's attorney said that the sheriff welcomes Moore's decision to review the case, and will continue to cooperate ""in every way."" ""We appreciate Mr. Moore's interest in these tragic circumstances and applaud his urging of the community to come forward with facts and evidence rather than feelings or opinions, no matter how sincere they may be,"" said attorney James Elliott. ""While Sheriff Prine has every confidence that his office's investigation was handled with the necessary diligence to assure that all leads were examined and exhausted, he welcomes the U. S. Attorney's further review of the case,"" the attorney said. But a former FBI agent contacted by CNN to review the materials questioned those conclusions. Harold Copus, now a private investigator, questioned how authorities handled evidence in the case, including blood smears found on a nearby wall they said were unrelated to the case. Copus also questioned the handling of a pair of gym shoes that had a substance that appeared to be blood on them. Investigators told CNN the shoes weren't collected as evidence because the substance was not blood. Despite the findings of state medical examiners who found no evidence of foul play, a private pathologist hired by the family to conduct a second autopsy after exhuming the teen's body found that Johnson had a blow to the right side of his neck ""consistent with inflicted injury."" The pathologist also discovered that the teen's organs had not been returned to his body after the initial autopsy. It had instead been stuffed with newspapers. The absence of the organs fueled the family's suspicions of a coverup in their son's death. ""They know something happened in that gym, and they don't want it to come out,"" Kenneth Johnson said at the time. Kendrick Johnson's parents want answers . Brick walls . For months, the family's quest for answers went nowhere. It took until May for autopsy results to be issued, and then the sheriff's office said the investigation had been closed. The sheriff's office and school officials resisted the family's request to obtain school surveillance images and other records, citing state law that exempts the release of ""education records of a minor child."" After months of pursuing official answers and getting nowhere, they began staging daily rallies. A Facebook tribute page and a CNN iReport submitted by Kendrick's aunt spread the message far beyond the southeast Georgia town. On Monday, a Lowndes County judge ruled that authorities had to turn over the surveillance records and files sought by the family -- the first step, family attorney Chevene King said -- in finding what they say is  the truth about what had happened. Video included in the release and reviewed by CNN shows him walking in a hallway and entering the gym. It also shows him inside the gym prior to his death, along with other students playing basketball. There is no indication that any of the people shown in the video have any knowledge of the events surrounding Kendrick's death. See the evidence . A civil rights case? King has alleged that if Kendrick had been white, the investigation would have gone differently. He doesn't believe race tells the whole story though. ""You have to consider race as a factor, but I don't think that that's the end-all in terms of trying to understand why this case was handled in the way that it was,"" he said Thursday. ""We believe that, certainly, if there is a coverup it is a coverup for somebody, and not a nobody,"" he said. Prine, the sheriff, is white, as are about 60% of the county's residents. However, sheriff's office officials have rejected the claim that race influenced the case. ""Race never played into it,"" Stryde Jones of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office said in May. ""The victim played into it. That's who we're working for is the victim and the victim's family."" King said none of the materials released Monday are expected to show exactly what happened to Kendrick. But they could cast doubt on the official explanation and nudge officials toward reclassifying Kendrick's death to allow a new investigation into what happened, King said. ""Essentially, it shifts the focus from what the sheriff had offered to other theories that were not explored and that have I think begun to slowly creep to the surface,"" King said after the hearing. On Thursday, Lowndes County Coronor Bill Watson said he has not made a decision yet on whether to open a coroner's inquest into the death. That would be the first step in reclassifying the death to something other than accidental to allow a fresh investigation into the circumstances. Watson said he would make that decision in ""the next day or so."" ""And I'm emphasizing the 'or so',"" he said. Regardless of what happens, Kenneth Johnson said Thursday the family has no choice but to keep pressing on. ""We're fighting for Kendrick to the end,"" he said.","""This is a murder-mystery and we're going to get to the bottom of it,"" says attorney .

"(CNN)Buckingham Palace came out swinging Monday against allegations that Prince Andrew had sex with an underage girl.  Prominent U.S. attorney Alan Dershowitz, facing a similar accusation, did the same in a CNN interview. ""It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation,"" Buckingham Palace said in a new statement. Dershowitz went further, telling CNN the accuser should go to jail and the lawyers representing her should be disbarred.  He's never even met Roberts, he said. ""I am telling the truth and I can prove it.  They are lying, and I can prove it,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""This is a zero sum game.  Either I'll end up being disabarred and criminally charged or they will be.  There's no gray area here."" Dershowitz said he was filing a sworn affidavit Monday denying the accusations, and was filing a motion ""to intervene in the case.""  His legal team is ""preparing disbarment and disciplinary papers,"" he said. He challenged Roberts to charge him with rape, the ""most serious crime anyone can imagine.  If she does, she will go to jail for filing a false rape charge.""  Dershowitz offered to waive the statute of limitations and ""any immunity."" Dershowitz threatens $100 million defamation suit . He also challenged Roberts' attorneys to make their accusation in public, rather than through a ""privileged legal document."" ""They will not state on your show, 'Alan Dershowitz had sex with this woman,' "" Dershowitz said.  ""Because if they do that, they're in court the very next day being sued for defamation for $100 million."" The attorneys have previously refused to do so. ""We intend only to litigate the relevant issues in Court and not to play into any sideshow attempted by anyone,"" Roberts' attorney Brad Edwards said in an email to CNN on Friday after Dershowitz was quoted elsewhere in the media making similar remarks. ""We do not plead anything before carefully investigating all of the allegations first,"" Edwards wrote. His co-counsel in the case, former federal judge Paul Cassell, was copied on the email. The message included a statement from Roberts, whom the attorneys referred to as ""Doe 3."" ""I am looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse.  It appears that I am now being unjustly victimized again.  These types of aggressive attacks on me are exactly the reason why sexual abuse victims typically remain silent and the reason why I did for a long time. That trend should change.  I'm not going to be bullied back into silence."" ""It's the exact opposite"" of trying to silence someone, Dershowitz said in the CNN interview.  ""Repeat the statements, so then I can sue you."" Roberts' attorneys did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. The fallout follows a federal court filing alleging that ""Doe 3"" was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager.  Virginia Roberts made the allegations in a civil motion filed last week in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media over the weekend, and Buckingham Palace included it in the statement.  (Dershowitz noted that in his CNN interview, it was CNN that identified her by name.) Case involves billionaire's plea deal . The case centers on an American billionaire. Roberts and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the U.S. government to take a fresh look at its case involving Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation. The investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in 2007 and began serving an 18-month sentence in 2008, according to The New York Times. Epstein was the subject of a federal investigation, but a deal allowed him to plead guilty to the lesser state charge and avoid a potential federal case, the Times and the Washington Post reported. Prince Andrew has been photographed with Epstein. The prince previously issued an apology for his friendship with the scandal-plagued billionaire. Buckingham Palace took issue Monday with reports in which Roberts' father alleged that his daughter had met Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Andrew's mother.  The Palace said there is no record of a meeting. Andrew, who was on vacation when the media storm over the accusations erupted, returned to Britain late Sunday, the Palace said. The court filing last week claims that Roberts ""was forced to have sexual relations"" with the prince in London, New York and on Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. In 2013: Prince Andrew mistaken for intruder . Dershowitz was also accused in the latest court filing. ""Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,"" the filing states. ""She said I had sex with her on Epstein's island. I was on his island once,"" Dershowitz said, adding that he was ""never out of my wife and daughter's sight for the 24 hours I was on the island.  She said I had sex with (her) on Jeffrey Epstein's ranch in New Mexico. I was there for about an hour once before the building was complete. Nobody was in the building, I just toured the building.  She said I had sex with her on Jeffrey Epstein's airplanes. The flight manifests will prove conclusively I was never on any airplanes with her. She's making it up out of whole cloth."" Including the accusations in a ""privileged legal document,"" he said, is ""the legal equivalent of writing graffiti on a bathroom wall and  then running away."" CNN's Jethro Mullen, Max Foster and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Buckingham Palace ""emphatically"" denies accusations against Prince Andrew .

"(CNN)President Barack Obama says that the last American troops will leave Afghanistan at the end of 2016. This happens to roughly coincide with the end of his second term in office and also fulfills his campaign promise to wind down America's post-9/11 wars. But is it a wise policy? Short answer: Of course not. One only has to look at the debacle that has unfolded in Iraq after the withdrawal of US troops at the end of 2011 to have a sneak preview of what could take place in an Afghanistan without some kind of residual American presence. Without  U.S. forces in the country, there is a strong possibility Afghanistan could host a reinvigorated Taliban allied to a reinvigorated al Qaeda. Needless to say, this would be a disaster for Afghanistan. But it would also be quite damaging to U.S. interests to have some kind of resurgent al Qaeda in the country where the group trained the hijackers for the 9/11 attacks. It would also be disastrous for the Democratic Party, should it win the presidency in 2016, to be the party that ""lost"" Afghanistan. After all, the Democratic Party is viewed by some as weaker on national security than the Republicans and it is inevitable that without some kind of residual American presence in Afghanistan al Qaeda would gain sufficient strength to launch an attack from the Afghan-Pakistan border region against American interests. An easy way for potential Democratic Party presidential candidates such as Hillary Clinton to distinguish their national security policies from Obama's would be to say that they are in favor of some kind of long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan and to argue that it would be needed to avoid an Iraq-style outcome there. Similarly, as the Republican Party starts ramping up for the 2016 campaign, potential candidates such as Jeb Bush can distinguish themselves from the isolationist Rand Paul wing of the party by saying that they are committed to a long-term presence in Afghanistan. This U.S. military presence in Afghanistan doesn't have to be a large, nor does it need to play a combat role, but U.S. troops should remain in Afghanistan to advise the Afghan army and provide intelligence support. Such a long-term commitment of several thousand American troops is exactly the kind of force that the Obama administration was forced to deploy to Iraq during the past six months following ISIS's lightning advances. Selling such a long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan would be pushing against an open door with that nation's government. Consider that within 24 hours of being installed, the new Afghan government signed the basing agreement that allows American troops to stay in Afghanistan until December 2016. Consider also that the Afghan government has already negotiated a strategic partnership agreement with the United States lasting until 2024 that would provide the framework for a longer term U.S. military presence. Consider also that many Afghans see a relatively small, but long-term international troop presence as a guarantor of their stability. It is also not in Pakistan's interests for Afghanistan to fall to the Taliban or be thrust into another civil war. The Pakistanis have seen for themselves repeatedly the folly of allowing the Taliban to flourish on their own soil, most recently in the Taliban attack last month on the army school in Peshawar that killed 132 children. It is in Pakistan's own interest that the Afghan army is able to fight effectively against the Taliban, which is more likely if they continue to have American advisers at their side. Other regional powers such as the Chinese worry about Chinese Uighur separatists establishing themselves on Afghan soil.The Russians are similarly worried about Islamist terrorist groups located in Afghanistan and so will not stand in the way of a small long-term U.S. military presence in Afghanistan as that would dovetail with their own security concerns about the country. Keeping a relatively small, predominantly U.S. Special Forces, presence in Afghanistan to continue to train the Afghan army past December 2016 is a wise policy that would benefit both Afghans and Americans. Both the Democratic and Republican parties should adopt such a plan in their platforms as they gear up for the 2016 campaign.","Peter Bergen says it would be a serious mistake to pull all U.S. forces from Afghanistan .
It would invite the kind of chaos we've seen in Iraq with the rise of ISIS ."
"A review of police response to the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School has found that officers ""responded to the scene rapidly, positioned themselves appropriately, and followed their department policy,"" according to a report by the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association. The nine-page report analyzing the Newtown Police Department's response time and entry to the school during last December's mass shooting was written by a subcommittee of four police chiefs from the state. ""Our evaluation showed that the officers of the Newtown Police Department navigated the inevitable chaos created in the first few minutes of such a call, managed to piece together what was occurring, but were unable to intervene before the shooter took his own life,"" according to the report, which was released Thursday. The review references a CNN report that said, ""Police and other first responders arrived on scene about 20 minutes after the first calls."" CNN initially reported police arrived ""within 20 minutes."" The committee had access to 911 recordings, dispatch tapes, first-responder and officer statements as well as other documentation. The committee report was released on the same week as audio recordings of 911 calls to police from the school at the time of the shootings. The December 14, 2012, massacre left 20 first-graders and six school employees dead. The shooter, Adam Lanza, 20, shot himself and died in the school. Newtown Police Department Chief Michael Kehoe requested the analysis after media reports indicated the response time was greater than Kehoe knew it to be, said Jack Daly, president of the Connecticut Police Chiefs Association. Daly appointed the sub-committee in August. According to the report, the first call to police was at 9:35 a.m; the first officer arrived two minutes and 41 seconds after the first radio broadcast of a shooting. The elapsed time between the first police officer's arrival and police entry to the school was just under six minutes. The report said officers were delayed in entering the school because they faced what they considered ""exterior threats"" of a person running outside the school building. The person was detained and later identified as a parent. ""Officers are trained to prepare for more than one threat or aggressor,"" the report said. The Newtown Police Department followed their policy on ""active shooter incidents"" by confronting the shooter as quickly as possible, according to the report. ""History teaches that the typical active shooter only stops when confronted; as a result the quicker the confrontation by police, the better,"" the report said. Lanza, who had been a student at the school years earlier, fired more than 150 shots from a .223-caliber Bushmaster rifle before turning a 10mm Glock pistol on himself, according to police. ""Newtown officers were on scene a total of 1 minute and 10 seconds before the shooter committed suicide,"" the report said. The Newtown shooting is the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, behind only the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech that left 32 people dead. After the 1999 Columbine School shooting in Colorado, where two students shot 13 people to death before killing themselves, the law enforcement practice of confronting a shooter as quickly as possible replaced a ""contain and wait"" policy. According to the report, the Newtown Police Department adopted a quick-engagement policy in April 2003 ""in keeping with current trend in police training.""","Connecticut police chiefs' group review Newtown police response time to shooting .

The prosecution and defense will have to pare down that pool to 12 jurors and six alternates. Prosecutors have said the trial could last up to four months. 2. We already have some clues about the arguments on both sides. Court documents filed so far by the defense and prosecution paint a pretty clear picture of where things are heading -- though their portrayals of Tsarnaev, 21, are dramatically different. Prosecutors cast him as a deliberate killer inspired by jihadist literature. The defense has tried to pin the blame on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, describing Dzhokhar as a youngster manipulated by his older brother, who ""was an all-powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed."" Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a confrontation with police days after the bombing. Police surrounded Dzhokhar Tsarnaev two days later as he hid inside a boat in a backyard in Watertown, Massachusetts. He surrendered with rifle lasers tagging his head. 3. Tsarnaev faces 30 federal charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all of them, including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death. In addition to accusations tied to the two pressure cooker bombs that blew up at the marathon, the indictment against Tsarnaev also alleges that he and his brother killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer by shooting him in the head at close range. 4. It's a capital case, even though Massachusetts abolished the death penalty. Massachusetts got rid of the death penalty three decades ago, but this is not a state case. Federal prosecutors can seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev because of the nature of the crimes he's accused of committing. Federal prosecutors say he acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner"" and lacks remorse. 5. This isn't the prosecutor's first time tackling a prominent case. In 2011, The Boston Globe named U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz ""Bostonian of the Year"" for prosecuting corrupt politicians, winning a terrorism case against an al Qaeda supporter and pushing the prosecution of notorious mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger. When Bulger was sentenced in 2013 to two life terms plus five years in prison, Ortiz didn't mince words, describing him as a terrorist driven by ""his desire for power, for greed and ambition."" 6. Tsarnaev's lawyer is known for representing high-profile clients in death penalty cases. Her name is Judy Clarke, and you've seen her before. The federal public defender represented ""Unabomber"" Ted Kaczynski and Jared Lee Loughner, the gunman who seriously wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six people at a meet-and-greet for the congresswoman. An ardent opponent of the death penalty, she has kept some of the nation's most despised criminals -- baby killers, bombers, white supremacists and terrorists -- off death row. 7.  Prosecutors and defense attorneys talked about a possible plea deal for Tsarnaev, but it didn't work out. Several of Clarke's most notorious clients have pleaded guilty and avoided the death penalty. Kaczynski and Loughner both faced capital charges but are now serving life sentences in prison. In Tsarnaev's case, discussions in recent months have centered on the possibility of him pleading guilty and receiving a life sentence without parole. The talks have reached an impasse because the Justice Department has resisted removing the death penalty as a possibility, officials told CNN. 8. Some people in Boston want to see a deal like that for Tsarnaev. In an opinion column published in the Boston Globe earlier this month, a retired federal judge, a former prosecutor and another lawyer argue that a trial and the media frenzy surrounding it will needlessly force victims to relive the horrors of the bombing. ""Let's write a last chapter that guarantees just punishment for Tsarnaev while putting the victims and the community at the center of the legal system's concerns,"" Nancy Gertner, Michael B. Keating and Martin F. Murphy wrote. 9. Others want him to get the death penalty. When federal prosecutors announced last year that U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder had decided to seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev, a number of victims and their family members said it was a step in the right direction. Marc Fucarile, who lost a leg in the bombing, told WCVB he has no doubt about where he stands. ""I prefer the death penalty, because I prefer that people know that if you terrorize our country, you're going to be put to death,"" he said last year. ""And I strongly believe that's how it should be."" 10. Tsarnaev's lawyer tried to get the case moved out of Boston. The judge said no. So did a federal appeals court. Clarke argued that Tsarnaev couldn't get a fair trial there. Federal prosecutors argued that changing the location of the trial would deny victims a chance to see justice carried out. Experts are split on how the location could influence whether Tsarnaev is sentenced to death. On the one hand, Boston is a liberal city where opposition to the death penalty is widespread, CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. On the other hand, because it's a federal case, the jury will be drawn from a broader pool that could include more conservative suburban or rural residents who are more inclined to support executions, New York lawyer Ronald Tabak, a leading expert on capital cases, told CNN last year. In a 2013 Boston Globe poll, 57% of Boston respondents supported a life sentence for Tsarnaev. Thirty-three percent favored the death penalty. 11. It's unknown whether Tsarnaev will testify. At a hearing last month, he appeared in court, telling a judge that he was satisfied with his defense lawyers. 12. Bombing survivors might. They told The Boston Globe that they're prepared to take the stand. 13. Even if Tsarnaev is found guilty, that's not the end of the trial. Since Tsarnaev's trial is a capital case, there will be a separate court proceeding on whether he should get the death penalty if the federal jury finds him guilty. That phase, Toobin says, would be like a  ""small, separate mini trial."" CNN's Michael Martinez, Deborah Feyerick, Sunlen Serfaty, Ann O'Neill, Kristina Sgueglia, Ronni Berke and Evan Perez contributed to this report.","Jury selection in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's trial has started .

"Health officials in Canada said Monday they are looking into the case of a man who recently traveled from Liberia and is exhibiting symptoms consistent with viral hemorrhagic fevers. Viral hemorrhagic fevers is a generic term that refers to a number of diseases found in Africa, including Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever, according to Denise Werker, deputy chief medical health officer at the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health. ""There is no risk to the general public at all about this incident. We recognize that there's going to be a fair amount of concern, and that's why we wanted to go public with this as soon as possible and dispel some of those myths that are out there,"" she told reporters Monday. ""We do not have information that it's Ebola hemorrhagic fever. All we know at this point is that we have a person who's critically ill who traveled from a country where these diseases occur,"" Werker said. An Ebola outbreak has killed at least 59 people in Guinea, which borders Liberia in West Africa. Werker said the Canadian patient is in an intensive care unit and isolated, meaning no visitors are allowed. Specimens have been sent for study, and officials are expecting preliminary results Tuesday, she said. The hemorrhagic fevers are characterized by high fever and symptoms that may be nondescript. But at the end point of the disease, patients can have bleeding from their mouths or eyes, Werker said. There is no drug treatment for Ebola hemorrhagic fever, she said, adding it is not a highly infectious disease. ""You have to be in close proximity to the person's secretions,"" Werker said. ""The persons who are most at risk are person who are actually health care workers, who don't wear protective clothing.""

"One year ago, a Tunisian street vendor set himself on fire, igniting a storm of protest that toppled his country's oppressive government in less than a month. The anger swiftly spread, as activists and bloggers, organizing through social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, set off a season of revolution that is still shaking the Arab world. Yet as the first anniversary of  that event approaches, a new threat to digital activism is looming -- in the United States. On Thursday the House of Representatives is expected to vote on the Stop Online Piracy Act, which would force social media platforms to pro-actively monitor and censor users to prevent them from posting words or images that might violate copyright. Website operators who fail to do so could be blacklisted and prosecuted. The bill and  its Senate counterpart, the Protect IP Act, would empower the attorney general to block allegedly infringing websites based anywhere on Earth. The drafters of both bills do not mean to stifle online dissent and activism. Their goal is to protect intellectual property, especially  from piracy by websites overseas. The problem is that the bills' legal and technical solutions are very similar to mechanisms that  authoritarian regimes  use to censor and spy on their citizens. Our organization, Global Voices Online, is an international network for citizen media. We  support the protection of intellectual property; many members of our community earn all or part of their living by creating copyrighted work. We worry, though, that the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect IP Act will inflict broad unintended damage on digital activists living under repressive regimes as well as restrict speech freedoms at home. Even existing copyright law is abused in attempts to stifle criticism and public debate. Take the case of Trevor Eckhart,a security researcher who wrote a critical blog post last month about a little-known software program called Carrier IQ, which runs on millions of smartphones and logs information about users' activities. Rather than address Eckhart's claims, Carrier IQ responded with legal threats, accusing him of copyright violation because his analysis included copies of its manuals, even though the manuals were  publicly available on the company's own website. After the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation came to Eckhart's defense, the company withdrew its threats and apologized. If the Stop Online Piracy Act becomes law, online speech like Eckart's will be more vulnerable to censorship. Those seeking to abuse copyright law to stifle criticism will be further empowered. To comply with the Stop Online Piracy Act, Eckart's service provider would have had to actively monitor what he was posting to prevent him from violating copyright. If there is doubt about whether a post is or isn't ""infringing,"" website  operators will be under pressure to avoid legal problems just by blocking or deleting it -- even if there is a good chance a court of law would eventually rule that it is protected speech. In countries whose judicial systems are less independent and where legal defense for bloggers is rare, abuse of copyright law to stifle activism is much easier. The Russian government last year used a crackdown on software piracy as an excuse to confiscate activists' computers.  The Chinese government used copyright claims to crack down on critics of the 2008 Beijing Olympics who sometimes used modified images of the Olympic mascots in their critiques. ""In China 'copyright' is one of many excuses to crack down on political movements,"" a Chinese blogger, Isaac Mao, told us. ""If a new law like SOPA is introduced in the U.S., the Chinese government and official media will use it to support their version of 'anti-piracy.'"" Amendments could narrow or eliminate some of the bills' most dangerous features. Congress could pass a better, though still problematic, bill. Yet even these efforts fail to address the  deeper problem: that some members of Congress are seeking to regulate the global Internet for the benefit of the U.S. entertainment industry. At the same time, members of both parties in the House and Senate (including some sponsors of both bills) have expressed impassioned support for global Internet freedom, sometimes chastising the executive branch for not doing enough.  Last week Rep. Christopher Smith, R-New Jersey, introduced a new version of the Global Online Freedom Act, which aims to punish companies that sell censorship and surveillance equipment to authoritarian regimes or support the suppression of online dissent around the world. In recent years, Congress has repeatedly allocated funds for tools that help Internet users  get around those surveillance regimes. It is thus only reasonable to expect that Internet-related legislation should be consistent with Congress' repeated commitment to uphold and protect rights of Internet users globally. Contributors to Global Voices on all continents face increasingly sophisticated surveillance and censorship. Several are in jail right now because of  their online activities, and others are in exile. Passage of the Stop Online Piracy Act or Protect IP will send a loud signal to governments everywhere that it is fine to monitor and censor citizens' online behavior to catch and prevent ""infringing activity,"" which too often means political and religious dissent. The  result will be a world even more dangerous and difficult for bloggers and activists than it already is.","Ivan Sigal and Rebecca MacKinnon say Congress is mulling bills to stop online piracy .

"(CNN) -- When black people protest against police violence in Ferguson, Missouri, they're thought of as a ""mob."" But when white people got up in arms at the Pumpkin Festival in Keene, New Hampshire, a few weeks ago -- for apparently no reason whatsoever -- they were merely accused of ""disruptive behavior."" The two situations -- protests in Ferguson and drunken violence in Keene -- are not equivalent. However, it's revealing how the two groups are perceived differently by society and and the media. How is it that the bad behavior of some black people is used to condemn an entire community, while the bad behavior of some white kids is excused and explained away? Maybe this is why residents of Ferguson protested in the first place. A grand jury will decide any day now whether to indict a police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, this past August. In anticipation of possible violence, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has preemptively declared a state of emergency. It will last for 30 days unless Nixon extends it. Nixon is taking the precaution in light of the mass protests this summer over how the investigation into the shooting was being handled. The protests were largely peaceful, but there were some looters and other troublemakers. The police were widely criticized for their over-the-top militaristic response, including riot cops in tanks with automatic rifles pointed at the protesters. Complete coverage: Ferguson shooting and protests . Police aggression made the protests worse. Slate's Jamelle Bouie, who was on the scene, tweeted, ""This has been the consistent pattern. Unilateral police escalation prompts minor response from more volatile elements, justifying crackdown."" Still, most protesters maintain an iron-clad commitment to nonviolence, which the New York Times noted in a detailed report. Yet, many on social media and some in the mainstream media continue to use the isolated actions of a small number of bad protesters to smear the entire community. The smears often carry a subtle, racially tinted message. ""Stunning Photos From Violent Protests in Ferguson, Mo."" read a headline on the conservative Daily Caller website, adding ""Is This America?"" ""Ferguson Thugs Harass, Verbally Abuse Police Officers,"" read a headline on the conservative website RightScoop. ""We know now that thugs are thugs,"" conservative radio host Laura Ingraham offered on Fox News. Now, let's turn to white protesters: In mid-October, during the annual Pumpkin Festival in the small New England town of Keene, New Hampshire, some white college kids apparently had too much to drink and turned violent. They were hurling broken glass and rocks at police (as well as, apparently, pumpkins). At least a dozen people were arrested and 30 injured, with 20 taken to area hospitals. The troublemakers seemed to revel in the chaos and damage they caused, with one telling a local newspaper, ""It's just like a rush. You're revolting from the cops. It's a blast to do things that you're not supposed to do."" ""It demeans Ferguson and St. Louis to compare them to Pumpkin Fest,"" Professor Donna Murch of Rutgers University told CNN. Which is true -- and makes the contrast between how society perceives black and white behavior all the more striking. The protesters in Ferguson were airing legitimate grievances through mostly peaceful means and yet were denigrated, while the rioters in Keene were merely part of a party that ""spun out of control"" -- never mind that those in Keene were reportedly drunk and dangerous and disproportionately violent. The discrepancy is so jarring that none other than Twitchy, the notoriously lock-jawed right wing website, while managing to contort the incident to bash the supposedly liberal media, agreed, ""Critics of the media do have a valid point. There probably are a lot of reasons for the difference in coverage, racial bias among them."" Just days after the Pumpkin Fest, riots erupted in the largely white town of Morgantown, West Virginia. Why? Because West Virginia University's team beat Baylor at football. The rioters ""lit fires, pushed over street lights and threw rocks, beer bottles and other items at police,"" reported the local news. Police and fire vehicles were damaged. Eight people were arrested. Were the riot police, the National Guard, or a state of emergency declared? No. the city is just considering a law to ban upholstered furniture from outdoor areas, since the ""tradition"" of setting fire to couches apparently fueled the protests. Could you imagine a news story about a black community with a ""tradition"" of burning couches? The media would be pointing out how they're ""destroying their own community"" and the right would make assertions about black people not deserving public assistance. And there's more. Earlier this year, students at the University of Minnesota rioted after their team lost the hockey championship. In 2013, Michigan State students rioted after their team won the Big Ten. The same year football fans at the State University of New York in Cortland rioted even before the game started. And in 2011, after the University of Connecticut won the national basketball championship, students rioted in the streets. These occurred in places with mostly white people. In these instance there were injuries, property damage and arrests. Why aren't we talking about the epidemic of sports-induced violence among white people? Why aren't we calling on state and federal agencies to crack down on their clearly destructive lifestyles? We don't yet know what the grand jury in Ferguson will decide and how the community will respond. But residents want a public trial with transparency and accountability. If the grand jury decides not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, protests can be expected. When that happens, let's think about the real pain that residents of Ferguson feel. And if there's any violence from a few angry demonstrators, let's keep things in perspective considering the marauding bands of rowdy white football fans and rioting Pumpkin kids.","Sally Kohn: Some Ferguson protesters were compared to the ""mob""

"The United States and its allies are working to stop what they regard as an ominous trend: attacks against NATO-led troops by Afghan security forces or others clad in military or police uniforms. The assaults, called green-on-blue or insider attacks, have spiked this year, causing the deaths of 39 International Security Assistance Force troops -- including two in Farah province Friday. An estimated 101 NATO troops have been killed in green-on-blue attacks since May 2007 across Afghanistan, military analyst Bill Roggio said Friday. Roggio, managing editor of the Long War Journal blog, which reports and analyzes terror issues, said green-on-blue attacks have caused around 13% of coalition deaths this year. Of the green-on-blue attacks since 2007, about 40% of the deaths have occurred this year and 35% occurred last year, Roggio said. More U.S. soldiers killed amid Taliban claim of infiltrating Afghan forces . U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he is concerned that the attacks will damage coalition and Afghan partnership efforts.  Speaking at a Defense Department news conference Tuesday, he discussed measures to stop the acts by improving intelligence and vetting of security force recruits. ""Our enemies have attempted to undermine the trust between the coalition and Afghan forces, and in particular they have tried to take credit for a number of so-called green-on-blue or insider attacks that have taken place this fighting season,"" he said. ""Make no mistake about it. I'm very concerned about these incidents."" One measure to combat the attackers is a ""guardian angel program,"" Panetta said. That ""involves identifying one individual who stands to the side so that he can watch people's backs and hopefully identify people that would be involved in those attacks,"" he said. Pentagon changing lingo to 'green-on-blue' in growing threat . Panetta cited increasing ""the intelligence presence"" to obtain ""better information with regards to these kinds of potential attacks."" He also mentioned increasing the counterintelligence presence to ""identify those threats."" For example, a NATO official quoted in a column co-authored by CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said that the increase of counterintelligence officers is designed to ""ferret out Taliban double agents."" Panetta also said the military is using and reviewing a ""thorough"" and ""eight-step"" vetting process. ""We're doing forensics on the particular instances that occur in order to make sure, you know, how that process -- that vetting process operated and what we can do to improve it,"" he said. Another measure to fight the attacks is ""implementing a notification process"" for alerting people to threats. And another is that all troops at NATO headquarters in Kabul now must carry loaded weapons around the clock, CNN has learned. Panetta said Gen John Allen, the chief NATO commander in Afghanistan, is meeting with village elders to discuss the issue. Village elders ""are the people who usually vouch for individuals.  They have to sign something that vouches for the character of individuals, and he's going back to them to ensure that that's being done properly."" ""All of this requires action both by the United States and coalition forces and by our Afghan partners who also face this insider threat. We shouldn't forget that the Afghans themselves are targets of these kinds of attacks, as well,"" he said. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared at the news conference with Panetta. Allen is convening a conference of senior coalition commanders, and Afghan security ministers are having a summit on the issue, Dempsey said. He stressed that Afghan security forces are also suffering from the same trend and noted that President Hamid Karzai has condemned the attacks. He cited an instance where Afghan soldiers who were killed when they came to the aid of their American counterparts in one of the attacks. Official: Man in Afghan security uniform kills 3 U.S. troops . ""There's far more stories about the positive relationship than there is about this particular insider attack trend, but it is one that we have to remain seized with and focused on,"" he said. ""Unknown but important, they've discharged hundreds of soldiers who did indicate ... that some of these young men had the capability to be radicalized, either by virtue of travel back and forth to Pakistan, by literature, by language, by music."" Nevertheless, Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar has claimed that fighters are infiltrating Afghan security forces to attack NATO-led forces on their bases. ""Many Afghans in the rank and files of the enemy have shown a willingness to help the (Taliban) in a shrewd manner,"" said a statement posted on militant websites Thursday and obtained by SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the activities of militant groups on the Web. ""As a result, the foreign invaders and their allies at their military centers and bases are suffering crushing blows by these heroic soldiers."" Panetta said that ""one of the reasons the Taliban is targeting in this manner, we believe, is the success that our Afghan partners are having on the battlefield.  The reality is, the Taliban has not been able to regain any territory lost, and so they're resorting to these kinds of attacks to create havoc."" And, Panetta said, there's ""no one source"" for the attacks. Some are people ""who, for one reason or another, are upset and suddenly take it out. We've seen that here in the United States oftentimes."" Sometimes, they are people who aren't Taliban but become radicalized, he said. ""They use cell phones to tune into various, you know, stations that provide incentives for that type of thing.  And so we've seen some of that take place in some of these attacks.  And then others, you know, have some Taliban ties,"" Panetta said. ""It's difficult to kind of draw any kind of firm conclusion as to just exactly, you know, whether this is kind of a pattern, a broad pattern.  As a matter of fact, at least from everybody I've talked to at this point, you know, these seem to be incidents that are taking place and oftentimes caused by different backgrounds of the individuals involved."" Bergen, who wrote the column for CNN and the New America Foundation with Jennifer Rowland, said the ""motivations of about half the attackers are difficult to classify because the perpetrator is either dead or has fled. Citing media accounts, Bergen and Rowland say many of the ""green-on-blue"" attacks appear to have occurred after quarrels between Afghan and international troops, or because the Afghan soldier has ""personal grievances."" They cite a Department of Defense report in April that said ""investigations have determined that a large majority of green-on-blue attacks are not attributable to insurgent infiltration of the ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces,] but are due to isolated personal grievances against coalition personnel."" They said one military behavioral scientist who interviewed more than 600 Afghan soldiers and policemen last year ""found they held overwhelmingly negative perceptions of Western soldiers."" ""The Afghan security forces aired grievances ranging from NATO soldiers' supposedly indiscriminate fire that killed civilians to the public searching of Afghan soldiers outside NATO bases, as well as U.S. soldiers urinating in public or cursing at their Afghan counterparts,"" according to the authors. Another cause of the increase in the attacks over the past two years is the growth of the Afghan army and police force, Bergen and Rowland say.

Counterintelligence has been bolstered to finger Taliban double agents .

"Xu Caihou, a retired PLA general and former vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC), was taken from his sick bed at 301 Military Hospital in Beijing on Saturday by dozens of armed policemen, the South China Morning Post reported, quoting unidentified sources. Xu was detained the same day President Xi Jinping chaired a steering group tasked with reforming the military, the Post said. If confirmed, Xu would become the highest-ranking military officer to be detained on suspicion of corruption. Xu's critics claim that during his tenure, the buying and selling of military ranks was widespread in the defense establishment. ""I was told by an ex-PLA man I met on the train travelling to Guangzhou that he quit the military because so many people were buying positions and he did not want to play that game,"" said David Zweig, professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. ""Telling me, a foreign professor, such dirt suggests that it is widespread and the anger that exists about this is also widespread."" Bribery scandal . Xu's detention may be connected with the corruption probe of Gu Junshan, the army's former deputy logistics chief and one of Xu's closest subordinates. Gu, who was in charge of the military's massive procurement and property portfolio, reportedly received bribes in cash and gifts. He has been under investigation since early 2012. Xu, 71, was promoted to the CMC in 1999 and became its vice-chairman in 2004. He retired in March last year. He has not been seen in public for several months until January 20, when the Chinese media showed him with President Xi greeting a group of retired military officials on the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year. The bespectacled general appeared frail, observers noted. He is said to be terminally ill with bladder cancer, prompting speculation that Xu may have been spared a corruption probe and prosecution due to his condition. His sympathizers had been pushing for leniency, sources said, arguing that the terminal cancer was a fate equal to the death penalty. But the prospect of treating Xu leniently has caused discontent among reformists in the military who say letting Xu off the hook will be following double standards. That is not the signal Xi Jinping wants to send. Mosquitoes and tigers . Xi, who is also chairman of the CMC, has vowed to clean up the tarnished image of Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army. He has pushed big anti-graft campaigns, pledging to target not just ""mosquitoes"" (minor officials) but also ""tigers"" (top officials). It's a daunting task, given the common perception among Chinese that corruption is endemic. On the most recent Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, China was ranked 80th, tied with Greece and one notch above Swaziland, among the 177 countries and regions surveyed. The index ranks countries and territories based on how corrupt their public sector is perceived to be. China's image has gotten worse. On the 2004 index, China was ranked 71st, lumped with Saudi Arabia and Syria. Xi has warned officials that no one will be spared. ""Every Communist Party official should keep in mind that all dirty hands will be caught,"" he told a meeting of the party body tasked with curbing corruption last January. ""Senior officials should hold Party disciplines in awe and stop taking chances."" So far, Xi has snared a few big tigers. Powerful scalps . Zhou Qiang, China's top law enforcer as chief of the Supreme People's Court, said in his annual report to China's legislature last month that the courts in 2013 have tried and convicted 29,000 cases of embezzlement, bribery and dereliction of duty. More than 20 minister-level officials have been ""taken down"" since the major Communist Party meeting last November, various Chinese media reported. The list includes a former party official of Sichuan Province, the former mayor of Nanjing, and the former minister of the influential State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission. Political analysts wonder if more, bigger tigers could fall prey. Speculation has focused on the fate of Zhou Yongkang, 71, a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body, until he retired in 2012. Zhou had also served as the powerful czar of China's security and police institutions, and before that was the overseer of China's lucrative petroleum industry. Unwritten rule . Rumors surrounding Zhou's ""imminent"" downfall have been circulating on China's social media for two years. They have gained currency in recent months as high-profile corruption probes have led to the detention of senior officials linked to him throughout his career. An unwritten rule favors Zhou. No member of the Communist Party's standing committee, past or present, has been prosecuted for graft. But apparently Xi Jinping is far from finished with his clean up drive. Several days ago, he issued a call to add ""chili pepper"" to the anti-graft campaign, as the hunt for corrupt officials heats up. ""The work of criticism and self-criticism should be intensified,"" he said when addressing a group of grassroots officials in Lankao County in central Henan Province.  ""Adding a bit of chili pepper to make every Party official blush and sweat a little.""","Chinese President Xi Jinping is intensifying his heralded anti-corruption drive .

"Washington (CNN)It's been more than a decade since the 9/11 report was released, and the leader behind the effort is pushing President Barack Obama to hand over the final 28 pages to the American public. Those redacted pages from the congressional investigation into the attacks specifically focus on the role of foreign governments in the al Qaeda plot. ""They primarily deal with who financed 9/11, and they point a strong finger at Saudi Arabia,"" former Democratic Sen. Bob Graham of Florida told CNN's Michael Smercornish over the weekend. He co-chaired the panel that released the report in 2002. Graham, along with Rep. Walter Jones (R-North Carolina) and Stephen Lynch (D-Massachusetts) will hold a news conference Wednesday asking Obama to declassify those remaining pages of the 832-page 9/11 report. In the months after 9/11, the House and the Senate convened joint hearings and produced the massive report. But the 28 pages were classified by then-President George W. Bush. The government feared releasing them ""could adversely affect ongoing counterterrorism efforts,"" according to a letter from the  Senate Intelligence Committee. Terry Strada, whose husband died in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, said 9/11 families like hers have been pushing for the release for 13 years. The families say Obama personally promised he would release those redacted pages -- but it hasn't happened. ""They are protecting the Saudi regime over protecting the American people,"" Strada told Smerconish. ""And that is the travesty."" Bill Doyle's son was working in the World Trade Center on the day of the attacks and was among the nearly 3,000 killed. ""If these pages were to be released, we could hold them accountable -- the people that financed 9/11,"" Doyle told CNN.","The pages focus on the role of foreign governments in the plot .
""They point a strong finger at Saudi Arabia,"" says Bob Graham ."
"At least 40 people were killed and about 100 were wounded after a bomb exploded at a bazaar in Peshawar on Sunday, officials at a Pakistani hospital said. A car carrying 220 kilograms (485 pounds) of explosives detonated in the city's historic Qissa Khawani bazaar, destroying at least 10 shops and several vehicles and leaving a huge crater, said Shafqat Malik, chief of the bomb disposal unit. The Pakistani Taliban, Tehrik-i-Taliban, condemned the attack and denied any involvement. Alamzeb Khan was working at a nearby tea stall Sunday when he felt the earth shake. The impact of the blast knocked him to the ground. ""When I got up, everything was on fire. Women and children were burning in (a) Suzuki pickup, and a number of vehicles were destroyed, besides the shops (that) were also on fire,"" Khan said. The death toll is expected to rise, as most of the wounded are critically injured, said Dr. Arshad Javed, chief executive of Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar. Already, people are sharing stories of incredible loss. One family traveled to Peshawar to attend a wedding. Now they're planning a mass funeral. In all, the family lost 18 members in the attack, including children. Bus blast in Pakistan kills at least 17 . A gruesome week . Peshawar, the capital of Pakistan's volatile Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, has endured a violent week. On Monday, 81 people were killed in a suicide bombing at a Protestant church in one of the deadliest attacks ever on the Christian community in Pakistan. A splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, saying the attack was in response to U.S. drone strikes in tribal areas. And on Friday, at least 17 people were killed and more than 30 others wounded in an explosion that ripped through a bus carrying government employees. Tackling religious intolerance and violence in Pakistan . Sikander Khan Sherpao, senior minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, suggested the attack had been carried out by forces wanting to sabotage recent efforts by the national government to pursue peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban. The recent bombings have raised concerns about the government's ability to provide security. Sunday evening, after a meeting of provincial officials, the creation of task forces to help maintain peace in Peshawar was announced. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Sunday's attack at the bazaar. The Pakistani Taliban decried the loss of innocent life but at the same time struck a defiant note.  ""We are targeting the government machinery and the law enforcement agencies but not general public,"" said spokesman Shaidullah Shaid. Qissa Khawani bazaar, or the ""storytellers' market,"" was the site of a bloody massacre in April 1930 when British soldiers fired on peaceful demonstrators, killing hundreds. At the time, Pakistan was part of India, and India was under British rule. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. Earlier this month, Pakistani officials announced plans to pursue peace talks with Taliban militants and withdraw troops from parts of the volatile northwestern region, which borders Afghanistan.

"(CNN)  -- When Hurricane Katrina walloped New Orleans in late August 2005, Kate Schneiderman was in New York, 10 states and 1,100 miles away from the storm. Kate Schneiderman, 24, is originally from New York, and works in politics in New Orleans. Fifteen months later, she traded New York's streets for those submerged during what the Federal Emergency Management Agency called the nation's worst natural disaster. ""I literally quit my job, bought a car, packed it up, drove down,"" Schneiderman, 24, told CNN. She said a college friend who was living in New Orleans persuaded her to quit her Wall Street job in financial communications -- a career that didn't make her happy and didn't fit her political science degree -- and move to New Orleans. ""It's the best decision I ever made,"" Schneiderman said. Now nearly a year into her position as director of communications for New Orleans Councilman-at-Large Arnie Fielkow, the native New Yorker has become a self-described ""grizzled veteran"" of the Big Easy. She speaks affectionately of the city's people and of its slower pace, although she laughingly notes that she'll ""never ever"" get used to the city's soupy summer heat. She says she's here for the long haul. ""When I first moved down, I said, 'I'll give it two years...it'll be my little adventure.' And something sort of funny happened almost immediately,"" she said. ""I felt immediately at home."" Schneiderman is one of many young professionals who have arrived in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina ransacked the city, according to experts who study population trends in the area. Armed with college degrees and buoyed with seemingly boundless optimism and energy, these 20- and 30-year-olds have taken up work in various sectors of the community, ranging from business to politics, or in the several humanitarian programs helping to rebuild the city. ""From what you can tell in talking to people and looking at organizations...there does seem to be a significant influx of young, usually very well educated college graduates...who have come to New Orleans to help,"" said Tim Ryan, the University of New Orleans' chancellor. ""Many have decided that this is an interesting place to live, and decide, at least for some short period of time, to stay here."" While there is speculation on whether the number of young professionals moving here actually constitutes a ""significant influx,"" there is ample anecdotal evidence to show that beleaguered New Orleans is softly luring young people looking for meaningful and purposeful work. Dubbed New Orleans' ""brain gain,"" these newcomers all have their own stories, their own path to the city. Some were volunteers who arrived soon after the storm. Others, like Schneiderman, came well after. Some are New Orleans natives, many are not. Regardless of their hometowns, their professions, their reasons for moving, they are bound by a common thread: a pull to this city that so many left behind. ""In other cities,"" Mike Heid, a 26-year-old copy editor for an advertising firm, said, ""I probably would have just done my job and gone home and been happy with that. Because those other cities ... I don't think would have needed my help as much as this city."" Heid worked in New York for a time before he arrived in New Orleans, he said. ""Just being down here ... even if it's just to help business down here,"" Heid said, ""anything that's down here is helping."" After volunteering for a short time with The Idea Village, a nonprofit group that supports entrepreneurs, University of Pennsylvania graduate Miji Park said she didn't want to leave. ""Being involved in that and ... getting to understand the city made me realize that the impact I could make here was so much greater than at a boring real estate economic research firm back home,"" the 23-year-old said. She gave up the well paid ""boring"" job in her hometown of Berkeley, California, for a full-time job with The Idea Village. And she hasn't regretted it at all. ""I believe in the power of place,"" she said. ""I think history incorporates itself not only in the architecture, but also the atmosphere of different cities, and in New Orleans you definitely feel that atmosphere and you can feel the history. And I think that's what drew me closer to New Orleans."" Richard Campanella, a geographer and associate director of the Center for Bioenvironmental Research at Tulane University, says there are probably 2,000 to 3,000 of these newly arrived young professionals in New Orleans. In an e-mail, Campanella said he bases this rough estimate on the 2006 Louisiana Health and Population Survey. However, amid the city's current population of 273,000, this group of newcomers is a ""small segment of the population,"" according to Greg Rigamer, the chief executive officer for GCR & Associates Inc., a New Orleans research firm. They are by no means replenishing the approximately 40 percent of the city's pre-Katrina population who have not returned. ""We are not the 'Mecca' in the country for these young people,"" Rigamer said. William Frey, a researcher with the Brookings Institution, which has kept detailed records and analysis of the city's population since the storm, said his analysis of 2006 census data released this month shows that those in the 25- to 35-year-old age range were least likely to be present in the city by July of last year. Still, Rigamer said, ""There are a number of young people coming to help out."" What makes this group's arrival notable, he said, is that before the storm, the city had difficulty drawing or keeping the young and educated. ""We are attracting...young people that we weren't before,"" Rigamer said. Asked whether Campanella's estimate of 2,000 to 3,000 is accurate, Rigamer said it likely was. ""It's really probably in that range,"" he said. Hanging over these young people, however, is a persistent question. Will they stay? ""I don't think that many of those people have made permanent decisions,"" Ryan said, adding that the answer to that question depends on whether the city is able to fix many of its problems -- among them a weakened infrastructure, a high murder rate and limited career growth opportunities. ""I think they're willing to certainly keep an open mind about the future and see how things go over the next couple of years,"" Ryan said. Rigamer concurred. ""This is the most mobile segment of our community,"" he said. ""So guess what? They're going to be mobile."" For Harvard Business School graduate John Alford, 32, who arrived in June 2006, the rate of progress can be frustrating. Alford is the school leader of the Langston Hughes Academy Charter School. ""[I'm] driving past the same potholes...since last year,"" he said. ""They're not being fixed. I know that's just a pothole, but it's also a sign of where the city's at."" For Heid and Schneiderman, crime is a concern. ""Crime kind of freaks me out,"" Heid said, adding that he also grows anxious when storms draw near. But both say it isn't enough to push them out of the city. Likewise, Alford, a Brooklyn, New York, native, says he's here to stay. ""This is my new home,"" he said. What about the question of whether to rebuild the city? Irrelevant, he says. ""The question's already been answered. We are rebuilding it now."" E-mail to a friend .

"HEBRON, West Bank (CNN) -- Jewish settlers are on a ""terror"" rampage in the West Bank city of Hebron, angry over the Israeli military's seizure of a disputed home, the city's mayor said Thursday. Israeli police struggle to remove Jewish settlers from a disputed house in Hebron on Thursday. ""What's happening in Hebron is terror by the settlers,"" the mayor, Khaled Osaily, told CNN. ""They are attacking houses, setting fire to property and injuring people."" Some of the settlers opened fire on Palestinians, critically injuring one, Palestinian sources told CNN. Five other Palestinians have been wounded in the rioting, the sources said. The latest round of violence comes hours after Israeli police and military forcibly removed a group of settlers from a disputed home in Hebron. The settlers inside the residence had ignored court orders to vacate the house, which a Palestinian man claims belongs to him. The situation has led to recent clashes between Jewish settlers and Palestinian residents. Osaily called on the international community to pressure Israel to remove all settlers from Hebron, one of the most contested cities in the West Bank, with a Palestinian section and a Jewish settler enclave. It is home to about 160,000 Palestinians and 500 Israelis. ""We warned the Israelis about this,"" the mayor said. ""They didn't do enough to stop the settlers from their aggression."" Shortly after seizing control of the disputed home, the Israeli military declared the southern part of the West Bank, including the entire city of Hebron, a closed military zone. Israeli media reported that the settlers are vandalizing Palestinian residences in the Hebron area, including setting fire to some homes. Israeli daily Haaretz reported that police used stun grenades and tear gas to subdue the rioting settlers. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN the rioting was not widespread. ""There have been sporadic incidents,"" he said. ""We have stepped up police patrols in the West Bank to increase security."" A line of Israeli forces stood outside the disputed home on Thursday, as specially trained Israeli police pulled the settlers out of the home, according to Israeli military spokesman Maj. Avital Leibovitch. A banner castigating Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and the president of Israel's Supreme Court, Dorit Beinisch, hung above the home's entrance. Some of the settlers walked out unassisted, while others were physically escorted by the security forces. One settler, who was on the ground in tears, was carried away. The entire operation took just over an hour, Leibovitch said. ""The events today in Hebron demonstrate clearly that in Israel the rule of law will prevail and not the vigilante extremist,"" said Mark Regev, a spokesman for outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Ambulance services reported 20 people -- settlers and Israeli security forces -- were injured in the struggle, none seriously. The Israeli military dispatched two helicopters in case of a medical emergency, Leibovitch said. Earlier this week, the Israeli army established a closed military zone around the disputed house. Israeli security forces moved in to remove the settlers a short time after Barak and the Settler Council failed to agree to resolve the situation peacefully. Barak told the council leaders that ""all citizens must accept the authority of the state."" The settler leaders agreed but called on Barak not to forcibly remove the settlers from the house, council spokesman Yishai Hollander told CNN. The council leaders offered to Barak several non-violent solutions to end the confrontation. Hollander noted that there is a small group of settler extremists who do not abide by Israeli law nor the council's demands. Barak vowed that Israel ""will not allow extremist elements to undermine the authority of the state and its foundation."" ""The people who are residing in the disputed house must vacate the house and follow the instructions by the state organizations and the courts,"" Barak told the council, according to his spokesman. ""Only after the house is vacated will it be possible to clarify the disagreements."" Israeli settlers moved into the so-called ""house of contention"" last year, claiming they bought it from the Palestinian man. That man, however, says no deal was ever made. A court ruled two weeks ago that the settlers living in the house must evacuate. It said they would be evicted within 30 days if they did not leave voluntarily, but the settlers ignored the court's orders. Violence flared Monday over rumors that the contested house would be evacuated. Eleven people were wounded. Settlers and Palestinians threw stones at each other and settlers rioted elsewhere in the West Bank. Hebron also is the location of the Cave of the Patriarch, a religious site holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims, and has been the site of high-profile violence between Palestinians and Israelis.","NEW: Jewish settlers ""attacking houses,"" mayor of Hebron says .

"Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) faces mounting damages from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster as more U.S. servicemembers joined a lawsuit accusing the Japanese national utility of lying about the risks involved in an aid effort to the stricken area in 2011. Attorneys said the number of plaintiffs had grown to 26 from an initial eight, who filed their original lawsuit in December, and that 100 more were ready to join the lawsuit which is now seeking more than $2 billion, the Stars and Stripes newspaper reported late last week. TEPCO confirmed that more plaintiffs had been added to the court petition filed with the U.S. District Court in California in December but did not give details. ""We would refrain from responding to the matter in relation to the contents of the detailed procedure of the lawsuit. In any case, we would like to properly cope with this lawsuit, following U.S. legal proceedings,"" the company said in a statement to the Tokyo Stock Exchange obtained Monday. The amended lawsuit increases the amount of damages lawyers are seeking for crew aboard the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and other service vessels in the area who say they are suffering continuing health problems from the rescue effort that followed the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck eastern Japan on March 11, 2011, crippling reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant. Lawyers will still sue TEPCO for $40 million in compensation and punitive damages for each crew member but have increased the demand of $100 million for ongoing health monitoring and medical expenses to $1 billion, Stars and Stripes reported. ""At all relevant times, the defendant knew that the reactors and storage tanks at the [Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant] were then leaking and emitting high levels of radiation,"" the report said, citing the complaint. It claims TEPCO knew the U.S. Navy would send the USS Ronald Reagan and other vessels to help, relying on what the utility was saying about the risks, adding: ""At all relevant times herein, the defendant failed to warn the plaintiffs, the U.S. Navy and public officials of the properties and actual levels of radiation detected at the [plant] at that time."" The plaintiffs say they are suffering a range of disorders related to radiation exposure, from headaches and difficulty concentrating to rectal bleeding, thyroid problems, cancer and gynecological bleeding. ""At all times relevant herein, the Japanese government kept representing that there was no danger of radiation contamination to the USS Reagan (CVN-76) and/or its crew, that 'everything is under control,' 'all is OK, you can trust us,' and there is 'no immediate danger' or threat to human life, all the while lying through their teeth about the reactor meltdowns at FNPP,"" lawyers stated in the complaint. The Navy ""was lulled into a false sense of security"" because it relied on TEPCO's ""misrepresentations regarding health and safety,"" it continued. The suit also accuses TEPCO of failing to conduct adequate testing, designing a defective product, conducting deceptive business acts and practices, acting as a public nuisance and as a private nuisance and fraud. ""The Plaintiffs must now endure a lifetime of radiation poisoning and suffering which could have and should have been avoided,"" lawyers said. Last October, TEPCO acknowledged that it had played down safety risks at the facility out of fear that they would lead to a plant shutdown. The company said in a report that ""severe accident measures"" were taken in 2002, which included ""containment venting and power supply cross-ties between units,"" but additional measures were never put in place. Part of the reason, the report said, was a concern that implementing the new safety measures ""could spread concern in the sitting community that there is a problem with the safety of current plants."" TEPCO added that taking such measures could also have added to ""public anxiety and add momentum to anti-nuclear movements.""","Lawsuit over radiation exposure to crew of USS Ronald Reagan expands .

"(CNN)The 110th birthday of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was celebrated on August 22 with an exhibition, a television biopic, and a series of national events. The ""paramount leader"" ruled for more than a decade, kick-starting China's market economic reform. All these events have prompted much talk not just on Deng but also on Chinese president Xi Jinping. Straws in the wind here hint that China is again entering an era of strongman rule. Less than two years after Xi took over the top Communist Party post, Xi's leading position is looking virtually unassailable. He now holds the top posts in the party, state and the military. Recently, he has cleverly maneuvered to put himself at the head of two new supra-ministerial bodies. The ""central leading group on national security"" gives him the final say on diplomatic, military, security, police and intelligence institutions. The other leading group on ""deepening of economic reform"" gives him oversight on economic affairs, clipping the power of Premier Li Keqiang, China's No. 2 leader and the de facto COO of the economy. This, China analysts say, signifies that Xi has become the most powerful Chinese leader since the death of Deng in 1997. Mao or Deng? Xi's shrewd moves makes China watchers wonder: Is he mimicking Mao, who wielded absolute power during his decades-long rule?  Is he building a cult of personality that befits an omnipotent modern-day emperor? To be sure, Xi does not approve of totally repudiating Mao. ""To completely negate Mao Zedong would lead to the demise of the Communist Party of China and to great chaos in China,"" Xi said early last year. He rejected ""historical nihilism,"" instead advocating ""not being negative about the 30 years before Deng Xiaoping's economic reform."" Still, some China experts say Xi is not following Mao's policies. ""If you look at what he does and how he does it, I don't see much Maoism,"" said Ezra Vogel, a retired Harvard professor and author of the book ""Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China."" ""I see much more of Deng Xiaoping."" Vogel recalled how Xi chose Shenzhen as the site of his first ""inspection tour"" as president. The Special Economic Zone is where Deng Xiaoping experimented with his market-reform in the early 1980s. Xi referred to that in his speech commemorating the 110th anniversary of the birth of the late Deng. ""It was a very sentimental thing,"" Vogel noted. ""I think the effect of the speech and what Xi was trying to say is that 'Ok, Deng was a bold leader who tried to make changes. I'm going to make some changes too.'"" Like Deng, Vogel explained, Xi believes that the country must be strong. ""But he felt in the end that only if the country had enough internal stability could you make changes,"" the Harvard professor said. ""And he was quite cautious about releasing and allowing more freedom until the conditions were met. It looks to me that Xi Jinping was very much following it."" Keeping friends close . The Harvard historian has not seen much sign that Xi wants to be more democratic. ""He has been very tough on corruption, and the way I see it now he's beginning to talk about the law, the legal reform,"" he said. Early this month the Communist Party announced that Zhou Yongkang, the former public security minister and member of China's Politburo Standing Committee, would be investigated ""on suspicion of grave violations of discipline."" This is by far the biggest step Xi has taken in his anti-corruption campaign, confirming his pledge to take on the ""tigers"" (top officials) as well as ""flies""(minor violators). Like Deng, Vogel added, Xi wants to centralize things in his own hands. ""He wants to be a strong leader. He wants to make bold decisions. And he wants to make it very clear that he's in charge."" Xi is in a hurry to take charge. Since he took over top posts, he has been moving allies into key Party, government and military positions. ""It took (former president) Jiang Zemin 10 years to promote his trusted commanders to top military posts,"" says one Chinese source who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic. ""It took (Xi's predecessor) Hu Jintao four to do the same. Xi is doing it in two years."" Liu Yuan, an army general and, like Xi, a well-connected ""princeling"" (he is the son of the late Chinese president Liu Shaoqi), is poised to be elevated into the military commission, the source said. Current Shanghai party chief Han Zheng is also expected to move to Beijing to join the Leading Group on Economic Reform. Top-level reshuffles are expected to be finalized during a policy meeting, called a ""plenum,"" of the nearly 400 members of the Communist Party's elite scheduled in October. After this round of changes, the Chinese source said, ""about 70% of top leaders in the provinces and major cities and some ministries will have been replaced or reshuffled. It's the second stage of Xi's plan to put in his people."" ""Historic mission"" Supporters of Xi's attempts to accumulate power say he needs to do so to deal with a host of pressing challenges. I asked whether this makes him a dictator in the making. ""Every leader in the world does this,"" the source said. ""If Hillary (Clinton) becomes the next U.S. president, she will also do the same -- put people you trust in critical posts."" Leading China's transition, he said, is an extraordinarily difficult job. Xi's admirers say he a pragmatist who is more goal-oriented than ideologically driven. ""It's not really a question of whether Xi is a conservative or a reformist,"" said the Chinese source. ""He is poised to make big changes because he truly believes he has a historic mission to achieve his China Dream.  He wants to keep the Communist Party in power but he also wants to push China to the next level."" How Xi will achieve his goals remains undefined, but one thing is clear: Xi does not welcome unsolicited advice. Earlier, he had been heard saying, off-the-cuff:  ""Westerners with full stomachs should not be lecturing China."" Said in the fashion of Mao and Deng.","Xi has become the most powerful Chinese leader since the death of Deng Xiaoping in 1997 .

"Back when Mike Tyson bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield's ear in 1997, it seemed unlikely the two boxers could ever reconcile. But apparently, time heals all wounds. In a reunion that was once unthinkable, Tyson will be Holyfield's presenter for his induction into the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame. The Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame made the announcement on its website. Tyson will deliver the presenting speech for the former heavyweight champion. The ceremony will take place August 9 at the New Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas. Tyson calls the opportunity to present Holyfield a ""privilege and high honor."" Holyfield's response to Tyson presenting him: ""That is great!"" Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame president and founder Rich Marotta says that Tyson presenting Holyfield is ""sheer magic."" ""This is the kind of thing we showed is possible in boxing last year at our inaugural induction ceremony,"" Marotta said. ""Former and even current rivals coming together under the same roof to celebrate boxing. Everyone checks those rivalries at the door."" In November 1996, Holyfield defeated Tyson at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas by an 11th-round TKO. Their highly anticipated rematch was in June 1997 at the same venue. In the third round of that bout, Tyson shocked fans around the world when he bit off a piece of Holyfield's right ear. Tyson was disqualified from the fight. In the years that have followed the ear-biting, Holyfield and Tyson have been on better terms. They've even been in a recent television commercial together. In a humorous Foot Locker ad, Tyson says, ""I'm sorry, Evander,"" handing him a box that is supposed to have the piece of Holyfield's ear in it, saying he kept it in formaldehyde.

"A century ago this Saturday on a street corner in Sarajevo, Gavrilo Princip fired the shot that started World War I when he killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand. What do we know about history's greatest teenage troublemaker? 1. His name was Gavrilo, or Gabriel. Our history teachers taught us that World War I began after a gunman killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. The shooting acted as a trigger, metastasizing from a Balkan street corner into a continental crisis by releasing pent-up tension between rival blocs of Great European Powers: the Austro-Hungarian Empire and Germany on one side and France, Russia and Great Britain on the other. The name of the gunman was Gavrilo Princip, his first name meaning Gabriel in his mother tongue, Serbian. His mother had wanted to call him Spiro after her late brother, but the local priest intervened saying the boy should be name after the Archangel Gabriel. Statue of assassin who unleashed WWI unveiled in Sarajevo . 2. He was only 19 when he triggered the first global conflict. Surely history's greatest teenage troublemaker, Princip was a student in his last year of high school -- the eighth grade -- when he fired the shot that sparked World War I. His exact age was a matter of intense legal scrutiny after the assassination because so many people in Austria-Hungary believed a death sentence appropriate for the assassin who had killed the heir to the Habsburg empire. But the Austro-Hungarian legal code was clear on capital punishment. Only those 20 years of age or older on the day of the offense could be executed. The recorded birth date for Gavrilo Princip was 13 July, 1894, making him 19 years, 11 months and 15 days on the day of the assassination, in other words just two weeks inside the deadline that would have seen him hanged. It all got a bit complicated when a council record was found by investigators that suggested he had actually been born on 13 June 1894, making him old enough to execute. But after much legal debate it was accepted that this record was a mistake -- the month of July in the Cyrillic script used by the parish can easily be mistaken for June. Princip was sentenced to 20 years in prison -- the maximum penalty for someone his age at the time -- but would be dead before the guns of WWI fell silent, dying of tuberculosis in the hospital at his jail on April 28, 1918. 3. He had the same nationality as Adolf Hitler. 100 years ago, at the twilight of the grand imperial era, the notions of the nation state and of nationality belonged to the future. Countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Austria did not exist. Instead they were bundled together in the sprawling Habsburg Empire, also known as Austria-Hungary, a muddle of divergent ethnic groups often speaking very different languages, and of varying vintages, all under the imperial control of Vienna -- the system was so chaotic that in parts of the empire vehicles drove on the left, elsewhere on the right. Gavrilo Princip was born in a province of Austria-Hungary that had recently been acquired, an area known as Bosnia Herzegovina. For centuries it had been occupied by the Ottoman Empire but in 1878 it was ""flipped,"" becoming Habsburg territory overnight. Its citizens did not have passports but they did have travel passes, and as a young man Gavrilo Princip qualified for the same type of pass as that given to Adolf Hitler, who was born further to the northwest, but still within the Austro-Hungarian empire. 4. As an assassin, Princip had the luck of the devil. The driver of the Archduke's car should have driven straight past Princip at speed but, because of a misunderstanding, he turned the car on the exact corner where Princip was standing and was immediately shouted at to stop. Princip found his target a sitting duck right in front of him. He fired only one shot at the Archduke with a pistol. By a fluke the bullet cut Franz Ferdinand's jugular vein. He was dead in a matter of minutes. 5. He was not a Serb nationalist. Princip was actually a south Slav nationalist; although ethnically a Bosnian Serb, he supported a group of activists calling for the unification of all local Slav people in Bosnia: Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Their dream was to drive out the Habsburg occupier, so shooting the Archduke was seen as a ""grand gesture"" to inspire others to rise up against the foreign power. 6. The plan worked, but at a terrible price. The shooting triggered a war that Princip could never have anticipated. Millions died and empires fell -- and eventually, the hated Austro-Hungarians were driven out of Bosnia. As a result, the local Slavs had the chance to unite in one country, later called Yugoslavia, meaning a nation for south Slavs. In the eyes of some locals there, Princip could be heralded as a ""liberator."" 7: His legacy in the Balkans was toxic. The wars that ripped Bosnia apart in the 1990s were driven by ethnic divisions between the local Slav communities: Serb, Croat, Muslim. The dream of all local Slavs living together was shattered. Though Princip fired his gun a hundred years ago in hopes of freeing his Slav kinfolk, today he is ""blamed"" for being an ethnic Bosnian Serb, tainted by association with those extremists responsible for committing atrocities during the Balkans war. The issue is so toxic that, as the centenary of the June 28, 1914 assassination approached, in Bosnia there was no national consensus on how it should be acknowledged. History's greatest teenage troublemaker is also, perhaps, history's most toxic teenage troublemaker.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates arrived in Afghanistan on Monday morning on an unannounced visit, as NATO-led coalition forces are pressing an offensive in the nation's south. Gates was scheduled to meet with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan. Coalition forces are battling Taliban fighters around the town of Marjah in southern Helmand province. Dubbed Operation Moshtarak, the offensive was launched in February by an international coalition of 15,000 troops, including Afghans, Americans, Britons, Canadians, Danes and Estonians. Gates told reporters that he was going to Afghanistan to ""get an update on the campaign, not only in Marjah but the next steps as we look to spring, summer and fall."" Long a bastion of pro-Taliban sentiment and awash with the opium used to fund the insurgency, the Marjah region has been known as the heroin breadbasket of Afghanistan and as a place where the Taliban had set up a shadow government. The hope now is for the United States to persuade the locals to change their crops from poppies -- grown to produce opium for the Taliban's drug trade -- and instead grow crops such as wheat, which can help them survive and provide income as well. Karzai visited Marjah on Sunday with McChrystal to see what gains have been made in the military offensive. Gates arrived in Afghanistan on the same day that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was supposed to have visited. Iranian state-run media reported Monday that Ahmadinejad's trip had been postponed until mid-March. ""Iran is playing a double game in Afghanistan,"" Gates told reporters on the flight to Afghanistan. ""They want to maintain a good relationship with the Afghan government. They also want to do everything they possibly can to hurt us, or for us not to be successful."" Gates said the Tehran government ""will help the Taliban, whether they are providing money"" or ""some low level of support."" The United States and its European allies are making a strong pitch to members of the U.N. Security Council for new sanctions that they say will be ""smart and effective"" as Iran moves forward with its nuclear program. Those proposed new sanctions reportedly would target Iran's banking, shipping and insurance sectors. But it's unclear whether China, a veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council, will support the proposals. The United States and other nations think Iran has undertaken a program to build nuclear weapons, an assertion Iran denies, saying the goal of the program is to produce domestic power.","Gates is to meet with Karzai and U.S. Commander Gen.

"The U.S. Department of Labor recently announced that the unemployment rate fell to 8.2%. That should have been a signal that jobs are coming back and that the economy is about to rebound. But, as many economists say, the numbers fell primarily because unemployed Americans have become so discouraged with trying to find a job that they've simply quit looking. Because nearly one-third of the American middle class, mostly families with children, have fallen into poverty or are one paycheck away from poverty, it is paramount that we dissect the root causes of this mass disenfranchisement within the American workforce. This was the motivation behind ""The Poverty Tour: A Call to Conscience,"" our 18-city bus tour that traveled across the country last year. It was designed to bring more attention to the plight of impoverished Americans. These citizens do not fit the negative stereotypes and propaganda that we've heard during the Republican presidential primary contests. The candidates who have vowed to cut government subsidies speak of the poor as if their constituents had been exempted from the millions who, despite their middle-class identification and aspirations, now fall beneath the established poverty line. The people we met aren't lazy or eager to live off so-called government entitlements. We spoke with formerly middle-class parents who were thrust into poverty when one or both lost their salaries. We heard the stories of single mothers and fathers, military veterans and former high-wage employees desperately trying to re-enter a workforce that no longer pays living wages. Joann Cotton, a 54-year-old Columbus, Mississippi, resident, was one of those faces of poverty we met on the tour. Unemployed for three years, Joann has gone from making ""$60,000 a year to less than $15,000 overnight."" Her husband is disabled and dependent on medicines the couple can no longer afford. They rely on food stamps, which, Joann says, ""is depressing as hell."" Receiving government aid, however, has not been as depressing as her job search. Joann says she has applied for at least 300 jobs. Even though she can barely afford gas, she drives to the interviews only to learn that the employers want to hire younger candidates at low wages. The experiences have taken a toll: ""I've aged 10 years in the three years that I've been looking for a job,"" Joann told us. ""I want to get a job so I can just relax and exhale ... but I can't. After a while you just give up."" Like Joann, millions of Americans are just giving up on the possibility of ever rejoining the workforce. These frustrations reflect a reality that is unraveling the American identity. One of the most fundamental dictates in achieving the ""American Dream"" has always been a good job that pays wages decent enough to care for our families, buy a car and a home, and live reasonably comfortable lives. What has caused so many to quit looking for jobs and, by extension, abandon the American Dream? We argue that a covenant has been broken with the American people. We live in a society where corporations put profits over people. We march to the beat of political leaders who have decided the richest 1% of the people in this country deserve generous tax breaks and preferential treatment while most of the 99% are forced to pay unbalanced shares of the tax burden and live on less and less. Unemployment has been discussed in sound bites within the framework of the Great Recession. Reporters and pundits pontificate about the housing and home-lending fiasco, the collapse of Wall Street and the amount of construction, manufacturing and government jobs lost as a result of the market's economic downturn. Yet economists and politicians propose failed remedies based on rebuilding and rebooting systems that have already dashed the American Dream for many. Economist Peter Morici, for example, suggests dynamic job growth will be sparked by increasing domestic oil production, tackling the trade imbalance with China, relaxing regulations for big businesses and curbing health care mandates. Not only do these efforts lack the innovation necessary to meet the demands of a burgeoning world economy, they also do nothing to change the nation's capitalist equation that renders everyday Americans irrelevant. ""Fair trade"" with China will not interrupt the transportation of construction, manufacturing and production jobs overseas in exchange for huge profits. Fat-cat executives running investment firms, banks, insurance, health care and pharmaceutical companies might like to curb health care mandates, but that approach certainly doesn't address the needs of Americans looking for decent wages and affordable health care. The Supreme Court's regressive Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision in many ways validates a truism. The court basically ruled that corporations are people. And like all Americans, corporations have the free speech rights and can spend whatever they want on political ads without disclosing who they are or exposing their agendas. So, in a very real sense, corporations are people  -- super-rich, self-serving people who can use their billions to influence elections at the expense of, well, real people. Most major corporations are run by the über-rich -- the same people who shipped American jobs overseas, broke the backs of labor unions, pay a fraction of the salaries once paid for manufacturing jobs, turned full-time work into part-time positions, and snatched health care benefits away from employees. And many companies have even established ""unemployed need not apply"" policies. In other words, if you don't have a job when it's time to apply, you can't get the job. When the ""need not apply"" story broke late last year, more than 6 million Americans had been out of work for six months or more. Talk about kicking people when they're down. During our poverty tour last year, we met countless people caught in vicious cycles of looking for nonexistent jobs because their unemployment benefits were expiring or had run out, scraping change together for gas to go on interviews that may or may not pan out, and having to swap food stamps for cash to keep the lights or gas on in the house. Frustrations are especially high among young people dealing with an 18% unemployment rate -- a more than 60-year high. We attended a town hall meeting in Detroit during our poverty tour where parents complained of 25-year-olds who came of working age before the Great Recession who have never had a job in their lives. The newly launched #FixYoungAmerica campaign is centered around the fact that 20% of young workers have been out of work for a year or longer, jobs are scarce, and the cumulative student loan debt is more than $1 trillion. ""Our generation has been hit far worse than any other,"" said Scott Gerber, 28, part of the group of young people who started the campaign. ""We represent the broken dream of America, and we can't let it continue."" That dream has been broken for youths and adults all over the country. Many single mothers have stopped looking for work for the sake of their children's health. Because of deficit budget cuts, states are either eliminating or tightening eligibility requirements for child care programs that used to serve the working poor. More cuts are on the way, but, for the moment, children of women on welfare have access to basic health care. But previously eligible low-wage-earning parents are now either denied assistance or their children are placed on interminable waiting lists. It has reached the point where struggling parents have to choose between a low-wage job and welfare so their children can receive basic medical attention. A person can survive in the jungle for only so long before his or her spirit breaks. And the spirit of the American workforce is approaching a breaking point. Today's staggering unemployment isn't the stepchild of the Great Recession. It is the illegitimate offspring of a long-abided system that places the profits and concerns of big business and the mega-rich above the rest of us. The cancer of greed has spread throughout the body of America and surgery based on pre-recession strategies won't cure the disease. The inconvenient truth is that America itself is in need of a transfusion of economic equity and radical reform. Everyday people must recognize that their lives matter just as much as the lives of the rich. A workplace rooted in fundamental fairness that provides decent living wage jobs will allow frustrated, unemployed workers like Joann Cotton to breathe again, and give them a chance to become revitalized contributing members of society. It's time to resuscitate the American Dream.","Writers: Jobless numbers fell, but many discouraged unemployed just quit looking .

"(CNN) -- From ambitious teens taking on the world and tech pioneers breaking boundaries to maverick slum dwellers dreaming big and trailblazing innovators tackling social problems, CNN's African Start-Up has been following the efforts of the continent's innovative and determined entrepreneurs to make their business dreams become reality. Indeed, all across the continent, a growing wave of grassroots self-starters are taking risks and defying obstacles to bring their money-making ideas to life. Armed with a can-do attitude and hopes of striking it big, they're navigating a conundrum of challenges to pursue opportunities at a time when many African countries enjoy unprecedented levels of economic growth. ""The entrepreneurial landscape in sub-Saharan Africa is absolutely excellent,"" says Mike Herrington, executive director of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. ""It's on the increase because Africa, at last, has been emerging and the economies are booming -- several countries are starting to really increase entrepreneurial activity and move to opportunity entrepreneurship, rather than necessity entrepreneurship,"" he adds. ""Opportunities abound and a positive spirit is emerging amongst the population of these countries."" So, Africa's entrepreneurial spirit is alive and thriving -- but how does it compare to the rest of the world? Earlier this year, GEM published its annual report looking at the state of entrepreneurship globally. It found that sub-Saharan Africa is the region with by far the highest number of people involved in early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA), with Zambia and Nigeria leading the world rankings. It's a woman's world . Africa also leads the world in the number of women starting businesses, with almost equal levels of male and female entrepreneurs. In fact, in countries like Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia the women outnumber the men. Overall, the continent has a much higher proportion of female entrepreneurs compared to other regions, with Nigeria and Zambia (both 40.7%) coming on top and countries like the United States (10.4%), the UK (5.5%), Norway (3.6%) and France (3.1%) lagging far behind. According to Herrington, the main reason for this is because women in Africa ""need to earn an extra income"" to be able to afford ""to send their children to school."" Getting off the ground . Yet, does the high number of both male and female entrepreneurs tell the whole story? And do these impressive figures translate to sustainable startups that are able to grow and provide employment to the continent's young population? In its analysis, GEM groups countries into geographic regions, but also according to their development stage: factor-driven, efficiency-driven and innovation-driven, each suggesting an increasing level of sophistication in the operation of the economy (see fact box on the left). Most African nations surveyed are placed into the factor-driven stage, where early-stage entrepreneurial activity rates tend to be higher than the rates of owner-managers in established businesses (running more than three and a half years). In other words, ""a high entrepreneurship rate does not necessarily mean the creation of a lot of jobs,"" explains Herrington. ""Those countries with low GDP per capita tend to have a very high entrepreneurial rate, because the larger corporations are not taking up a lot people to provide them with the so-called formal employment,"" he adds. Calling it a day . Similarly, the continent might be buzzing with startups, but how long do these last? According to GEM, the rate of business discontinuance tends to decrease as economic development increases. As a result, countries like Malawi and Angola that see many new businesses also experience high numbers of people abandoning their efforts after failing to make profits. ""The discontinuance of businesses in the factor-driven economies is very high,"" says Herrington, citing ""the lack of education, market research and access to funding"" as the main reasons. Fearless entrepreneurs . There are several factors hindering the survival and growth of small businesses in Africa -- little government support, bureaucracy and lack of financial backing to cite a few more. Yet, all these constraints do little to prevent the continent's budding entrepreneurs from trying their luck. True, entrepreneurs might be optimistic by nature, but nowhere else in the world is this key drive toward success as present as in Africa. The continent's entrepreneurs boast the lowest levels of ""fear of failure,"" with just 24% responding that it would stop from starting a business and seizing business opportunities. In countries like Zambia, Uganda and Malawi the figure drops to as little as 15% -- compare that to countries like the UK (36.4%) and the United States. (31%). All you need is confidence . It's no surprise then that African entrepreneurs are also the most confident in the world in their ability and skills to start a business. In comparison, people in Malawi feel twice as self-assured about launching a startup as those in the UK. Likewise, sub-Saharan Africa claims the top five spots for countries where people see good opportunities for starting a business and feel positive about entrepreneurship. Herrington says that it's these qualities, coupled with a need for better education and a focus on moving entrepreneurs from necessity to opportunity, that will drive the continent's development. ""Africa is going to have to rely on small businesses (SMEs) to provide the bulk of the employment,"" he says. ""In a lot of countries the SMEs contribute more than 50% of the GDP and more than 50% of employment, so if you're going to employ people in Africa and other developing countries it's SMEs are the ones that are going to provide that.""","Experts say Africa has to rely on small businesses to provide employment .
The continent has the highest rates of early-stage entrepreneurship in the world .
It's a leader for female entrepreneurship, says Global Entrepreneurship Monitor .
Yet countries with many new startups also see high levels of discontinuance ."
"Washington (CNN)Sen. Rand Paul declared the war against ISIS ""illegal"" in a new opinion piece Monday, urging conservatives to speak out against President Barack Obama's decision not to seek congressional authorization for military action against the terrorist group. ""This war is now illegal. It must be declared and made valid, or it must be ended,"" the Kentucky Republican wrote in an op-ed published Monday by The Daily Beast. The U.S. began airstrikes in Iraq in August and in Syria in September, citing a 2001 measure known as the Authorization for the Use of Military Force as the president's legal basis for going after terrorist threats. Paul cites the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in stressing his long-held position that all military action must be approved by Congress. The exception is when a situation is considered urgent. In that case, a president has 60 days to get authorization after military action. If there's no approval from Congress, the president has 30 days to end the mission. Rand Paul plants feet between both sides of foreign policy debate . While Paul said he doesn't think the War Powers Resolution specifically applies to the ISIS situation -- because the U.S. had not been attacked -- he notes that even if it did, the president's time would be up. ""Taking military action against ISIS is justified. The president acting without Congress is not,"" he wrote, reiterating a stance he's held since September. This fall Paul has described the airstrikes against Syria as appropriate action but said Obama's method for doing so was ""unconstitutional."" The op-ed comes as Paul, who's seen as a likely presidential candidate in 2016, has been trying to shed his isolationist image yet maintain his libertarian-leaning roots. In the new op-ed, he specifically reached out to conservatives, saying they ""they should end their conspicuous silence about the president's usurpation of Congress' sole authority to declare war."" Paul blasts Obama as arrogant 'autocrat' He suggested conservatives are being hypocritical in their criticism of Obama by lambasting him for acting alone through executive actions but staying quiet when he authorizes military action without approval. ""Conservatives who blast the president for ignoring the separation of powers on immigration display a fatal inconsistency by embracing unlimited war-making powers,"" he wrote. Paul: Washington's 'barnacled enablers' push for constant war . His piece comes as a report from Politico lists new details about his all-but-certain presidential campaign. The report says he would likely headquarter his campaign in Louisville, Kentucky, and would move forward with a 2016 re-election bid for the Senate on top of a presidential run. Paul, who's attempting to sharpen his foreign policy brand, also raises questions about Hillary Clinton's physical stamina as well as her record as secretary of state and her involvement in Libya.","Rand Paul calls on conservatives to decry the President's use of military action without authorization .

"It's a national outcry. Republicans and Democrats have urgently pressed President Barack Obama to do something to stem the flow of child immigrants crossing the southern border -- and fast. But in the hours after Obama announced Tuesday his request to Congress for $3.7 billion to slow the surge, objections began to mount on Capitol Hill. The opposition is entrenched and extends beyond the current crisis of more than 52,000 unaccompanied minors crossing the border since October. It's rooted in distrust of the President, especially on immigration. ""There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws and it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes,"" House Speaker John Boehner said in February. As a central example, Republicans point to Obama's decision in 2012 to defer deportations of children brought to the United States illegally by their parents. They claim that's a reason for the unexpected surge of kids today from Central America. With the door closed to any action on immigration reform this year with midterm campaigning in full swing, Congress and Obama now face a crisis around that issue, which Republicans do not want to touch as it's politically charged and complex. And they're signaling that Obama's proposal to address the situation on the southern border won't be dealt with quickly, even though the White House casts it as an emergency. Obama on Wednesday called the flow of ""unaccompanied children"" an ""incredibly dangerous"" situation, and said his proposal offers Congress ""the capacity to vote immediately"" on a solution if it wants to address the problem swiftly. Obama heads to Texas amid 'urgent humanitarian situation' Is immigration crisis Rick Perry's second act? But Boehner said earlier on Wednesday, ""We've got to do something about sealing the border and ending this problem so that we can begin to move onto the bigger questions of immigration reform."" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia got to the heart of GOP sentiment, saying Obama ""created this disaster"" with his action to ease deportations. ""No amount of resources or changes will be effective in stemming the surge of illegal border crossings if President Obama continues to ignore the law,"" he wrote in a statement, resurrecting the common refrain when immigration reform was still a possibility. Republicans also balked at the size of Obama's request, which was twice what they anticipated. It includes $1.8 billion for the care of immigrant children while in holding facilities and $1.1 billion for the transportation and removal of any children ineligible to remain in the country. ""What disappoints me so much is he's asking for a blank check,"" Texas Sen. John Cornyn said. Fiscal hawk Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said it's an extraordinary amount. ""We can put them all on a first class seat to their homes, that's $8 million,"" Coburn said Tuesday on CNN's ""Crossfire."" The issue of immigration is ripe with politics, especially in an election year. It motivates the Republican base, which is skeptical of reform and despises Obama. But Democratic strategist Maria Cardona said Republicans are trying to have it both ways -- ask for a solution and criticize the President. ""They can't scream about the house being on fire and then cut off the water supply to put out that fire,"" she said. The situation also plays well for Democrats. They have consistently and increasingly captured the Hispanic vote, and used immigration as a wedge to keep Latinos in their camp. While Democrats indicate they support Obama's request, they want more details before signing off. At least one has expressed some frustration with the White House on this issue and, too, raises trust, but in a different context. ""We just can't just trust the President and say we are going to give you exactly every penny you want,"" Rep. Henry Cuellar, whose South Texas district is one heavily impacted by the current crisis, told CNN. Democrats want to maintain the status of current law giving youth the right to make their case in an immigration proceeding. ""I hope at the end of the day it is basically fair and humanitarian and we keep in mind repeatedly that we're dealing with children here,"" said Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois. A law signed by President George W. Bush just prior to Obama's swearing-in, was meant to address child victims of illegal trafficking. It says unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico or Canada cannot be immediately deported. Instead, they must be treated humanely, turned over to the Health and Human Services Department, and given an immigration hearing to determine if they qualify for asylum. 5 things you need to know about the immigration crisis . Republicans want the law changed so unaccompanied youth can be immediately sent home without due process. Cuellar and Sen. John Cornyn, also of Texas, are set to propose legislation on Thursday to reverse that measure. While the White House says it will ask Congress to give the Homeland Security Department more discretion to send such immigrants home, it's unclear if Obama will request changes to the anti-trafficking law. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said this week the administration would meet humanitarian and due process standards. More judicial resources to accelerate immigration proceedings is one step the White House indicated was necessary. Even some Democrats want more information, especially regarding asylum for trafficking victims who may be fleeing abuse or life threatening situations in their domestic surroundings. ""I want to see what is written. I trust this president but I want to verify,"" Durbin said.","President Obama asked Congress for $3.7 billion for border solution .
Republicans immediately raised concerns, especially over cost .
Democrats are also wading cautiously on the issue in a midterm election year .
Obama says Congress can solve problem now if it wants by passing his plan ."
"(CNN) -- The start of the final stage of the Tour de France was delayed Sunday when race officials asked Lance Armstrong and his team to remove their commemorative jerseys for cancer survivors. The officials told Armstrong and his team to remove the all-black jerseys and continue to wear their official jerseys throughout the race, according to CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, who was at the event. Armstrong was not a top finisher in his last Tour de France ever, but he and his team had planned to ride into Paris' Champs-Elysees with pride Sunday, wearing jerseys with the number 28 emblazoned on them. The number represents the 28 million people currently living with cancer worldwide -- a cause near to cancer survivor Armstrong's heart. ""Today, we're riding for every one of the 28 million people all over the world whose lives and families are affected by this disease,"" said Armstrong, explaining why Team RadioShack was swapping its official red-and-gray racing kit in favor of the black ones. Alberto Contador won the Tour de France Sunday for the third time. His previous triumphs were in 2007 and 2009. Mark Cavendish won the 20th -- and final -- stage. Armstrong, 38, was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer in October 1996. He beat it, came back to win the Tour de France each year from 1999 until 2005, and launched the Livestrong Foundation that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars toward the fight against cancer. After a four-year-retirement, he returned to the race in 2009 -- almost winning an eighth title. But this year, Armstrong finished 23rd. Armstrong and the rest of Team Radio Shack won the team competition, with their combined times faster than any other team. Armstrong is also fighting accusations leveled by former teammate Floyd Landis that he used performance-enhancing drugs. Landis himself was stripped of his 2006 Tour title for doping. Gupta is a board member of the Lance Armstrong LiveStrong Foundation.","Race officials refused to let Armstrong's team wear the special jerseys .

"Two members of the dissident Russian punk band Pussy Riot were attacked by a group of men while eating breakfast at a McDonald's restaurant in a Russian city on Thursday. The unidentified men threw trash and squirted paint at the two band members, Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alyokhina, in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, about 400 kilometers (250 miles) east of Moscow. The band members posted a video of the attack online, which left them with paint smeared over their faces. The video shows a group of about six men assaulting the women, who are seated at a table. The men shout obscenities and tell the women to get out of the city and go to America. Tolokonnikova cries out at one point, stumbling away from the table holding her face. Pussy Riot gained international attention in 2012 after members of the band were arrested for performing an expletive-ridden song denouncing Russian President Vladimir Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral in Moscow. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina, who both have young children, were sent to prison after being convicted of hooliganism and inciting religious hatred. Russian authorities freed the pair in December. Several other high-profile critics of the Russian government were released ahead of the Winter Olympics, which took place in the resort of Sochi last month. Nearly two years in prison failed to silence Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina. After their release, they immediately resumed their denunciations of the Kremlin, as well as the conditions that inmates endure in Russian prisons. Their continued activism has kept them in conflict with Russian authorities. They went to Sochi during the Olympics to voice their concerns. While there, they were briefly detained by police and beaten by a group of Cossacks. In the video of Thursday's attack, Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina said they had gone to Nizhny Novgorod because they heard of prisoners' rights being violated there and wanted to help.","Unidentified men throw trash and squirt paint in the women's faces at a McDonald's .

"(CNN) -- Russia and Qatar will host soccer's biggest tournament, the FIFA World Cup, for the first time in 2018 and 2022 respectively. Russia headed off 1966 host England and joint presentations from Spain-Portugal and Holland-Belgium in Thursday's vote at FIFA headquarters in Switzerland. Qatar won the right to host the 2022 tournament ahead of bids from the United States, South Korea, Japan and Australia. Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin decided against attending the ceremony in Zurich, but his deputy Igor Shuvalov was present to accept the first successful bid from Eastern Europe. Has FIFA gambled with World Cup decisions? ""You have entrusted us with the FIFA World Cup for 2018 and I can promise that you will never regret it. Let us make history together,"" Shuvalov told the assembled delegates. Putin later flew to Zurich to address the world's assembled media. ""This sport makes a positive difference -- 2018 will be fantastic,"" the former Russian president said. ""We will build new stadiums and do our best to make the World Cup safe and enjoyable for everyone. We will allow all football fans to enter the country without a visa in order to enjoy the tournament and to get to know Russia and its history and culture."" Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Thani, the son of Qatar's emir and head of the emirate's bid team, said he was looking forward to the first time a Middle Eastern nation hosts the event. ""Thank you for believing in change, for expanding the game and for giving Qatar a chance. You will be proud of us -- and you will be proud of the Middle East. I promise you this,"" he said. Qatar's World Cup vision . FIFA president Sepp Blatter confirmed that the ruling body's desire to grow the sport around the world played a big part in the committee's thinking. ""I have to say thanks to the executive committee because for 2018 and 2022 we go to new lands, because the FIFA World Cup has never been in eastern Europe or the Middle East. So, I'm a happy president when we speak of the development of football,"" he said. ""But I have to give big compliments to all the bidders for the big job they have done and the messages they have delivered. All have delivered the message that football is more than just a game. Football is not only about winning -- it is also a school of life where you must learn to lose, and that is not easy."" We are not corrupt, insists FIFA official . CNN's Moscow-based correspondent Matthew Chance said the decision had been received with great jubilation in Russia, where the government has pledged billions of dollars to build new stadiums and infrastructure. It has already begun preparing to host the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014. ""This is a huge boom for the Russian economy -- it is going to mean tens of billions of dollars put into infrastructure and will give the country the incentive they need to meet their modernization plans,"" he reported. ""There is also a huge emotional pull for the people of this country. It is very intriguing the tactics used from the Russians to secure the bid. England's bid had prime minister David Cameron and David Beckham to give it the celebrity X-factor, but Putin just stayed in Russia to wait for the result of the vote."" Qatar's victory came despite several obstacles being flagged up in FIFA technical report before the vote, including the region's intense heat at the time the tournament will be held in June-July and a lack of existing infrastructure. CNN Arabic . ""Logistics were talked about, but Qatar said we can do that, we will build enough hotels, enough stadiums,"" CNN's Sara Sidner reported from Doha after the announcement. ""The feeling here is a sense of achievement, the sense that Qatar is an important country. People here are very proud. There was a little bit of surprise -- they could just not believe that Qatar was called, but there were some very big cheers. ""When you look at Qatar as a country, it has a small population and most are ex-pats, but there a lot of fans here. They believe people will come here, they will have plenty of facilities and they will have the climate conditioned -- and they will put on a fantastic show. ""They are saying that people do not need to be afraid -- we are going to open up to the world and the world should open up to us."" Why the world 'turns around a spinning ball' This year's World Cup was held on the African continent for the first time, while the next one in 2014 will be in Brazil, which was last host in 1950. CNN World Sport anchor Pedro Pinto said he was surprised that FIFA again chose to seek new territories after South Africa 2010 and Japan and South Korea in 2002. ""To risk it again for two consecutive years is quite amazing. Most of the world's media here is surprised,"" he said from Zurich. Russia won nine of the 22 votes in the first round of voting, with Spain-Portugal earning seven, Holland-Belgium four and England two. The lowdown on the World Cup bid ballot . In the second round, Russia earned a majority of 13 ahead of the Iberian bid (7) and that of the Low Countries (2). The 2022 vote went to four rounds, with Australia eliminated in the first, Japan the second and then South Korea. Qatar triumphed with 14 votes to the Americans' eight in the decider. The build-up to the vote was overshadowed by allegations of corruption against FIFA delegates. Two executive committee members and four other officials were suspended after being accused of offering their votes for sale following an undercover investigation by a British newspaper. A program by the BBC on Monday alleged that three current executive committee members accepted bribes more than a decade ago.","Russia to host 2018 World Cup after winning vote by FIFA executive committee .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Somewhere in the world, a child dies of hunger every five seconds -- even though the planet has more than enough food for all. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon laid out this sobering statistic as he kicked off a three-day summit on world food security Monday in Rome. ""Today, more than 1 billion people are hungry,"" he told the assembled leaders. Six million children die of hunger every year -- 17,000 every day, he said. The summit opened with the leaders adopting a declaration to renew their commitment to eradicating hunger. They promised to do so by promoting investment, reversing the decline in funding for agriculture and tackling the effect of global warming on food security. Urgent action is critical, Ban said. In 2050, the world will need to feed 2 billion more mouths -- 9.1 billion in all. The steps Ban proposed included providing farmers with seeds and land and offering them access to better markets and fairer trade. ""These small-holder farmers are the heart and soul of food security and poverty reduction,"" he said. ""Our job is not just to feed the hungry but to empower the hungry to feed themselves."" The summit came under criticism even before it began, with some aid groups skeptical that it would accomplish much. The United Nations hopes that donors will go beyond affirming their support to end hunger and fulfill a promise they made during a Group of Eight meeting in July to increase food aid significantly. Though more than 60 world leaders are at the summit, all but one of the G-8 leaders were absent. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Belusconi is hosting the gathering. The United States sent the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Britain sent two ministers. During his speech, Ban also tied the global warming crisis to hunger eradication. The melting of Himalayan glaciers will affect the livelihood of 300 million people in China and up to 1 billion throughout Asia, he said. And African farmers might see harvests drop by 50 percent by 2020. The United Nations has scheduled a climate summit next month in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""There can be no food security without climate security,"" Ban said. ""They must produce results. ""The world is impatient for us to make a difference. I, too, am impatient. And I am committed."" The United Nations also seeks commitment from the public, making an online appeal for individual donations to fight hunger. The U.N. World Food Program's ""Billion for a Billion"" campaign aims to reach 1 billion individuals. ""If a billion Internet users donate a dollar or a euro a week, we can literally transform the lives of a billion hungry people across the world,"" said Josette Sheeran, the World Food Program's executive director. Small donations can make a big difference, Sheeran said. ""Year in, year out, governments have supported WFP in its mission to feed the world's hungriest people, but they cannot be expected to do it alone,"" Sheeran said. ""It's time for members of the public to act.""","More than 1 billion hungry, U.N. official says at summit for world food security .

"(CNN) -- Ebola virus disease is sweeping across West Africa in the largest outbreak of the virus to date. Mortality rates are currently at 60% in a disease where up to 90% of infected people can die. But despite this lethality there remain no licensed treatments or vaccines available, nearly 40 years after the disease was first discovered. In March, Ebola was reported for the first time in Guinea, West Africa, in districts that border neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone. This proximity meant that unlike previous outbreaks in other parts of Africa, the usually remote Ebola virus had the opportunity to cross borders. With residents migrating back and forth, it did just that. Four months later the outbreak has reached unprecedented scales, with 1,093 people infected and 660 deaths attributed to the virus. ""This is clearly an outbreak across international borders and it has not been handled properly,"" explains David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who was on-site at the first human Ebola outbreak in 1976. He says the 24 known outbreaks of Ebola to date have shown that it should be easily controlled. ""It's not rocket science to control these outbreaks but instead basic epidemiology: infection control, hygiene practices, contact-tracing and safe burial practices,"" says Heymann of the virus, which is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids. ""Ebola is its own worst enemy, it's too lethal and cannot sustain its own spread."" But whilst it should be easily contained, this time something has gone wrong. The Guinean and Liberian capital cities were reached exposing many more to the virus and making those infected and their contacts harder to trace and isolate. The outbreak has been described as ""out of control"" by Doctors without Borders -- so why is there no other approach? Opinion: Why Ebola epidemic is spinning out of control . The usual response in disease outbreaks is to use drugs to treat those infected and stop them transmitting to others, in combination with vaccines that protect those exposed and slow down, or halt, the spread of a virus through a population by enabling herd immunity. But there are no licensed drugs or vaccines for use against Ebola as its periodic, remote and usually small-scale nature means there has not been a big enough market, nor the ability to conduct large-scale trials in humans exposed to the disease. The biology of the virus also makes it challenging to develop vaccines that create a strong enough immune response; the occurrence of multiple forms of the virus means an immune response is needed against all of them, and Ebola's ability to replicate rapidly means it could equally rapidly evolve resistance to the vaccine. Despite these challenges, there are vaccines being developed by a range of organizations, including the vaccine research center at the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) -- and some argue that an outbreak is the perfect time to trial them. ""It would be unethical not to acknowledge that potential new treatments could both save lives and reduce transmission in this and future outbreaks,"" says Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of global charitable foundation the Wellcome Trust. Farrar has recently called for new approaches to be used in controlling the outbreak as no other opportunity will enable the further development of new treatments or vaccines. ""Any new intervention must have preclinical safety and efficacy data and Phase I safety data in healthy volunteers,"" he says describing the slow progression of phases involved in pharmaceutical development, ""But ultimately there can be no Phase II (vaccine efficacy) data in Ebola other than that acquired during an epidemic."" Peter Piot, director of the LSHTM, who co-discovered Ebola during its first outbreak, agrees with Farrar. ""In general I believe that this continuing outbreak is a rare opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of experimental drugs,"" he says, but stresses, ""as long as all ethical standards are respected, and as long as it does not create more problems for controlling the outbreak, since medical experiments may decrease even more trust in health authorities and add to hostility to healthcare workers."" Piot is referring to resistance from affected communities towards healthcare workers and health officials who enter their villages dressed in astronaut-like quarantine clothing and ask them to change their cultural practices such as burials, where the traditional cleaning of bodies puts those mourning at risk of transmission. Long-standing mistrust exists towards governments and ministries of health, leading to healthcare staff having rocks thrown at them, being threatened by machetes and facing general aggression, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesperson. Tensions between those controlling the outbreak and those affected by it mean trialling vaccines in outbreak communities is not supported by WHO officials on the ground. ""Using an experimental vaccine on human beings in the middle of an outbreak in this case would not be ethical, feasible, or wise,"" according to the WHO. But there remain other avenues. ""The vaccines are likely safe and effective but aren't used by public health teams and they won't use them without adequate trials,"" explains Dr Peter Walsh, from the University of Cambridge, who is developing vaccines for use in non-human primates such as chimpanzees and gorillas who are also victims of the virus. Walsh's vaccines have shown a good immune response when trialled in chimpanzees and he suggests trialling human vaccines incrementally in healthcare workers rather than the mass population. ""Healthcare workers are at the greatest risk and are hubs of infection who are likely to spread it to others,"" he says. ""The risk of dying from the vaccine is tiny compared to dying from Ebola and unlike communities, healthcare workers would understand the risks better and should be able to give informed consent."" This approach is supported by the NIAID, whose Ebola vaccine programs have progressed the furthest. ""We are supporting a number of vaccines and they are all in a roughly similar position and getting ready for Phase I trials for safety,"" says Dr Mike Kurilla, director of their Office of Biodefense Research Resources and Translational Research. ""If these make it through testing what we're likely to see in future outbreaks is healthcare workers and outbreak investigators taking the vaccine under informed consent,"" Kurilla explains. ""Working with those at the highest risk will enable you to see if the vaccine has an impact."" It is too late in this outbreak for vaccines to have enough of a preventative impact, but Ebola will emerge again in the future. If safety can be proven, the stockpiling of vaccines could improve the outcome of future outbreaks. ""Vaccines enable a preparative framework to be established rather than a reactive one,"" explains Heymann. ""But firstly it must be shown to be safe in humans."" The ability to control future epidemics may depend on it. Opinion: Why Ebola epidemic is spinning out of control .","40 years after its discovery, there are no licensed treatments or vaccines for Ebola .
Ethically, a vaccine for Ebola can only be trialled for effectiveness during an outbreak .
Vaccines are better trialled in high-risk groups, including healthcare workers, say experts ."
"An Alitalia passenger jet pilot said he saw a drone over Brooklyn on Monday. Whether it's true or not -- the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating -- we are going to be hearing more and more about drones in American skies. I predicted two things about drones in an online essay for Stanford Law Review in December 2011. Those predictions turned out to be true. But there was something I didn't see coming. My first prediction was that drones would trouble the public more than other contemporary surveillance technologies, in part because of their association with war. Events of the last year have borne this prediction out. Opposition to the domestic use of drones has spread steadily across the United States. Members of each house of Congress and each major party have raised questions about, or even proposed bills to limit, the use of drones for surveillance here at home. The FAA recently solicited comments on the privacy issues drones raise. The agency has granted 1,428 drone licenses so far, saying that typical purposes for the unmanned vehicles include ""law enforcement, firefighting, border patrol, disaster relief, search and rescue, military training, and other government operational missions."" The second prediction was that our collective, visceral reaction to drones would force a national conversation about the adequacy of privacy law. The jury is still out on whether we will seriously re-examine privacy law. For instance, in American law today there is next to no reasonable expectation of privacy in public. If there were, Google Maps would not be able to post its Street View. A police drone could likely hover over your backyard and record video without triggering constitutional scrutiny. Last year, the Supreme Court confronted the question of whether police following someone around continuously for a month using a GPS device required probable cause. Five of the nine justices worried aloud about continuous electronic surveillance, but ultimately the court found against the police officers, on the basis that they had triggered the Fourth Amendment through the act of physically attaching the GPS device to the suspect's car -- something drone surveillance does not require. There is also little expectation of privacy in illegal possessions or activities. Thus, a dog may sniff your bag at the airport (and elsewhere) without implicating the Constitution, on the theory that the dog only alerts in the presence of contraband. No officer need see the contents of your bag unless you have something you shouldn't. Drones, meanwhile, can be equipped with a variety of sensors that serve the same function. The very next generation of drones may be able to detect grow lamps, guns, or marijuana and, again, report back only what is already illegal. This year, the Supreme Court is set to decide whether a dog -- and, presumably, a drone -- could sniff even your house without a warrant. The court could take the opportunity either to limit or to seriously extend the contraband exception. In short, I looked up at the sky and saw the storm brewing. One thing I did not predict, however, was the danger to the drones themselves. The city of Seattle, where I live, just ended its modest drone program over citizen protests, even though the drones could only stay up in the air for 15 minutes and were intended to support emergency response.  The city of Charlottesville, Virginia, issued a moratorium on the use of drones within city limits.  And this is nothing compared with what may happen in 2015 when the FAA paves the way for the use of drones by private parties. I do not blame opponents of drones. They raise legitimate concerns that have gone largely unaddressed. The FAA and others should have taken privacy seriously from the beginning.  But I do worry that we are missing out on the transformative potential of drones. What are drones but flying smartphones, one app away from indispensable? We could see drones accompanying early morning joggers, taking sport, wildlife, and other photography to a new level, or mapping out hard-to-reach geographic terrain. The possibilities, as Vivek Wadhwa recently wrote, are endless. Which is why I would rather see an end to bad privacy law than an end to drones.","Ryan Calo: Like pilot's claim, we are going to hear more reports of drones in U.S. skies .
People are fearful of drones because they are used in war and surveillance, he says .
Calo: Privacy law doesn't cover most uses of drones, so many want to change laws .
He says potential creative uses of drones are endless and bad laws could prevent them ."
"He's a high school dropout who worked his way into the most secretive computers in U.S. intelligence as a defense contractor -- only to blow those secrets wide open by spilling details of classified surveillance programs. Now, Edward Snowden might never live in the United States as a free man again. Where he may end up was a source of global speculation Sunday after he flew from Hong Kong to Russia, his ultimate destination unknown to most. Snowden has revealed himself as the source of documents outlining a massive effort by the U.S. National Security Agency to track cell phone calls and monitor the e-mail and Internet traffic of virtually all Americans. Snowden, 29, said he just wanted the public to know what the government was doing. ""Even if you're not doing anything wrong you're being watched and recorded,"" he said. Snowden told The Guardian newspaper in the United Kingdom that he had access to the full rosters of everyone working at the NSA, the entire intelligence community and undercover assets around the world. ""I'm just another guy who sits there day to day in the office, watching what's happening, and goes, 'This is something that's not our place to decide.' The public needs to decide whether these programs or policies are right or wrong,"" he said. Snowden fled to Hong Kong after copying one last set of documents and telling his boss he needed to go away for medical treatment. From Hawaii to hiding . Before his leak of U.S. intelligence, Snowden was living ""in paradise."" He worked for a major U.S. government contractor in Hawaii, earning a six-figure salary and enjoying the scenic state with his girlfriend. He told The Guardian he never received a high school diploma and didn't complete his computer studies at a community college. Instead, he joined the Army in 2003 but was discharged after breaking both legs in an accident. Snowden said he later worked as a security guard for the NSA and then took a computer security job with the CIA. He left that job in 2009 and moved on to Booz Allen Hamilton, where he worked as a contractor for the government in Hawaii. He told the Guardian that he left for Hong Kong on May 20 without telling his family or his girlfriend what he planned. ""You're living in Hawaii, in paradise and making a ton of money. What would it take to make you leave everything behind?"" he said in the Guardian interview. ""I'm willing to sacrifice all of that because I can't in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building."" Some residents on Oahu island are glad Snowden left. ""From a Hawaii standpoint, good riddance, thanks for leaving,"" Ralph Cossa told CNN affiliate KHON. ""I'm sure the guy had an overactive Mother Teresa gene and thought he was going to go out and save America from Americans, but in reality he was very foolish,"" Cossa said. ""We expect the government to honor our privacy, but we also expect our government to protect us from terrorist attacks."" Opinion: Snowden is a hero . The fallout . President Barack Obama insists his administration is not spying on U.S. citizens -- rather, it's only looking for information on terrorists. Booz Allen Hamilton, the government contractor that employed Snowden, said Snowden had worked at the firm for less than three months. ""News reports that this individual has claimed to have leaked classified information are shocking, and if accurate, this action represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,"" the company said in the statement. The firm said it will cooperate with authorities in their investigation. According to the Guardian, the only time Snowden became emotional during hours of interviews was when he thought about what might happen to his relatives -- many of whom work for the U.S. government. ""The only thing I fear is the harmful effects on my family, who I won't be able to help anymore,"" he said. ""That's what keeps me up at night."" As for his concerns about his country, ""the greatest fear that I have regarding the outcome for America of these disclosures is that nothing will change."" Obama: No one listening to your calls .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Comic actor Harvey Korman has died at 81, according to the UCLA Medical Center. Harvey Korman's death comes after complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Korman died at the center four months after suffering complications from the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. ""It was a miracle in itself that he survived the incident at all. Everyone in the hospital referred to him as 'miracle man' because of his strong will and ability to bounce right back after several major operations,"" said Korman's daughter, Kate Korman. ""Tragically, after such a hard-fought battle, he passed away."" Korman was a regular on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" from 1967 through 1978, for which he won Emmy awards in 1969, 1971, 1972 and 1974. He also won a Golden Globe for his work on the series. The lanky Korman also appeared in Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"" (as the sneering Hedley Lamarr), ""High Anxiety"" and ""History of the World, Part 1."" He starred in his own short-lived situation comedy, ""The Harvey Korman Show,"" in 1978, in which he portrayed Harvey Kavanaugh opposite Christine Lahti, who played his wife, Maggie. He made dozens of appearances in other television shows and movies during his lengthy show-business career, including providing voices for several animated productions. Among those was The Great Gazoo, a helmeted space man who appeared in some episodes of ""The Flintstones."" Angie Horejsi, an assistant to Burnett, told The Associated Press that Burnett was devastated by Korman's death: ""She loved Harvey very much,"" Horejsi said. The AP also reported that Brooks described Korman as a ""dazzling"" comic talent. ""You could get rock-solid comedy out of him. He could lift the material. He always made it real, always made it work, always believed in characters he was doing,"" he said, according to AP. Korman was born in Chicago, Illinois. His first marriage, to Donna Ehlert in 1960, ended in divorce in 1974. He married Deborah Fritze in 1982. Both marriages produced two children. Korman landed some sketch work on ""The Red Skelton Show"" in 1961, followed by a four-year stint on ""The Danny Kaye Show,"" which led to his joining Carol Burnett in 1967.

"Suntech Power Holdings, which was until recently the world's largest producer of solar panels, has said its main subsidiary in China is bankrupt, in a further stark illustration of the declining fortunes of the global solar industry. Suntech's Wuxi subsidiary is the first big Chinese solar group to declare insolvency and the world's biggest such bankruptcy, following a string of failed western solar companies including Q-Cells in Germany and Solyndra in the US. ""What the Suntech case shows us is that the Chinese companies are not too big to fail,"" said Jenny Chase, head of solar analysis at Bloomberg New Energy Finance. ""We are entering a period of great difficulty for Chinese solar manufacturers."" China is the world's biggest producer of solar panels, but the sector is suffering from overcapacity after rapid expansion fuelled by cheap loans and preferential government policies. US-listed Suntech was the posterchild of the country's swift entry into, and then dominance of, the market. It announced on Wednesday that eight Chinese banks had filed a petition for insolvency and restructuring of Wuxi Suntech in a court in Jiangsu province. The bankruptcy is a milestone because, until now, China's larger struggling solar companies have been kept afloat by cheap credit and indirect state support. Suntech defaulted last week on a $541m convertible bond issued by its Cayman Islands subsidiary, which triggered cross-defaults on other loans outstanding. According to the company's most recent reports, Suntech's net debt stood at $1.6bn at the end of March 2012. The case is set to be a big test of China's new bankruptcy law, which came into effect in 2007 but has rarely been applied to overseas-listed companies with assets in China. It will be complicated by the fact that neither the US-listed entity, Suntech Power Holdings, nor any subsidiaries other than Wuxi are declaring insolvency. ""It's going to be a test of what, exactly, do the US entities and the Cayman entities really own?"" said one Singapore-based analyst who asked not to be named. Under Chinese law, the courts will have six months to come up with a restructuring plan that is then presented to creditors, with the possibility of an additional three-month extension. Bankruptcy specialist Han Chuanhua, a partner at the Zhongzi Law Office in Beijing, said: ""It is rare for such a big company to get into bankruptcy proceedings, even though many companies cannot pay off their debts."" He cited local government bailouts, and creditor reluctance, as two main reasons why insolvent Chinese companies avoid bankruptcy. The government of Wuxi, the city where Suntech is headquartered, has come to Suntech's aid in the past -- and appears to be taking an even more active role in the company with the appointment earlier this week of a new president, Zhou Weiping, who previously worked for the government-backed Wuxi Guolian Development Co. Mr Han said the co-ordinated action of the eight banks suggested the local government had given its blessing to the proceedings. ""Without government support, even if creditors file a petition, the court wouldn't accept it,"" he explained. David King, Suntech's chief executive, said: ""While we evaluate restructuring initiatives and strategic alternatives, we are committed to continuing to provide high-quality solar products to our global customer base.""","Suntech Power Holdings has said its main subsidiary in China is bankrupt .

"At least 64 people were killed in Syria on Sunday, according to an opposition activist group, as the Arab League suspended a monitoring mission designed to protect Syrian civilians from government-sponsored violence. The dead included 19 in Homs, 15 in Hama and 16 around Damascus, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Three children were among those killed, the group said. The LCC also called on Syrians to make Monday a day a remembrance. ""Please join us in observing a moment of silence as we remember the sacrifices of our fallen heroes, whose pure blood has saturated the earth of our beloved country,"" it said. Earlier, another opposition activist group, the Syrian Revolution General Council, said as many as 34 people had died Sunday, including a person who had been killed under torture, a woman and two children. Heavy clashes took place in the Eastern Ghouta area outside Damascus, the LCC said. At least 50 people were wounded in random bombardment by government forces, the group said, adding the government forces attacked residential areas and cut off electricity, water and communication. The reported deaths come a day after opposition sources said at least 98 people were killed. CNN cannot independently confirm reports from Syria because the government limits the activity of journalists there. Ali Erfan, senior advisor to Arab League Secretary General Nabil el-Araby, said Sunday that observer activity in Syria has been suspended, and all observers who were outside Damascus have redeployed to the capital. Some will leave the country, he said. Others will stay on for the moment in Damascus, but they will not be conducting any missions, he said, adding that he did not have details on how many are leaving and how many are staying. Russia's foreign minister said earlier Sunday he is in favor of boosting the number of observers in Syria, adding that he did not understand why the Arab League suspended its monitoring mission. ""We should like to understand why this useful instrument is treated in such a way,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, according to reports in Russian state media. The Local Coordination Committees said two Damascus men on Sunday ""tarnished the stairway of the Russian Cultural Center in red in an expression of their anger with the Russians' support of the regime."" It did not provide further details. The Arab League announced Saturday it was suspending its mission because of a sharp increase in violence. Monitors representing the 22-nation alliance were in Syria to determine whether President Bashar al-Assad's government is abiding by an agreement with the Arab League to end violence against anti-government protesters. ""I would support an increased number of observers,"" Lavrov said. There were reports Sunday of violent clashes between Syrian troops and rebel forces, made up primarily of military defectors, in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. Three people were killed in the violence, the group said. At least 10 Syrian troops were killed when a roadside bomb targeted a military vehicle in the mountains in the northwest province of Idlib, the Observatory group said. A rebel soldier was killed in clashes between the towns of Bloludan and Zabadani, the group said. A roadside bomb targeted a bus carrying Syrian troops in a Damascus suburb, killing six soldiers and wounding six others, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Sunday. Al-Assad's government has been under international pressure to stop a brutal, months-long crackdown on an anti-government uprising that began last year. The United Nations, the United States, the European Union and members of the Arab League have called on al-Assad to end the violence and step down. Meanwhile, Syrian Kurdish political groups met in Iraq to formulate a plan to protect their rights if al-Assad is ousted. All but a few Kurdish parties attended the meeting in Irbil in Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. In their final statement Sunday, the groups agreed to support decisions and recommendations made by the Kurdish National Council. While the Syrian groups are willing to unite with the Arab opposition in Syria, they want more self-determination and autonomy in a post-Assad Syria. The Kurds also continue to reject taking up arms and say they are afraid of Islamic undertones in the opposition groups. ""We are calling for a decentralized government because Syria is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious country,"" Abdul Hakim Bashar, chairman of the Kurdish National Council, told CNN. ""We demand a secular state, so Islamist movements don't try to interpret the system for their benefits by applying Islamic rules in a disfigured way."" However, one of the main Syrian Kurdish parties, the Democratic Union Party, or PYD, said it was excluded from the meeting. ""We have been working to unite Kurdish people and converge between different views within the Kurdish movement in Western Kurdistan and Syria,"" the party said in a statement. ""This conference by the Kurdistan Democratic Party is a plan to divide rather than unite the Kurdish people."" ""We alert the public that any recommendations and decisions issued by the so-called conference is not representative of the Kurdish people in Western Kurdistan,"" the group said. Kurds are Syria's largest ethnic minority, comprising between 10% and 15% of Syria's population. The United Nations last month estimated that more than 5,000 people have died since March, when the government launched a crackdown against demonstrators. Activist groups estimate a higher death toll, with counts near or exceeding 7,000 people. The opposition has blamed the deaths on government actions. The Syrian government says terrorists are responsible for the casualties. Diplomats at the U.N. Security Council are considering a draft resolution that calls on al-Assad to step down and transfer power to his vice president. Lavrov said the Arab League plans to submit new proposals to the U.N. Security Council this week. ""We need to study a report,"" he said, according to the ITAR-TASS news agency in Russia. Russia, which maintains trade relations with Syria, has proposed its own draft U.N. resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both al-Assad and the opposition, an option dismissed by the West. Lavrov said the draft resolution remains up for discussion. In October, Russia and China issued a rare double veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in Syria. This latest draft also lacks sanctions but is tougher than the earlier version, which said nothing about transfer of power. There will be a Monday meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries on the Security Council. Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Ja'afari, has dismissed the proposed resolution. ""Syria will not be Libya; Syria will not be Iraq; Syria will not be Somalia; Syria will not be a failing state,"" he told reporters.","The LCC asks that Monday be a day of remembrance .

"It was during the throes of the Civil War, with lots of bloody and brutal fighting still ahead, when President Abraham Lincoln turned his attention to the Mariposa Grove and the Yosemite Valley areas of California. Lincoln's signature on the Yosemite Land Grant bill on June 30, 1864, set a precedent for the preservation of the young country's wilderness. That act 150 years ago was the first instance of the U.S. government setting aside scenic wilderness for public use and preservation. The act put both tracts of land in trust for the state of California, and it set the stage for the 1872 establishment of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Montana and Idaho as the first national park. Calling it a ""remarkable message of hope for a nation embroiled in a bloody civil war,"" National Park Service director Joseph Jarvis suggested Lincoln's actions may have been ""assuring the nation of better times ahead, as if he knew that Americans would need places where they could go and find peace in the perfection of the natural world."" The land around the grove and the valley became Yosemite National Park in 1890. Both pieces of land were re-acquired by the federal government and combined with the national park in 1906, which created the park much as we know it today. Yosemite now hosts 3.7 million visitors annually, and the numbers are expected to swell for anniversary events through October. But the glorious groves of ancient sequoias, spectacular waterfalls and 750 miles of trails that are now Yosemite National Park's 1,200 square miles are a joy for travelers to visit any time of year.

"About a month from the 2014 midterm elections House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was already predicting a sweep for her party in the 2016 election. Referring to Republicans, Pelosi said, ""Their days are numbered.  I know that in two years there will be a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President."" Pelosi has publicly urged former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run for president and said if Clinton does decide to run she would win. While she was clearly looking ahead the top House Democrat was careful not to concede the election this November.  Pressed about the prediction she made earlier this summer that her party would pick up the 17 seats they would need to regain the majority in the House, Pelosi replied, ""I think we will do OK."" Pelosi brushed off the negative attack ads featuring her image in several House races, but said she was ""offended"" by what the GOP was saying about President Barack Obama on the campaign trail. The California Democrat seemed more than happy that Republicans are again using a strategy from previous election cycles to try and tie vulnerable House Democrats to her, remarking, ""oh my goodness, they've helped me raise money every time."" Asked about her personal political plans given her confidence of a Democratic takeover on Capitol Hill, Pelosi pointed out she was already running for re-election in 2014.  But when asked whether she intended to remain in her top leadership position beyond the 2016 election, she told reporters she had to check with her husband first.","Pelosi says ""there will be a Democratic Congress and a Democratic President.""

"The U.S. Senate gave final approval Thursday to a roughly 1,200-page bill that promises to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986, creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents while ratcheting up security along the Mexican border. Senators passed the sweeping legislation -- initially drafted by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the chamber's so-called ""Gang of Eight"" -- by a 68-32 vote. Fourteen Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in supporting the bill, which is backed by the White House and has the potential to become the crowning legislative achievement of President Barack Obama's second term. In a White House statement, Obama hailed the Senate vote as ""a critical step"" toward fixing what he called a broken immigration system. He labeled the measure that now goes to the Republican-controlled House a compromise, adding that ""we just need Congress to finish the job."" The Senate vote included a rare adherence to old-fashioned protocol. Vice President Joe Biden presided in his constitutional capacity as head of the Senate, and senators voted one-by-one from their desks, calling out ""aye"" or ""no."" Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas broke the drama of the moment when he mistakenly voted ""aye,"" then quickly asked the clerk to make it ""no"" as the chamber erupted in laughter. Biden tapped his gavel and called for order. Before announcing the result, Biden warned against outbursts from the public gallery, but chants of ""Yes we can"" and ""Si se puede"" broke out after he read the tally. Biden called for the sergeant at arms to restore order. ""Today is another historic day in the Senate,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont.  ""This legislation will reunite families.  It will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal system.  It will spur job growth and reduce our deficit.  And it will make us safer."" ""The time has come to act in the interest of all Americans,"" declared Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, a member of the Gang of Eight. ""I hope that message will be heard loud and clear in the House (of Representatives)."" Historic ruling opens door for immigration for same-sex spouses . Most congressional conservatives, however, remain staunchly opposed to the measure, and have declared it dead on arrival in the House. Obama warned in his statement that opponents of immigration reform will try even harder to derail it. Noting the broad support for the Senate bill from the business community, organized labor and others, he urged people to contact their House representatives and ""tell them to do the right thing."" Republicans are sharply divided over the politically sensitive issue. In the wake of the GOP's crushing loss among Hispanics in the 2012 election, many top voices in the party have pushed for an endorsement of some form of a path to citizenship for the country's roughly 11 million undocumented residents. ""No one should dispute (that) like every sovereign nation on this planet, we have a right to control who comes in. But unlike other countries, we are not afraid of people coming in here from other places,"" said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the Gang of Eight and a potential 2016 presidential candidate. ""I support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants, but because I believe in America even more."" For many of the GOP's strongest supporters, any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally is a form of unforgivable amnesty. They also don't trust the Obama administration to fully enact the bill's new border security measures, which are generally opposed by progressives. ""There's just no way I can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that today's assurances won't become tomorrow's disappointments,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""We'll never resolve the immigration problem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can prove that the border is secure as a condition of legalization."" Senate takes another step toward passing immigration reform . Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, called the vote on the measure ""largely symbolic"" and predicted the bill would ultimately be relegated to the ""ash heap of history."" If enacted, the measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America's farms. A recently added border security amendment -- introduced by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee -- would require 20,000 more border agents, complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The amendment also strengthens eligibility verification and border entry-exit controls. Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security. While Corker's and Hoeven's change appeared to sway some reticent Republicans in the Senate, top House Republicans remained opposed the overall blueprint. ""Apparently some haven't gotten the message: the House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes,"" said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""We're going to do our own bill ... and move the legislation that reflects the will of our majority and the will of the American people."" House Republicans have indicated their intention to tackle the issue with several smaller proposals instead of one larger bill. Boehner repeated his pledge to block a vote on any immigration measure that doesn't have the support of a majority of House Republicans. Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House if brought to a vote, with a united Democratic caucus joined by some Republicans. The speaker also refused to take a position on whether or not there should be some kind of path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally. Democrats have repeatedly warned they will not agree to a plan that lacks such a path. Regardless, Boehner said he hopes the House will deal with immigration reform this year. ""I have made it clear since the day after the election that this political football should stop, and that the Congress should deal with this issue,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits the White House next week, he will carry with him grand hopes for a re-energized partnership between his country and the United States. Fresh off a landslide victory in the Indian elections, Modi has seized an outright majority in parliament and a mandate for sweeping domestic reform. For years, the former chief minister of Gujarat faced an American visa ban due to his alleged role in violent riots. Now, the new premier's visit represents a key opportunity to recharge a critical bilateral relationship. It's one the United States and India should seize. Routinely described as ""natural allies,"" India and the United States have over the past year seemed more like estranged partners, united more by a sense of dashed expectations than by a shared approach to common challenges. India's economy, which grew 7.4% annually between 2000 and 2011, fell to 4.5% growth in 2012 and has rebounded only slightly since. The economic slowdown prompted a more inward focus in New Delhi and questions in Washington about India's ability to generate national power. At the same time, key agreements went unsigned or unfulfilled, including a landmark civil nuclear accord, defense pacts aimed at deepening security cooperation and a stalled bilateral investment treaty. Indian government officials expressed worry about Obama's stated commitment to withdraw all troops from Afghanistan; Americans had their own concerns about India's disinclination to apply sanctions on Iran. The fallout from the December 2013 arrest in New York of India's deputy counsel general brought relations to a new low. Albright: Why Modi visit crucial for U.S., India, world . Nevertheless, the strategic logic compelling closer bilateral ties remains sound. The United States and India share interests, including ensuring a stable Asian balance of power, expanding economic relations, preserving access to the global commons, countering terrorism, expanding access to energy sources and supporting the expansion of human rights. India and the United States view similarly the challenge posed by China's rise, seeking strong economic ties with China and good diplomatic relations with Beijing while hedging by strengthening relations with other regional powers -- including each other. Stronger ties with India signal that the United States remains committed to an enduring presence in Asia and helps ensure that China ascends in a region where the great democratic powers are also strong. Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the underlying strategic rationale for closer partnership, American and Indian leaders have too frequently sounded more romantic than realistic about the possibilities. Rarely does a speech lack either a reference to the natural affinities between the ""world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy"" or high-flying rhetoric about the ease with which ""natural allies"" should work together. But invoking such romance risks raising expectations of effortless achievement, as if the compelling logic of two liberty-loving great powers working in harmony is itself sufficient to propel the relationship forward. The reality is more difficult and continuing to build a true strategic partnership will take senior-level ownership, hard work and the expenditure of diplomatic capital. Modi's visit should mark a new step toward that goal. An ambitious but realistic agenda of deepened political, economic and security ties would reverberate in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. As the two country's leaders chart the next phase of the U.S.-India relationship, they should outline a path forward that encompasses new activity in a broad range of areas. Boosting economic and defense ties and enhancing regional cooperation should be at the top of the agenda. In practical terms, Washington and New Delhi should press ahead to complete their bilateral investment treaty negotiations, for instance, seek a resolution to their differences at the World Trade Organization and jump start trade liberalization talks. They should complete the implementation of the civil nuclear agreement and renew and expand their defense framework agreement, which expires next year. And they should deepen regional cooperation, including through dialogue on the shape of Afghanistan after the 2016 withdrawal of American troops and by reviving the U.S.-India-Japan-Australia Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Modi's visit to the United States represents an important opportunity to rejuvenate bilateral ties after a period of malaise and inattention. Once the pomp and ceremony of the visit have passed, the two countries must ensure that it does not represent a one-off attempt but rather the beginning of renewed attention to a relationship that requires constant tending. In so doing, they can deepen the transformation of relations between two great powers, anchor an Asian balance of power, spur growth in both countries and smooth the rise of the world's largest democracy. In a world awash with intractable challenges, this is an investment worth making.","Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the United States .

"(CNN)The Manhattan clinic that treated comedian Joan Rivers before her death made a number of serious mistakes, including failing to identify deteriorating vital signs, and providing timely intervention, according to a report released Monday. The report, issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a federal agency, did not mention Rivers by name, but referred an 81-year-old female, or Patient #1. The description of that patient and the procedures she underwent match what's known about Rivers, including her age and the date of her appointment. CMS declined to say whether the patient referenced in the report is Rivers. The famed 81-year-old entertainer died September 4, a week after an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. Among the major errors CMS found the clinic committed are: . -- Failing to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention; . -- Failing to record Rivers' weight, prior to the administration of medication for sedation; . -- Failing to consistently document the dose of Propofol, a sedative, administered; . -- Failing to get Rivers' informed consent for each procedure performed; . -- Failing to ensure that she was cared for only by physicians granted privilege in accordance with the clinic's bylaws; . -- And finally, failing to abide by its own cell phone policy (the report found that a photograph was taken of a surgeon and Rivers while she was under sedation). Yorkville Endoscopy released a statement in response to the report, saying it has been cooperative and already taken steps to correct the situation. ""In response to the statement of deficiencies, Yorkville immediately submitted and implemented a plan of correction that addressed all issues raised. The regulatory agencies are currently reviewing the corrective plan of action and have been in regular contact with Yorkville. ""In addition, the physicians involved in the direct care and treatment referenced in the report no longer practice or provide services at Yorkville,"" it said. Rivers' appointment at the clinic was on August 28. Paramedics rushed Rivers from the clinic to New York's Mount Sinai Hospital a mile away, where she was kept on life support until she died a week later. Her daughter, Melissa, ""is terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings on the part of medical personnel and the clinic as evidenced by the CMS report,"" according to a statement from her attorneys. ""As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure,"" it read. The New York medical examiner ruled last month that Rivers died of ""therapeutic complications"" during a procedure to evaluate her ""voice changes"" and stomach reflux. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","Rivers, 81, died a week after an appointment at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The mayor of West Hollywood has condemned a Halloween display resembling Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin hanging by a noose. A Halloween display resembling Sarah Palin hanging in West Hollywood. The life-size doll with a white noose around its neck is outfitted to look like Palin -- with a beehive wig, glasses and a red business suit. It hangs in front of the North Orange Grove Avenue house of the display's creator, Chad Michael Morrisette, who also put up a depiction of Republican presidential candidate John McCain engulfed in flames. Mayor Jeffry Prang asked in a statement that the display be taken down and said: ""I respect that we all have the right to freedom of speech. However, with that right comes responsibility"". ""While these residents have the legal right to display Senator John McCain and Governor Sarah Palin in effigy, I strongly oppose political speech that references violence -- real or perceived,"" he added. The effigy resembling McCain appears to emerge from the house's chimney with paper flames around it. Both displays are clearly visible from the street and attract locals and tourists to take pictures. However not all locals --- Republican or Democrat -- are charmed by the somewhat provocative dolls. One, who identified himself to CNN affiliate KCAL-TV in Los Angeles only as ""George,"" said the display takes the spirit of Halloween ""too far."" What do you think, tell us below. Morissette does admit that if he had put up a display resembling Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama hanging from a noose, ""people would've probably thrown things through our windows."" ""The image of a hanged black man is a lot more intense than the image of a hanged white woman -- for our country, in the history of our country,"" he explained to KCAL. Morrisette said he wants the display viewed as art that is appropriate for the holiday. ""It is Halloween. It's time to be scary. Its time to be spooky,"" he said. Mayor Prang's statement, without naming Morrisette by name, asked that residents find ""more constructive ways to express their opinion.

"(CNN) -- Should we worry about mission creep? Only one week after President Obama said that he would not send combat troops to fight ISIS, Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate that U.S. forces could ""accompany Iraqi forces in attacks"" if the situation deteriorated. As President Obama prepares to address the United Nations General Assembly this Wednesday, Americans are naturally wondering where this will all end. Some have raised the specter of Vietnam. After all, President John F. Kennedy sent fewer advisors to Vietnam during his presidency than President Obama is sending to Syria right now. James Carafano, a former Army officer at the American Heritage Foundation, said that ""this is reminiscent of how we got involved in Vietnam."" Mission creep is possible, and indeed it's likely to happen. Whenever the United States commits any human capital to a conflict of this size, complexity and danger, the pressure to intensify the nation's commitment is bound to increase. The President has already sent about 1,600 advisors. If someone is killed, it would be hard for the United States not to respond. If the situation on the ground becomes worse, it would be difficult for the President to do nothing given that he has now acknowledged that ISIS is a big problem that requires the intervention of the United States. But that does not mean that this will become another Vietnam. Often, the legitimate and necessary warnings about what can go wrong overstate the risks of intervention and miss the ways in which our political environment has changed since the 1960s, in a way that makes the massive and ultimately futile ground war of Vietnam more difficult to replicate. Back in the 1960s, the United States had a peacetime draft. The system, put in place in 1940, offered presidents a virtually unending source of military personnel that they could tap into when going to war. Although Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were cognizant of the political costs of drafting Americans into war, the system still provided a huge resource that could be put into place quickly. Congress dismantled the draft in 1973, shifting to the use of a professional army, and forever changed the capacity of the president to mobilize large ground forces. With a professional military any president has a more finite number of resources. There's also less money for any large scale mobilization. During the 1960s and early 1970s, the statutory income tax rates were much higher than today, reaching over 90% for the highest wage earners. A vibrant period of economic growth meant that incomes were rising and relatively more tax revenue came into Treasury. This is no longer the case. One of the biggest effects of the conservative movement in American politics, starting with Ronald Reagan's tax cut in 1981, has been to systematically whittle away at the level of tax resources. Tax rates have steady declined. Conservatives have also been extraordinarily effective at making tax increases taboo, so much that even Democrats have shied away from this policy. When the United States went to war against Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, President George W. Bush cut taxes even further, abandoning the tradition of raising taxes in time of war. This is a far way off from when FDR's Treasury Department commissioned Disney films during World War II to convince Americans to pay higher taxes to defeat Germany and Japan. So too has the growth of pre-committed spending programs such as Medicare and Social Security that consume more of the federal budget and leave less discretionary spending for politicians to play around with in any given year. The kind of wars America fights have also changed with new kinds of military technology that have developed along with the sophistication of special operation forces. While the promise that new technology will save the nation from ground wars is not new, right now it is increasingly fulfilled. The use of drones, for example, has proven incredibly potent at attacking the terrorist networks responsible for 9/11. Special operations forces have also become increasingly sophisticated and capable of conducting the kind of targeted, small-scale operations that are at the heart of breaking up terrorist operations. In the coming months, this kind of warfare will make it possible to combat ISIS without sizable number of boots on the ground. This is certainly not a guarantee that the need for troops won't intensify, as was the case in Iraq, but it does offer an important alternative for the time being. Another reason that it is harder to have another Vietnam, or Iraq and Afghanistan, for that matter, is because of those wars. All of them now loom large in the mind of the public. Those wars shape every conversation, creating ongoing political concern about every military intervention -- and political pushback as things get messy. While policymakers in the 1960s remembered the stalemate in Korea they also spoke about the victories of World War II. The current generation of politicians and voters has grown up in the shadows of unsuccessful and messy wars. The only conflicts that seemed to have a better outcome were Operation Desert Storm and the bombing of Bosnia and Kosovo in the 1990s -- all short-term, limited conflicts. Finally, the nature of this conflict is different than what the United States faced in Vietnam. The conflict against terrorism is not simply about a brute response to ground troops. As most policymakers realize, this is a war that revolves around improving intelligence, implementing policies to win over the minds of local populations so that terrorists do not gain hold in communities and stopping the flow of financial resources that keep these networks alive. Much of the victory will require a political solution. A massive infusion of American troops won't have the impact that is needed, and in some ways given the opposition that exists toward western intervention, too many troops could make things worse by rallying Iraqis and Syrians against the United States rather than ISIS. None of this is to say that this war won't get bigger and that it can't get much uglier quickly. But the fact is we are a long way away from Vietnam, and some of the institutional and cultural changes that have taken place -- as a result of that disastrous war -- have created a set of handcuffs on elected officials that won't be easily removed.","Some fear the fight against ISIS could expand via ""mission creep""

"Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales won passage Tuesday in the House of  Commons. The vote was 366 for, 161 against. The bill now goes to the House of Lords, where it will face further opposition. A rebellion within Prime Minister David Cameron's Conservative Party threatened to derail the bill. Tuesday brought the second day of discussions on the legislation. Members of Parliament voted Monday on a series of amendments to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. Cameron backs the bill but his commitment to it has put him at odds with many in his own party and its grassroots supporters. The Conservatives govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The bill was kept on track Monday thanks to the support of members of the opposition Labour Party, who voted to oppose an amendment that many Conservative rebels backed. Same-sex marriage: Who will legalize it next? The amendment, which was put forward by MP Tim Loughton, proposed extending civil partnerships to heterosexual couples as well as same-sex couples. Minister for Women and Equalities Maria Miller, the sponsor of the same-sex marriage bill, argued that this would result in significant expense and delay, thus derailing the whole bill. Labour leader Ed Miliband tweeted Monday: ""David Cameron's inability to control his party must not be allowed to wreck the Equal Marriage Bill. Labour's commitment unwavering."" A law recognizing civil partnerships in England and Wales was passed in 2004. The Church of England is among the religious bodies opposed to the new legislation. The issue of same-sex marriage has exposed painful divisions within Cameron's party, with many lawmakers already fractious over his position on Europe. Under pressure, Cameron's government last week published a draft bill promising a referendum by 2017 on Britain's membership of the European Union. The Conservative Party faces a political threat from the UK Independence Party, which has vowed to take Britain out of Europe. Controversy has also blown up following weekend UK media reports that quoted a senior ally of Cameron describing party activists as ""swivel-eyed loons."" In an effort to dampen the flames, Cameron sent an e-mail late Monday to party supporters, according to UK media reports, saying he was proud of their work and would ""never have around me those who sneered"" at them. Same-sex marriage around the world . The issue of same-sex marriage has also prompted wide disagreement elsewhere. On Saturday, French President Francois Hollande signed into law a bill allowing marriage and adoption for same-sex couples despite vocal opposition from many conservatives and the Catholic Church. The step made France the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage. If Uruguay and New Zealand enact legislation approved by their lawmakers as expected, the count of nations worldwide allowing same-sex marriage will rise to 14. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001, with others following suit in Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. Argentina was the first Latin American nation to legalize such marriages, in 2010. Other countries on the list are Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Many countries remain split over the issue. A Brazilian court this week issued a directive removing a barrier that had limited same-sex marriage, but no bill has made it through Congress. In the United States, the question went before the Supreme Court and justices are deliberating over the matter. Twelve U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage. On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying. UK lawmakers approve same-sex marriage in first vote .

"(CNN)The new Greek government suspended competition in the top-flight Super League indefinitely after violence at a weekend match between the top two football clubs in the country. Sunday's game between bitter Athens city rivals Panathinaikos and away team Olympiakos was marred by a pitch invasion despite a heavy police presence. The players and officials of Super League leader Olympiakos were also pelted with various projectiles and flares amid ugly scenes. None of its fans attended after a previous league ruling which was put in place with the aim of avoiding confrontation at games. Panathinaikos won the so-called ""Derby of the Eternal Enemies"" 2-1 to cut the gap at the top to just three points, but the focus of attention after the clash was on the continued troubles. A Super League board meeting Tuesday to discuss the issue also saw an unsavory confrontation between representatives of the two clubs, with a reported brawl. Following these incidents, the ruling Syriza Party has made its decision to impose a suspension, which will be the third team this season that Greek football has been halted. ""We are at the beginning of the end... everyone must understand that soccer with violence, irrationality and savagery cannot continue any longer,"" said Deputy Sports Minister Stavros Kontonis, the Greek sports minister, told reporters.

Back in September a ban was put in place after the death of a fan following clash between supporters of two third-flight teams Ethnikos Piraeus and Irodotos.

""If the situation remains the same there will not be games again the following Sunday. We hope everything we discussed will be implemented,"" he added. In a statement on the official Super League website, Borovilos admitted solutions needed to be found to ""chronic problems"" afflicting the game.

"A small mammal with fluffy red-orange fur, a short bushy tail, and an adorable rounded face has leapt onto the raccoon family tree. Scientists at the Smithsonian in Washington announced Thursday the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe). If you're a fan of long technical names, this one is Bassaricyon neblina. Such a discovery is rare. The olinguito is the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the Americas in 35 years, according to Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. His research group's study on the creature is being published in the journal ZooKeys. Researchers argue that the olinguito should be considered the smallest living member of the raccoon family, which includes other animals that make us go ""awww"" such as coatis and kinkajous. The Smithsonian describes the olinguito's appearance as a cross between a house cat and a teddy bear. Cats, bears, and olinguitos belong to the Carnivora order. This animal had been seen before by humans, Helgen said, but it had been ""a case of mistaken identity."" ""It was in museums, it's been in zoos, and its DNA had even been sequenced, but no one had connected the pieces and looked close enough to realize, basically, the significance of this remarkable and this beautiful animal,"" Helgen said. Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said. Olingos are larger, less furry and have longer faces than the newly discovered species. Tracking the olinguito . Helgen began his detective work in pursuit of the new species when he set out about a decade ago to comprehensive study of olingos. Behind the scenes at the Chicago Field Museum in 2003, he remembers pulling out a drawer of skins and skulls that didn't look like any animal he had ever seen before, or that had been reported by zoologists. The teeth and skull were smaller and shaped differently than olingos, and the coat was denser. Records indicated to Helgen that such specimens came from the northern Andes about 5,000 to 9,000 feet above sea level, which is much higher than olingo habitats. Helgen and colleagues worked with Miguel Pinto, a zoologist in Ecuador, who had shot a few seconds of video that appeared to depict the animal. They teamed up in Ecuador in 2006, using Pinto's knowledge of cloud forest habitats to pick the best spots to investigate. Cloud forests are ""cloaked in fog,"" Helgen said. On their very first night on the pursuit, the team found a real, living olinguito. Seeing the fluffy tree-dweller for the first time, Helgen felt ""sheer elation, just incredible excitement but at the same time almost disbelief. This animal had been missed by everyone."" Even people who live in the Andes had the same confusion about olinguitos being olingos, because humans don't hunt them and the creatures stay in the trees, Helgen said. Ancient primate could be a missing link . How it lives . The researchers found out that the olinguito primarily eats fruits, but also insects and nectar, and its activity is mostly at night. The animal lives in the trees and can jump from one to another. Mothers raise a single baby at a time. At about 2.5 feet long from nose tip to tail tip, the olinguito weighs about 2 pounds and is a little smaller than a house cat. DNA analysis confirmed that while olinguitos and olingos both belong to the raccoon family, they are ""sister groups,"" in the same way that humans are closely related to chimpanzees. The olinguito's misty high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, have helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists until now, Helgen said. It turns out, according to Helgen, there are four subspecies of olinguitos, differing in color -- shades of reds, orange and browns -- and size and living in various sections of the Andes. New species of mice, bats and shrews are more commonly discovered, but these animals are tiny and hard to tell apart, Helgen said. Prior to the olinguito, the most recent mammal to be discovered in the Americas was a small weasel from the Andes -- the same area and habitat where the olinguitos live, he said. ""It shows us that there's a long way to go to exploring the whole world, but especially maybe these cloud forests,"" Helgen said. More olinguitos may be found in other South American countries with cloud forests in the future, according to the Smithsonian. The olinguito is not yet considered an endangered species, but there are threats to its home environment, Helgen said. Many have such forests been chopped down. ""We also kind of hope that in telling this story to the world about the olinguito, that this beautiful new animal serves as something of an ambassador for those embattled cloud forest habitats."" The zoo olinguito . Helgen's group has ""discovered"" the olinguito, but it been evolving as an independent species for about 3 to 4 million years, he said. One olinguito whose history Helgen's group studied was exhibited in the United States during its lifetime as if it were an olingo. The creature came from the mountains of Colombia to the Louisville Zoo in 1967, courtesy of a German couple with a love of raccoon family members, Helgen said. It was also in the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington and the Bronx Zoo, where it passed away. DNA from this olinguito shows that it is clearly not an olingo, Helgen said. The wife of the animal's keeper told Helgen, ""We always thought there was something strange about that olingo,"" he said. She told Helgen this particular animal moved from zoo to zoo because she wouldn't breed with the olingos around her. ""It wasn't because she was fussy, it was because she was not at all even the same species,"" Helgen said.

"(CNN) -- Iceland will close two airports on Friday for the first time, a week after ash from an Icelandic volcano forced the shutdown of airspace over much of Europe and stranded thousands of passengers around the world, the Icelandic aviation authority announced Thursday. The Keflavik International Airport and Reykjavík International Airport will be closed beginning early Friday morning, the aviation authority said, according to a statement on the Keflavik airport's website. Though the ash cloud originated in Iceland, the country's airports have been spared from closure until now. Strong northwest winds had been blowing ash from the volcano, in the south of Iceland, out to sea and over Europe. ""Now the winds have died down, and the cloud is lingering around Iceland,"" said Chris Almond, a forecaster with Britain's Met Office, the nation's national weather service. Two other Icelandic international airports, in Akureyri and Egilsstadir, will stay open to all air traffic, the aviation authority said. The ash cloud is not expected to reach those cities, which are in the north and east of the island nation. Icelandair announced Thursday that trans-Atlantic passengers from the U.S. and Europe who would have stopped in Keflavik will be rerouted Friday via Glasgow, Scotland. Icelandair said that passengers traveling to and from Iceland will have the option of being re-routed through the Akureyri airport, a four-hour drive from Reykjavík. The airline is arranging bus travel between Akureyri airport and the Reykjavík Bus Terminal. Elsewhere in Europe, most airports appeared to be open on Thursday and are expected to be open Friday. But the cloud still caused flight disruptions Thursday. The British Ministry of Defence temporarily suspended non-essential flying Thursday after volcanic ash was found on some of its Typhoon fast jets. The closure of so much European airspace for nearly a week left untold numbers of travelers stranded, and it's not clear how long it will take to get everyone home. Many airlines added or rearranged flights to try to clear the backlog. At its peak, the crisis affected 1.2 million passengers a day and 29 percent of all global aviation, according to the International Air Transport Association. It was the worst disruption of air traffic since the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001. Following those attacks, the United States closed its air space for three days, forcing Europe to postpone all transatlantic flights. The International Air Transport Association estimated earlier this week that the Icelandic volcano crisis cost airlines more than $1.7 billion in lost revenue through Tuesday. The crisis began after the volcano beneath the Eyjafjallajokull glacier erupted April 14 and sent a cloud of ash into the atmosphere. By the next day that cloud had reached Europe, where authorities quickly closed the airspace over safety fears. By Tuesday, however, airlines had started to complain that the measures were too restrictive. Ash levels in most parts of Europe, they said, were low enough to allow the safe operation of flights. Scientists in Iceland said Wednesday the volcano has decreased its ash output by 80 percent compared to the first day of eruption. Armann Hoskuldsson, a volcanologist at the University of Iceland, told a briefing that the volcano's output is now ""insignificant,"" though it will continue to be active for a while. That reduction in volcanic activity appeared to be the main reason that flights resumed operating in Europe on Wednesday, along with European countries relaxing their restrictions on flight, according to a spokeswoman for Eurocontrol, an intergovernmental body that manages European air travel. In Britain, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) issued revised guidance on flying through volcano ash clouds, allowing airlines to conduct their own risk assessments and requiring them to report any ash damage to the authorities. The 27 countries of the European Union also agreed with Eurocontrol to split the airspace into zones based on their ash content and to allow flights in the unaffected areas, said Spanish Minister of Public Works Jose Blanco. ""Airspace was being closed based on theoretical models, not on facts,"" said Giovanni Bisignani, director general and CEO of International Air Transport Association. ""Test flights by our members showed that the models were wrong.""","Keflavik International Airport, Reykjavík International Airport will be closed Friday .

"A 14-year-old boy is being hailed as a hero in Pakistan for tackling a suicide bomber -- dying at the main gate of his school and saving schoolmates gathered for their morning assembly. Ninth-grader Aitazaz Hassan Bangash was on his way to the Ibrahimzai School on Monday in the Hangu district of northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province when the bomber, dressed in a school uniform, asked him where the school was, the teen's cousin told CNN. Aitazaz and his cousin, Musadiq Ali Bangash, became suspicious, Musadiq said. ""The other students backed off, but Aitazaz challenged the bomber and tried to catch him. During the scuffle, the bomber panicked and detonated his bomb,"" he said. Rajab Ali, who also witnessed the bombing, told CNN that he saw Aitazaz throw a large stone at a boy trying to enter the school. The blast happened when Aitazaz grabbed him, he said. Aitazaz and the bomber died at the scene. Witnesses say the blast injured two other people. Iftikhar Ahmed, a Hangu district police officer, confirmed the details of the attack to CNN. Hangu is a troubled district bordering Pakistan's tribal areas. It is rife with sectarian violence, with attacks against Shia and Sunni Muslims. ""It was a great sacrifice to save the lives of hundreds of both Shia and Sunni students, who were in morning assembly,"" Musadiq said. Aitazaz is survived by his father, Mujaad Ali Bangash, a laborer; his elder brother, Mustajab Hassan Bangash, a student in Pakistan; and three sisters. Local residents such as Nawaz Khan are calling for Aitazaz to receive a posthumous award for his bravery. ""He saved the lives of hundreds of students. He deserves more recognition than Malala Yousafzai,"" he said. Pakistanis are comparing him to Malala, the schoolgirl shot by the Taliban in October 2012 for promoting education for all boys and girls. Pakistanis on social media are praising Aitazaz's bravery, with people on Twitter asking everyone to use hastags #onemillionaitzazs or simply #aitzaz and calling for his heroism to be recognized with an award.

"The weddings have happened -- but will they count? A day after a federal judge struck down a Michigan state amendment restricting marriage to between one man and one woman, gay and lesbian couples lined up Saturday to make their unions official. ""We never thought that we'd see this day,"" said Ann Watson, who wed her partner of more than 23 years. ""In that sense, it's amazing."" Watson -- who works for Turner Broadcasting System, an entity that includes CNN -- and her partner were one of 57 couples to get same-sex marriage licenses in Ingham County, according to county clerk Barb Byrum. Byrum, a Democrat elected to the county clerk post, said that she personally performed 30 ceremonies in Mason. ""Today was an awesome day,"" Byrum tweeted. Not all county clerks followed suit by taking the abnormal step of opening up their offices on a weekend. But there were a few others, such as in Oakland County, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. There, in Pontiac, Frank Colasonti and James Ryder arrived early for the chance to marry after 26 years together. Colasonti told WDIV that ""we wanted to get married as soon as possible"" in the wake of the court ruling issued late Friday afternoon. Their motivation was simple: ""We love each other, and we want to make sure that we protect each other."" As to being among the first gay couples married in Michigan, Colasonti said, ""It's historic, and we're glad we're a part of it. And we are just happy."" There's a chance that their marriage could be among the last, too. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette, a Republican whose term expires later this year, announced on Friday evening he'd filed an emergency request for U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman's order to be stayed and appealed. ""In 2004, the citizens of Michigan recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable,"" Schuette said. ""Michigan voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution, and their will should stand and be respected."" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order Saturday to temporarily stay through at least Wednesday the decision by Friedman. In its brief order, the court explained that it did so ""to allow a more reasoned consideration of the motion to stay."" Earlier, the same court had said that those opposed to Schuette's request have until noon Tuesday to respond. It's not immediately clear what will happen, then, with the same-sex marriages that took place earlier Saturday. Watson said she isn't surprised by the stay and is bracing for the idea she and Sherman won't immediately have full benefits available to them in Michigan -- though she expects that, at least, they'll now have federal benefits available to marriage same-sex couples. ""It is what we expected,"" Watson said. ""We know that we are on the right side of history."" In fact, Friedman's ruling was the latest in a series of recent district judge decisions -- which have also affected Texas, Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Utah -- striking down state laws restricting marriage to one man and one woman. Judges later issued stays of those decisions until higher courts weigh in. Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond's law school, explained that appellate judges must weigh in on all these cases. The Supreme Court likely won't add its input until its next term, which starts in October. Still, the trend in the courts -- which also happens to mirror that in public opinion polls -- so far is clear. ""It's all in one direction right now,"" Tobias said. Regardless of the fact her situation is in limbo, Watson and her partner are celebrating, nonetheless. They have family members expressing joy and solidarity along with them, such as a brother-in-law who noted the two are finally ""acting out what's been in place for years."" But most importantly, they have their 16-year-old daughter to savor the moment with -- who they were able to jointly adopt years ago in Georgia and who was at her parents' wedding ceremony in Mason. ""She's excited about it,"" Watson said.","Woman married in Michigan says she expected the stay .

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN)  -- The Honduran government extended a nationwide curfew to 36 hours Tuesday, as the country awaits the consequence of the surprise return of deposed President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Honduran troops surround the Brazilian Embassy in the capital, Tegucigalpa, on Tuesday. Zelaya, a centrist whose politics took a strong turn to the left once in office, was ousted in a coup on June 28. Despite increasing political, diplomatic and economic isolation, the government of interim President Roberto Micheletti has steadfastly resisted pressure to allow Zelaya to return to power. Micheletti maintains that Zelaya's removal was not a coup but a constitutional transfer of power, and Micheletti thwarted two very public attempts by Zelaya to return to his homeland. When Zelaya suddenly appeared inside the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Tegucigalpa on Monday, it caught everyone by surprise, even the Brazilians, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Luiz Nunes Amorim told CNN en Español. In response, Micheletti's government ordered a curfew beginning Monday evening. Many pro-Zelaya supporters ignored the call and demonstrated outside of the Brazilian embassy. Police dispersed about 2,500 demonstrators without causing any deaths, Micheletti said in a televised statement Tuesday. But a doctor said that at least 80 people were admitted to an area hospital with injuries, Marcial Torres, a Honduran journalist for the newspaper La Tribuna, told CNN. Most were released from the hospital Tuesday afternoon, Torres said. After the curfew was announced Monday, the government extended it once until Tuesday evening and then again to 6 a.m. Wednesday. The result was a nearly-deserted city blanketed by what Torres called a ""tense calm."" Uncertainty was fueling the tension in Honduras, Torres said -- uncertainty about what Zelaya, who said he returned for ""homeland, restitution or death,"" has planned, and how Micheletti, who has held his ground against international pressure, will respond. ""The country is paralyzed,"" Torres said. Supermarkets, banks, gas stations and public transpiration were all closed because of the curfew. Schools and universities also closed. Police and soldiers maintained a security cordon around the Brazilian embassy, dispersing supporters of Zelaya -- who remained holed up inside the embassy. All flights in and out of the country were canceled Tuesday, after all four of Honduras' international airports were also closed. Micheletti's government isolated the Brazilian embassy by cutting water, power and phone lines to the building, U.S. Department of State spokesman Ian Kelly confirmed to reporters in Washington. Nunes Amorim, the Brazilian foreign minister, said the action was a ""very serious"" move by Micheletti that violated international law. But police claimed utilities were turned off in the area surrounding the embassy to discourage looting. About 100 people remained inside the embassy Tuesday night, many of them supporters and friends of Zelaya, Nunes Amorim said. The Brazilian foreign minister said he spoke with Zelaya and asked him not to use inflammatory language. Likewise, Kelly said, ""The United States calls on all parties to remain calm and avoid actions that might provoke violence in Honduras and place individuals at risk or harm. We urge that all parties refrain from actions that would lead to further unrest."" Kelly said the American embassy in Tegucigalpa had closed because of the situation, but that U.S. diplomats remained in contact with both sides in the conflict. Food delivered to the Brazilian embassy Tuesday was believed to have been brought by the Americans, Torres said. The United States and Brazil said they support dialogue between the two sides, centered on the San Jose Accord, an agreement negotiated by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. But in an interview with local network Televicentro, Micheletti said that Zelaya's sudden appearance would not revive negotiations. Micheletti's government sent a letter to the Brazilian authorities on Tuesday asking them either to give Zelaya asylum in their country or to turn him over to Honduran authorities. Zelaya faces charges of violating the constitution relating to a proposed referendum that was at the center of his ouster. ""Unless the government of Brazil proposes another solution, its obligation is to turn him over to the relevant Honduran authorities with urgency,"" the letter said. Earlier in the day, local television footage showed video of water cannons being used to scatter Zelaya supporters and the ousted president's backers throwing rocks and other objects at police. The demonstrators flipped over and burned a police vehicle, said El Heraldo newspaper, which showed a photograph of an overturned truck on its Web page. Zelaya was removed by soldiers in a coup June 28 after he tried to hold an election that day on a measure to allow a president to run for a second consecutive term. The measure would have asked Hondurans whether they wanted to place a referendum on the November presidential ballot, which would convene a constitutional assembly to consider changing presidential term limits. Zelaya's term ends in January and he would not have been subject to any measures adopted by the constitutional assembly. The nation's supreme court ruled the June ballot initiative was illegal and congress had decreed Zelaya couldn't hold it. Micheletti has denied that a coup took place, saying that Zelaya was removed legally through constitutional means. He vowed Monday night to stay in power despite Zelaya's return. It was not publicly known Tuesday how Zelaya got into the country and he declined to provide details, only telling CNN en Español that it was a 15- to 16-hour trip he took ""with the help of Hondurans."" Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report for CNN en Español.","Brazil's Embassy surrounded after Jose Manuel Zelaya's backers dispersed .

"The House of Representatives voted Thursday to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt for refusing to turn over documents tied to the botched Fast and Furious gun-running sting -- a discredited operation that has become a sharp point of contention between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. The House approved a pair of criminal and civil measures against the attorney general, marking the first time in American history that the head of the Justice Department has been held in contempt by Congress. House members approved the criminal contempt measure in a 255-67 vote.  Almost every House Republican backed the measure, along with 17 Democrats.   Shortly thereafter, the civil measure passed in a sharply polarized 258-95 vote. A large number of Democrats -- including members of the Congressional Black Caucus and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi -- walked off the House floor in protest and refused to participate in the criminal contempt vote.  A slightly smaller number of Democrats appeared to boycott the vote on the civil measure as well. Speaking in New Orleans, Holder dismissed the House action as ""the regrettable culmination of what became a misguided -- and politically motivated -- investigation during an election year.""  In a written statement, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer blasted congressional Republicans for pushing ""political theater rather than legitimate congressional oversight."" The criminal contempt charge refers the dispute to District of Columbia U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, who will decide whether to file charges against Holder.  Most legal analysts do not expect Machen -- an Obama appointee who ultimately answers to Holder -- to take any action. The civil measure allows the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to file a lawsuit asking the courts to examine the Justice Department's failure to produce certain subpoenaed documents, as well as the validity of the administration's recent assertion of executive privilege over the documents in question. Executive privilege: A rocky legal and political road in U.S. history . Legal experts contacted by CNN have said, based on recent precedent, that it could take years for the courts to reach any final decision in the civil case. Fast and Furious, a so-called ""gun-walking"" operation, allowed roughly 2,000 guns into Mexico with the goal of tracking them to Mexican drug cartels. Two guns found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's fatal shooting were linked to the operation. Guns from the operation have also been linked to an unknown number of Mexican civilians' deaths. GOP leaders say the documents they seek are needed to get to the circumstances surrounding Terry's death.  Democrats insist the Republican-led probe is all about politics.  Thursday's vote came two days after House Republicans rejected the latest offer by the White House and Justice Department to turn over some of the documents sought by congressional investigators in exchange for dropping the contempt measures. A senior House Republican aide told CNN the offer was insufficient. In the hours leading up to the criminal contempt vote, Republicans repeatedly insisted that they were exercising proper legislative oversight of the executive branch and seeking answers for Terry's family. ""In the real world Americans are expected to comply with subpoenas.  Is the attorney general any different?  No he is not,"" said Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Florida.  ""The attorney general can stonewall all he wants.  The attorney general can misremember all he wants.  But whether he likes it or not, today responsibility will land on his desk."" Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, warned that ""even the attorney general cannot evade the law.  (It's) time for America to find out the truth. ... (It's) time for a little transparency.  Today is judgment day.  That's just the way it is."" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the ""House needs to know how this happened, and it's our constitutional duty to find out. ... No Justice Department is above the law, and no Justice Department is above the Constitution."" Democrats accused Republicans of playing political games with an operation that leaders on both sides of the aisle concede was a mistake. ""What the Republicans are doing with this motion ... is contemptible,"" Pelosi declared.  ""This is something that makes a witch hunt look like a day at the beach.  It is (the) railroading of a resolution that is unsubstantiated by the facts, based on a false premise."" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, complained that ""every single attempt for even-handed investigation has been thwarted by the Republican majority.""  Holder is ""a good, decent, honorable man.  He's doing an excellent job as attorney general.  He does not deserve this."" Among other things, Democrats contend that California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has refused to let witnesses proposed by Democrats give public testimony.  They also claim he has been demanding documents outside the scope of the subpoenas Holder is accused of violating. Specifically, Issa and other Republicans are seeking documents showing why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate a February 2011 letter sent to Congress that denied any major flaws in Operation Fast and Furious. Holder has repeatedly refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and asked Obama last week to assert executive privilege over such documents. Opinion: Holder contempt vote sign of 'broken' Washington? A video released Tuesday by Democrats on Issa's panel showed the chairman making past allegations of White House links to Fast and Furious, juxtaposed with Issa saying Sunday there was no evidence of a White House cover-up. Some gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, maintain that the program allowed hundreds of weapons, including assault rifles, to end up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels in order for the Obama administration to press for new gun control laws.  The NRA heavily pressured House members -- most notably moderate and conservative Democrats -- to back the contempt measures. The contempt vote in Issa's committee last week fell along strict party lines, with Republicans supporting a contempt recommendation and Democrats opposing it.  The vote occurred before the gun lobby formally registered its support for the contempt resolution. Rarely has any pro-gun-rights Democrat representing a rural and Southern district broken with the NRA's position on key votes, especially in an election year. Meanwhile, Pelosi argued last week that Republicans were targeting Holder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November.  Rep. John Larson, D-Connecticut, chastised Republicans earlier this week for pushing ahead on the contempt vote as part of a strategy to prevent economic progress and harm Obama's re-election chances in November. ""This is just all part of a continuing plan, and whether it's suppressing the vote or suppressing the economy -- this obstructionist regime that we see that continues to block because they think they would rather see President Obama fail than the nation succeed,"" Larson said.

"(CNN) -- A Catholic priest, facing criminal charges and a lawsuit alleging that he sexually abused a teenage boy, is now charged with attempting to hire someone to kill the youth, authorities said Tuesday. The Rev. John M. Fiala was in the Dallas County, Texas, jail on Tuesday, charged with one count of criminal solicitation to commit capital murder, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety and the jail's website. He also is charged with two counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child. His bail totals $700,000. Fiala, 52, of Dallas, was out on bond on other sexual assault charges involving the youth, now 18, when he allegedly attempted to negotiate the boy's murder, said Tom Rhodes, the teen's attorney. He was arrested last week after he offered an undercover agent with the Texas Department of Public Safety $5,000 to kill the teen, according to department spokeswoman Lisa Block. ""This guy,"" Edwards County Sheriff Don Letsinger said, ""is an evil man."" A call to Rex Gunter, the defense attorney listed in jail records for Fiala, was not immediately returned Tuesday. The youth met Fiala in 2007, according to Rhodes. The attorney said the priest started ""grooming him,"" buying him gifts including a computer and a car. In early 2008, when the boy was 16, under the guise of providing private catechism lessons, Fiala ""gained access to him and began to sexually abuse him once or twice a month, including on church grounds,"" Rhodes said. At the time, Fiala was administrator of Sacred Heart of Mary in Rocksprings, Texas, which is in Edwards County. The alleged abuse occurred in two counties -- Edwards and Howard -- and included the youth's rape at gunpoint, the attorney said. Fiala allegedly threatened to kill the youth if he told anyone -- threats he repeated in daily text messages, Rhodes said, and Fiala also threatened to kill himself, telling the teen they would ""go to heaven together."" The teen, after struggling with the abuse, told a school counselor, who notified authorities, Rhodes said. He filed suit in April against Fiala, as well as the archdioceses of San Antonio, Texas, and Omaha, Nebraska -- where Fiala was before Texas -- and Fiala's religious order, the Society of Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity, the attorney said. The suit claims that all three covered up Fiala's record of abuse. All three have denied doing so, according to the San Antonio, Texas, Express-News. When former San Antonio Archbishop Jose Gomez and the religious order learned of the police investigation into Fiala's relationship with the teen, he was removed from active ministry in October 2008, the newspaper reported. In September, an Edwards County grand jury indicted Fiala on three counts of aggravated sexual assault of a child and one count of aggravated sexual assault by threat, according to the Express-News. Fiala was arrested in Kansas by a fugitive task force and was extradited to Texas, where he posted bail on September 27, according to the newspaper. He then moved to Dallas County. A grand jury in Howard County handed up an indictment last week on the two aggravated sexual assault charges, the Express-News said. Meanwhile, ""approximately a week ago, we got an anonymous phone call from someone saying, 'Look, I'm living in a building with this guy, and he's talking about killing this young man,' "" Rhodes said. ""Our response was, 'You need to call police.' "" Letsinger said he got a call November 11 from the neighbor. The man at first just told authorities they should ""be looking at this guy,"" the sheriff said, but later said Fiala had offered him $5,000 to kill the teenager. The allegation surprised him, Letsinger said. The Department of Public Safety and its Texas Ranger Division got involved, sending the undercover agent to speak with Fiala, Rhodes said. The conversation was caught on video and audiotape. Rhodes said his client was relieved to hear of Fiala's arrest. He was attending college but had to withdraw and be spirited away somewhere safe because of the threats, he said. ""He's still very afraid, but he is hoping that this time Fiala will stay behind bars,"" Rhodes said. A hearing on the lawsuit was held Monday, he said. The Omaha diocese had argued it should be sued in Nebraska rather than Texas. The judge rejected that argument, Rhodes said. ""I think he's cooked his goose now,"" Letsinger said of Fiala. ""We know that pedophiles sometimes threaten their victims to keep them quiet. But this is kind of an older victim, and you wonder sometimes why they wouldn't come forward. ... I can see now the evil in this guy is pretty bad.""","John Fiala is jailed on $700,000 bail .

"(CNN)You could call it a budding romance with the possibility of a strong, long-lasting relationship. More Americans are riding public transportation. Upwardly trending statistics show it's not just a meaningless crush. These newcomers -- many thought to be in their 20s and 30s and living in the nation's medium-sized cities -- are joining a love affair that rail-riders and strap-hangers in Chicago and the Northeast have known for generations. After decades of embracing car culture, experts report growing movement out of the driver's seat and into transit stations. The change is a reflection of a ""do-more-with-less economy"" where jobs often pay less than they used to and are harder to hold onto. For many, the cost of owning, insuring and maintaining a vehicle outweighs the value of its function. The commuter culture got tired of traffic snarls and parking headaches. We may be seeing a statistical movement partially fueled by a generation that's more concerned than their parents about cutting air pollution. Related story: Opinion: Give up your cars . Dubious? Here are five signs America may be falling in love with public transportation: . 1. More Americans are taking mass transit. Ridership is experiencing a winning streak. The nation is on track to top 2013's annual ridership, which was the highest since 1956. Third-quarter figures released Wednesday from the American Public Transportation Association show rising ridership nationwide for 12 of the past 15 quarters. From July through September of this year, total U.S. trips on commuter rail, subways, buses, streetcars and trolleys topped 2.7 billion. That's an increase of 1.81%. The increases are happening across the country in cities such as Seattle, Minneapolis and Albany, New York, APTA reports. Some cities set records, including St. Petersburg, Florida, as well as Oakland, California. The new figures prove ""a dramatic change in public attitude as more people are demanding public transportation services,"" said  Michael Melaniphy, APTA president and CEO in an e-mail to CNN. And while ridership increases, gasoline prices are plummeting. This week, the national average for a gallon of regular unleaded gas hit $2.55, a five-year low. You might think falling gasoline prices would result in a big ridership drop off as driving suddenly becomes more affordable. But according to a 2012 APTA study, when the cost of fuel goes down, many riders tend to continue using public transit. The drop-off rate from low gas prices doesn't match the ridership increase that happens when gas prices shoot sky-high. 2. Americans are breaking up with their cars. Since 2007, Americans have been driving less, breaking a trend that had been rising for more than two decades. In addition, an October report from consumer group U.S. PIRG shows driving and car ownership is trending down among younger Americans and is likely to keep doing so. Some commuters may be dumping their cars to save money. The public transportation industry says commuters could gain an average annual savings of $9,635 by taking public transit instead of driving. 3. Cities think streetcars and trolleys are totally hot. In Oregon, Portland's success with its streetcars in the early 2000s helped spur similar projects around the nation. New streetcar projects are in service, under construction or being planned in Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Cincinnati; Dallas; Detroit; Kansas City, Missouri; Salt Lake City; Tucson, Arizona; and Washington. Supporters say: . -- Streetcars can create economic growth by attracting shoppers from outlying areas to downtown. -- They're convenient because they're easy on/easy off. -- Tourists love 'em. Critics aren't so sure. They talk about the cost of streetcar infrastructure and they wonder how efficient streetcars can be if ridership isn't constantly high. 4. More city transit centers: New meet markets? Several city planners are pinning their hopes on spectacular new transportation facilities that combine transportation with other activities such as shopping and eating. One of these just opened this month in Anaheim, California. It's called the ARTIC, Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodel Center, KNBC reports. It boasts access to buses and regional and interstate rail lines. It's got bike lockers for the two-wheeled traveler. Price tag: $180 million. Similar facilities are proposed in San Francisco, the Chronicle reports, and in Newport News, Virginia, according to WAVY. Near Denver, a project is under construction which aims to connect the airport, a new Westin hotel and an 82,000-square-foot plaza to the city via a new rail line. Critics fear it will balloon well beyond its $500-million-plus budget, the Denver Post reported. In Denver's Lower Downtown district, the city unveiled its renovated Union Station transportation center earlier this year. It's already been credited with spurring a rise in ridership. Denver Regional Transportation District CEO Phillip Washington said the revamped station makes the city ""the mother of all transit-oriented communities."" In South Florida, the Miami Intermodal Center -- expected to be finished soon -- will mashup just about every mode of transportation possible: airport, Amtrak, local rail, rental cars and buses, the Miami Herald reports. 5. The rise of regional transit: Long-distance relationships . These days, jobs are where you find them, not necessarily where you live. Supporters say the need for faster, affordable mass transit between nearby cities has never been greater. Utah Transit Authority's light-rail line called TRAX has connected communities within the sprawling Salt Lake County for 15 years. Since 2008, the UTA intercity commuter railroad called FrontRunner has reached out ever farther with a corridor connecting Provo, Salt Lake City and Pleasant View along about 90 miles of track. Now, commuter rail lines have been proposed connecting other regional cities -- such as Chicago with St. Louis, Dallas with Houston and Orlando's airport with downtown Miami.","The United States is on track to top 2013 ridership on public transportation .

"The death toll from this month's Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines has spiked to 5,235, a national agency reported early Saturday. That figure -- posted at 6 a.m. (5 p.m. ET Friday) on the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council's website -- marks a significant increase from counts earlier in the week. On Thursday, for instance, the toll stood at slightly more than 4,000. The same agency also reported that 23,501 were injured due to the epic storm, with 1,613 reported missing. The missing amount is 31 higher than a day earlier. The monster typhoon left behind a catastrophic scene after it made landfall on six Philippine islands on November 8, leaving many without immediate access to food and medical care. It flattened some communities and displaced about 3 million people. INTERACTIVE: Panoramic photo shows Haiyan devastation .","The death toll rises yet again; it stood at just over 4,000 on Thursday .
23,501 were injured, while 1,613 have been reported missing, a Philippines agency reports ."
"Two days ago, an intensely powerful typhoon ripped through the midsection of the Philippines. Internationally known as Haiyan, the weakened but still dangerous storm has plowed into Vietnam. But history will record this as a Filipino disaster. I will call the typhoon by its Filipino name, Yolanda. Yolanda might have been the most powerful land-falling tropical cyclone -- this being the generic scientific term as they are called typhoons, hurricanes or simply cyclones in different parts of the world -- ever recorded by meteorologists. More analysis will be needed to finalize that ruling.  But it really doesn't matter now to the millions of people in the rubble of Yolanda's wake. The strongest winds, in the narrow ring of Yolanda's perfectly circular eyewall, passed directly through Tacloban city, a provincial capital with more than 200,000 inhabitants. Photos coming from Tacloban show almost complete devastation. An accurate death toll will take time, but it is nearly impossible to imagine that it won't be in the thousands. Numbers of more than 10,000, as in some early estimates, seem possible. Many, perhaps most, were not killed by the winds but were drowned by deep storm surges. Yolanda may have broken records, and its direct hit on a major city was excruciatingly bad luck. But tropical cyclone death tolls in the thousands or higher are not nearly rare enough in the developing world. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis likely killed more than 100,000 in Myanmar. And the Philippines, right in the world's worst cyclone highway, are hit very often. In December, Typhoon Bopha, nearly as strong as Yolanda, hit the southern island of Mindanao and killed more than a thousand. Does it seem, in fact, that these weather disasters are happening more often? Well, they are. The damage caused by tropical cyclones has risen dramatically in the past century everywhere it has been assessed. But essentially all of that is attributable to development of vulnerable coastlines, rather than changes in the storms themselves. The population of the Philippines, rich in vulnerable coastlines, has roughly doubled in the past 30 years. There as elsewhere, more people are simply exposed to danger. In the U.S., dollar losses from our hurricanes have exploded. Large numbers of American casualties, though, have become rare, despite big increases in the numbers of potential victims along the coasts. (Katrina in 2005 was the exception that proves that rule.) Better forecasts, warnings and evacuation procedures, as well as tougher building codes and other infrastructure measures, have achieved that. Improvements are starting to take hold in the developing world as well. When Cyclone Phailin hit India's west coast last month, there was reason to fear a repeat of the 1999 cyclone that hit nearby Orissa, killing 10,000. Instead, good advance warning and evacuations (with help from a storm weaker than some anticipated) kept Phailin's casualty count low. In the Philippines, many hundreds of thousands were reported to have been evacuated ahead of Yolanda. As awful as the death toll will surely be, it could just as surely have been much higher. But are population growth, development and emergency management the whole story? Or is this disaster also related to global warming? Well, it is. Climate scientists expect that tropical cyclones should become more powerful as the climate warms. There may or may not be more of them; there may well be fewer. But the chance of getting one as strong as Yolanda -- the very worst kind -- may well be increasing. Global warming may already, in fact, have contributed to Yolanda's power. We can't see that in the data; the numbers and intensities of tropical cyclones naturally fluctuate too much from year to year for us to clearly identify a rising trend underneath that would show warming's influence with certainty. But that doesn't mean it's not there. If the time comes that we can detect the warming signal in cyclone activity well enough to make definitive statements, it will be because the storms have intensified to a frightening degree -- and irreversibly so, for all practical purposes. Sea level rise is a much more certain consequence of warming, already easily detectable. That alone will make flooding -- likely Yolanda's deadliest weapon -- a more severe consequence of storms as the sea starts higher before the surge. Today, as the Philippines reels from Yolanda, climate is not the main story. Our thoughts should be with the survivors and those rushing in to help them. The way to save people and property from tropical cyclones, in the near and medium-term, is to get them out of harm's way -- in the days before landfall to the extent that's possible; and, even better, by not putting them there in the first place. But the changes we are making to the climate are not likely to help.","Typhoon caused devastating damage to parts of the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- It's a tough time for businesses, but one entrepreneur may have found the recipe for success. Male and female servers go topless at Grand View Topless Coffee Shop. On Monday, Donald Crabtree opened Grand View Topless Coffee Shop in Vassalboro, Maine, where the waiters and waitresses serve their customers topless. In a town with fewer than 4,500 residents, the topless coffee shop is booming with business. Paul Crabtree, the owner's brother, describes business so far as ""fantastic."" ""It's just been crowds mobbing in,"" he said. Donald Crabtree faced initial opposition to his plan, but he won the right to go ahead in a planning board hearing last week. Many local residents were irate over the idea of combining coffee and nudity. Crabtree, however, saw a profitable business venture. ""I know what people want,"" he said. ""People like nudity, and coffee is profitable. Sure, I'd start a coffee shop, but I'd be out of work in a week."" The flood of job applications -- more than 150 -- for Grand View Topless Coffee Shop reflected the rough job market. Crabtree hired 10 women and five men under stringent requirements, including friendliness and, what he considered most important, that the wait staff ""treat everyone equally."" Watch townspeople, employees talk about coffee shop . ""We didn't hire '10s,' "" he said, referring to appearance. ""We hired everyone from skinny to big-boned women."" Of the 15 selected, most had been laid off from other jobs in the past few months. Elvis Thompson of Brunswick, for example, was a line cook at a restaurant before he lost his job. ""They couldn't afford me anymore,"" he said. He said he doesn't mind fielding interesting requests from customers. ""An 80-year-old woman told me she wanted to see me in spandex,"" Thompson said. ""I just feel really lucky to have a job. I need the money so I can pay my rent."" Ginni Labree from Palermo, Maine, said she applied to several restaurants before being hired at the Grand View. All the restaurants declined to hire her because of her lack of experience. ""I'm so excited, so excited to have a job,"" she said. The coffee shop jobs are paying off. One waitress received a $100 tip for a cup of coffee, and most of the wait staff make about $30 a table. Although the topless coffee shop has been open less than a week, Crabtree said he is already seeing regulars. Customers include a variety of individuals, but mainly couples and females. He also sees his new business venture as a temporary fix for customers struggling through tough economic times. ""The economy is so bad,"" Crabtree said, ""Everyone's losing their homes, their ties, everything they own. People leave here happy and can't wait to come back. It's nice to see people smile again.""","Men, women without tops wait tables at Maine coffee shop .

"Less than a week after a tightly controlled trial, a Chinese court Tuesday found a prominent Uyghur scholar guilty of ""separatism"" and sentenced him to life in prison, his lawyer said. Ilham Tohti, an economics professor at Beijing's Minzu University, was tried for two days last week at the Intermediate People's Court in Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang. The trial took place in China's restive western region where a spate of recent violent incidents have been blamed by the government on Muslim Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state. The court also ordered the confiscation of all of Tohti's assets, said Liu Xiaoyuan, one of Tohti's lawyers, . Police detained the 44-year-old academic -- along with several of his students -- in Beijing in January and took him to his native Xinjiang. Tohti spent months in jail before state prosecutors charged him with the serious crime of ""splitting the country."" Liu told CNN before the court announcement that he and his client were prepared for a guilty verdict and would appeal. The ruling Communist Party controls all aspects of China's judicial process and, according to the country's supreme court, the conviction rate for criminal trials stood at 99.9% at the last count. ""Whatever the result, he said he would face up to it,"" Liu said, while anticipating a heavy sentence for Tohti. ""But he emphasized he's not a separatist, just someone who offered constructive criticism on the government's ethnic policies."" ""He maintained that he'd always been trying to preserve ethnic unity, not to destroy it,"" the lawyer added. ""What he wanted was the implementation of human rights, rule of law and genuine autonomy in Xinjiang."" 'Respected professor' In a statement, The White House called on Chinese authorities to release Tohti, describing him as a ""respected professor who has long championed efforts to bridge differences between Uyghurs and Han Chinese."" Although Tohti was indicted only in late July, Xinjiang police said in a statement in January that they had gathered firm evidence of him colluding with overseas forces to ""spread separatist ideas, incite ethnic hatred and advocate Xinjiang independence."" The police statement also accused Tohti of teaching students about ""violent Uyghur resistance"" in his class and encouraging them to overthrow the Chinese government. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that the harsh sentence appeared to be ""retribution for Professor Tohti's efforts to promote human rights for China's ethnic Uyhgur citizens."" He added that Tohti and those like him were ""indispensible in helping to resolve the underlying causes of unrest and violence"" and ""silencing them can only make tensions worse."" Tohti's defense team has challenged the Urumqi court's jurisdiction over the case and complained about the poor treatment of their client in jail, which at one point caused him to stage a ten-day hunger strike in protest. The lawyers recently said that Tohti was put in shackles and denied warm clothes in a cold cell. The Xinjiang government did not immediately respond to CNN's call for comment Tuesday. Lawyer Liu said Tohti was mostly calm and relaxed during the trial but launched an eloquent and passionate hour-long self-defense toward the end of the hearing, prompting the judge to warn him ""this is not your lecture hall."" Human rights campaign group Amnesty International said the verdict and heavy sentence was an affront to justice. ""Ilham Tohti worked to peacefully build bridges between ethnic communities and for that he has been punished through politically motivated charges,"" said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International. ""Tohti is a prisoner of conscience and the Chinese authorities must immediately and unconditionally release him."" International attention . Tohti's fate has attracted great international attention. Western diplomats -- including representatives from the U.S. embassy in China -- and journalists trying to attend the ""open trial"" last week were kept at bay, as uniformed and plainclothes police flooded the area around the court. The authorities allowed in four Tohti family members -- his wife and three brothers -- who had not seen him for nine months. The U.S. government has expressed deep concern over the scholar's case and called for his release on several occasions. ""His arrest silenced an important voice that peacefully promoted harmony and understanding among China's ethnic groups, particularly the Uyghurs,"" a spokesman for the U.S. embassy in Beijing told CNN after the trial. ""We stress the importance of Chinese authorities differentiating between peaceful dissent and violent extremism."" Tohti is known for his research on Uyghur-Han relations and has been a vocal critic of the government's ethnic policies in Xinjiang, a resource-rich region long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking Uyghurs. The arrival of waves of Han, China's predominant ethnic group, over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward the Han majority in recent years over what they describe as harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and loss of economic opportunities to Han people in Xinjiang. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing and education, as well as curtailed religious freedom. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies.","Chinese court has found a prominent Uyghur scholar guilty of ""separatism""

"In the early days of the Internet boom, some thought we would enter an era where there would be one integrated world economy with no borders, where we would share similar democratic values, and where governments would be less important and civil society could pick up many governmental tasks. But that turned out not to be the case. Many countries don't share our values. There are conflicts, and the Internet has become a good place for these conflicts to play out. One outcome is espionage, whether it is the National Security Agency listening to foreign leaders or China's People's Liberation Army stealing trade secrets.  Another outcome is cybercrime. It seems every month there is a story about a giant retailer being hacked and the personal data of hundreds of thousands of people being stolen by faceless cybercriminals. The last big story was Target.   This week it's eBay, where hackers stole electronic credentials from eBay employees and used the credentials to access and steal customers' data. According to one estimate, more than 800 million records were stolen in 2013. Fortunately, that doesn't actually mean all 800 million people suffered financial loss.  Only a small fraction of people who have their data taken become victims of fraud or theft, because it is hard for criminals to ""monetize"" data -- to turn your personal information into cash. But the cleanup costs for the victimized company can be gigantic. After Target's hack, its CEO was fired for not doing enough. Cybercrime is a growth industry and online security breaches are not going to stop any time soon. The Internet was designed to ensure easy, reliable connectivity and in this it has been an immense success. When the Internet was commercialized in the 1990s, the U.S. government thought it was better to immediately start using an imperfect technology and get the economic benefits rather than wait for a completely safe Internet. That was the right decision. The Internet has drastically changed all facets of our lives, including the way we communicate and do business. It has brought us immense economic benefits. But the downside is that the Internet is not a secure place. Cybersecurity would not be as big a problem as it is today if the pioneers had paid more attention to security issues. For example, encryption (software that scrambles your data into unintelligible patterns) was decontrolled in 1999. But many encryption products turned out to be hard to use, slowing computers and adding cumbersome steps to simple transactions. Encryption is still not widely used. Many companies don't encrypt the data of their customers and rely on passwords, which are very easy to hack for many transactions. Cybercrime is an issue that needs more attention. According to one European intelligence service, there are 20 to 30 criminal gangs in the former Soviet Union that have hacking skills as good as most nations.  There are many other groups with lesser skills.  These criminals are nimble and inventive, and there are thriving cybercrime black markets where you can buy the latest hacking tools.  This means there are highly skilled criminals who live in safe havens but can use the Internet to commit crimes that can earn millions of dollars, for which they will never be arrested or tried.  Why would they stop?  While there is good cooperation among Western countries against cybercrime, Russia has little interest in stopping these groups. Eventually, the Internet will become less risky.  There are basic things that companies can do to make sure their networks are more secure -- at least from all but the high-end criminals and big intelligence agencies. Many companies are now taking cybersecurity seriously in a way different from even a year or two ago.  The United States can work with other governments to improve law enforcement cooperation and to close down criminal networks. The question is whether there will be enough progress before hackers get better at using what they steal.  Right now, cybercriminals can steal millions of records but only be able to ""monetize"" a few thousand of them.  If cybercriminals get better at monetizing the personal data they steal, there will be a spike in losses. And if countries like China continues to hack U.S. businesses to steal trade secrets and make competing products, American companies will lose sales and jobs. The eBay hack reminds us that cybercrime is risk free, hard to stop, and big money for hackers.  Even the best defenses may have holes in them. The least we can do is to try to put in the safeguards.","Hackers take electronic info from eBay employees to steal customers' data .

"""Find a way."" That's the mantra Diana Nyad said she had this year. And that's exactly what she did. On Monday, Nyad became the first person to swim from Cuba to Florida without a protective cage, willing her way to a Key West beach just before 2 p.m. ET, nearly 53 hours after jumping into the ocean in Havana for her fifth try in 35 years. Shortly after conquering the Straits of Florida, the 64-year-old endurance swimmer sat down with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. ""It's all authentic. It's a great story. You have a dream 35 years ago -- doesn't come to fruition, but you move on with life. But it's somewhere back there. Then you turn 60, and your mom just dies, and you're looking for something. And the dream comes waking out of your imagination,"" Nyad said. The swim wasn't easy. ""With all the experience I have, especially in this ocean, I never knew I would suffer the way I did,"" she said. ""For 49 hours the wind just blew like heck, and it was rough."" At one point, she was vomiting because she had so much salt water in her system and was shivering. She sang lullabies to help her relax. ""It was really rough that first day, Saturday, after the start and I just said: 'Forget about the surface up. Get your hands in somehow, and with your left hand, say, push Cuba back, and push Florida towards you,'"" Nyad said. Through it all, she held her mantra close: ""You don't like it. It's not doing well. Find a way."" 'You are never too old' Dozens of onlookers -- some in kayaks and boats, many others wading in the water or standing on shore -- gathered to cheer Nyad on as she finished the more than 100-mile swim. She pumped her fist as she walked onto the beach toward an awaiting medic before being guided to an ambulance. ""I got three messages,"" an exhausted and happy Nyad told reporters. Her face was sunburned and swollen. ""One is we should never, ever give up. Two is you never are too old to chase your dreams. Three is it looks like a solitary sport, but it's a team,"" she said. The swim was a long-awaited triumph for Nyad, who was making her fifth attempt since 1978 and her fourth since turning 60. The first four tries were marked by gut-wrenching setbacks; if the rough, strength-sapping seas didn't force her to quit, an hours-long asthma attack or paralyzing and excruciating jellyfish stings did. But for this swim, besides donning a suit meant to protect her against her jellyfish nemesis, she wore a special mask to prevent jellyfish stings to her tongue, a key factor in her failed attempt last year. Nyad, who was 29 when she first tried the swim, said last week that she wanted to show that ""you can dream at any age."" ""This time, I am 64. So, the years of my life are shorter to the end,"" she said at a news conference in Havana on Friday. ""So this time I am, all the way across ... going to think about all those life lessons that came up during the swim."" Fatigue almost seemed poised to derail her again early Monday. About 7:30 a.m. ET, she was slurring her speech because of a swollen tongue and lips, her support team reported on its website. As the team called her around dawn for her first feeding since midnight, she took longer than normal to reach the support boat, the report said. Divers swam ahead of her, collecting jellyfish and moving them out of Nyad's path. Swimmer's challenge: Cross 103 miles of shark-infested water . When instructed Monday morning to follow the path that's been cleared for her, she flashed her sense of humor, replying, ""I've never been able to follow it in my life,"" according to the website. 'Tell me what your dreams are' Nyad's home stretch followed an overnight in which she became so cold, the team didn't stop her for feeding until first light ""in the hopes that swimming would keep her warm,"" the website said. Every stroke she swam put her deeper into record territory. On Sunday night, she broke Penny Palfrey's record for the farthest anyone has managed on the trek without a shark cage. In 1997, Australian Susie Maroney completed the swim from within a shark cage. She was 22 at the time. Nyad set out from Havana at 8:59 a.m. Saturday with a crew of 35, including divers to watch for sharks. In her first attempt to cross the Straits of Florida in 1978, rough seas left her battered, delirious and less than halfway toward her goal. She tried again twice in 2011, but her efforts ended after an 11-hour asthma attack and jellyfish stings. Last year, she abandoned an attempt about halfway through after severe jellyfish stings and a lightning storm put her in danger. Nyad was a swimming sensation before these attempts. In the 1970s, she won multiple swimming marathons and was one of the first women to swim around the island of Manhattan. She was 8 years old when she first dreamed about swimming across the Straits of Florida. At the time, Nyad was in Cuba on a trip from her home in Florida in the 1950s, before Fidel Castro led a Communist takeover in Cuba and the country's relations with the United States soured. The Los Angeles woman had said this was going to be her final attempt. ""I decided, this one no matter what happened, I don't want that experience again -- like right now, tonight -- talking to you about the journey is worth everything. It is. But I didn't want to be here packing up again,"" Nyad told CNN's Gupta. She demurred when he described her as a hero but said she hopes she can serve as some sort of inspiration. ""I think that a lot of people in our country have gotten depressed, pinned in, pinned down with living lives they don't want,"" Nyad said. She continued: ""I do write all the time about -- you tell me what your dreams are. What are you chasing? It's not impossible. Name it."" 14-year-old swims solo across Lake Ontario .","Diana Nyad sits down with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta .

"Ready or not America, Nina Davuluri is the new girl next door. That's how the 24-year-old Indian-American woman sees herself, she explained to CNN's Erin Burnett on Wednesday, three days after being crowned Miss America. ""I have always viewed Miss America as the girl next door,"" Davuluri said. ""But the girl next door is evolving, as the diversity of America evolves. She's not who she was 10 years ago, and she's not going to be the same person come 10 years down the road."" The fact that her win Sunday spurred a torrent of racist reactions online -- many along the lines that she doesn't represent what the United States is -- didn't surprise Davuluri. She'd experienced it on a smaller scale when she became the first Miss New York of Indian descent. Davuluri sees it as her mission to tackle such stereotypes head on. It's why the daughter of two Indian-born parents has a pageant platform of ""celebrating diversity through cultural competence."" ""I wanted to be the first Indian Miss America, to be that symbol of a new face for the organization,"" she said Wednesday. ""And to let younger girls know that regardless of race, their socioeconomic status, their religion that anyone can become not only Miss America, but anything."" Still, it would be understandable if Davuluri was taken aback by tweets claiming she wasn't sufficiently American or was a terrorist. Yet she's been more heartened by all those that rallied around her. ""For one negative tweet, I received dozens of positive tweets and support from not only Indians, but the American people across the country and ... the world for that matter,"" the Fayetteville, New York, native said. ""It's been such an honor."" And while some criticize the pageant circuit for putting looks above all else, Davuluri said she's thankful it helped her earn $25,000 in scholarships to study cognitive science at the University of Michigan. She will have another $60,000 to apply to her medical school tuition -- $50,000 from her Miss America win and $10,000 from Miss New York. This is all part of the more than $45 million in cash and scholarships the pageant organization gives out. Yes, Davuluri admits, good looks are a part of the equation. Contestants do strut around in swimsuits, after all, and they are judged as they walk in evening gowns. Davuluri says ""that's reality,"" as is the 10-minute interview with judges that people don't see on TV. And Davuluri couldn't be happier with the reality she's now living -- as a groundbreaker, and a talking point, in a country addressing its cultural diversity.

But in a contentious interview Friday on CNN's ""New Day,"" Bundy stood by his remarks, saying he's not a racist but only somebody who speaks his mind, perhaps using politically incorrect language. ""Maybe I sinned, and maybe I need to ask forgiveness, and maybe I don't know what I actually said, but when you talk about prejudice, we're talking about not being able to exercise what we think. ... If I say Negro or black boy or slave, if those people cannot take those kind of words and not be (offended), then Martin Luther King hasn't got his job done yet,"" he told anchor Chris Cuomo on Friday, adding, ""We need to get over this prejudice stuff."" Bundy brought up civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks, who was arrested in December 1955 for not giving up her seat on a public bus to a white man. The arrest sparked the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott. King would have wanted Parks to sit anywhere on a bus, according to Bundy. The 67-year-old added: ""I want her to sit anywhere in the bus, and I want to sit next to her anywhere in the bus."" In one exchange with Cuomo, Bundy said, ""I don't know how to talk about these ethnic groups. ..."" ""Then don't,""  Cuomo said. For two decades, Bundy's cattle have fed off government-owned land without paying grazing fees like thousands of other ranchers. He claims he won't do business with the federal government because, in his view, the Constitution doesn't say Americans can't use land owned by the federal government. He said he'd be willing to talk with state and local authorities.. ""I'll be damned if this is the property of the United States. They have no business here,"" he said on ""New Day."" ""This is a sovereign state, the sovereign state of Nevada. The federal government has nothing to do with public land in Nevada."" He said other ranchers are as frustrated as he is. This stance made him a darling of some conservatives in the media and Republican circles upset over what they've deemed government overreach. Militiamen rallied by the side of the 67-year-old rancher as federal rangers tried to force him off his land. Bundy won that standoff, but he didn't stop talking. Speaking to reporters over the weekend, he recalled driving by a public housing project in North Las Vegas, Nevada, and seeing ""at least a half-dozen (black) people sitting on the porch, they didn't have nothing to do."" ""Because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they do?"" he added in comments first reported by The New York Times and later seen on video. ""They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. ""And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom."" The remarks have since gone viral, drawing widespread condemnation from Democrats and Republicans alike. The rancher said he doesn't feel ""abandoned"" by the uproar by the likes of right-wing radio firebrand and Fox News host Sean Hannity, who has ripped what he called the ""ignorant, racist, repugnant, despicable comments."" Sen. Rand Paul, who originally supported Bundy's case, issued a statement Thursday decrying Bundy's racial comments. ""His remarks on race are offensive and I wholeheartedly disagree with him,"" said the Kentucky Republican, who's considering a 2016 presidential run. Cliven Bundy: Another conservative folk hero exposes racial nerve . GOP Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada earlier called Bundy's supporters ""patriots."" But on Thursday, the senator's office said he ""completely disagrees with Mr. Bundy's appalling and racist statements."" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who had not weighed in on the land dispute, said Bundy's words were ""beyond the pale."" Politicians denounce Bundy's racist remarks . On Thursday, in an exclusive interview with CNN's Bill Weir, Bundy was asked to elaborate on his remarks. He explained he'd been simply ""wondering whether (blacks) are that much better off in the situation we're in now."" He backtracked somewhat, insisting he ""didn't really mean it to compare (African-Americans' current plight) with slavery. I meant to compare it with maybe life on the farm or life in the South, where they had some chickens and the gardens, and they had something to do."" At the same time, Bundy stood by his general premise that blacks once had better lives -- stating that, right now, ""they don't have nothing to do with their children, their family unit is ruined. ... That's what I was referring to. I don't think they have the life that they should have"" because of the government. How did he arrive at these generalizations? ""I feel that, because I see that,"" Bundy explained. He said, ""I don't think I'm wrong. I think I'm right."" Weir at one point challenged the Nevada rancher about whether he was any more or less a ""welfare queen"" since his cattle have been feeding off the government, literally, by eating grass on public land. Bundy's response: ""I might be a welfare queen. But I'll tell you I'm producing something for America and using a resource that nobody else would use or could use. I'm putting red meat on the table."" On Friday, the Bundy Ranch Facebook page elaborated on the rancher's ""New Day"" comments. The post concluded with these sentences: . ""I am doing the same thing Rosa Parks did -- I am standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom. Just like the Minutemen at Lexington and Concord, we are saying no to an oppressive government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men. ""I invite all people in America to join in our peaceful revolution to regain our freedom. That is how America was started, and we need to keep that tradition alive."" In a press conference later Friday, Bundy added that while he is ""tired"" personally he is ""not tired of talking about race."" ""It's time the United States had a discussion about race,"" he said. ""... I think all races should be talking about this, having their opinions and defending their liberties.""","Bundy says he is ""not tired of talking about race""

"(CNN) -- New York Yankees All-Star players Tuesday remembered owner George M. Steinbrenner III as a demanding father figure who had a gentle side. ""He was always good to be around, recalled pitcher Andy Pettitte. ""He was tough. He was fair."" Stories about the larger-than-life Yankees owner, 80, provided a backdrop for Tuesday night's All-Star game in Anaheim, California, where the crowd remembered the baseball titan. Yankees manager Joe Girardi and other members of the team wore black armbands in memory of Steinbrenner. Pettitte, Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter spoke earlier about ""The Boss,"" who died Tuesday morning after suffering a massive heart attack in Tampa, Florida. They described him as a boss many folks would like to have: Demanding. Caring. Clear about what he wanted: to win. ""I once got a handwritten note from him,"" Rodriguez told reporters a few hours before the All-Star Game. It said, 'I AM COUNTING ON YOU!' I still hold it dear. I am playing for him."" ""He expected perfection and it rubbed off on the organization,"" said Jeter. Tributes rolled in all day Tuesday, hours after Steinbrenner's family said he was rushed from his Tampa home to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he died. ""It is with profound sadness that the family of George M. Steinbrenner III announces his passing,"" the family said in a statement. ""He was an incredible and charitable man. First and foremost he was devoted to his entire family -- his beloved wife, Joan; his sisters, Susan Norpell and Judy Kamm, his children, Hank, Jennifer, Jessica and Hal; and all of his grandchildren. ""He was a visionary and a giant in the world of sports. He took a great but struggling franchise and turned it into a champion."" Under Steinbrenner's guidance, the Yankees have earned seven World Series trophies since 1973. He was the longest-tenured owner in Major League Baseball, having served as principal owner since purchasing the club on January 3, 1973. ""Owning the Yankees,"" Steinbrenner once said according to MLB.com, ""is like owning the Mona Lisa."" The Yankees also won 11 American League pennants under Steinbrenner's ownership. Major League Baseball Commissioner Allan ""Bud"" Selig said Steinbrenner was a giant in the game. ""His devotion to baseball was surpassed only by his devotion to his family and his beloved New York Yankees, "" Selig said. ""He was and always will be as much of a New York Yankee as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford and all of the other Yankee legends. He was my dear friend for nearly four decades. Although we would have disagreements over the years, they never interfered with our friendship and commitment to each other. Steinbrenner was a pop culture figure, famously earning some attention in episodes of the TV sitcom ""Seinfeld."" ""I met the real George Steinbrenner on only one occasion when he actually came and played himself on an episode of 'Seinfeld,'"" recalled Jason Alexander, who played George Costanza. ""He seemed to really enjoy himself. I did not get to know him but the fact that he allowed himself and his beloved team to be satirized on our show is an indication to me of his true character."" Hall of Fame Yankees catcher Yogi Berra called Steinbrenner a ""great friend."" ""George was The Boss, make no mistake.  He built the Yankees into champions  and that's something nobody can ever deny,"" Berra said in a statement. ""George and I had our differences, but who didn't? We became great friends over the last decade and I will miss him very much."" At a press conference Tuesday, Berra said Steinbrenner had long ago apologized for firing the popular manager. ""George said to me it was the 'worst mistake I made in my life' and I said 'George everyone makes mistakes,'"" Berra added, choking up at the memory. Berra predicted Steinbrenner would get into the Hall of Fame. Former Yankees Manager Joe Torre remembered the boss as tough and passionate. ""I will always remember George Steinbrenner as a passionate man, a tough boss, a true visionary, a great humanitarian, and a dear friend. I will be forever grateful that he trusted me with his Yankees for 12 years. ... It's only fitting that he went out as a world champ,"" he said in a statement. In an interview Tuesday on CNN's ""Rick's List,"" Torre said, ""He did scream, he did get loud, but when you closed that door there was a human side of him too. That's one thing, when you work with George Steinbrenner....you can't pick and choose the parts you like. You have to understand that it's the whole package."" CNN sports contributor Max Kellerman said, ""Steinbrenner is the most famous owner in sports, really maybe in the history of American team sports -- it's a very big deal. He was an ongoing character on 'Seinfeld.' ... Steinbrenner has made his way into popular culture, into the cultural consciousness."" Steinbrenner was born on July 4, 1930, in Rocky River, Ohio. His mother, he once said, imbued him with a compassion for the underdog. He told The New York Times Magazine in 1978 that he ""never really appreciated"" his father when he was growing up but that now he ""can't give enough credit"" to him. ""Anything I ever accomplish I owe to him,"" he said then. Now a baseball icon, Steinbrenner began his major league ownership career in 1973 after he bought the Bronx Bombers from CBS for $8.7 million. Steinbrenner was chairman of the board of the American Ship Building Co., which had an estimated $180 million in sales in 1978. His other ventures including political fundraising, backing of Broadway plays, an interest in the Chicago Bulls basketball team, ownership of the thoroughbred Kinsman Stud Farm in Florida and an extensive holdings in banking operations and Florida real estate. Steinbrenner was for decades the most colorful, controversial and domineering owner in baseball. He demanded victory from his teams and managers, firing managers who didn't deliver. Famously, he hired and fired manager Billy Martin half a dozen times in the 1970s and 1980s when the Yankees dominated baseball. He was willing to shatter ideas about what baseball players should be paid to stack his teams with stars, starting with pitcher Catfish Hunter and slugger Reggie Jackson in the 1970s and continuing up to the present with Derek Jeter and C.C. Sabathia. But Steinbrenner didn't always know where to draw the line on payments, and stepped over it at least twice -- with illegal campaign contributions to Richard Nixon in 1974, and with a $40,000 payment to a gambler for damaging information about a player. He was suspended from baseball for the Nixon contribution and banned for life for the payment to gambler Howie Spira, according to Major League Baseball. He was reinstated three years later. He often starred in commercials lampooning himself, including a commercial in which he chewed out Jeter for partying. On his 80th birthday last week, Steinbrenner thanked fans, friends and family for their good wishes. ""I am very fortunate to have the love and support of a great family and many, many friends. The Yankees and their fans are a large part of what keeps me going. It means a lot,"" he said. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said, ""This is a sad day not only for Yankee fans, but for our entire city, as few people have had a bigger impact on New York over the past four decades than George Steinbrenner. George was a larger-than-life New York figure whose passion and drive to succeed will forever be missed."" Funeral arrangements will be private, the family said, adding there will be an additional public service with details to be announced at a later date. Steinbrenner's death marks the second loss in so many days for Yankee veterans. Announcer Bob Sheppard died Sunday. Steinbrenner called Sheppard ""a good friend and fine man whose voice set the gold standard for America's sports announcers.""

"The slick, black aircraft came roaring down the runway on its way into the sky. We had been allowed to watch the takeoff from an elevated viewing area about three-quarters of the way down the strip. There were the five of us attached to the USO's Operation Thriller III tour: writers Kathleen Antrim, Joe Finder, Andy Harp, Brad Meltzer and me. A handful of airmen assigned to a U.S. Air Force base in the Mideast were on hand as well. I was tracking the jet's advance down the runway with my video camera. I pivoted as the plane swept by, and my view was suddenly blocked by one of the airmen. He stood pumping his fist up and down as the jet rose in front of us. I momentarily paused on him and lost the plane. It streaked by with a blast of sound and air displacement that went right through me. I turned my camera in time to catch the afterburners as the aircraft rose at a steep angle into the sky. I thought I had blown the shot with my pause on the airman's pumping fist. But then I realized I actually had the real shot, the shot that told the fuller story. The shot that underlined what I had been seeing over and over as we traveled from base to base and visited troops stationed in support of military efforts. Opinion: Everyday should be Veterans Day . From the truck drivers to the pilots to the gate sentries to the colonels in command, the effort is one of pride and preparedness that left me with a new take on what it means to be heroic. These people, far from home and seemingly in the middle of nowhere, are the noble but unknown troops. They've got true character. When I had first been approached about joining a USO tour comprising authors, I jumped at the chance. After all, I am in the hero business. I write about fictional characters who face adverse circumstances and with relentless spirit and drive overcome the odds to succeed -- sometimes at great danger and cost to themselves. This is the coin of the realm when it comes to fiction. It's character, character, character. Slick plotting and exotic settings and forensic detail are all window dressing on the real deal. Readers come into a story looking to connect with a character they identify with and want to ride with. They are looking for heroes. Veterans Day by the numbers . So what better way to meet and research heroes than a USO tour? I heard that last year's Operation Thriller USO tour went to Afghanistan and the one before that visited troops in Iraq. The writers on those trips were furnished with Kevlar helmets and flak jackets. I assumed we would make a similar journey, that we were going where the troops dodged sniper bullets and IEDs as a matter of course each day. But then I got the word. Operation Thriller III would not be going to the front. We would spend a week visiting support bases scattered across the Southwest Asia. Though my family breathed easier at the news, I have to admit I was disappointed. I had signed up to meet heroes and now I was going to meet the troops who backed up the heroes. Well, I got that wrong. On our weeklong USO tour, I got the chance to visit with the heroes who load pallets of water on cargo planes, the heroes who patrol the desert for explosives dating back to the first Persian Gulf War of 1991, the heroes who fix and maintain the vehicles that cover the rugged ground in Afghanistan and the hero pilots that fly in supplies instead of bombs. Most of them came from reserve units from across the United States. It is work that is not without danger, but still it never gets the notice of the media focused squarely down range on the fight. No matter, these troops weren't looking for attention and they weren't looking to be called heroes. They simply were going about their jobs with pride and professionalism, knowing that down range it mattered. Like the airman fist-pumping at the side of the runway, character and heroism are where you find them. Sometimes, it's maintaining the plane instead of flying it. Sometimes, it's moving water bottles instead of bullets. Always faithful: Marine veterans tend to hero's grave, cemetery . I met an Army specialist on a base in Kuwait who drives a forklift. He didn't wear a combat helmet. He wore a hard hat. His hard hat was a custom-made white cowboy hat he had ordered off the Internet. His job was to move pallets of water on to cargo planes that lifted them to bases all across the region. In a place where summer temperatures routinely break 100 degrees before the sun is barely up, bottles of water can be as important as bullets. Eight months into his posting, he said he had helped move more than 3 million bottles of water and counting. It was a figure of which he was proud. He knew he played an integral part in the fight. I didn't get to Afghanistan, but the USO and the man in the white hat taught me a lesson in what it is to be a hero. They showed me sacrifice, pride, professionalism and reminded me that being part of the team and doing the job right -- whether anyone is paying attention or not -- are the ingredients of character.

"Is it an extreme case of helicopter parenting or a smart move to keep kids safe? That's what parents are asking after hearing about a Long Island middle school's decision to ban most balls during recess and also require supervision of tag, even cartwheels, due to safety concerns. No longer allowed at the Weber Middle School in Port Washington, New York:  footballs, baseballs, soccer balls, lacrosse balls and any other hardballs that could injure a child. Also off limits: rough games of tag and cartwheels unless an adult supervisor is on hand. ""We want to make sure our children have fun but are also protected,"" Kathleen Mooney, superintendent of Port Washington Schools, said in a local television interview, noting how playground injuries can ""unintentionally"" become very serious. Whatever happened to 'go outside and play?' The school district, in a press release, said that due to construction going on at the school, there is ""limited space"" for the children to play during their 20-minute recess period. ""With children in close proximity to each other, it is not safe for them to be engaged in unstructured play with hardballs,"" said the district. It's not clear when the construction project will come to an end at the school and if kids will be able to resume normal ball-playing after it wraps up. A call to the superintendent's office for confirmation has not yet been returned. Soft nerf balls will be provided during recess, and kids can play with hardballs during gym and intramural athletics. Not suprisingly, when we asked what people thought about this school's policy on CNN's Facebook page, we got a ton of comments, the majority outraged by the school's decision.

Our kids don't experience physical activity unless it involves downloading an app."" ""Without opportunities to learn how to navigate space with their bodies, and to negotiate rules, risks, and experimentation of cooperative play, how are children going to ever be able to handle themselves in any society as adults?"" said Alex Martin, an associate director at a Manhattan nursery school. On the other side, there were some people who thought the school's actions were warranted. ""Freedom is great until the parents sue the school district,"" said Tyllor Parker on Facebook. ""I don't think kids should have their fun pasttimes discontinued, but head trauma can be serious,"" said Marilyn Decker on Facebook. ""Helmets can lessen that. Even pro sports issues protection.

"A Florida airport is pushing to join 16 other U.S. airports in opting out of Transportation Security Administration screening in favor of private screeners. Orlando Sanford International Airport has been trying to get approval since last year to join the TSA's Screening Partnership Program, which helps airports hire qualified private screening companies to enforce security protocol set and overseen by the TSA. The airport's application has been denied twice. ""We're not booting the TSA. This is a TSA program created by congress,"" said Larry Dale, the airport's president and CEO. The partnership started in 2002 with five airports participating in the pilot program.  There are now 16 participating airports, including San Francisco International and Kansas City International. One additional airport, West Yellowstone in Montana, was approved in January. Legislation championed by representative John Mica, R-Florida, and signed into law with the much-delayed FAA reauthorization bill in February was designed to make it easier for airports to join the program. Orlando Sanford has submitted a request to the TSA to reconsider its application, under a stipulation outlined in the bill, Dale said. ""We believe in free enterprise and holding people accountable for efficiency, safety and security,"" Dale said. The TSA is ""developing procedures to implement the Screening Partnership Program-related provisions included in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012,"" the agency said in a statement. The TSA administrator is required to approve airport applications for the program if security is uncompromised, cost efficiency is maintained and the screening of  passengers and property is not negatively impacted. Orlando Sanford International Airport saw close to 1.6 million passengers in 2011, compared with more than 35 million passengers at neighboring Orlando International Airport.","Florida airport pushing to join private screening program .

"(CNN) -- Someone in the Obama White House clearly has a good book to write one day: ""How Not to Do Rollouts."" With one hapless episode after another, the rollout of the President's plan to destroy ISIS is beginning to rival the less-than-splendid debut of the Obamacare website. President Barack Obama's critics may take some glee from the recent missteps, but they shouldn't. Going to war is serious business, especially when the conflict promises to be long and messy. For the nation's sake, our dysfunctional politics needs to become functional on this one or we put too much at risk, starting with the lives of our men and women in uniform. That's why it is imperative and urgent that the Obama team and their allies take a deep breath, pull themselves together and get this war effort on solid footing. Instead of becoming defensive, they need to go on offense, showing the world they are firmly in charge and on a winning path. Ever since the President went on prime-time television to announce his new strategy to ""degrade and destroy"" ISIS, he and his team have slipped on one banana peel after another. First came the series of muddled messages. Was this to be called a war or something else like a counterterrorism campaign? Who knew after so many contradictions from the administration? Is the threat from ISIS something we are trying to prevent from happening one day or is it imminent? Again, contradictions. Crucially: Still we put boots on the ground or will we leave all the ground fighting to surrogates? No one can be sure yet. Even as a coalition grows of nations proclaiming their support, questions also rise of just how much -- or how little -- they will actually do. Meanwhile, the media has been jammed with news analyses and comments from respected former officials calling into question the whole enterprise. The administration expresses confidence that a reconstituted Iraqi military along with Kurdish forces, working with American air power, can destroy ISIS in Iraq, but so far, press reports are skeptical. And experts point out that the best Iraqi fighters are Shia militia allied with Iran. There is even more skepticism about our capacity to mobilize ""moderates"" in Syria. And listening to two of Obama's former defense chiefs, Bob Gates and Leon Panetta, one suspects they would have strongly opposed the plan if they were still in government. As if the gnawing doubts weren't filling enough air time, now comes a new round of stories in The Washington Post, The New York Times and Financial Times reporting on a growing rift between the President and his military generals. One can easily read too much into these tensions. In truth, Obama and the military have been able to work together in a professional way through most of his administration. And certainly the collaboration within the government in pursuit of Osama bin Laden was masterful. But it is also true that underneath the surface, there has been an unhealthy atmosphere of mistrust between this White House and some of its military chieftains. The Obama team has doubted the loyalty of several of its generals, while the military has doubted the competence of the President and his national security team, especially in the second term. Soon after he took office, Obama felt that through leaks to the press, his generals were trying to box him in on how many additional troops he would send to Afghanistan, trying to push him to higher numbers. He felt excessive pressure as well on keeping a sizable number of troops in Iraq. And his political advisers were deeply suspicious that Gen. David Petraeus would run against Obama in 2012 the way Gen. George McClellan ran against Lincoln in 1864. These fears and anxieties were overwrought, but they have left scars that remain today. In both the Pentagon and White House, there is now concern about management of the war from here on out. The military worries that Obama and his team will micromanage, especially in Syria -- something that President Lyndon Johnson did with disastrous results in Vietnam. And they worry that a nervous White House will tie their hands in the fight, ruling out the force necessary to win. The White House worries that the military, hellbent upon victory, will accidentally drop bombs on too many innocents, inflaming opinion and making it harder to keep a coalition together. They point to what has happened in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In Syria, they worry an imprecise approach could further drag the United States into the chaotic civil war. Presumably, these are adults on both sides who can work things out but if suspicions and rifts grow, that will definitely handicap prosecution of the war -- and risk a national security debacle. An additional challenge the administration faces is that the President has now announced America is going to war, but there are virtually no signs of mobilization on television. This is very different from most recent conflicts when a President takes to prime time and within hours screens are filled with pictures of military mobilization or of rockets and bombs flying and the public is rallying round the flag. What is left now is a virtual news vacuum that is being largely filled with arguments and counterarguments about the wisdom and competence of the administration. All of this is no way to galvanize a nation or build a vibrant coalition. In coming days, through his time at the United Nations and back in the White House, the President must dramatically seize the reins of leadership. He must form a strong, bipartisan advisory team around him with leaders from the past such as Colin Powell, James Baker, Madeleine Albright, Zbigniew Brzezinski, and yes, Gates and Panetta. He has to work in close harness with his military commanders, ending talk of rifts. And he must mobilize a coalition of nations that takes the fight to the enemy with great urgency. It is inconceivable that the United States, with the best trained and equipped military in the world, can't clear the battlefield of a band of thugs. We must not lose heart just because this war is off to a rocky start. After all and let's admit it: when the administration finally fixed up Obamacare, it started to work better than many of us expected.","David Gergen: Rollout of President's fight vs. ISIS has been dogged by problems .

After her career in food imploded last year when she admitted to previously using a racial slur, the 67-year-old celebrity chef is trying to slowly rebuild what she's lost. However, her recent cover story with People magazine is having the opposite effect. In the article, Deen says she is finding inspiration in what might seem an unusual place given her past troubles.

"St. Paul, Minnesota (CNN) -- When Max Adrien first heard that a massive earthquake had leveled Port-au-Prince, Haiti, it hit close to home.

His class isn't made up of the typical credit-craving college co-ed.  That's mainly because the vast majority of students have long since finished college. The class is free of charge and open to everyone. The roster of students includes local doctors, nurses, physical therapists, social workers, lawyers and ministers. All of them have either been to Haiti or are planning volunteer trips soon. ""They appreciate when you try,"" said Donna Richtsmeier, a retired nurse who travels to Haiti to volunteer. ""I just want to learn a few phrases so I can greet them and ask how they are."" Retired educator Ruth Anne Olson has been to Haiti three times in the past four years. She has been working on a collection of personal stories of people living in Haiti. She says knowing more Creole will make conducting her interviews easier. ""I needed to learn something about the language because particularly I found that I couldn't have any conversations with women,"" Olson said. ""The women either do not speak English or they're more shy about trying it."" She said it was hard finding someone who spoke the language in Minneapolis, Minnesota, let alone providing a free class. Adrien began teaching in February, and now helps students for one hour every Tuesday. He has about three dozen students. ""It is so gratifying...to see that there are people out there who want to help,"" he said. ""Angels are in the form of people."" Adrien has lived in the United States since he was 20, but he says his heart remains in his home country. ""Haitians, in a way, capture the essence of the human spirit,"" Adrien said, sharing his love for, as he puts it, ""my people."" Even if his students only learn a few simple phrases in Creole, Adrien says it will have a profound impact. ""If they see an American say 'How are you today, how are you feeling, what hurts?'... I know the smile that would put on somebody,"" he said.  ""The appreciation they would get to see an American not only care enough to be there but care enough to learn the language to speak to me in my own tongue and make me understand that I matter ... I know the joy that would bring to a Haitian's heart,"" he said. ""I don't think you could give Haitians a better gift.""","Max Adrien, originally from Haiti, wanted to help after the January 12 earthquake .

"(CNN)There is no jarring video of a man clocking his fiancee in a casino elevator, no images of ""switch"" marks left on a small boy's thighs. Still, Junior Galette's arrest on a misdemeanor domestic violence-related charge is a serious issue for the NFL as it marks the first real test of the league's new personal conduct policy. Authorities responded to the New Orleans Saints defensive end's home Monday morning after receiving a call about a disturbance, according to a news release from Kenner, Louisiana, police. ""Upon arrival, officers met with a 22-year-old female who was observed bleeding from her left ear, having an earring ripped from her ear, and scratch marks to her face,"" the release said. Lt. Brian McGregor noted that Galette disputed the woman's account, and in a statement provided to CNN, attorney Lon Burns said, ""Junior Galette is concerned about working to clear his good name which he has established on and off the football field. ... Friends of Mr. Galette's pulled together and rallied around their friend, whom they know as 'Junior,' who has done much when asked for people around him here in the New Orleans area."" Later Tuesday, another attorney, Ralph Whalen, sent a statement saying he was ""confident an investigation and a full hearing of the facts will reveal that Junior Galette behaved appropriately given the circumstances and in no way committed domestic violence or battery."" He said the woman threatened Galette and four others, including Galette's girlfriend, with a knife. She had her earring ripped out when a ""dog reacting to her yelling jumped on her,"" Whalen said in his statement. ""This was not domestic violence for many reasons, including the fact that the woman with the knife is not in a relationship with Mr. Galette nor do they live together. Also, there was there was no battery committed by Mr. Galette,"" the statement said. The relationship between the woman, who police have not identified, and Galette is unclear. The woman told police she had lived with Galette for two years, doing chores and running errands for him, but had been asked to leave Monday morning, police said. Galette told police, though, that the woman was a dancer who was supposed to leave his home Sunday night but was allowed to stay until Monday morning. ""There are some varying versions of what occurred,"" McGregor said during a Monday news conference. 'Then I grabbed a knife ... ' According to the woman's side of the story, she woke Galette up to request cab fare and he told his cousin and former Temple University teammate Terrance Banks ""to take care of the request,"" police said. McGregor read to reporters the woman's account of what happened next: ""We started arguing and Junior pushed me. He pushed me two times, trying to get me out the house and I fell down and they both was on me and I couldn't breathe. I couldn't fight both of them, then Terrance picked me up and put me out. I started to dial 911 and Terrance took my phone and wouldn't give it back. Then I grabbed a knife because I thought they were going to jump me again."" Galette, 26, was arrested on a charge of simple battery involving domestic violence, and Banks, 26, was arrested on a simple battery charge. Galette posted a preset bond of $600 and Banks posted a $300 bond, and both were released from jail Monday, according to police. Galette is scheduled to appear in Kenner Mayor's Court on February 26, McGregor told CNN. The incident report will not be released until Thursday or later, McGregor said, but the responding officers had no option but to arrest Galette and Banks, given the circumstances. Among the factors they considered, according to McGregor: Two large men were fighting with one woman, the nature of each party's offensive and defensive injuries, the seriousness of the injuries, and the heights and weights of the parties involved. 'When you go hands on with someone, you've gone too far,"" the lieutenant said, explaining that the initial investigation indicated Galette and Banks were the ""predominant aggressors."" Asked about Galette's claim that he merely wanted the woman to leave his home, McGregor said, ""All you had to do was call the Kenner Police Department, and we would've responded."" Policy put to work . Galette's arrest will be the first real test for the NFL's new personal conduct policy, adopted last month after widespread uproar over the handling of the Ray Rice assault case and Adrian Peterson child abuse case, along with other lower-profile arrests. The policy calls on players, coaches, owners, game officials and other employees to be ""people of high character,"" and it expands the 2007 list of prohibited conduct, allows for independent investigations, creates criteria under which a player can be suspended with pay and establishes a group of outside advisers to review potential violations. ""Conduct by anyone in the league that is illegal, violent, dangerous, or irresponsible puts innocent victims at risk, damages the reputation of others in the game, and undercuts public respect and support for the NFL,"" the policy states. Perhaps most pertinent to Galette's case, the policy also establishes a ""baseline suspension without pay of six games"" for any violation involving ""assault, battery, domestic violence, dating violence, child abuse and other forms of family violence, or sexual assault involving physical force or committed against someone incapable of giving consent."" The suspension can be lengthened if the case involves aggravating factors, and a second offense could see a player banished from the league outright. Galette was apparently aware of this, as he told arresting officers the incident could affect his recent contract extension, McGregor told CNN. Under the extension, signed in September, the Saints will pay the Haitian-born defensive end with 31.5 career sacks as much as $52 million over six years, according to reports. He is slated to get a roster bonus of $12.5 million this year. ""It had no bearing on our decision (to arrest him),"" McGregor said of the contract. League, team investigating . Regarding Galette's status on the gridiron, a Saints spokesman told CNN on Monday, ""We are aware and our security department is still collecting information."" League spokesman Greg Aiello told CNN the NFL is looking into the matter and there was nothing new to report Tuesday. He further explained how the league follows up on suspected violations, which includes making certain assistance available to the victim. For Galette, the NFL will offer and pay for a formal clinical evaluation, along with education and counseling, and if he participates, it will reflect positively ""in determining eventual discipline if a violation is found,"" according to the policy. The league will also conduct an investigation -- tapping NFL security, independent parties or both -- while cooperating with any law enforcement probes. ""League and team employees are required to cooperate in any such investigation and are obligated to be fully responsive and truthful in responding to requests from investigators for information (testimony, documents, physical evidence, or other information) that may bear on whether the Policy has been violated. ""A failure to cooperate with an investigation or to be truthful in responding to inquiries will be separate grounds for disciplinary action."" CNN's Kevin Dotson contributed to this report.","Woman had earring ripped out when dog jumped on her, New Orleans Saint's lawyer says .

"When Commissioner Adam Silver speaks to the media Tuesday about the NBA's findings in the investigation into racist remarks attributed to Clippers owner Donald Sterling, the league's players hope it includes the most severe penalties. ""When a hint of cancer is shown, you have to cut it out immediately, and I feel that's where the players are today,"" Kevin Johnson, the former all-star who is the chairman of the National Basketball Players Association's executive committee, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Johnson said the players trust that the new commissioner, on the job for less than three months, will find the right penalties for Sterling, who has owned the Clippers for almost 30 years. ""They don't think he's worthy to be an owner,"" said Johnson, also the mayor of Sacramento, ""so whether there's a sanction that includes a suspension, whether there's a sanction that includes a hefty fine ... the players feel very strongly that he's not fit to be an owner and a part of this NBA family."" The NBA has scheduled a news conference for 2 p.m. ET Tuesday. Monday brought a slew of sponsors distancing themselves from the team and a host of other owners and team officials condemning the comments attributed to Sterling, who has never been disciplined by the league. On Saturday, the website TMZ posted a 10-minute recording of a conversation, reportedly between Sterling and his girlfriend, whose legal name is V. Stiviano. According to the website, the conversation occurred on April 9. On the recording, the man and woman argue about photos posted to Instagram in which she appears with African-Americans. The man says he doesn't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her. Sterling has not commented publicly on the scandal. Team President Andy Roeser issued a statement this weekend that said ""what is reflected on that recording is not consistent with, nor does it reflect (Sterling's) views, beliefs or feelings."" He suggested that the recording was an attempt by Stiviano to ""get even"" with Sterling. Speculation on possible punitive actions . Silver has promised the league would give Sterling due process but would act quickly. It is unclear whether Silver could order Sterling to sell the Clippers, a team he bought for $12 million in 1981 and is now worth $575 million, according to Forbes magazine. A lifetime suspension and fine of at least $1 million is more likely, experts say. The commissioner might announce an indefinite suspension while the investigation continues, CNN's Rachel Nichols reported. Opinion: Sterling has to go . ""He (eventually) could suspend Donald Sterling maybe for a year, maybe even two years or even indefinitely,"" Nichols said. ""And the idea and the hope would be that if he made him so uncomfortable, if he was removed from day-to-day operations, if sponsors are pulling out the way that they are, there would be some way to convince Sterling, it's in your best interest and the interest of everyone else to sell the team."" Nichols likened the situation to the late Marge Schott, who owned the Cincinnati Reds and made racist and other insensitive comments. She was suspended twice, the second time in 1996, and sold the team in 1999. Other NBA owners have called the remarks attributed to Sterling ""abhorrent,"" ""reprehensible,"" ""hurtful,"" and said they have no place in the league or anywhere in society. And they all said they have confidence Silver will handle the matter well. Charlotte Bobcats owner and Hall of Fame Michael Jordan made a rare public statement on a controversial subject. ""As an owner, I'm obviously disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views,"" he said. ""As a former player, I'm completely outraged. There is no room in the NBA -- or anywhere else -- for the kind of racism and hatred that Mr. Sterling allegedly expressed."" Five key players in the Donald Sterling uproar . TMZ posts audio recording . In the recording, the man seems mad about a photo the woman posted to Instagram with Magic Johnson, now a part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. ""In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" the man says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" she responds. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" Bird was Johnson's chief rival when Bird's Celtics and Johnson's Lakers ruled the NBA. ""I've known (Magic Johnson) well, and he should be admired. ... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately,"" the man on the recording says. ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games."" On Sunday, the sports website Deadspin posted five additional minutes it said was part of the same audio recording. Neither website has said how it obtained the recordings. Stiviano's lawyer's office said Sunday that she didn't release the recordings to TMZ but that they are legitimate. ""This office understands that the currently released audio tape of approximately 15 minutes is a portion of approximately one (1) hour of overall audio recording of Mr. Donald T. Sterling and Ms. Stiviano, and is in fact legitimate,"" Mac E. Nehoray said in a news release. ""Ms. Stiviano did not release the tape(s) to any news media."" Sterling has history of fighting discrimination claims in court . Clippers considered boycott . Sterling's wife, who is suing the woman, gave CNN affiliate KABC a statement Sunday night. ""Our family is devastated by the racist comments made by my estranged husband,"" Rochelle Sterling said. ""My children and I do not share these despicable views or prejudices. We will not let one man's small-mindedness poison the spirit of the fans and accomplishments of the team in the city we love."" Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers told reporters Monday that he was offered an opportunity to speak to Sterling after the comments attributed to the team's owner were posted online, but Rivers said he ""passed."" Rivers added, ""I don't think right now is the time or place, for me at least. And so I just took a pass."" The coach, in his first year with the Clippers, said he believes that Sterling did make the comments but said he wanted to find out if the recording was doctored. Rivers confirmed the team's players had talked about boycotting a playoff game but decided against it. Whether the coach or a player will address the fans before Tuesday's Game 5 against the Golden State Warriors is being discussed internally, Rivers said. The teams each have two wins in the best-of-seven-games series. Golden State coach Mark Jackson said Monday that fans should make a statement by staying home. Poll: Do you think Clippers players should boycott? Sponsors leave in droves . Twelve Clippers sponsors have taken action. State Farm, Virgin America, CarMax, Red Bull were among companies to pull sponsorships, at least temporarily, CNN Money reported. Sterling was to receive a lifetime achievement award at an event next month to mark the 100th anniversary of the Los Angeles NAACP, but the national organization said Monday that would not happen. Sterling had been given a lifetime achievement award from the organization in 2009, according to a brochure obtained by CNN. Roeser, the Clippers' president, suggested Saturday that Stiviano -- whom he didn't mention by name -- was ""getting even"" with Sterling over a lawsuit. Rochelle Sterling filed a lawsuit last month against Stiviano, who she said was having an affair with her husband. In the complaint, Rochelle Sterling accuses Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men. The suit claims that Donald Sterling used the couple's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover and that Stiviano took possession of a $1.8 million duplex through fraud. Sterling also gave her nearly $250,000 in cash, the court document says. Stiviano countered in another court document that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the Clippers owner, who made much of his fortune in real estate. Speaking about the recording, Roeser said, ""We do not know if it is legitimate or it has been altered. We do know that the woman on the tape -- who we believe released it to TMZ -- is the defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even.'

"Violence in the streets of Damascus. A growing refugee crisis. Calls for outside intervention. Reading the grim headlines out of Syria, it's easy to forget how we even got to this point. Here's a refresher course to get you up to speed. Overview . The Syrian regime, led by President Bashar al-Assad, launched a violent crackdown last year on activists demanding more economic prosperity, political freedom and civil liberties. This sparked a nationwide uprising and eventually a civil war with armed rebels, many of whom defected from the military. As of July, the conflict had claimed an estimated 17,000 lives, mostly civilians, according to the United Nations. And more than 170,000 people have fled the Middle East nation to seek refuge in neighboring countries such as Iraq, Jordan and Turkey. Throughout the uprising, the Syrian government has referred to the opposition as terrorists trying to destabilize the country. Opposition leaders say that's just the regime's way of justifying attacks. U.S. President Barack Obama and many other global leaders have called on al-Assad to give up the power his family has held since 1970. They've also imposed economic sanctions on Syria as they try to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. How it started . In January 2011, revolution in Tunisia marked the start of the so-called Arab Spring. Tunisia's successful uprising inspired similar unrest in countries throughout North Africa and the Middle East -- countries that, like Tunisia, were experiencing high unemployment, corruption and political repression under longtime autocratic leaders. In March 2011, violence broke out in Daraa, Syria, after a group of children and teenagers were arrested for writing political graffiti. Dozens of people were killed when security forces cracked down on protesters. Demonstrators soon called for al-Assad to leave office, following in the footsteps of Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Tunisia's Zine el Abidine Ben Ali. Al-Assad promised to make changes, and he lifted the country's state-of-emergency law, which for 48 years gave the regime the power to detain anyone without charge and hold them indefinitely. But just four days after the emergency law was lifted in April 2011, the Syrian regime sent thousands of troops into Daraa for a wide-scale crackdown, witnesses said. Since then, the violence has only increased, spreading throughout the country and becoming a full-fledged civil war between the regime and an armed resistance. By the summer of 2012, the clashes had reached Damascus, Syria's capital, and Aleppo, its largest city. Timeline: From uprising to civil war . Who is al-Assad? Bashar al-Assad has been president since his father, Hafez, died in 2000. Hafez ruled Syria for nearly 30 years and was supposed to be succeeded by oldest son Basel, but Basel died in a car crash in 1994. When Bashar took office at the age of 34, Western nations had hopes that he might be more moderate than his father, a hard-line Soviet ally. Bashar, young and Western-educated, was at one time studying in London to become an eye doctor. The al-Assad family is Alawite, a Shiite Muslim offshoot that's one of the minorities in a country that is nearly three-quarters Sunni. Bashar has filled key positions in his government with extended family members, and many of his supporters are Alawites and other minorities who fear what might happen if the Sunnis were to gain power. Will Syria's first lady take a stand or stand by her man? Who are the rebels? The opposition has become larger, more organized and better armed since the start of the uprising. Many of the fighters are ex-soldiers who defected from the military, but there are also civilians who have taken up the fight against the al-Assad regime. ""I go to war for my family, for my country,"" said Soukrot Amin, a 23-year-old volunteer in the Free Syrian Army. ""Because (al-Assad) has killed everyone. He killed my cousin. He destroyed my village. He destroyed my home."" The Free Syrian Army, the primary opposition group, emerged in July 2011, claiming responsibility for an attack on an air intelligence base. It is not the only militia opposing al-Assad, however, and there are questions about how unified the opposition truly is. CNN inside Syria: Faces of the Free Syrian Army . Overall, the rebels have showed that they can effectively attack the regime. But it has been unable to hold major cities for long, frequently retreating under the pressure of a powerful Syrian military that is better equipped and has airstrike capabilities. Outside intervention . The United States and many of its Western allies have imposed economic sanctions against Syria, condemning al-Assad and demanding that he leave power. But they have not persuaded the U.N. Security Council to do the same. China and Russia -- two of Syria's commercial partners -- have vetoed several proposed resolutions on Syria. Without international consensus, most countries have been hesitant to intervene militarily. Saudi Arabia and Qatar, two Sunni-led countries in the Middle East, are believed to be sending arms to the opposition. But the United States is providing only non-lethal aid and humanitarian assistance. On the other side, Iran is supporting al-Assad and the Syrian regime, as is Lebanon-based Hezbollah, another Shiite ally. What's at stake for Syria's neighbors . The U.N., through former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, proposed a peace plan this year and sent a team of observers into the country to observe a cease-fire that was supposed to go into effect. But violence persisted, the observers were withdrawn, and Annan resigned his post as special envoy. Why Syria matters . Of course, there is the humanitarian crisis, with people dying, starving and in need of aid. The U.N. says the violence has made it difficult for many Syrians to access food, water, electricity and medical supplies, forcing tens of thousands to flee the country. But Syria's key role in the heart of the Middle East means there might also be long-term geopolitical consequences at stake. Many analysts see the conflict as a proxy war between Iran and its Sunni Arab rivals in the region, between Iran and the United States, and even between the United States and Russia -- the latter ""about who is going to have more say in the future of the region and on what terms the international community will intervene in conflicts such as Syria,"" said Nader Mousavizadeh, chief executive of Oxford Analytica. Why Americans should care about Syria . Because the Syrian regime is Alawite and the majority of the country is Sunni, there is also concern that Syria could devolve, like Iraq once did, into a bloody, sectarian battle that could further destabilize the region. And any time you talk about instability in the Middle East, there are worries about al Qaeda and other hard-line militants filling any power vacuums or failed states. Then there is the Arab-Israeli issue to consider. Syria has been a key Palestinian ally through the years, actively supporting Hamas and Hezbollah while sharing a border with Israel. What will the Syrian outcome mean for Mideast peace? As Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. diplomat, once said, ""The Arabs can't make war without Egypt, and they can't make peace without Syria.""","Syria's uprising, which started in early 2011, has turned into a full-fledged civil war .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Police in California are pleading for help from the public in the investigation into the shooting of three people and the death of a baby who was later found in a dumpster. Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna admits that investigators do not have enough information to answer the key questions in the case, but are confident that witnesses can fill in the gaps. Three-week-old Eliza Delacruz was abducted from a home in Long Beach on Saturday night after her mother, father and uncle were shot. The baby's body was found the next day, more than 100 miles away, in a strip mall dumpster in Imperial Beach. ""We need to get the coward who committed this violent, senseless act off the street,"" Luna said at a news conference Monday. ""Somebody, somewhere, saw what happened, and we need you to come forward."" The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved Tuesday a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in the infant's death. ""I made this motion in collaboration with the Long Beach Police Department to support their aggressive work to bring to justice the person(s) who committed this heinous crime,"" Los Angeles County Supervisor Don Knabe sad in a statement.  ""We are asking anyone who has any information to please come forward -- they can remain anonymous."" Police are working the leads they have, Luna said. They are interviewing family members and neighbors, and reviewing surveillance footage from the strip mall where Eliza's body was found. But, he added, investigators need help. ""As we stand here as police officers, unfortunately we deal with tragedies, but nothing as horrendous as a child -- a baby for that fact -- being taken from her home and then be left in the trash dumpster,"" he said. ""We really, really need your help."" Authorities told CNN that the attacker may have known the family. A transient searching for recyclables found the dead baby in the dumpster and alerted the owner of a business, CNN affiliate KGTV reported. Meanwhile, two of the shooting victims remain in critical condition at an area hospital, police said, and a third has been treated and released.

"Washington (CNN)This isn't how House Speaker John Boehner wanted to start 2015. He's presiding over a historic majority in the House while the Senate is controlled by Republicans for the first time in nearly a decade. But the Ohio Republican is still wrestling with a familiar problem that could threaten his agenda over the next two years: conservative unrest. That dynamic was on display Tuesday when a surprisingly large group of Republicans voted against giving Boehner a third term as Speaker. ""I think a lot of Republicans are looking for a new direction,"" Oklahoma GOP Rep. Jim Bridenstine, one of those saying he'll back another candidate, told CNN. This group, which includes about a dozen lawmakers, is almost certain to fail. But even if they don't block Boehner from another term wielding the Speaker's gavel, their opposition is a fresh reminder of Boehner's struggles to control his rank-and-file just as he and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell try to prove that Republicans can govern heading into 2016. And the drama is all playing out amid turmoil in the leadership ranks after revelations that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise once spoke to a white supremacist group, unfortunate news for a party that is trying to expand its reach to minorities ahead of the next presidential election. Although he already got the nod to keep his post by the House Republican conference after the midterms in November, Boehner doesn't officially get the gavel again until a majority of members vote for him on the House floor on Tuesday. If 29 GOP members vote for someone else, they can force a potentially embarrassing second ballot -- with the scene playing out on live C-SPAN cameras. The opposition movement isn't entirely unexpected. Two years ago, Boehner faced a similar, poorly organized effort when a dozen House Republicans backed other candidates or declined to vote for him. Some Boehner opponents say their position isn't personal. They just don't like the way he ran the House. ""This isn't about John Boehner,"" Bridenstine said. Republicans looking for an alternative ""just want to make sure that we're doing the right thing on behalf of our constituents."" Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert and Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, who are tea party favorites, announced they would run for the Speaker. In an interview on CNN Monday, Rep. Steve King of Iowa floated Florida Rep. Daniel Webster as another possible candidate. But even Bridenstine conceded no one can defeat Boehner outright. Kentucky Republican Rep. Tom Massie told reporters he opposed Boehner not because he wasn't conservative enough, but because he failed to give members enough input into legislation like the massive spending bill that passed in December. Conservatives were angry that the bill didn't do anything to block President Barack Obama's immigration executive order. Massie estimated there were between 10 and 50 House Republicans who could back an alternative to Boehner. Still, he said he was only confident that those who have publicly announced they opposed Boehner would actually follow through and vote for someone else on the House floor. Massie declined to tell reporters on Monday night who he was supporting. Indiana Rep. Marlin Stuzman, another conservative Boehner critic, told reporters Monday he was still deciding who to back and was hoping he and others trying to force a change in leadership could agree on a ""consensus candidate."" Boehner's allies say they aren't worried about him losing his job and GOP members across the ideological spectrum left the first meeting of all House Republicans on Monday night predicting the Speaker would be re-elected. Even Texas Rep. Roger Williams, who told CNN he didn't always support Boehner, said he thought the Speaker would overcome the challenge, and that he deserved a chance to shepherd a conservative agenda through a new session. At a time when GOP leaders want to turn the page on the dysfunction that has dominated Capitol Hill, this latest effort feeds into the familiar narrative that played out over the past four years that Boehner can't control his conference. ""This is a last moment sideshow,"" Rep Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Boehner supporter, told CNN. He added: ""the sad thing is it distracts from what our messages ought to be. We ought to be talking about the Republican agenda -- about the possibilities now that we have the Senate -- about Keystone, about fixes on Obamacare, trade regulatory reform."" Michael Steel, a spokesman for the Speaker, said Boehner is ""confident he'll remain the Speaker."" Indeed, Boehner has laid a groundwork for being re-elected. He reached out individually by phone to House GOP members after the midterms and was the party's top fundraiser in 2014, collecting chits along the campaign trail. According to his political staff, the Speaker brought in over $100 million over the 2014 cycle, and traveled extensively for members and candidates, attending 150 events. In Monday evening's meeting in the Capitol basement, Boehner didn't specifically address his critics. But he made a general pitch to his fellow Republicans on the need to stay united in the new Congress, according to several GOP members who attended the session. He noted his party had a real opportunity to get some of their top priorities done if they worked as a team. Still, some outside groups are trying to whip up a grassroots campaign to get conservative activists to call in and demand members vote against Boehner. FreedomWorks, a group with strong tea party ties, is part of this effort, but Boehner supporters say this group and others who have been critical of the Speaker have a history of seizing on internal feuds to raise money. Boehner slammed some of these conservative groups out after the 2013 government shutdown, arguing they are more concerned with their elevating their own profile than helping the GOP govern effectively. South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who didn't vote for Boehner in 2013, wouldn't say how he would vote on Tuesday. But he appeared to criticize the anti-Boehner forces for not standing up and saying they wanted someone else earlier this fall. ""We had an election for Speaker in November and no one opposed John Boehner. I find it hard to believe that those folks who really don't like Mr. Boehner today suddenly discovered they didn't like him between November and today,"" Mulvaney said. In addition to his own political problems, Boehner is also opening the new Congress grappling with a scandal caused by a top Republican ally. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, the third ranking House GOP leader who is tasked with counting votes, admitted last month he spoke to a white supremacist group in 2002. Scalise apologized and renounced the group, which has ties to former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke. Boehner stood behind him calling him a ""man of high integrity and good character."" But some Republicans outside Congress are calling on Scalise to step aside, to prevent any damage to the party's efforts to diversify its supporters. House Democrats are already using the Scalise story -- targeting 30 House Republicans in competitive districts and challenging them to publicly say whether or not they support him remaining in his post. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, asked Monday whether Scalise should stay, took a jab at the GOP, saying who Republicans choose as their elected leaders ""says a lot about who the conference is and what their priorities and values are."" He also repeatedly noted that Scalise had referred to himself as ""David Duke without the baggage,"" but said it's up to Republicans on who they elect as their leaders. As the former chair of a group of influential House conservatives, Scalise is viewed as Boehner's bridge to those on the right, so any effort to push him out could hurt the Speaker at a time he needs to hold conservative support to keep his own job. For now, Scalise seems poised to remain in the leadership. Republicans are facing high expectations as they take full control of Congress. Many House GOP members and outside groups are saying they expect many items -- such as changes to banking rules, Obamacare, environmental regulations -- that Senate Democrats blocked to sail through now that McConnell is in charge. That might be easier said than done since Senate Republicans will still have to rely on Democratic votes to overcome filibusters and pass legislation. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is a close personal friend of Boehner's said the Speaker will have to guide House members to concentrate on things that are doable. ""I think he has to tap down unrealistic initiatives and focus people on the tools we do have,"" Burr told reporters, mentioning using spending bills to strip away money for programs or limit the Administration's actions. CNN's Dana Bash, Adam Levy and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","House will vote Tuesday on whether John Boehner will serve a third term as Speaker .

"The washing of feet was a radical act in Jesus' time. It is no less radical in the modern era, with Pope Francis' decision to break with the long-standing papal tradition of washing only priests' feet, to include women and non-Christians in the symbolic ceremony. The controversy began on Holy Thursday last year when Pope Francis washed the feet of two women and two Muslims at a juvenile detention center in Rome. Before this, modern Popes had only ever washed the feet of 12 priests at the Vatican, during the Mass for the Last Supper. WATCH: Pope Francis washes prisoners' feet . This year, Pope Francis visited a home for the elderly and disabled, the Fondazione Don Carlo Gnocchi, to wash the feet of ""12 disabled people of different ages, ethnicities and religious confessions,"" during a special Lord's Supper Mass, according to the Vatican. Those chosen for the special honor included a 16-year-old boy from Cape Verde who was paralyzed in a diving accident last year, a 19-year-old man and a 39-year-old woman diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and two 86-year-olds with mobility problems. The 78-year-old pope smiled at each of the people whose feet he washed, but clearly struggled to get up from his knees as he moved down the line; two assistants helped him to his feet. He appeared to tire towards the end of the short ceremony. The tradition of the pontiff washing his priests' feet is based on a passage of the Bible which says that Jesus attended to his disciples at the Last Supper, saying, ""If I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet."" (John 13:15) Vatican ecclesiastical rules say that only ""adult males"" may have their feet washed at the Mass of the Last Supper (according to the Roman Missal, 2002), following the biblical tradition that Jesus washed the feet of 12 men. The choice of 12 priests is also symbolic of Jesus' institution of the priesthood, which according to Catholic tradition, occurred at the Last Supper. For many years, however, bishops around the world received permission from the Vatican to wash the feet of women as well in their churches. In fact, when the now-Pope was Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Argentina, he washed the feet of young mothers at a maternity hospital in 2005. And it wasn't the first -- or last -- time his choice would provoke debate: In 2001, he washed and kissed the feet of 12 AIDS patients at a hospice in the Argentinian capital, and in 2008, he washed the feet of recovering drug addicts at a rehab center in the city. But until last year, no pope had dared to go against Vatican rules and choose anyone but priests for the Holy Thursday event. In choosing to change the practice, Francis is being as radical as Jesus was in his own time. ""According to the Talmud, the washing of feet was forbidden to any Jew except those in slavery,"" the US Conference of Catholic Bishops says in its Holy Thursday Mandatum. ""Jesus' action of washing the feet of his disciples was unusual for his gesture went beyond the required laws of hospitality (washing of hands) to what was, in appearance, a menial task."" By eschewing traditional practice, Pope Francis is emphasizing the spirit rather than the letter of the law -- something Jesus himself did by breaking with Jewish tradition in washing his disciples' feet. And the spirit, or meaning, behind washing the feet of another person is one of humility and service -- that through the act, the leader becomes a servant to his followers. The Vatican's Congregation for Divine Worship says that foot-washing ""represents the service and charity of Christ, who came 'not to be served, but to serve.'"" According to Vatican spokesman Father Thomas Rosica, Francis' gesture in 2013 was one of humility and service, intended to ""embrace those on the fringes of society."" From the beginning of his papacy, the pope himself has been on the ""fringes"" of long-standing Vatican protocol, for example by choosing to live outside of the papal palace and eschewing traditional papal garments and modes of transport. In breaking the rules of foot-washing at the Vatican, the Pope is acknowledging what has been a practice in local churches for some time, and also reminding Catholics that the important thing is not whose foot is being washed, but the spirit behind that gesture.","Pope Francis washed the feet of 12 people at a home for the elderly and disabled .

"The bright yellow ribbons are tied tightly to the metal bars of the main gate at Danwon High School. Nearby, they are attached to trees and posts. Altogether, there are thousands of them. More than 300 students from the school were on a field trip on the Sewol, the ferry that sank last week off the coast of South Korea. Most of them are dead or missing. The ribbons symbolize solidarity with the missing teenagers' families and hopes that some of the students -- who went to school in Ansan, a city near Seoul -- might still be found alive. The approach borrows from a practice that became popular in the United States during the Iranian hostage crisis that began in 1979. The tradition was used again in the United States during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In South Korea, the ribbons have also spread into the realm of social media. Many people have posted an image evoking them as their profile photos on services like Facebook and Naver. The image is a bold yellow square with a black border. In the center sits a simple design of a bow in black with a line of Korean written underneath. ""One small step, big miracle,"" it reads. Celebrities join in . The online movement was started Saturday by a local student club, according to The Korea Herald, an English-language newspaper in South Korea. The group wanted ""to support the families of the missing and offer a hopeful message to the Korean public that the missing passengers could still be found alive,"" the newspaper reported. Other variations of the yellow ribbon image have also begun to circulate on popular social media sites. And Korean celebrities have helped spread the word. The K-pop star G-Dragon posted an image of a yellow ribbon on his Twitter feed, and the actress Park Shin-hye changed her profile picture to a ribbon picture with the popular hashtag #prayforsouthkorea written underneath. Ribbons spread . Clusters of real ribbons have also reportedly sprung up in other cities, such as Seoul and Chuncheon. Some of the ribbons have messages and tributes written on them. FC Seoul, a top local soccer team, will don the ribbons for a Saturday game against the Jeonnam Dragons, according to local media. The hopes the ribbons symbolize are fading fast. Rescuers saved 174 people on April 16, the day the ship sank, but no other survivors have been found since. Divers say they have found no air pockets that could have kept people alive inside the submerged vessel. Raising donations . The ribbons are also being used as a rallying point to raise money for the families who are grieving or still anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. National soccer player Park Chu-young, Olympic figure skater Yuna Kim and LA Dodgers pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu each donated 100 million won (roughly $100,000), according to Wow TV, a local broadcaster. Naver, a popular Web search portal, has a yellow ribbon page allowing users to leave messages and make donations to a fund organized by the National Disaster Relief Association. The ribbon campaign ""evolved organically in the social media sphere and is the term people seem to be using in reference to all different kinds of efforts being made on behalf of the victims and families of the disaster,"" said Chung Seo-yoon, a representative from the association, which was founded in 1961 by media groups. The organization is aiming to raise 500 million won. So far, tens of thousands of people have donated, raising nearly 350 million won. Evolving symbol . In the United States, yellow ribbons were widely used to demonstrate a desire for the return of American hostages held in Tehran between 1979 and 1981. Before that, they had been associated with convicts returning from prison. According to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, the yellow ribbon practice originated in a modern folk legend, which was turned into a popular song, ""Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree,"" which was in turn transformed ""into a ritual enactment."" Since the Iranian hostage crisis, it has reportedly been picked up in other countries, for a variety of movements and causes. In its 1991 article, the American Folklife Center noted the ribbon's ability to take on new meanings: . ""Ultimately, the thing that makes the yellow ribbon a genuinely traditional symbol is ... its capacity to take on new meanings, to fit new needs and, in a word, to evolve.""","Yellow ribbons are tied to the gates of a school hit by the sinking .

"(CNN)A federal judge Monday blocked one of the most well-known tools used to crack down on illegal immigration by the man who calls himself America's toughest sheriff. Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio must stop enforcing Arizona's identify theft laws, U.S. District Judge David Campbell ruled Monday, granting a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed against Arpaio. The lawsuit, filed by the Puente immigrant rights group, argues that the laws are unconstitutional and have been used by Arpaio and his office to target undocumented immigrants in workplace raids. Arpaio's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In the past, he's defended the workplace raids and said his department has been forced to step in because federal authorities haven't done enough to enforce immigration laws. Campbell said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their argument that the state's identify theft laws are preempted by federal laws, and that Arpaio must stop enforcing the laws until a final decision is reached in the lawsuit. Carlos Garcia, executive director of Puente, described the judge's ruling Monday as an ""enormous victory."" ""Arpaio and (Maricopa County Attorney Bill) Montgomery are being stripped of the tools they use to illegally terrorize immigrant workers and families,"" he said in a statement. ""We hope that justice will continue to prevail, that not one more worker is arrested for providing for his or her family and that the racist, anti-immigrant machine for which Arizona is known is dismantled completely."" Arpaio's tough, headline-grabbing punishments have earned him diehard supporters and fiery opponents. He's issued pink underwear to the men detained in the county's jails and said he is saving taxpayers money by removing salt and pepper from prison meals. Last year, he said inmates who allegedly defaced American flags placed in their jail cells would be punished with a diet of bread and water. In 2013, a federal court in Phoenix ruled that Arpaio's handling of people of Latino descent was not tough enforcement of immigration laws but instead amounted to racial and ethnic profiling. The judge later ordered a federal monitor to keep tabs on Arpaio's office and make sure officers weren't racially profiling anymore. Last year, he filed a lawsuit against U.S. President Barack Obama over his executive actions on immigration. But a judge dismissed Arpaio's lawsuit in December, ruling that Arpaio didn't have standing to bring the lawsuit and couldn't show he'd been harmed by Obama's changes. In a court filing last month, Arpaio said he was disbanding his office's criminal employment unit, the squad that conducted the workplace raids, because federal court decisions had already blocked certain Arizona laws. CNN's Dave Alsup, Amy Roberts, Eric Bradner and  contributed to this report.","A federal judge rules that Sheriff Joe Arpaio can't enforce his state's identity theft laws .

"(CNN)When Wadha and her family abruptly fled from Iraq's Nineva province on a balmy August day, they left all their possessions behind. ""I left with nothing, only a bottle of water, and this shirt,"" says Majdi, Wadha's eldest son. The family traveled by foot for 15 days to reach the safety of Iraqi Kurdistan. Majdi's wife was pregnant, slowing their travel. By the time they arrived, 13 members of their family had been killed or kidnapped, including one 12-year-old girl. Today the surviving family members rely on plastic sheeting, cardboard and pallets for an improvised shelter. It was here that Majdi welcomed a baby girl into their family, and in just a few weeks, he and his family may have to move again as local authorities, hoping to get children back in school, move displaced families into temporary shelters. Many of these shelters are built of flimsy materials and some are missing walls, leaving families open to the chilly weather. It's a terrible decision Wadha and her family may have to make just as the freezing temperatures are expected to arrive: school or shelter? ""We don't need anything else,"" says Wadha, ""but, please, just help us for winter."" From northern Iraq to Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon, the continuing fighting across Syria and Iraq is forcing families to run, and those who survive do not have what they need to last the winter. At the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan, where I visited last year, the cold wind shakes the tents and the temperature drops to freezing. Drafty, damp shelters will spread illness and disease. While most of the year this desert city is bone dry, during winter the rain washes along the rocky ground. It can flood quickly, destroying what few things families still have and making even these sparse accommodations unlivable. In the past, floods have caused riots in the camp. There, a 10-year-old girl, Haya, said to me, ""We fear you are forgetting us. ... Have you ever thought of the children of Syria?"" Roughly 6.5 million children have been affected by the war in Syria, and 1.6 million children are refugees. Children represent fully half the 3 million refugees across the region. Many Syrians have sought refuge in Lebanon and Turkey. Neighboring countries are being overwhelmed by the influx of refugees who have nothing but the clothes they wear. Something as simple as a blanket can help a family adjust to their new situation, easing the burdens on their host communities. A blanket can keep out the cold during these harsh nights and make life as a refugee a little more bearable. When I was in Jordan, I met a man named Mohammed, who had fled after being threatened by militants. His life as a refugee was nothing like what he left in Syria. Like many refugees, his life wasn't too different from a middle-class American's. ""We had everything,"" he told me on my visit to Za'atari last year. He had a good job, a nice home and regular vacations with his family. Hanah, Mohammed's wife, told me, ""Helping my children with homework was the most difficult part of my day."" But the family was caught in the epicenter of the civil war. Their hometown, Da'raa, is nicknamed ""The Cradle of the Revolution."" Mohammed has scars and burns after being arrested and detained for six days. After getting out, he fled with his wife and seven children toward the Jordan border, fearing for their safety the whole way. The family's oldest daughter, 11-year-old Rama, told me  the road up and down mountains made her ""so scared I didn't talk."" In Dohuk, where Wadha and her family now live in Iraqi Kurdistan, 100 other families are seeking refuge. There is no proper sanitation, and people have taken to relieving themselves in the open air. Heavy rains have caused flooding. These unsanitary conditions, experts believe, will lead to the spread of disease. As much as half of the vulnerable population is likely to need medical care. Wadha and her son Majdi, with his wife, are hopeful that the family's 3-week-old baby will be among those who live through the winter. The family hasn't named the baby girl yet, in case she doesn't survive. Across the region, refugees need adequate shelter and other cold weather supplies such as coats, mattresses and blankets, boots and shoes, and socks and hats. World Vision is distributing kits with these materials. However, the need continues to grow. Wadha's family has survived a harrowing few months, but the hardest 40 days are yet to come.","More than 6 million children are affected by the war in Syria, Richard Stearns says .

"Lady Gaga has taken the MTV Video Music Awards stage covered in (fake) blood; wearing a dress made of meat and as her male alter-ego, Jo Calderone. But at the 2013 MTV VMAs, Miley Cyrus stole Gaga's outrageous performance crown.

"(CNN)Private spaceflight company SpaceX scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch Tuesday, in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the rocket's first stage on a floating platform. The next possible launch attempt is at 5:09 a.m. ET Friday, NASA said via Twitter, ""pending resolution of the issue."" NASA and SpaceX said the problem was with the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage, rather than the section it plans to try to land. ""During the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust vector actuators on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic abort. Engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look,"" said John Taylor, of SpaceX communications. The thrust vector control actuators are used to steer the rocket in flight. The second stage of the rocket delivers the payload -- in this case, supplies for the International Space Station -- to the desired orbit. SpaceX's attempt to land the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage has been the chief focus of interest ahead of its latest resupply mission. Recycling rockets . Traditionally, rockets have been designed to fall back to Earth after separating from the spacecraft they lifted, and then burn up on re-entry or crash into the ocean. The millions of dollars that go into the production of the rockets burn, too. SpaceX wants to pioneer a reusable rocket, a development that could change the economics of space travel. ""A fully and rapidly reusable rocket -- which has never been done before -- is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access,"" SpaceX said in a statement. The company has twice attempted soft landings of the Falcon 9's first stage on water. Those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from hypersonic to nearly zero, and deploy landing legs. In those tests, the rocket tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean, causing damage that made the rocket unusable. That was according to plan, SpaceX said. Landing on a moving target . When the launch happens, the company will try the same soft landing for the Falcon 9's first stage, but this time on a custom-built floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship. Landing on the platform ""is significantly more challenging"" than the water landings, the company said. For one, the platform is not anchored, and while it looks large from the ground, it is a rather small target for the 14-story-tall rocket. SpaceX described reentry and landing as ""trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm."" The company puts the odds of success at 50% at best. It adds, however, that this is just the first of a number of tests toward the goal of landing a rocket stage for reuse. As for the target, ""X"" marks the spot: The company will try to land the rocket stage on the SpaceX logo painted on the center of the floating platform. Keith Smith, of Britain's Royal Astronomical Society, told CNN the reason for using the platform -- despite the complications of landing on a moving target -- was that it should prevent any properties on Earth being damaged if the landing goes wrong. It's not unusual for a launch to be aborted, he said, since there are so many elements at play. ""The payload on this is so expensive to launch that you don't want to risk anything about it,"" he said. The timing of the next launch attempt will depend on how serious the problem is, he said. CNN's Rachel Crane contributed to this report.","Problem is with a thrust vector actuator on the second stage, Space X says .

"(CNN)NASA has come out with a new image that could become one of its most iconic ever. The Hubble Space Telescope revisited the so-called ""Pillars of Creation,"" which the space agency describes as ""three giant columns of cold gas bathed in the scorching ultraviolet light from a cluster of young, massive stars in a small region of the Eagle Nebula, or M16."" The previous photo of these pillars, taken in 1995, went on to stand out from all the rest of NASA's space images, the agency said.  ""The Hubble image is so popular that it has appeared in movies and television shows, on T-shirts and pillows, and even on a postage stamp."" In celebration of the telescope's upcoming 25th anniversary in April, Hubble returned to the pillars -- and this time with the latest high-definition tools. The new sharper and wider image was taken ""in near-infrared light, as well as visible light,"" NASA said.  ""The infrared view transforms the pillars into eerie, wispy silhouettes seen against a background of myriad stars. That's because the infrared light penetrates much of the gas and dust, except for the densest regions of the pillars. Newborn stars can be seen hidden away inside the pillars."" In 1995, the captured image gave insight into star formation. ""Nebulous star-forming regions like M16 are the interstellar neon signs that say, 'We just made a bunch of massive stars here,'"" said Paul Scowen of Arizona State University, who helped lead the original observations, in a post on NASA's website. The new image ""hints"" that these columns ""are also pillars of destruction,"" NASA said. ""The ghostly bluish haze around the dense edges of the pillars is material getting heated up and evaporating away into space,"" said Scowen.

"(CNN) -- Three days after the world watched a giant balloon fly through the air as a tearful family expressed fears that their 6-year-old boy could be inside, authorities announced what millions suspected: The whole thing was staged. The balloon is displayed at the sheriff's department in Fort Collins, Colorado, on Sunday. The ""Aha!"" moment that led authorities to realize what had happened was an interview with the family Thursday night on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" Sheriff Jim Alderden of Larimer County said Sunday. In the interview with Wolf Blitzer, filling in for King, the Heenes asked their son why he had not come out from hiding when they called his name. ""You guys said we did this for the show,"" the boy responded. On Sunday, Alderden called the incident a ""hoax,"" adding that investigators believe the evidence indicates that ""it was a publicity stunt"" by the family in hopes of ""better marketing themselves for a reality television show at some point in the future."" The parents, Richard and Mayumi Heene, met in a Hollywood acting school and ""put on a very good show for us,"" Alderden said. Authorities know there was ""a conspiracy"" between them, he added. He said charges are expected to be filed in the case. The couple's attorney told CNN affiliate KMGH that he hasn't seen any evidence beyond ""speculation,"" but the Heenes would turn themselves in if charges are filed. ""All I'm saying if you've got some reason to arrest him, let me know, he'll turn himself in,"" said Denver attorney David Lane referring to Richard Heene. ""If you got the goods, just tell me."" The sheriff said investigators also want to interview 25-year-old researcher Robert Thomas who worked with Richard Heene for about two months last spring. Thomas was paid by Gawker.com -- a popular gossip site -- to write about his experience with Heene for a story published on Saturday.  Watch Alderden tell how police recognized ""hoax"" » . In an interview arranged with the help of Gawker, Thomas told CNN Sunday that as a student at Colorado State University with an interest in electromagnetic studies, he sought out Heene for a job as a possible research assistant. He said he ended up as his ""stenographer,"" taking down Heene's ideas and proposals for reality-show pitches. Thomas said that at one point they were talking about the Roswell UFO incident of the late 1940s, when Heene said it would be easy to cook up ""a media stunt that would be equally profound as Roswell, and we could do so with nothing more than a weather balloon and some controversy."" Thomas said he wrote up the balloon idea, which he says did not involve any kids going missing, as a potential reality show episode. ""I didn't know that he was going to do something like this,"" Thomas told CNN Sunday. Thomas said he eventually quit working with Heene in May. The sheriff's announcement included an admission that authorities misled the media on Friday when they said they still believed it was not a hoax. After Falcon's remark on CNN Thursday night, ""it became very clear to us at that point that they were lying,"" Alderden said. The ""nonverbal responses"" and ""verbal cues"" from the children at that moment made it clear, Alderden said. But to get to the truth, ""it was very important during this time that they maintained their trust with us."" So investigators misled the media while they carried out their ""game plan"" of gathering the truth.  Watch body language expert analyze Heene interview » . That plan included pursuing separate interviews with the Heene parents and polygraph tests, partly by arguing that it could help end the media frenzy surrounding them, Alderden said. He added that by law he could not say whether those tests were taken. The Heenes have repeatedly denied any hoax. In an interview Friday with CNN's ""American Morning,"" Richard Heene said Falcon's remark was a reference to the media that had assembled in front of the family's home. Charges have not been filed, but authorities expect to recommend felony charges including conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant, Alderden said. They also plan to recommend a charge of filing a false police report, which is a misdemeanor.  Watch family lawyer: Clients ""presumed innocent"" » . He also said it is unlikely that someone convicted of these charges would face jail time.  Explainer: How 'balloon boy' drama began » . One of the key questions that remain unanswered, Alderden said, is: Where was Falcon as police searched for him? On Friday, Alderden said it had been determined that the boy was hiding in an attic in the garage, and had fallen asleep. Now, authorities are unsure. Alderden said the boy may not have even been in the home. ""The biggest error we made is when we searched the house very clearly we didn't search the house as thoroughly as we should,"" he said. Authorities had assumed a 6-year-old boy could not have reached that attic, he said, so they took the Heenes at their word that he had hidden there the whole time. The Heenes have previously appeared on the ABC program ""Wife Swap."" Richard Heene chases storms and brings the family along. After the Hollywood gossip Web site TMZ.com reported that the Heenes had been ""pitching a reality show about the wacky family,"" one of the networks mentioned -- TLC, which produces the show ""Jon and Kate plus 8"" -- told CNN that ""they approached us months ago, and we passed."" Heene has been described as a meteorologist, but his education ended at the high school level, Alderden said. Alderden also said authorities are concerned about the safety of the three children, ages 6, 8, and 10. In fact, authorities spoke with Mayumi Heene ""at length about domestic violence"" and the children's safety, Alderden said. ""But we didn't have enough that would allow us or Child Protection Services to physically take the kids from that environment."" iReport.com: ""Outraged"" over balloon hoax . A 911 call was made from the home earlier this year that led authorities to a ""suspicious circumstance"" that Alderden said may have involved ""domestic violence, perhaps against the wife."" Lane, the Heenes' attorney, told KMGH that he has ""no reason to believe they're anything but loving parents."" In an interview Friday with CNN's ""American Morning,"" the Heene parents -- looking exhausted -- expressed relief that their son was alive. ""I'm feeling very, very grateful that Falcon is among us,"" Richard Heene said. iReport.com: ""Balloon boy saga is symptom, not disease"" Mayumi Heene said that the family was sitting in their living room, distraught and terrified for missing Falcon, when he walked into the room. ""[It] felt like from nowhere. When I first saw him, I couldn't even believe it. I couldn't comprehend right away,"" she said, adding that the next moment she was ""just jumping, calling his name.""

Michael Pfleger, a visiting Catholic priest, mocked Obama's Democratic rival during a sermon at Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, Illinois. In the sermon, Pfleger wipes his eyes with a handkerchief and suggests that Sen. Hillary Clinton wept because she thought that as a white person and the wife of a former president, she was entitled to the presidency. Pfleger is a Catholic priest at St. Sabina Roman Catholic Church on Chicago's southwest side. He is also a friend of Trinity's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, from whom Obama distanced himself in April.  Watch Pfleger mock Clinton » . Obama said the Pfleger controversy made it clear that, as long as he remained a member of the Trinity congregation, remarks from the pulpit would be ""imputed"" to him, even if they conflicted with his personal views. Obama said he and his wife, Michelle, began discussing a departure from the church after Wright spoke at the National Press Club on April 28. During the appearance, Wright said that Obama had ""distanced"" himself the fiery pastor for political reasons. Wright, Obama's minister for about 20 years, drew unwanted attention for the campaign when videos of his fiery sermons surfaced. In the speeches, Wright suggested that the U.S. government may be responsible for the spread of AIDS in the black community and equated some American wartime activities to terrorism. Obama has said he was not present for the controversial sermons by Wright or Pfleger. His campaign condemned Pfleger's comments. ""That is why I am deeply disappointed in Father Pfleger's divisive, backward-looking rhetoric, which doesn't reflect the country I see or the desire of people across America to come together in common cause,"" he said in a statement Thursday. Obama said he and his wife had discussed and prayed on the issue with Trinity's senior pastor, the Rev. Otis Moss, and hoped that the decision would withdraw Trinity from the spotlight. ""Though we are saddened by the news, we understand that it is a personal decision,"" Moss said in a statement Saturday. ""We will continue to lift them in prayer and wish them the best as former members of our Trinity community,"" Some Obama supporters, including U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, said that disconnecting from the church signaled a chance for the campaign to move on. ""I think it bodes well for us in the general election that we can put whatever issues there were behind us in respect to the church,"" Wexler said.","Obama says it was clear that pulpit remarks would always be linked to him .

"(CNN) -- NASA has never flown a manned space shuttle mission. There was no Mars rover. People can make their own currency. From February 2009 through September 2010, someone using the name ""Erad3"" made these and a series of other assertions -- unusual at best, disturbed at worst -- on the website abovetopsecret.com. Erad3, according to site co-owner Mark Allin, was almost certainly Jared Lee Loughner, the 22-year-old man accused of killing six people and injuring 14 others last weekend, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona. The site, Allin said, focuses on ""alternative news"" and information ""not covered by the mainstream media."" Allin noted that all 130 messages from Erad3 were posted from Loughner's hometown of Tucson, and many of them bear a striking resemblance to postings made by Loughner on the popular social media site YouTube. Investigators are examining the postings on Allin's site, according to a law enforcement source. The messages from Erad3 -- riddled with grammatical errors -- often became the object of ridicule, scorn or sympathy from other contributors. ""The ranting about proof, (your) inability to make a coherent sentence gives you away red handed,"" one person wrote. ""It won't be long (until) you have been banned once again!"" ""You sound absolutely bonkers,"" added another. ""I think you're frankly schizophrenic,"" said a third. ""That's not an amateur opinion and not intended as an uninformed or insulting. ... You clearly make no sense and are unable to communicate. I really do care. Seek help before you hurt yourself or others or start taking your medications again, please."" Erad3 replied with a series of unrelated arguments before concluding with a brief expression of thanks for the writer's concern. None of Erad3's postings mentions Giffords or a desire for violence, unlike language used in documents found in Loughner's residence. They do, however, appear to reflect a strong urge to break free of any constraints -- real or imagined -- imposed by government officials. ""Every human who's mentally capable is always able to be treasurer of their new currency,"" he wrote at one point. ""If the treasury creates one new currency then why couldn't they create an infinite amount? Wouldn't (it) be beautiful to see your face on the new coins?""

"U.S. minorities now represent more than half of America's population under the age of 1, the Census Bureau said, a historic demographic milestone with profound political, economic and social implications. The bureau -- defining a minority as anyone who is not ""single race white"" and ""not Hispanic"" -- released estimates on Thursday showing that 50.4% of children younger than 1 were minorities as of July 1, 2011, up from 49.5% from the 2010 Census taken in April 2010. ""2011 is the first time the population of infants under age 1 is majority minority,"" said Robert Bernstein, a Census Bureau spokesman. The latest statistics -- which also count the national population younger than 5 as 49.7% minority in 2011, an increase from 49% in 2010 -- portend a future of a more racially diverse America, with new and growing populations playing more important roles politically and economically in years to come, analysts say. Like other analysts, Kenneth M. Johnson, senior demographer at the Carsey Institute and professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire, isn't surprised at the trend. ""We've known it was going to come, but the question was what year the ""crossover point"" would happen, he said. ""Little children are in the vanguard of all this change coming to America."" he said. Johnson sees the trend as an opportunity for more Americans to embrace diversity. More children are going to be exposed to a more diverse group of classmates, and that will affect attitudes and outlook. The changes are going to be felt first in hospitals, as well as schools, where an increasingly diverse child population has to be absorbed. Hospitals would need interpreters and translators, for example, Johnson said. English as a second language would be an educational priority. While many regions such as Atlanta have a diverse population, other regions lack racial and ethnic variety and will have to deal with a new kind of population, he said. In declining rural counties, he said, an influx of groups like Hispanics would serve to renew communities and changes would ensue. ""For a country that's aging, we need young workers, and the growth of the minority population will contribute to the size of the young adult workforce,"" he said. ""This is breathing new life into the United States."" Jeff Passell, senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, called the Census numbers ""a cumulative effect of 35 to 40 years of immigration"" bringing large numbers of Latinos, Asians and other immigrants into the United States. He said the Hispanic population in particular is very young, much more concentrated in child-bearing years, and has a higher fertility rate than the white, non-Hispanic population. Lately, he says, there are a lot more births among native Hispanics in the United States than new Hispanic immigrants, a ""cumulative effect"" of immigration. If the trend continues, Passell says several decades from now, possibly in the late 2030s or early 2040s, the U.S. population will become less than 50% non-Hispanic white. ""This is a trend that we can reasonably expect to continue. The factors that determine this have been set into motion, and in demography things tend to change gradually,"" he said. There were 114 million minorities in 2011, or 36.6% of the U.S. population, a bump of half a percentage point from 2010. The latest figures count Hispanics as the most populous and fastest growing minority group. They numbered 52 million in 2011, and their population grew by 3.1% since 2010. The U.S. Hispanic population grew from 16.3% in 2010 to 16.7% in 2011. ""California had the largest Hispanic population of any state on July 1, 2011 (14.4 million), as well as the largest numeric increase within the Hispanic population since April 1, 2010, (346,000),"" the Census said. ""New Mexico had the highest percentage of Hispanics at 46.7%. Los Angeles had the largest Hispanic population of any county (4.8 million) in 2011 and the largest numeric increase since 2010 (73,000). Starr County — on the Mexican border in Texas — had the highest share of Hispanics (95.6 percent)."" Asians numbered 18.2 million nationally in 2011, making them the second fastest-growing minority group -- up by 3% since 2010. Figures show that California had the largest Asian population of any state at 5.8 million and the largest increase since 2010 at 131,000. ""Hawaii is our nation's only majority-Asian state, with people of this group comprising 57.1%  of the total population. Los Angeles had the largest Asian population of any county (1.6 million) in 2011, and also the largest numeric increase (16,000) since 2010. At 61.2%, Honolulu had the highest percentage of Asians in the nation,"" the Census said. African-Americans are the second largest minority group in the United States at 43.9 million in 2011, an increase of 1.6% from 2010. New York has the largest black population of any state with 3.7 million and Texas has the largest increase from 2010 of 84,000. Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, has the largest black population of any county at 1.3 million. Fulton County, Georgia, which includes Atlanta, has the largest increase since 2010 at 13,000. The District of Columbia has the highest percentage of blacks at 52.2%. Mississippi has the second-largest at 38%. America's native population -- labeled ""American Indian and Alaska Native population"" by the Census -- was about 6.3 million in 2011, up 2.1% from 2010. California had the largest such population at 1,050,000 and the largest increase at 23,000. Alaska had the highest share at 19%. Los Angeles had the largest such population of any county, with 231,000, and the largest increase, 9,000 since 2010. The population classified as ""Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander"" was 1.4 million in 2011, up 2.9% since 2010. Hawaii had the largest such population of any state at 359,000 and the highest percentage at 26.1. California had the largest increase since 2010 at 9,000. Honolulu has the largest population of any county at 235,000.  Los Angeles County had the largest increase since 2011 at 2,700. Of single race non-Hispanic whites, California had the largest population at 15 million. Texas had the largest increase since 2010 at 80,000. Maine had the highest percentage of the non-Hispanic white alone population, 94.3 percent. Four states and the District of Columbia have predominantly minority populations, Hawaii, at 77%, the District of Columbia at 64.7%, California, at 60.3%, New Mexico, at 59.8%, and Texas, at 55.2%. Minorities comprised the majority population in 11%  of the nation's 3,143 counties. Michael White, professor of sociology at Brown University, said the rise of minorities fits into a longer-term evolution of the U.S. population, a mosaic that has been adapting to ethnic change since the first Census was recorded in 1790. There have been many groups represented over time, from enslaved and indigenous peoples, those of European stock, and now to a population reflecting the wider world -- truly a ""melting pot,"" he said. White says it's hard to say how the changes will affect politics and that one can't assume that ethnic patterns will determine voting patterns. Local economic issues, for example, will evolve differently in different states and cities, and there are economic benefits of having a younger population, he said. ""The political dimensions will play out differently,"" he said. And by the time the babies are old enough to cast ballots, ""the United States will be a different place when they are walking into a voting booth."" William Frey, Brookings Institution demographer, sees political challenges for new immigrants and an economy benefiting from their presence. Many Hispanics and Asians are too young to vote or can't cast ballots because they haven't become citizens. ""It's going to take perhaps awhile before the younger people get more engaged in politics. They do have an impact in some places, like swing states, such as Nevada, Colorado and Florida. They can make a difference,"" he said. He, too, says that newcomers to the United States bring an energy that invigorates the economic system and an older society. ""I think we're going to just see that the younger part of the population will have a different vibe,"" he said. ""They are sort of needed to help our youthful image and to add to that vitality. They will bring a dimension and element we sorely need.""","Hispanics are most populous and fastest growing minority group, the Census says .

"(CNN) -- The World Health Organization says the current Ebola epidemic trend ""shows a mixed picture"" in Africa, according to a statement released early Tuesday. Liberia has reported 16 new cases with nine deaths. Sierra Leone has had 34 new cases and 14 deaths since last week. The WHO statement suggests the growing number of cases in these countries means that there is still a problem with active viral transmission. There has been some progress in Guinea. WHO says there has been a reduction in the number of new cases reported in Guinea. In fact, it has been a week since a new case has been reported in that country. There have, however, been two deaths reported. With their countries facing an Ebola epidemic, the health ministers of 11 African nations have agreed to a joint strategy to try to stem its deadly advance. As part of the plan, the World Health Organization will set up a ""sub-regional control center"" in Guinea -- one of the three West African nations at the heart of the outbreak -- to help coordinate the response. The strategy was announced last week at the end of a two-day summit in Ghana that brought together ministers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Uganda with health experts, Ebola survivors and WHO representatives. It also calls for better surveillance and reporting of cases, the mobilization of community and political leaders to improve awareness and understanding, and greater cross-border communication. WHO has previously warned that ""drastic action"" is needed to halt the spread of the virus, which can kill up to 90% of those infected. Addressing the closing session, Dr. Luis Gomes Sambo, WHO regional director for Africa, welcomed the move. ""It's time for concrete action to put an end to the suffering and deaths caused by Ebola virus disease and prevent its further spread,"" he said. WHO reports there have been 844 cases, including 518 deaths, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as of July 6. 'Enormous' impact . The impact of the outbreak, which began in March, ""has been enormous in terms of loss of human lives and negative socioeconomic effects,"" Sambo said. The disease's spread ""is in great extent associated with some cultural practices and traditional beliefs"" that run counter to preventive health measures, he said. According to a WHO statement, such traditional practices foster ""mistrust, apprehension and resistance"" in local populations regarding health workers' efforts. These include the hiding and treatment at home of Ebola victims and funerals at which mourners touch the body of the deceased. ""These are very high-risk practices leading to extensive exposures to Ebola virus in the community,"" the statement said. Sambo added, ""The extensive movement of people within and across borders has facilitated rapid spread of the infection across and within the three countries."" He also paid tribute to those on the front lines of the fight against the deadly disease, saying health workers have been ""disproportionately affected,"" with more than 60 cases and 32 deaths reported among their ranks. What you need to know about Ebola . Uganda takes steps . Uganda's health authorities, who took part in the summit in Ghana, announced new measures Friday to screen people arriving from Ebola-affected countries. ""All border posts have been told to intensify disease surveillance check points,"" Ugandan Health Minister Ruhakana Rugunda said. ""Special focus is on anyone with travel history of the past three months from the three West African countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia."" Although no travel ban is in place, Ugandan residents have also been urged to limit nonessential travel to those three countries. Rugunda said Uganda, which has experience in dealing with Ebola outbreaks, most recently in 2012, had been asked by WHO to provide technical assistance in the latest battle to contain the virus. Internal, external hemorrhaging . Ebola is a violent killer. The symptoms, at first, mimic the flu: headache, fever, fatigue. What comes next sounds like something out of a horror movie: significant diarrhea and vomiting while the virus shuts off the blood's ability to clot. As a result, patients often suffer internal and external hemorrhaging. Many die in an average of 10 days. People are traveling without realizing they're carrying the deadly virus. It can take between two and 21 days after exposure for someone to feel sick. The good news is that Ebola isn't as easily spread as one might think. A patient isn't contagious -- meaning they can't spread the virus to other people -- until he or she is showing symptoms. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with the blood and body fluids of infected animals or people, according to WHO. The scientist who discovered the Ebola virus in the 1970s, Dr. Peter Piot, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour this week that the situation is ""unprecedented."" ""One, (this is) the first time in West Africa that we have such an outbreak,"" he said. ""Secondly, it is the first time that three countries are involved. And thirdly, it's the first time that we have outbreaks in capitals, in capital cities."" Officials believe the wide footprint of this outbreak is partly because of the proximity between the jungle where the virus was first identified and cities such as Conakry, Guinea's capital, which has a population of 2 million and an international airport. Complicating matters, the countries hit hardest by the epidemic have major medical infrastructure challenges. There is no cure for Ebola, but in theory, the disease should be easy to fight since close contact is needed to become infected, Piot said. Simple hygienic measures such as washing with soap and water, not reusing syringes and avoiding contact with infected corpses are sufficient to stop spread of the disease, Piot said. ""This is an epidemic of dysfunctional health systems,"" he added. ""Fear of the virus, and the lack of trust in government, in the health system, is as bad as the actual virus.""

"(CNN)More than 18 months ago, the body of Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd had been shot seven times near a pile of construction waste. The semipro football player for the Boston Bandits was 27. Days after he was found dead, then-NFL star Aaron Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder. Testimony in the case against Hernandez began this week. Hernandez also faces murder charges in a 2012 double homicide. He has pleaded not guilty. The charges mark the latest turn in Hernandez's downward spiral. Just two years ago, he was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends, inking a $40-million contract extension with the New England Patriots. Friends and fans alike wonder: How could the star player who had more than 900 receiving yards in 2011 now be on trial for murder? From 'golden boy' to behind bars . Long before Hernandez made national headlines, he was a standout athlete in Bristol, Connecticut, who came from a family described as a local sports dynasty. ""I don't think there was another family that was more familiar in Bristol,"" Bob Montgomery, who covers high school sports for the Bristol Press, told CNN. The young Hernandez was the ""golden boy,"" playing football, basketball and running track, following in the footsteps of his uncle, older brother and father -- all well-known athletes in the community. Hernandez's father constantly pushed his son, requiring him to practice for hours before he could go out with friends. ""I saw a closeness with them that I'd never seen before,"" Montgomery said of the relationship between Hernandez and his father. But his father, the man who kept the 16-year-old anchored, died from complications after a routine surgery. Hernandez left high school halfway through his senior year in January 2007 to join the University of Florida Gators, and trouble seemed to follow. In just his first semester, a police report says Hernandez got into a fight at an off-campus restaurant, sucker-punching the manager and rupturing his eardrum. The following fall, there was a shooting near a local club. Police reports link Hernandez and several other University of Florida football players to an argument in the parking lot. Hernandez was one of more than 20 people interviewed by police, and he was the only one who did not make a statement after invoking his right to counsel. At the time, Hernandez's mother told the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, ""I know he was at the club, but he never saw any shooting."" The case remains open, and no one has been charged. Hernandez was also suspended at least once for marijuana, an issue that would follow him as he entered the draft his junior year. Trying to put the alleged drug use behind him, Hernandez wrote a letter to the Patriots director of personnel. ""If you draft me as a member of the New England Patriots, I will willfully submit to a bi-weekly drug test throughout my rookie season. ... In addition, I will tie any guaranteed portion of my 2010 compensation to these drug tests and reimburse the team a pro-rata amount for any failed drug test,"" he wrote, according to the Boston Globe. Before the draft, Hernandez was expected to be a first- or second-round pick. He was passed over until the fourth round, when the Patriots selected him. By the end of his second season, he was a bona fide star, landing the $40 million contract extension. Less than a year after signing the deal, however, the Patriots dropped him on the day he was charged with Lloyd's murder. The killing of Odin Lloyd . When Odin Lloyd pulled up in a black Chevrolet suburban, Boston Bandits coach Mike Branch thought something was out of place. Lloyd didn't own a car. Aaron Hernandez case: Who's who? Branch had his suspicions, but he couldn't get answers. Lloyd was too busy telling his friends about the good time he had at the club the previous night. ""He said he was at the club with Mr. Hernandez, and that they were partying and he had a good time, and that Mr. Hernandez spent a good amount of money,"" Branch recalled. Lloyd said Hernandez spent about $10,000 that night. Lloyd's friends say he wasn't a big partier. He was more passionate about football and family. Remembering Odin Lloyd . Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins, the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the all-American who made it. Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna, who's engaged to Hernandez and the mother of his little girl. On June 16, 2013, Lloyd was riding with friends in the black suburban, which police later learned was rented by Hernandez. Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez, asking to hang out later that night. As they parted ways, Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later. The next day, Lloyd's body was found. Prosecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima. Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m. At the same time, chilling text messages from Lloyd's phone were sent to his sister telling her he was with ""Nfl,"" adding, ""just so u know."" Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m., workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29, a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway, about a half a mile from the death scene. Three people got out of the car, and Lloyd was not one of them. Nine days later, Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapon-related charges. He has pleaded not guilty. In April, Ortiz and Wallace were also charged in Lloyd's slaying. They, too, have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say the three men are being tried in a joint venture, a legal term that means it's not necessary to prove who pulled the trigger as long as there is evidence that each defendant actively participated in Lloyd's murder. As the trial for the death of Lloyd has neared, lawyers have been arguing about evidence, including cell phones and text messages. Some rulings are victories for the defense. The jury won't see the text Lloyd sent to his sister, telling her he was with ""Nfl."" The judge ruled it hearsay and said the state hasn't proven Lloyd believed his life was in danger. Jurors also won't hear anything about what happened in Boston on July 16, 2012 -- the night two men were murdered outside a club where Hernandez had been. The judge agreed with defense lawyers that it's far too prejudicial and irrelevant to Lloyd's murder. Did spilled drink lead to slaying? Investigators allege Hernandez shot and killed Daniel Abreu and Safiro Furtado because one bumped into him on a nightclub dance floor and spilled his drink. District Attorney Patrick Haggan described the scene in a Massachusetts courtroom in May, saying Hernandez became ""angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. Abreu smiled and did not apologize."" Prosecutors: Bump, spilled drink led to double homicide . Hernandez's friend tried to calm him down, and the pair walked outside and eventually entered a second club across the street, the prosecutor said. Court documents identify that friend as Alexander Bradley, who would go on to accuse Hernandez of shooting him in the eye in an incident that would take place seven months later. (If Bradley testifies during the trial for the murder of Lloyd, he cannot talk about allegedly being shot by Hernandez, the judge ruled). After leaving the second nightclub, Hernandez and the friend returned to their SUV and pulled over on a nearby street where Hernandez removed a revolver from the engine block, Haggan said. Hernandez began trailing Abreu, Furtado and three of their friends in his SUV, authorities said. He then pulled up to the victims' car at a red light and leaned out the driver's side window with a loaded revolver, Haggan told the court. Hernandez allegedly said, ""Yo, what's up now,"" followed by a racial slur, and fired at least five rounds from a .38-caliber revolver, Haggan said. Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado was sitting in the front passenger seat and suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including one to the head, Haggan said. Hernandez was charged in the double homicide in May, and he pleaded not guilty. Investigators found evidence they believe links him to the 2012 slayings while investigating the death of Lloyd. As for the Lloyd case, Hernandez's lawyers contend the circumstantial evidence has gaps. ""There's certainly a lot of what I would call smoke. There's no doubt about it,"" defense lawyer Jamie Sultan said during a June 16 hearing. ""But that's not probable cause that he committed murder. And you can't just throw a bunch of stuff against the wall and say that's good enough."" Now, a jury will decide. There is a gag order prohibiting the defense and prosecution from commenting on the case. Hernandez's lawyers and mother declined to be interviewed, but both predict he will be cleared. It's a possibility that haunts Lloyd's loved ones. ""That's my biggest fear,"" Michael Branch, Lloyd's former coach and mentor, said. ""All it takes is one juror."" CNN's Laura Dolan, Kristi Ramsay and Michelle Rozsa contributed to this report.","Jury selection begins this week in trial for murder of Odin Lloyd .

"(CNN)Authorities in Scotland are looking for whomever abandoned a mixed-breed dog outside a railway station, along with a suitcase containing his food and other belongings. The Scottish SPCA is appealing for information on Facebook after the male shar-pei crossbreed was discovered Friday night, tied to a railing outside the Ayr train station. Beside him was a suitcase with some of the dog's belongings, including a pillow, toy, a bowl and food. Heart-tugging photos of the forlorn dog attracted thousands of shares and sympathetic comments on social media, with many people condemning his former owner. ""Poor lad, what a thing to do to him,"" wrote one woman on Facebook. ""I hope his future is brighter."" SPCA Inspector Stewart Taylor said the dog is microchipped, allowing authorities to find out his name: Kai. The SPCA contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who said they had sold Kai online in 2013 but did not know the address of the person who bought him. ""This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about,"" Taylor said in a post on the Scottish SPCA's website. ""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible."" A woman from Aberdeenshire, Scotland, told the Daily Record on Friday that the dog's abandonment was the result of an attempted sale gone wrong. The woman said she responded to an online ad and agreed to buy the dog for about $600 but changed her mind once she arrived at the Ayr train station to meet the seller. ""I went to buy a dog but the dog was not the same as the picture advertised,"" she told the Record. The seller then took off in his car, leaving the pooch, she said. The woman said she considered taking the dog home but panicked and left him tied to the railing because she had to catch the last train to Aberdeen with her daughter, who suffers from asthma. Meanwhile, the SPCA has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt the dog. Taylor of the SPCA said Kai is about two to three years old and is ""a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home."" Some people noted that Kai's plight echoes that of Paddington, the fictional bear in a series of popular kids' books, who was adopted by a family after they found him sitting on his suitcase at Paddington Railway Station in London. Abandoning an animal is an offense under Scotland's Animal Health and Welfare Act, and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or even life.","Woman claims dog's abandonment was result of an attempted sale gone wrong .

"(CNN)Almost two years since the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly placed two bombs at the Boston Marathon finish line, turning the city's beloved Patriot's Day race into a war zone, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is finally going on trial. By the time the brothers were captured (one dead, one alive), they were accused of having killed four people, blown the limbs off another 16 and injured more than 260. But while I have heard many say they wish the authorities had simply added the younger Tsarnaev brother to the list of the deceased while they had the chance, that didn't happen. So now we find ourselves facing down a trial. Tsarnaev will be convicted (after all, the prosecution has, according to The New York Times, lined up 590 law enforcement witnesses, 142 civilians and more than 1,000 exhibits, including images of him placing his backpack -- believed to have contained a bomb -- near an 8-year-old killed by the explosion). But it is unclear what the punishment will be. That raises what is perhaps the key question of the case: Should we kill Tsarnaev? And the answer, despite the abhorrent nature of the crime, is simple: No, we should not. We are better than that. The fact is that the death penalty isn't justice, it's revenge. And in seeking it out, we would be engaging in something Tsarnaev is alleged to have sought in the name of Muslims killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. (He made his motive clear when he scrawled ""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop"" as he hid from police in a boat.) Indeed, the death penalty is nothing more than institutionalized revenge. And while seeking revenge makes for great action movies, in real life it lowers our own standards. And we have set our standards very high in Massachusetts, including having abolished the death penalty three decades ago. In fact, no one has been executed in Massachusetts for 67 years. It goes without saying that this is a deeply painful time for family and friends who lost loved ones that day, but research does suggest that executions do not give victims' families closure. Getting revenge won't bring back the lives that were lost, and state-sanctioned killing is not how we do things here. And it isn't how we want things done, either. In a Boston Globe poll in September 2013, for example, only a third favored the death penalty over life without parole for Tsarnaev. I've been disappointed that our leading politicians -- Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, and our new mayor, Marty Walsh, both opponents of the death penalty -- have failed to speak out clearly against the federal government for seeking the death penalty in this case. Indeed, even though Attorney General Eric Holder is personally against the death penalty, he authorized it in this case, and plea deals to avoid the death penalty have so far failed. I guess it's easier to be outspoken against the death penalty when you're not defending an alleged terrorist, but instead pointing out the alarming number of death row prisoners who have been wrongly convicted. Or that according to some, it costs 10 times more to try to execute someone than put them in jail for life. Or that it doesn't actually appear to deter crime. Or that the Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment and the Supreme Court has already ruled against the death penalty in cases against the mentally ill or minors. And with that in mind, it's important to remember in this case that the defense will not be eyeing an acquittal, rather a sentence that spares Tsarnaev's life. To make this case, the defense attorneys will no doubt delve deep into his personal history, the evidence that his older brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind, and that Dzhokhar was under his brother's spell. Perhaps most importantly, it should be remembered that in defending Tsarnaev, they are not endorsing him, but instead are endorsing our collective humanity and our Constitution, fighting for even the worst among us to be afforded its consideration and its protection. My husband and I have lived in the Boston area for 18 years, we have run many marathons, and like so many folks, we had friends who were injured when those bombs when off. What struck us so profoundly about the attack, though, was not the destruction and devastation, but our response. Our response was profound and full of courage. First responders went running toward the blast areas to help. Runners, many of whom were doctors or veterans who had just finished running 26.2 miles, carried the injured to safety or ran to emergency rooms to help tend to the wounded. It's that kind of resolve that defined the day, not the attack itself. Greater Boston, an area of millions, became a community of one: a ""Boston Strong"" community. And after the bombings, we took our kids to the makeshift memorial at Copley Square, we donated to the One Fund, we cried as we watched the interfaith memorial service held just days after the blast. A year later, we joined millions of people along the race course and cheered on the 36,000 runners who ran one year after the bombing. Running the race again was a way to reclaim both the day and the finish line. Like marathoners, the survivors have pushed ahead one step at a time, and in their own ways: starting foundations, getting married, and learning to dance and run again. And this is what we should keep doing -- moving forward, leaving the attackers in the dust, forgotten in a cell somewhere to live with what has been done. Revenge is by its very nature a backward-looking emotion. If we are to truly leave that atrocious act behind us, we should therefore shun it, and instead keep putting our best foot forward, looking to our future, not behind us. If we do that, we will be the stronger ones -- Boston Strong.","Mel Robbins: Death penalty isn't justice, it's revenge .

"(CNN)Dozens of militants -- believed to be ISIS members -- attacked several Iraqi security posts and checkpoints in western Iraq's Anbar province Tuesday morning, leaving at least 11 people dead and 18 others wounded, security officials in Iraq said. The attacks, involving a suicide bomber, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, happened in the town of Jubbat al Shamiya, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Baghdad, security officials in the Anbar capital of Ramadi said. Anbar is a western province largely controlled by ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Sunni Muslim extremist group that has used brutal tactics such as mass kidnappings, beheadings and other abuses against civilians and armed foes to capture vast swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria in the past few years. Most of those killed and wounded in Tuesday's attacks were Iraqi security force and local Awakening Council members, the security officials said. Awakening Councils, also known as the Sons of Iraq and Sahawat, are made up of Sunni Muslim fighters who turned against al Qaeda and have been active in Iraq since 2006. The U.S.-backed councils were credited as being a major factor in a drop in violence across Iraq a few years ago, after the strife that followed the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003. But council members recently have become targets for ISIS, which has waged war to establish what it says is an Islamic caliphate. Also Tuesday, ISIS militants attacked the Albu Risha police station in northern Ramadi, killing several police officers and injuring at least two other people, the security officials said. The battle for the station began early Tuesday, the Ramadi security officials said. After about two hours of clashes between ISIS militants and police officers, ISIS managed to take over the station. Ramadi is about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Baghdad. The Anbar capital has been one of the province's few holdouts against ISIS. Anbar is home to Al Asad Air Base, where 320 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, are stationed as part of an effort to advise and assist Iraqi forces fighting ISIS. ISIS' campaign, and the military response to it by Iraqi forces supported by air power from a U.S.-led international coalition, left a bloody toll in Iraq in 2013. At least 17,049 civilians were recorded killed in Iraq last year, roughly double the number recorded in 2013, according to the Iraq Body Count monitoring project. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Militants attacked checkpoints with suicide bombing, grenades and guns, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Dueling theories of how the universe was created got a split decision Friday night from the Texas Board of Education, which required examination of ""all sides of scientific evidence"" in new science standards, but rejected language requiring teachers to teach the ""strengths and weaknesses"" of scientific theories. A woman stands in front of a mural depicting the development from ape to computer user. The debate pitted proponents of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution against supporters of religion-based theories of intelligent design, or creationism. ""Science loses. Texas loses, and the kids lose because of this,"" board chairman Don McLeroy, a creationist, told the Dallas Morning News. A final 13-2 vote approved language that will be printed in textbooks beginning in 2011 and remain there for 10 years, CNN affiliate KPRC-TV in Houston reported: . ""In all fields of science, analyze, evaluate, and critique scientific explanations by using empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and experimental observation and testing, including examining all sides of scientific evidence of those explanations so as to encourage critical thinking by the students."" Earlier, the board rejected two sections written by McLeroy on identical 8-7 votes, the Dallas Morning News said. One section required teachers to ""analyze, review, and critique scientific explanations, including hypotheses and theories, as to their strengths and weaknesses using scientific evidence and information,"" and the other required high school students to study the ""sufficiency or insufficiency"" of key principles of evolution. Opponents were pleased with the board's action on McLeroy's sections, but unsatisfied with the final result. ""The phrase has been an open door to religious indoctrination in public schools,"" Mark Finkelstein, a lawyer with the Anti-Defamation League, told KPRC, referring to the ""strengths and weaknesses"" phrase in the material voted down. ""This document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into Texas classrooms,"" Kathy Miller, president of the Texas Freedom Network, told the Dallas Morning News. She predicted battles over textbooks in the coming years, a prediction McLeroy bolstered. Publishers, he said, will ""have to get their textbooks approved by us in a few years."" The size of the textbook market in Texas gives it influence nationwide, as publishers adapt their material to its standards. Darwin's theory of evolution proposes that humans evolved over millions of years from animal species -- including, most famously, early primates that also are the ancestors of modern-day apes. Such thinking, which challenged religious accounts of a deity creating humans, was considered radical, even blasphemous, when Darwin published it in 1859. Central to Darwin's thesis was his scientific explanation of life's diversity: that natural selection is enough to explain the evolution of all species. The scientific community has overwhelmingly scorned creationism and its latest incarnation, intelligent design, as a pretext for biblical explanations of how the world came to be, and asserts that there is no weakness or doubt in the scientific community about evolution. Last year, the National Academy of Sciences called for the public to be better informed about the importance of understanding and teaching evolution. The academy released a booklet titled ""Science, Evolution, and Creationism"" -- the third explanation of evolution put out since 1984 by one of the nation's leading scientific organizations. However, those who take issue with evolution believe it should be treated with healthy skepticism and argue that having high school students question a scientific theory overwhelmingly accepted by scientists teaches them critical thinking. ""This debate will impact whether students are taught to think critically and scientifically when you learn about evolution. It's important for students to learn how to think like scientists and not be forced to treat these controversial topics like a dogma,"" Casey Luskin, a policy analyst with the Discovery Institute, a group that questions the theory of evolution, said in an article in the San Antonio Express-News. Proponents of evolution say the dogma is on the other side, with the Discovery Institute and others purposely distorting and ignoring scientific evidence to reach their desired conclusion. For decades, the teaching of evolution in public schools has been a flash point in some states, with proponents of ideas such as creationism and intelligent design trying to gain a place in science classes. The issue has been before school officials, legislators and courts in Alabama, Kansas, Kentucky, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana and Virginia. The controversy over the teaching of intelligent design came to a head in Pennsylvania, where the Dover School Board voted that ninth-grade students must be read a statement encouraging them to read about intelligent design. A federal judge said the board violated the Constitution in doing so because intelligent design is religious creationism in disguise and injecting it into the curriculum violates the constitutional separation of church and state. ""Academic freedom"" bills have emerged but failed in various state legislatures, the National Center for Science Education said. An ""academic freedom"" act has been adopted as law in Louisiana, and there is legislation in Florida calling for an ""academic freedom"" bill that would mandate a ""thorough presentation and critical analysis of the scientific theory of evolution."" The center says such bills are strategies by creationists to appeal to the American sense of balance, and give the false sense that there are different sides to scientific issues such as evolution. ""Two plus 2 is not 5,"" said the group's spokesman, Robert Luhn.","Texas Board of Education votes on science curriculum amendments .

"My list of reasons why I'm glad my girls, ages 5 and 7, were too young to ever get into ""Hannah Montana"" grew exponentially longer after Miley Cyrus' unforgettable ""twerking"" in a bra and undies at MTV's Video Music Awards. ""Miley, what exactly were you thinking?"" pretty much sums up the sentiment I heard from outraged moms and dads around the country who believe Cyrus, whose loyal fan base includes a huge chunk not yet old enough to drive, should know better. ""It's a damn shame that Miley is doing this to herself, making a vulgar joke out of her talents and her beauty, but it's a much bigger shame that she's doing it to her young fans and other young people (who) see her in the media,"" said Heidi Cardenas, a mom of two teenage boys, in response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page. ""It's the same thing as going to any street corner in America and selling herself for money,"" said Cardenas. ""I have to instantly think that Miley does not either a) care what her younger fans think of her or b) hasn't even bothered to think of what her actions (are) doing to her image,"" said Larene Grady, a mom of two whose tween was ""absolutely infatuated"" with Cyrus but isn't anymore. ""She thinks Miley does not appeal to children (who) used to like her as 'Hannah Montana,' which speaks volumes coming from a 10-year-old who had two 'Hannah Montana' parties, everything from bed sheets, pajamas, bath soaps, toothbrushes and book bags,"" Grady added, also in response to a tout on CNN's Facebook page. Miley Cyrus twerks, stuns VMAs crowd . ""Hannah Montana"" seems about as relevant to the current day Cyrus as a typewriter is to millenials. The 20-year-old has every right to chart a new course beyond her Disney days, moms and dads said in comments on Facebook and exchanges via e-mail. It's just that the path she is choosing seems so wrong and dangerous, many said. Sonia Prince of Nashua, New Hampshire, said her kids -- ages 9, 12 and 13 -- will no longer be listening to Cyrus' music. ""There is enough fantastic music out there with people who have respectful behavior, especially women who don't feel the need to be sexual in public in order to be successful,"" she added. Cyrus' choice to wear next to nothing and strut around the VMA stage is yet another example, frustrated parents say, of the sexualization of our young girls, an issue we touched on at CNN.com just a few weeks ago in our piece on how too many tween fashions are too sexy, skimpy and short. ""I do think Miley wrongly represents the way girls should act today,"" said Steve, a CNN commenter who shared his first name and the fact that he has a 12-year-old granddaughter. ""The way they dress, act, not caring about how other people may respond to your actions,"" Steve added. ""I think it is an oversexualization of young girls/young women."" Robin Belkin, a mom of three in Northern California, believes Cyrus' performance only adds to the already ""damaging image of women-as-sex-objects."" ""I just find it extremely discouraging and difficult to hold out hope for the improved status of women in this world when even the most entitled among us so negatively reinforce the worst stereotypes and misogynistic attitudes about women,"" said Belkin. Opinion: Miley Cyrus is sexual, get over it . ""Her behavior sets 50 to 60 years of women's forward progress back a long way when you consider that her huge fan base really only consists of young and impressionable girls and horny young boys, who, unfortunately on many levels, are our future leaders,"" said John Rodrigues of Boston, in response to a request for comment on CNN's Facebook page. ""Growing up under the impression that this behavior is not only OK, but acceptable, is such a terrible message and, in this case, I am happy I'm not a father trying to keep this away from my children,"" the 35-year-old single Army veteran added. Eric Solomon, a father of two, watched the VMAs with his 15-year-old son. ""I am so embarrassed and sitting next to my son and watching this happen made me even more embarrassed,"" he added. Solomon said he has conversations with his sons about what's right and what's wrong, and said that they know Cyrus' performance was ""not appropriate"" and not the behavior of ""your normal woman."" Mary Hogan of Cordova, Tennessee, doesn't have kids but works in education and says parents have a role to play. ""Parents need to explain to their kids that what she did is not OK, and should not be imitated,"" said Hogan, adding that parents who didn't like what they were seeing should have changed the channel. ""I think the biggest responsibility for a parent is to know what their kids are watching,"" said Mark Edwards of suburban St. Louis, who has three teenage sons. ""The VMAs aren't appropriate for kids under a certain age and if some parents feel discomfort over what was aired, should they have been letting their kids watch the show in the first place?"" ""The VMAs are supposed to be shocking,"" said a woman who did not want to be identified. ""Why is Miley Cyrus such a big deal? ... I am more shocked people are watching the VMAs with their children."" Miley Cyrus upholds MTV VMAs tradition . After all, consider VMA highlights of years past when Lady Gaga donned a dress made entirely of raw meat and Madonna and Britney Spears kissed (mouths open!). It was, in fact, at the VMAs years earlier when Madonna broke out onto the national stage with her ""Like a Virgin"" performance. Cyrus ""took a page straight out of Madonna's playbook,"" said Ivan Baker, a father in New York City, on Facebook. ""I guess I am jaded. Not very impressed or shocked."" While much of the online conversation post-Cyrus' national ""twerking"" episode was dominated by criticism, there was also a very motherly and fatherly response, parents who worry that Cyrus is a child in need of serious help. ""It's clear that Miley Cyrus' lifestyle as a young woman is expressing pain and is dealing with emotional problems,"" said Andrew Thompson, an engaged father of two boys in Country Club Hills, Illinois. ""Her mother and father have a responsibility to come to her aid and work out these social issues before it's too late,"" he added. Some parents said there was only one upside they could see from the blistering reaction to Cyrus' performance and that is that it may show strength. ""The fact that she doesn't play the victim and shows that girls can be as aggressive and bad in many ways might in some twisted way pave the way for (women) to play in a more level field with men,"" said Leigh Bordbar, a mom of two from Toronto who said she was personally disappointed with what Cyrus did at the VMAs. ""In her performance, she seemed like the one in control and in the driver's seat, which sets her apart from the ways that perhaps Playboy or fashion models portray women."" Nicky Calvert, a mom of two in Marietta, Ohio, sees another positive. ""There is only one good thing that I can say about her performance on the VMAs,"" said Calvert. It shows her 9-year-old how she ""should never act in public."" May I repeat how happy I am my girls missed this one completely.

"Shenyang, China (CNN)On the streets of the neon-lit Chinese city of Shenyang, you'll find a restaurant, hotel, and other businesses owned and operated by the North Korean government. You'll also find a  secret network of North Korean hackers, known as Bureau 121, according to defector Kim Heung-Kwang. ""It's easy for them to work secretly. It also has great Internet infrastructure,"" says Kim Heung-kwang, a former Pyongyang computer science professor who escaped North Korea in 2004. Kim says some of his own students became cyber warriors for the hacker network. ""By day, they worked regular jobs. But the rest of the time, they were acting on orders from Pyongyang,"" he says. RELATED: North Korea pushes back against U.S. sanctions for Sony hack . What is 'Bureau 121'? Kim claims North Korean hackers operated secretly in Shenyang for years, moving from location to location to conceal their whereabouts and activities. ""Bureau 121 began its large-scale operation in China in 2005. It was established in the late 90s,"" Kim says. ""Team members entered China separately -- in smaller groups -- 20 members at a time,"" he says. ""When they entered China, they came under different titles. For example an office worker, an official with a trade company or even as a diplomatic staffer."" Long before North Korea had its own Internet, it dialed in to servers in Shenyang, in Liaoning Province, in the country's north. Today, nearly all of North Korea's Internet traffic is still routed through China. Kim says the operation in China scaled back considerably a few years ago, when North Korea expanded its high speed Internet access. But he believes hackers are still operating in Shenyang. ""North Korea does have illicit activities in China,"" says Steve Sin, a terrorism expert at the University of Maryland and former U.S. military intelligence analyst. Sin wrote a report naming the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang as a North Korean hacker hub. ""It has the location, security, as well as infrastructure,"" Sin says. ""Right now, the best information available to us is that they are still conducting such an operation and they can still conduct such an operation from that location."" The North Korean embassy in Beijing,  and government officials reached by email in Pyongyang, tell CNN they have no comment on Kim's claims. For its part, China says it opposes any illegal cyber activity on its territory. Inside Shenyang . For a Chinese city, Shenyang has a distinctly North Korean flavor. At the state-owned ""Pyongyang Restaurant,"" waitresses told us they came to China on what is considered a prestigious three-year assignment. They say they're all from the same university in Pyongyang. They serve ""North Korean meals,"" in far more substantial portions than the food rations at home. They also sing and entertain customers with popular folks songs like ""Arirang,"" considered the ""unofficial anthem"" for both North and South Korea. A short drive away is state-owned The Chilbosan hotel, a joint venture between North Korea and China. The women who work in the hotel wear traditional North Korean clothing. There is an art gallery featuring pieces that glorify North Korea, a gift shop with Pyongyang souvenirs, and even a travel office for North Korea's state-owned national airline ""Air Koryo."" There is also a marketplace -- which caters to Shenyang's large Korean community. And not far from the government business, there's a North Korean consulate. As the biggest Chinese city near North Korea, Shenyang is a place where many from Pyongyang come to work. According to Sin, they also come to hack. ""If you are going to conduct illicit activities or covert operations, it's better to hide among this population, if you will,"" Sin says.

"The audience was tense. Tempers were heated. Tears were seen and blows were nearly thrown. We needed a referee. This was not the pre-fight press conference weigh-in for a Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao boxing match. It was a panel discussion between African-American and Native American journalists from across the country to consider whether the Washington Redskins name was racist. But the conversation at the Unity Journalists of Color convention, which included more than 6,000 media professionals, got nowhere. Obama on the Redskins . Black journalists accused their Native American counterparts of showing racist videos during the panel of ranting black fans cheering for their beloved football team, including extensive video of the team's then-beloved, now maligned Chief Zee, the African-American man (Zema Williams) who's been the team's unofficial mascot for 35 years. ""Black people are not the only Washington fans in the stadium,"" I argued then. ""Where are the other fan faces? And why is this a racial issue?"" Our Native American peers yelled back, a few of them in tears, that we were being insensitive and ignorant for not understanding that the Redskin name was hurtful and damaging to their community. Nothing changed. Everyone left the workshop insulted and insistent they were on the right side of the debate, including myself. And we never found common ground. That was nearly 20 years ago. So it was refreshing earlier this week to hear President Obama, the nation's commander in chief and a sports fan, weigh in saying he'd think about changing the name if he were the owner of the team. Tribe seeks to force NFL Redskins name change . ""I don't know whether our attachment to a particular name should override the real legitimate concerns that people have about these things. ... I don't want to detract from the wonderful Redskins fans that are here. They love their team and rightly so,"" the president said to The Associated Press. I thought back to that Unity meeting and knew his words rang true. And I remembered several of my colleagues who, over the years, have tried to get me or others in the newsroom to feel their pain. And honestly, I just never gave it enough thought. But no longer can I justify my years of indifference to the sports moniker. The name must change. Let's toss it in the trash heap along with other now offensive -- but once widely used -- monikers such as Sambo, darky, dago and kike. And if you or team owner Daniel Snyder, who insists he'll never change the team name, are a bit insulted, that's the whole point. It is exactly what my Native American colleagues struggled to tell us for as long as I can remember. Predictably, many Redskins fans are livid that the president would jump into this fight. They are hypocrites. They're not the only people who can have an opinion about this matter. U.S. politicians are sports fans, too. Some of them have been quite engaged with popular sports conversations. President Ronald Reagan brought ""The Gipper"" to the White House. Obama participates in the annual March Madness bracket frenzy. For any fan, sports are among the most uplifting things about life. It's the one place we can escape the worries in the grownup world and enjoy our childlike enthusiasm for the games. None of that feeling goes away with a name change in Washington. Supporters of keeping the team name can see only tradition and honor of the franchise. Some are defensive -- rightfully, I believe -- about anyone saying they are somehow intentionally being malicious. Lanny J. Davis, an attorney for the Redskins and an Obama supporter, said in an e-mail to the media that fans don't intend to ""disparage or disrespect"" anyone. ""The name 'Washington Redskins' is 80 years old. It's our history and legacy and tradition."" What else could he say? He is paid by the team. But he must know that his argument just makes no sense. The football team's glorious history may indeed stretch back 80 wonderful years, but what intelligent person, or even a diehard football fan like me, could seriously argue that 80 years of entertaining football history could ever compare to the thousands of years that the original Americans have inhabited this land?

"(CNN) -- The archbishop of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, apologized repeatedly Tuesday night for the way his archdiocese handled an abusive priest and he defended the Vatican which has come under fire for not disciplining or defrocking the man. ""Mistakes were made in the Lawrence Murphy case,"" said Archbishop Jerome Listecki at the end of a special holy week mass at St. John's Cathedral in Milwaukee. ""The mistakes were not made in Rome in 1996, 1997 and 1998. The mistakes were made here, in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, in the 1970s, the 1980s and the 1990s, by the Church, by civil authorities, by Church officials, and by bishops. And for that, I beg your forgiveness in the name of the Church and in the name of this Archdiocese of Milwaukee."" The now-deceased Murphy is believed to have molested up to 200 boys. The Vatican says it did not know about the abuse until 20 years after civil authorities investigated and later dropped the case. However, a recent New York Times story alleged that top Vatican officials, including the future Pope Benedict XVI, failed to act despite warnings from several American bishops. Jeff Anderson, a lawyer who obtained internal church paperwork, said it ""shows a direct line from the victims through the bishops and directly to the man who is now pope."" In his comments Tuesday night, Listecki attempted to shift the blame away from the Pope. ""The Holy Father does not need me to defend him or his decisions,"" he said. ""I believe, and history will confirm, that his actions in responding to this crisis swiftly and decisively and his compassionate response to victims (and) survivors speak for themselves."" Listecki added that measures have now been put in place in his diocese and across the country to protect children from predatory priests. ""Still, we know it is not words, but actions that will demonstrate our resolve,"" he said. ""And, in some ways, regardless of what I say tonight or any other time, our critics will say it is not enough. ""But that cannot and will not prevent me from making every possible effort at moving forward toward healing and resolution with those who have been harmed, and determined to make sure nothing like this can ever happen again."" The apologies are little consolation to many of the victims, three of whom shared their stories on ""Larry King Live"" Tuesday night. ""These priests have been allowed to abuse children for years. And with the man who is now the pope knowing about what Father Murphy alone was doing, and not doing anything about it? He needs to resign. He has no business being in the position he is in,"" said Donald Marshall, who said he was abused once during one of Murphy's regular visits to the Lincoln Hills School, a juvenile detention center in Irma in northern Wisconsin. Most of the alleged abuse took place at the John's School for the Deaf in St. Francis where Murphy began as a teacher in 1950. He was promoted to run the school in 1963 in spite of the fact that students had warned church officials of molestation, according to documents that CNN has seen. Gary Smith said his abuse began when he was 12 and continued up until he was 20, about 50 or 60 times. ""He was scared. He didn't know if he should tell anyone,"" said Gigi Budzinski, who interpreted for Smith during his appearance on King's show. ""He felt like Murphy was so powerful that he couldn't do anything,"" she said. Local coverage from CNN affiliate WISN . Still, Smith and two other classmates eventually reported Murphy to the Milwaukee police. ""They did nothing,"" said Arthur Budzinski, who said he was abused three times. Three successive archbishops in Wisconsin were told of the abuse, but none reported it to criminal or civil authorities, said Anderson, who is representing five men who are suing the archdiocese. The Archdiocese of Milwaukee, however, said that abuse was reported in fall 1973 to Milwaukee police, who turned the report over to St. Francis police, but no charges were filed. Murphy was removed in May 1974 as director of the St. John's School for the Deaf, but remained as fundraiser and alumni director until summer 1974, when he was removed from any role at the school, according to a chronology posted on the archdiocese Web site. In August 1974, a series of newspaper articles in the Milwaukee Sentinel reported on Murphy's removal and the allegations, the chronology said. A district attorney reviewed the allegations against Murphy in fall 1974. A civil lawsuit was filed in 1975 against the archdiocese relating to Murphy, but was resolved the following year, the chronology said. The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the office led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger who would later become pope, ""was not informed of the matter until some 20 years later,"" said Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi. The office is in charge of deciding whether accused priests should be given canonical trials and defrocked. But as part of his lawsuit, Anderson obtained correspondence from Milwaukee to Ratzinger and other internal church documents. The documents, dating back to 1974, include letters between bishops and the Vatican, victims' affidavits, the handwritten notes of an expert on sexual disorders who interviewed Murphy and minutes of a final Vatican meeting on the case. Ratzinger failed to respond to two letters about the case in 1996 from Milwaukee's then-archbishop, Rembert G. Weakland. After eight months, Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who at the time was second-in-command of the doctrinal office and now is the Vatican's secretary of state, told Wisconsin bishops to begin a secret canonical trial, the documents show. By that time, Murphy was in poor health, living in seclusion and had not had any allegations of abuse levied against him for more than 20 years, the Milwaukee archbishop said. The Congregation suggested that the archbishop restrict Murphy's public ministry and require him to accept full responsibility for his acts. Murphy died four months later. ""Even though some do not want to hear it or accept it as truth, mistakes were made by law enforcement, medical professionals -- even reporters who helped bring initial stories to light and grappled with how to deal with perpetrators,"" Listecki said Tuesday night. ""We have all learned so much.""","Archbishop apologizes for archdiocese's handling of abusive priest, defends Vatican .

"(CNN) -- Wildfires burning across some 1.4 million acres in 12 states have forced the evacuation of 1,800 homes and businesses in one Texas county and claimed the lives of two firefighters in Florida, authorities said Tuesday. The two Florida Division of Forestry firefighters died Monday while fighting a wildfire in north-central Florida that had been declared contained but suddenly burst out of control, Amanda Bevis, a division spokeswoman, said Tuesday. ""They were both in tractors, and the fire literally just caught up with them,"" she said. The firefighters were identified as Josh Burch, 31, and Brett Fulton, 52. Both were rangers with the forestry division working the Blue Ribbon Fire in Hamilton County. ""The wildfires have ravaged our state, burning more than 200,000 acres, and now, they have taken the lives of two of our very own men,"" Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam said in a statement. Two other firefighters were injured trying to rescue their colleagues, Bevis said. They were treated and released Monday and will make full recoveries, she said. In Texas, a fast-moving fire near Grimes County destroyed at least 26 homes as it burned across more than 4,000 acres. The fire was caused by homeowners grilling near Stoneham, Texas, CNN affiliate KHOU-TV reported. Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell said officials have identified a person of interest who is believed to have built the barbecue pit that started the fire, but as of now authorities do not believe there was any intent of arson. The speed of the fire forced evacuations of whole subdivisions throughout the area. Jerome Seeberger, who owns 40 acres of land in Grimes County, said there's just one word to describe the scene. ""Apocalypse,"" he told KHOU against a backdrop of charred trees. ""I've never seen anything like this. Such a beautiful forest two days ago and now look at it."" The fires in Florida and Texas were just two of 53 large uncontained wildfires burning in 11 U.S. states, from Alaska to Florida, according to the National Interagency Coordination Center. All told, the fires have burned 2,166 square miles -- nearly the size of Delaware. About 10,400 firefighters are involved in efforts to contain the fires, with more than 7,000 of them in Arizona and New Mexico, where fires have burned 853,518 acres, according to the center. The largest of the fires continues to be the Wallow Fire in east central Arizona and west central New Mexico. That fire has burned 527,774 acres so far, the fire's incident command team announced Tuesday, and is about 56% contained. While residents of Greer, Arizona, are being allowed to return home, evacuation orders remain in effect in other parts of Arizona and in Luna, New Mexico. Residents in parts of Apache County, Arizona, also have been told to be prepared to evacuate should the need arise. Power has been fully restored in Alpine and Nutrioso, Arizona, but remains out in areas north of Blue River, fire officials said. In North Carolina, Forest Service officials said they are closely monitoring a fire in Pender County, which has burned more than 4,000 acres. Though evacuations have not been ordered, residents of Pender County said they are worried. Diane Kuzina's voice broke as she described the fire's path. Kuzina owns land near the Pender County line. ""I don't want to lose my home,"" she said. ""It's just scary."" Critical fire weather was forecast Tuesday for parts of Arizona, Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, with a combination of low humidity and high winds in many locations raising the threat from wildfires. The weather service also warned that scattered storms forecast in southeast Texas could bring welcome rain but also lightning that could spark new fires. The number of wildfires so far this year is below the 10-year average for the United States, according to the U.S. Forest Service. But the number of acres burned is three times that 10-year average, according to the agency. While some state and local authorities have reported stretched resources from the widespread fires, Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell told Congress last week that there's plenty of capacity to continue fighting fires. The U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the Interior have about 16,000 trained firefighters available nationwide, Tidwell said. The agency also has left-over funds from previous years to pay higher-than-usual firefighting costs. CNN's Craig Bell contributed to this report.","Acreage burned this year is three times the 10-year average, U.S. agency says .

"Washington (CNN)John Boehner was elected to a third term as Speaker of the House of Representatives on Tuesday after a tense floor vote that saw a remarkably large chunk of his own party attempt to remove him. Opposition to Boehner doubled from the last election for Speaker in 2013, when a dozen Republicans voted against him. He ultimately received 216 votes, enough to fend off an embarrassing vote on a second ballot but plenty to reinforce the notion that Boehner is struggling to maintain control over restive House Republicans. The dramatic scene played out before live television cameras, as members were called upon one-by-one to stand and name who they were backing to serve as the next Speaker. Despite the opposition facing him, Boehner was greeted by a standing ovation after he was nominated by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers on Tuesday and his wife, Debbie, watched the floor action from the Speaker's box. Shortly after winning his spot Tuesday afternoon, an emotional Boehner called improving the economy and creating more opportunities for the middle class ""our vital task."" ""We'll begin on common ground,"" Boehner said, adding later ""All I ask is that we disagree without being disagreeable."" He joked that his door is always open, but ""don't get carried away with it."" Behind the scenes, Republicans who opposed Boehner are beginning to face the fallout. Florida Reps. Richard Nugent, who voted against Boehner, and Daniel Webster, who challenged him, were removed from the House Rules Committee on Tuesday, according to multiple sources. Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions suggested the decision to remove the two GOP members came from Boehner, telling reporters he had only spoken with Webster. ""The committee works at the behest of the speaker and the speaker -- I believe any speaker -- would want and need a person focused on that agenda,"" Sessions said. Sessions said he was surprised these members broke with Boehner, adding ""sometimes there are casualties and there are changes, and people make decisions to do things knowing sometimes there can be consequences."" But the Texas Republican appeared irked at the pressure from the grassroots activists these Boehner opponents drummed up before the vote. ""The onslaught that has happened over the last two or three days has taken a number of members by storm. Their district offices, their Capitol Hill offices have been inundated by people who seemingly drew conclusions that we didn't even have time to go home and defend,"" Sessions said. A senior House GOP leadership aide indicated other members could also face some type of repercussions for their public rebuke of Boehner. Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas said he and other Republicans who voted against Boehner fear some type of retribution. He said he was told by a committee chair recently that he was in line for a subcommittee chair post but then after he publicly announced his new post it was revoked, and he suggested his criticism of the leadership cost him the job. Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, who was nominated by a GOP colleague to replace Boehner and voted for himself, struck a more conciliatory note. He told reporters Boehner is ""the speaker of the House and I look forward to following his lead."" Boehner begins the 114th Congress with a new Republican controlled Senate and big plans to enact a conservative agenda. President Barack Obama will meet with congressional leadership next week. But the contentious election just to secure Boehner's job is a sign that the same dynamic he's seen in the last four years -- resistance from conservatives -- will continue to hamper his ability to govern the House. After the vote, one of the Republicans who voted against Boehner, Huelskamp said the vote re-electing Boehner ""sends a clear message that that  U.S. House Republican majority is status quo -- more of the same."" He said the 25 members who voted for someone else or declined to vote was less about Boehner personally, but about his leadership's record of bringing major legislation to the House without enough input from members. Sessions, a Boehner ally who will help set floor debate parameters, said ""that's not the plan"" and insisted there would be open deliberations with members about what bills go to  the floor. Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole, a defender of Boehner's, said that because of the larger GOP majority in the House, the speaker can afford to lose some members. And he suggested those who broke with Boehner are likely to continue resisting his legislative strategy going forward. But he warned those who regularly rebel may end up hurting their own cause. ""There's always a little bit of fragmentation that occurs because again, people know they can go their own way and you can still get the legislation passed. And I think you saw a certain amount of that today. 'Well the speaker's going to win anyway, and this will help me at home with my right wing.  The problem is, if that's your reasoning, you're going to be subjected to that every single time, and you're going to start to lose influence,"" Cole said. The speaker began reaching out to members the day after the midterm elections, and he and his allies continued to make calls and appeals for support right up until the vote on Tuesday afternoon, according to a senior House GOP leadership aide.  As the top fundraiser for his party he raised over $100 million for GOP members and candidates and traveled to more than 150 events over the 2014 midterm cycle. One of the GOP members who broke with Boehner, North Carolina Rep Walter Jones, argued the current political system helps keep leaders like Boehner in place because they help colleagues with campaign donations. ""This place, it's all about money. Both parties, everything is about raising money for the next election. That's what complicates good policy -- is the next election and raising money,"" Jones said. Sessions said the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill has to have a better PR effort to ensure the public gives it credit -- both with its own members and the public -- for what it is doing to cut spending. ""We've got to do a very good job and sell what we do and if we sell what we do, then people will see it and i believe come to our side, including our friends in the tea party who very very much want to see our party win the presidency,"" Sessions said. Freshman Republican Rep Lee Zeldin, who backed Boehner, told CNN it was time for the House GOP members to move on and start focusing on coordinating with the new Republican controlled Senate. ""It's important this this entire Republican conference regardless  of whether you are leadership or rank and file, whether you are conservative or moderate, or whether you are from New York or from Oklahoma that we work together to move American forward."" The No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, told CNN he didn't think there would be any real fallout for Boehner of the high-profile spat on the House floor. ""He won,"" Hoyer said. ""In two weeks no one will remember what the vote was. He's the speaker."" CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report.","Boehner opponents face fallout .

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- A father and son reunited after an international custody battle planned to spend their first holiday season together in five years at Disney World in Florida, a family friend said. David Goldman and his 9-year-old son, Sean, arrived at Orlando International Airport just after 6 p.m. Thursday after meeting earlier at the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Sean Goldman had been living in Brazil since 2004 when his mother, Bruna Bianchi, took him to Rio de Janeiro for what was to have been a two-week vacation. She never returned, instead remarrying there and retaining custody of Sean. She died last year in childbirth. The Goldmans will spend their first holiday season together in five years at Disney World, a family friend told CNN. Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey, who flew to Rio to support constituent Goldman, called the father-son reunion ""extraordinary"" in a conference call with reporters. The lawmaker said ""there were lots of smiles, hugs"" when the two were reunited. ""They talked about basketball, the snowfall in New Jersey just recently and how much fun it is to play in the snow."" The Christmas Eve reunion follows a five-year battle that involved U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and numerous Brazilian courtrooms. The chief justice of the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled Tuesday in favor of Goldman, who had been battling the family of the boy's deceased mother for custody. The ruling by Chief Justice Gilmar Mendes paved the way for the reunion when the family said they would not file any new appeals in an attempt to keep the boy with them. Goldman argued he should be granted custody as the sole surviving parent. The Bianchi family maintained it would traumatize Sean to remove him from what has been his home for five years. Smith criticized the decision of Sean's stepfather and other members of his Brazilian family Thursday to ""walk [Sean] through a group of reporters and people outside the U.S. Consulate in Rio,"" Smith said. The boy's maternal grandmother, Silvana Bianchi, had declined a consulate offer of a police escort Thursday morning from the family's Rio home, saying it would harm the boy psychologically, according to the Brazilian broadcast network TV Record. The boy, appearing worried and frightened, arrived at the consulate wearing a yellow and green Brazil soccer jersey, and clutched his stepfather as he walked past a throng of reporters. TV Record reported that Sean's grandmother provided David Goldman with a list of the boy's allergies and medications. In a statement read to reporters by Smith, David Goldman offered his ""sincere and humblest gratitude"" for the help he received in getting his son. ""Please know that my love and the rest of Sean's family's love for him knows no boundaries."" Goldman later let his son speak on the phone with his paternal grandparents, Smith said. The custody battle garnered much media attention and spilled over into the political arena as well. U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, had placed a hold on a trade bill that would have benefited Brazil to the tune of $2.75 billion, but he lifted it after the court's ruling, spokesman Caley Gray said. Clinton also has issued statements calling for an amicable conclusion to the case. ""I am thrilled that 9-year-old Sean Goldman was reunited with his father David Goldman earlier today in Rio de Janeiro and that they are flying home to New Jersey,"" Clinton said Thursday in a statement. ""I want to thank everyone who helped bring this long process to a successful conclusion, including a number of members of Congress and many concerned parties both here and in Brazil. ""We also appreciate the assistance and cooperation of the government of Brazil in upholding its obligations under the Hague Convention on International Child Abduction. I offer my warmest wishes for father and son as they celebrate their first holiday season together in five years."" Sean led a privileged life in Rio de Janeiro, TV Record said. He lived in the wealthy neighborhood of Jardim Botanico and attended Escola Parque, one of the most prestigious schools in the city.

"Charges against a Pennsylvania woman accused of helping her 93-year-old father to commit suicide have reignited the national debate over aid-in-dying laws. A Schuylkill County magistrate has ordered Barbara Mancini, 57, of Pottsville to stand trial for allegedly handing her terminally ill father his prescription morphine medication, which prosecutors claim caused or assisted his suicide. At the August 1 preliminary hearing, Magistrate James K. Reiley said that prosecutors had presented enough evidence for the assisted suicide charges against Mancini, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. A county judge issued a gag order in the case before the preliminary hearing began. ""I can't respond. I'm sorry,"" Barbara Mancini told reporters as she left court in Pottsville. According to Mancini's lawyer, who spoke to reporters via teleconference the day before the hearing, her father, Joe Yourshaw, was in ""unremitting"" pain, suffering from numerous medical conditions including diabetes and kidney failure.  His daughter, who is also a nurse, was at his home hospice bedside when he allegedly asked her to pass him his prescribed morphine. ""He chose to drink his morphine because that was the only way for him to find pain relief. That was his choice; that was his constitutional right to do that,"" attorney Frederick Finelli said. Mancini's ""stated intention, only intention"" was to help her father get relief from his pain, he said. According to the medical records noted in his autopsy report,  Yourshaw went into a coma not long after taking the morphine and was found unresponsive by Barbara Klattermole, a nurse with Hospice of Central Pennsylvania.  Klattermole called an ambulance and called the 911 and reported an attempted suicide. Pottsville Police Capt. Steve Durkin said in an affidavit that when he responded to the call on February 7, Mancini opened the door. ""She told me that her father had asked her for his morphine so he could commit suicide, and she provided it. She further stated that he was on hospice care, was already dying  and did not want to be taken to hospital,"" he said . Yourshaw, who according to Finelli had a do-not-resuscitate order and had expressed his wishes to die at home, was then taken to a hospital and revived. Mancini was arrested and charged. Fanelli told reporters that when Yourshaw awoke in the hospital, he was angry. ""He starts raising hell with everybody for Number One, why are you doing this to me and Number Two, when he sees the police there, he wants to know why are they here and what are you saying my daughter did, leave her alone!"" Yourshaw died in the hospital four days later from complications due to morphine toxicity, according to the autopsy report. Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life choice advocacy group that has been fighting for dignity-in-death laws for over 30 years, is petitioning Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane to have the charges dropped. ""There's no question the she acted out of compassion and love and support for her 93-year-old dying dad. The fact that she's being charged is outrageous,"" said Barbara Coombs Lee, the group's president. ""Dying patients have a federal constitutional right to as much medicine as they need to relieve their pain, even if it advances their time of death."" While most states ban assisted suicide, aid-in-dying is permitted in Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont.  New Jersey will review a death-with-dignity bill later this fall that would allow aid-in-dying. Medical ethicist Art Caplan supports doctor-assisted suicide with restrictions, not family assisted suicide. He said Mancini's case has all the signs of a mercy killing. ""Your heart goes out to the family but at the same time, you're trying to make sure that it doesn't quickly turn into 'we're encouraging you to do this' or 'why don't you do this? Life would be simpler for us if you swallowed a bunch of morphine.'  It has to be regulated.""  Caplan does not expect Mancini to serve jail time. Coombs Lee of Compassion & Choices agrees that it's important to screen cases and make sure there's no malice or self-interest involved, but  ""when all the evidence and the entire family's testimony says it was not, it should end there."" She said the case has national implications because it scares doctors and hospice workers into not giving elderly patients needed pain medicine and instead encourages them to ""save themselves, not the patient"" and protect themselves against legal proceedings. Mancini is out on bail and is expected to be arraigned this fall and stand trial early next year.","Barbara Mancini is charged with helping her terminally ill father, 93, die in February .

"Washington (CNN)John Boehner and his allies scrambled to lock down support for his reelection as Speaker on Tuesday morning as the small army of conservative lawmakers promising to vote against him continued to expand. A senior House GOP leadership source tells CNN that Boehner is reaching out to members to urge support as they try to stave off the  coup attempt. Voting was underway Tuesday afternoon with several Republicans already voting for people other than Boehner. Bad weather and the funeral proceedings for former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, however, made conservatives' challenge tougher as the two incidents combined ensured some lawmakers wouldn't make the vote. With fewer lawmakers voting, conservatives will need more Boehner opponents to force the vote to a second ballot. Conservative call for Boehner coup grows louder . Still, Monday morning conservatives were optimistic as more prominent members in their ranks came out opposed to the Speaker. Rep. Justin Amash, one of the original dozen that opposed Boehner for speaker in 2013, said in a Facebook post that while ""Speaker Boehner has given his best to our conference...it's time for Republicans to change our leadership."" Incoming Rep. Curt Clawson, via tweet; South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan, via Facebook; and Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp, via tweet, also joined the 10 lawmakers that announced their opposition to Boehner over the weekend and into Monday. Conservatives say they've locked down at least a dozen and as many as 15 certain no-votes, with more expected when the vote happens Tuesday afternoon. Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, who is just starting his second term in the House, is one of the conservatives collaborating to spark a second round of voting, and has offered him up as an alternative to the Ohio Republican, along with Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert. While Boehner's allies have said they are confident a second vote won't happen, about a dozen Republicans have indicated publicly they will vote against Boehner. ""We're at over a dozen right now and you're going to see more people get on and decide not to vote for the current leadership,"" Yoho said Tuesday on CNN's New Day. ""It's time for new leadership."" Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas is also throwing his name into the running to overthrow Boehner. Yoho painted his challenge to the establishment leadership as a ""vote against the status quo"" and a rebuke of Boehner's leadership, which Yoho and his allies have called weak, short-sighted and eschewing regular order in favor of cobbled compromise. Yoho insisted his message is resounding with other Republicans. ""We announced on Saturday that we were going to throw my name in the hat and you've seen a groundswell, a grassroots movement of people saying, 'You know what, I appreciate you offering us an alternative because I'm tired of the status quo,'"" Yoho said. ""It's either a vote for the status quo or for a new direction for the Republican Party."" But they admit the public nature of the vote could cause all the opposition to fall apart at the final moments, and they're not yet predicting victory. Another test for John Boehner .","Yoho said he has more than a dozen votes and more will vote against Boehner on Tuesday .

"HAMMOND, Louisiana (CNN) -- The actions of a justice of the peace in Louisiana who refused to issue a marriage license to an interracial couple have prompted some top officials, including Gov. Bobby Jindal, to call for his dismissal. Beth Humphrey and Terence McKay say they were denied a marriage license because of their race. Jindal said the state judiciary committee should review the incident in which Keith Bardwell, justice of the peace for Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward, refused to issue a marriage license to Beth Humphrey, 30, and her boyfriend, Terence McKay, 32, both of Hammond. ""This is a clear violation of constitutional rights and federal and state law. ... Disciplinary action should be taken immediately -- including the revoking of his license,"" the Republican governor said. Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, D-Louisiana, said the committee should ""use its authority to have Justice Bardwell dismissed from his position."" ""Not only does [Bardwell's] decision directly contradict Supreme Court rulings, it is an example of the ugly bigotry that divided our country for too long,"" she said.  Watch Terence McKay react to the denial of a marriage license » . Bardwell has not returned repeated calls from CNN this week. However, Bardwell told Hammond's Daily Star in a story published Thursday that he was concerned for the children who might be born of the relationship and that, in his experience, most interracial marriages don't last. ""I'm not a racist,"" Bardwell told the newspaper. ""I do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house. My main concern is for the children."" Bardwell, stressing that he couldn't personally endorse the marriage, said his wife referred the couple to another justice of the peace. The bride says the case boils down to discrimination. Humphrey said on Thursday that she called Bardwell on October 6 to ask about getting a marriage license, and was asked by his wife whether it would be an interracial marriage. Humphrey said she was told that Bardwell does not sign off on interracial marriages. She said the couple, who received their marriage license October 9 from another justice of the peace in the same parish, have reached out to an attorney to determine their next step. ""We would like him to resign,"" she said. ""He doesn't believe he's being racist, but it is racist."" Patricia Morris, president of the NAACP branch of Tangipahoa Parish said her NAACP chapter has forwarded the case to the state and national levels of the civil rights group. ""He's an elected public official and one of his duties is to marry people. He doesn't have the right to say he doesn't believe in it,"" Morris said Thursday. ""If he doesn't do what his position calls for him to do, he should resign from that position."" According to the Census Bureau, Tangipahoa Parish is about 70 percent white and 30 percent black. The U.S. Supreme Court tossed out any racially based limitations on marriage in the landmark 1967 Loving v. Virginia case. In the unanimous decision, the court said that ""Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the state.""

"From the time they entered Europe from India a thousand years ago, the Roma were targets of discrimination. Countries passed laws to suppress their culture and keep them out of the mainstream -- and sometimes went much further. Roma were enslaved in Hungary and Romania in the 15th century and targeted for extermination by Nazi Germany 500 years later. Opinion: Europe's Roma discrimination shame . Estimates of Romani deaths in the Holocaust range from 25% to 70% of the Roma population in Europe. Many Roma remain on the fringes of mainstream European society -- a fact underscored in the current case of a Romani couple accused of child abduction in Greece. The fair-skinned child caught the eyes of authorities when they visited a Roma community. The couple's attorney says they adopted the child from the biological mother but didn't go through a legal process. On Thursday, a Bulgarian woman came forward to say she left the girl in Greece with a family she worked for in 2009, Bulgarian Interior Ministry General Secretary Svetlozar Lazarov said. Rights groups say the latest case is bound to shine a harsh spotlight once again on the Roma. ""The risk of this case is to further put more stereotype and racism on the general picture of the Roma community,"" said Dezideriu Gergely, executive director of European Roma Rights Centre. ""What is important here is to understand that this case is not one that defines the Roma. It is a case that needs to be looked at as an individual case and that could happen in any minority group. Not culturally related to the Roma minority or ethnically related to the Roma minority. Criminality is not ethnically related."" Photo gallery: The plight of the Roma . How are the Roma today? Today, one in three Roma in Europe are unemployed and 90% live below the poverty line, according to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Human Rights. Many Roma continue to live in camps or caravans, but it's hard to say how many prefer that lifestyle and how many simply cannot find a way to settle down. Advocates say the Roma are denied a fair chance to secure housing, employment and education. And the EU human rights agency said governments must act to stop the ""exclusion"" of the Roma from mainstream society. How many people are Romani? From 10 million to 12 million in Europe, according to the EU human rights agency, which said last year that the Roma are Europe's largest minority. Most live in southern and eastern Europe, although they can be found throughout the continent. What is their language? The Romani language includes multiple dialects, all evolved from Sanskrit. The language is largely unwritten, however, because of the high rates of illiteracy in most Roma communities, according to information from Minnesota State University. What is their religion? Some are Christian and some are Muslim, having converted while migrating through Persia and the Balkans, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Why were they called gypsies? Because when they entered Europe -- perhaps from the 8th to 10th centuries, although scholars differ on the timeline -- people mistakenly thought they came from Egypt. Actually, they originated in the Punjab region of India. The term ""gypsy"" is considered pejorative by some Roma. Romani scholar Ian Hancock, a Romani raised in Great Britiain, says the term falsely implies that Roma are not a race -- that they are simply a group choosing a lifestyle. Why did the Roma become nomads? Probably because they were distrusted and discriminated against by Europeans. Like Jews, the Roma often were prohibited from buying land or entering the more stable occupations. At some point, the nomadic lifestyle became the norm for them. By the 20th century, the number of truly nomadic Roma began declining. Some advocates say many Europeans wrongly assume all Roma still want to be nomads -- and use that belief to justify authorities' failure to provide housing when they evict Roma from camps. What kind of discrimination did they face? Roma were living in Spain, France, England, and large parts of what is today Russia and Eastern Europe by the late 1400s. They suffered persecution in those countries ranging from laws against their language and dress to expulsion, according to Minnesota State. In the beginning of the 15th century, many Roma were forced into slavery by Hungarian and Romanian nobles who needed laborers for their large estates, according to the university. Roma suffered persecution during World War II. The Nazis judged Roma to be ""racially inferior,"" according to the Holocaust museum.

"(CNN)This is going to be a long year. Well, one second longer. We're all going to get an extra tick of the clock, known as a ""leap second,"" on June 30. The bonus sliver of time raises a couple of questions. How to spend that extra second? Sleeping? Working? Maybe Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg will use it to help keep up with his New Year book-reading program. Then there's the question of why we need to tinker with clocks all around the world in the first place. Earth vs. atomic clocks . It all comes down to physics, according to Nick Stamatakos, the head of Earth Orientation Parameters at the U.S. Naval Observatory, which oversees atomic clocks in the United States. ""The real simple explanation is the Earth is slowing down a little bit,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. That means atomic clocks are keeping more accurate time than our planet's own rotation, which can speed up and slow down because of tides and changes within the Earth's core. To get things back in sync, an extra second is periodically added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), the world's benchmark time standard. The call is made by scientists at the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, the agency that keeps tabs on the spinning of the planet. It announced the decision to add a leap second this year in a bulletin Monday. The previous one was in 2012, but that didn't go entirely smoothly. Some of the software platforms that underpin a lot of websites didn't know how to cope with the extra second. U.S. wants to ditch leap seconds . The issue has become an international sticking point. Some countries, including the United States, want to get rid of leap seconds altogether, saying they're too disruptive to precision systems used for navigation, communication and other services. But others, like Britain, have argued that it's risky to allow a divergence between the time kept by atomic clocks and that of the Earth's rotation. An international radiocommunication conference in 2012 put off a decision on the matter until this year. In any case, fewer leap seconds are being added nowadays than a few decades ago. ""Earth isn't as slow as it was in the 70s,"" said Stamatakos. ""Relative to the 1970s, it's sped up a little bit."" But still not enough to keep time with the atomic clocks.","A ""leap second"" will be added to the world's standard time on June 30 .
The move is to keep clocks in sync with the Earth's rotation ."
"(CNN) -- Maz Jobrani was talking to his high school counselor one day when she delivered some bad news: He was white. At first, he tried to deny it. Jobrani had brown skin, and his parents spoke with a Persian accent. Strangers called him ""sheikh'' and ""towel-head."" He was living in the San Francisco Bay area during the Iranian hostage crisis in the early 1980s and would occasionally hear, ""Go home, Iranian."" But the evidence for his whiteness was plain to see. When Jobrani looked at college applications in his counselor's office, he saw no racial category for Iranians. ""That's because you're white,"" his counselor explained as she instructed him to check the box marked ""white."" ""I told her, 'What do you mean, white? I've been going through all this crap, all this ribbing and teasing for years, and I've been white all this time? You should have told me earlier.' "" Jobrani now has a message for other Arab- and Persian-Americans who have been living in racial limbo: ""Check it right; you ain't white!"" That's the slogan of a campaign that may change how Arab- and Persian-Americans define themselves on the U.S. census. Activists are encouraging both groups to shun a practice that dates to the late 19th century, when immigrants from the Middle East began identifying themselves as white. Jobrani and others say that Arab- and Persian-Americans should check the ""other"" box on the census form and write in their true ancestry. (Persian-Americans, such as those who trace their ancestry to Iran, aren't Arab, because they speak a different language and have a different culture). Their campaign echoes complaints voiced by Latinos, African-Americans and biracial people. They claim that the racial categories on the census form don't accurately reflect how various groups define themselves. Omar Masry, a campaign organizer, says it's time for Arab-Americans to affirm their identities. ""It's important to show that we're here, that we're part of the American fabric,"" said Masry, a city planner for Irvine, California. ""We were invisible"" It's also practical, Arab-American leaders say. According to the Arab American Institute Foundation in Washington, there are an estimated 3.5 million Americans of Arab descent. But those numbers won't be reflected in this year's census count because only race data, not ethnic data on groups like Arabs, will be tabulated, institute leaders say. Information from each census is used for everything from determining federal and state funding for communities to awarding grants, Arab American Institute leaders say. Helen Hatab Samhan, executive director of the Arab American Institute Foundation, says Americans have traditionally defined Arabs in terms of their ""otherness."" ""For many years, we were invisible, or we were seen through an Orientalist lens: the Middle East as barbaric or the enemy of the West,"" Samhan said. ""We didn't have a strong identity. We fit into the normal American concept of race."" The lens may have changed, but the view is the same, others say. Arab-Americans are still seen as a problem people: potential terrorists or victims of racial profiling, says Masry, the California-based leader of the census campaign. ""You look in the mainstream media, and they often try to minimize us as a group, like we're a shadowy, fringe minority,"" Masry said. If Arab-Americans are going to be treated as different, they might as well highlight their differences on census forms to get equal representation, Masry says. ""We're being profiled anyway, so why don't we take pride in ourselves and gain advantage from it?"" he asked. How Arab-Americans became white . Centuries ago, there was little advantage to being called an Arab in America, one scholar says. The first wave of Arab-American immigrants arrived in the U.S. around the end of the 19th century. Most were Christians from present-day Syria and Lebanon, says Sally Howell, co-author of ""Citizenship and Crisis: Arab Detroit After 9/11."" They came at a time when many Americans were turning against immigrants. The U.S. erected exclusionary policies that would prevent many immigrants from non-Western European countries from becoming citizens, Howell says. These immigrants often waged public campaigns, including court battles, to argue for the right to naturalize -- to become citizens. ""Each immigrant group had to fight their way into whiteness,"" Howell said. Arab-American leaders clinched their claim to whiteness with a shrewd appeal to the dominant faith of their new homeland, she said. ""They said, 'We're Christians from the Holy Land,' "" she said. "" 'If Christ is the symbol of Western civilization, then we're like the most original Christians. We're white people, too.' "" 'I'm not Iranian; I'm Italian' The practice of suppressing one's Arab or Persian identity continued deep into the 20th century, says Jobrani, the Iranian-American. He grew up outside San Francisco in the 1980s, during the Iranian hostage crisis. Iranian-Americans were sometimes jeered for their heritage, he says. ""A lot of Iranians didn't want to deal with it,"" he said. ""They would say, 'I'm Italian' or 'I'm Turkish.' There were a lot of guys who changed their name. I had a friend named Shahrokh who changed his name to Tony."" Jobrani says he once met a woman at a club who asked him about his heritage. ""I told her I was Iranian, and she walked away,"" he said. Arab- and Persian-Americans weren't treated that much better on television, Jobrani says. They were villains. ""There was never a Middle Eastern performer who was a good guy, someone who I could get behind and say that this guy is inspiring me,"" he says. Jobrani is now taking that role himself. Today, he's a popular comedian who helped lead the ""Axis of Evil"" comedy tour, which poked fun at Middle Eastern stereotypes. He recently filmed a television pilot called ""Funny in Farsi."" And he just filmed a playful public service announcement for an Iranian-American group that's encouraging Iranians to affirm their heritage on the new census forms. Jobrani says he's no longer checking boxes that say ""white."" He's proud of his heritage, and of being American. ""Our community was kind of hiding. Now, people are saying, 'Let's turn this around,' "" he said. ""We're successful. There's no need to hide.""","Arab-Americans no longer content to be labeled white .

"(CNN)Playing the lottery has always been something fun to do for retiree John Wines.  So when the New Mexico native went to a gas station to purchase his weekly Powerball ticket, on one particular Saturday in December, he sprung for a scratch-off ticket, too. ""You only live once, right?"" he said. The winning numbers printed at the top of the scratch-off were two and one. Wiles said he was in shock when he scratched off five of them, his winnings totaling more than $500,000.  The amount confused him, he said, because the maximum prize on the ticket is $250,000. Still, he said, he ""thought [he] won big!"" But when he took the ticket to the store where he bought it, the store clerk put the ticket in a scanner that said Wines wasn't a winner after all. Wines called the New Mexico Lottery Commission, which confirmed the ticket was a misprint. Wines' fun hobby had now become the cause of an emotional roller coaster. He reached out to the New Mexico Lottery Commission, hoping it might honor the ticket.  But it only thanked him for calling to attention the misprint and offered him $100 in lottery bucks.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama on Wednesday signed a law that makes it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity. The expanded federal hate crimes law, hailed by supporters as the first major federal gay rights legislation, was added to a $680 billion defense authorization bill that Obama signed at a packed White House ceremony. The hate crimes measure was named for Matthew Shepard, a gay Wyoming teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998, and James Byrd Jr., an African-American man dragged to death in Texas the same year. Shepard's mother, Judy, was among those at the ceremony that also included Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Attorney General Eric Holder and leading members of Congress and the Pentagon, who were on hand for the appropriations bill signing. To loud applause, Obama hailed the hate crimes measure in the bill as a step toward change to ""help protect our citizens from violence based on what they look like, who they love, how they pray."" He cited the work of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and others ""to make this day possible."" Later Wednesday, Obama stood with Shepard's parents and relatives of Byrd at a separate White House event honoring passage of the expanded hate crimes law. Noting reports of 12,000 crimes based on sexual orientation over the past 10 years, Obama called the bill another step in the continuing struggle for protecting human rights. ""Because of the efforts of the folks in this room, particularly those family members standing behind me, the bell rings even louder now,"" Obama said. When he finished his remarks, he hugged the weeping relatives as the audience applauded. Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality. However, Holder has said that any federal hate-crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias, not to prosecute speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs. Former President George W. Bush had threatened to veto a similar measure, but Obama brought a reversal of that policy to the White House. When the bill won final congressional approval last week, Human Rights Campaign president Joe Solmonese called the hate crimes measure ""our nation's first major piece of civil rights legislation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people."" Earlier this month, Obama told the Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest gay rights group, that the nation still needs to make significant changes to ensure equal rights for gays and lesbians. ""Despite the progress we've made, there are still laws to change and hearts to open,"" he said in an address at the group's annual dinner. ""This fight continues now and I'm here with the simple message: I'm here with you in that fight."" Among other things, Obama has called for the repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military -- the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. He also has urged Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act. The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage, for federal purposes, as a legal union between a man and a woman. It allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages. The Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act would extend family benefits now available to heterosexual federal employees to gay and lesbian federal workers. However, some advocates for stronger rights for the lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender community have complained that Obama's administration is moving too slowly on his legislative promises. Opponents of the expanded hate crimes bill challenged the need to specify one particular community in federal legislation. They contended that existing federal hate crimes laws were sufficient to protect the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. More than 77,000 hate-crime incidents were reported by the FBI between 1998 and 2007, or ""nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade,"" Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. At Wednesday's signing, Obama also praised what he called a bipartisan effort to start changing the culture of military spending through the annual appropriations bill. He noted that Gates had worked with congressional leaders to end what Obama called wasteful projects like the F-22 fighter bomber and a new presidential helicopter that would have cost ""almost as much as Air Force One."" ""I won't be flying on that,"" the president said. Noting that cost overruns in military projects total tens of billions of dollars, Obama called for further ""fundamental"" reforms in how the government and Pentagon do business. ""We all know where this kind of waste comes from,"" he said, citing ""indefensible"" no-bid contracts and special interests pushing unneeded weapons systems. Such actions are ""inexcusable"", ""unconscionable"" and an ""affront to the American people"" as the nation faces two wars and an economic recession, Obama said. ""Today I'm pleased to say that we have proved that change is possible,"" he said.","Law is attached to $680 billion defense authorization bill .

"Richmond, Virginia (CNN)Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell is vowing to keep fighting the bribery accusations that on Tuesday landed him a two-year prison sentence. Outside the federal courthouse in Richmond, the Republican said he was ""deeply, deeply sorry"" for the actions that led to his conviction on 11 felony public corruption charges, but that he ""never, ever betrayed my sacred oath of office."" McDonnell and his attorneys vowed to appeal the convictions immediately. The two years was a much shorter sentence than the 10 to 12 years that prosecutors had started the day asking for. But it was enough to rock McDonnell's children, family and friends, many of whom gasped as it was read and were left wiping away tears. When McDonnell left, his wife, Maureen McDonnell, who could face a similar sentence herself, remained in the courtroom, sobbing. RELATED: Jack Abramoff's prison advice for Bob McDonnell . His sentencing was the culmination of the dramatic downfall of the Republican governor once heralded as a rising star -- tapped to give the party's 2010 rebuttal to President Barack Obama's State of the Union, and a fixture on short lists for national office. Now, McDonnell has another distinction: He's the first Virginia governor ever sent to prison for corruption. McDonnell pled on Tuesday for mercy, saying he is now a ""heartbroken and humbled man."" His attorneys spent several hours ushering in a parade of political friends, religious leaders and family members to tout the Republican's good character -- and reading excerpts of more than 400 letters they'd submitted making the same case. It wasn't enough to keep him out of prison entirely. U.S. District Court Judge James Spencer delivered the sentence on Tuesday. His decision: In addition to 24 months in prison, McDonnell faces two more years of supervised release, as well as $1,100 in fines -- $100 for each of the 11 felonies for which he was convicted. McDonnell was ordered to report to prison on Feb. 9, just before his wife's Feb. 20 sentencing. It's Virginia's former first lady whose relationship with Richmond businessman Jonnie Williams, who provided the bribes that led to their convictions, has faced the most intense scrutiny in recent months. McDonnell's defense attorneys, allies and even one of the family's daughters pointed to New York shopping trips, New England vacations and more -- portraying a woman in love with the perks of power and a man too naive to say no. That assessment, Spencer said, is ""dangerously delusional."" ""While Mrs. McDonnell may have allowed the serpent into the mansion, the governor knowingly let him into his personal and business affairs,"" the judge said. In his comments to Spencer, McDonnell pled for leniency for his wife. Prosecutors wouldn't say Tuesday what penalty they'll seek for her. McDonnell's attorneys had tried to keep the former governor from spending any time in prison. They argued instead for 6,000 hours of community service -- or about three years worth of volunteer work. They even offered specific ideas, like working with a religious organization to aid the poor in Haiti or managing a food bank that serves an impoverished section of rural Virginia. Prosecutors, meanwhile, said that would amount to sweeping his crimes under the rug. The U.S. Probation Office had said federal sentencing guidelines suggested a sentence of 10 to 12 and a half years -- and prosecutors sought something in that range. But McDonnell's attorneys convinced Spencer that the loans and gifts the former governor took from Williams were being overvalued, and Spencer knocked the sentencing guidelines down to 6 and a half to 8 years -- and still delivered a punishment short of that. Spencer, a Ronald Reagan appointee, said he's spent decades trying to understand why seemingly good people do bad things -- but that McDonnell's crimes were too serious to ignore. ""This entire case has been tragic from beginning to end,"" Spencer said. The courtroom was so packed with McDonnell's family members, friends, political allies and former staffers that federal officials had to feed video of the proceedings onto televisions set up in another courtroom -- and that one filled up, too. Afterward, U.S. Attorney Dana Boente said getting prison time for McDonnell is a victory, and sends a warning shot to other politicians. McDonnell, 60, was convicted in September of 11 felony public corruption charges. His wife, Maureen, was also found guilty on eight charges. The charges were a result of the McDonnell family accepting about $177,000 in gifts and loans from Richmond businessman Williams. The trial was an emotional ordeal that often pitted McDonnell and other members of his family against his wife, who was portrayed as the driver of the family's connections with Williams. The two were convicted of taking bribes from Williams in exchange for government favors as he sought to market a dietary supplement. The gifts included shopping trips with dress purchases in New York, wedding catering for the couple's daughter, golf outings for their sons, a Rolex watch and more -- the bills for which McDonnell's attorney, John Brownlee, said the former governor never knew were footed by Williams. ""We believe that these things were kept from Mr. McDonnell -- at least the source who paid for them,"" he said. Pointing to several of the individual trips and gifts, he argued that McDonnell should be sentenced for having taken $69,000 in inappropriate gifts and loans, rather than $177,000. Afterward, Brownlee and fellow defense attorney Henry Asbill said the case hasn't reached its end. ""Sometimes in a case like this, justice is a marathon,"" Asbill said. ""We will never give up this case.""

"During the third and final presidential debate last October, President Obama made a promise to the American people. Sequestration, a package of forced budget cuts,  ""is not something I proposed,"" he said. ""It will not happen."" What a difference 100 days make. The military, fatigued after a decade of war, has already endured three rounds of budget cuts during the president's first term alone. It now finds itself little more than a week away from another $500 billion in budget cuts under sequestration, an outcome that would have a profound and lasting impact on the readiness and capabilities of our military for years to come. Rather than exhibit the leadership required from our commander in chief, the president has been missing in action. With just weeks to spare, the president has belatedly come forward with a proposal based on higher tax revenues and cuts in defense and discretionary domestic spending. Last week's offer from Senate Democrats holds fast to the president's preferred model and proposes a significant tax increase while asking our military to cut tens of billions more. Despite claims to the contrary, this approach is neither responsible nor balanced and should be deeply troubling to the voters who took Obama at his word during the campaign. Let's be clear: Defense spending is not what's driving our indefensible national debt. We spend less than 18% of our budget on the military, while mandatory domestic spending accounts for 60%. Despite this fact, the president has refused to consider reforms to mandatory spending -- the real driver of our debt crisis -- while using our troops as a piggy bank to keep unsustainable spending programs on life support. Borger: President can't kick his legacy down the road . There is a growing concern that the president will not seriously negotiate with Congress on a compromise to sequestration until after it takes place on March 1 and each member of Congress hears of the pain affecting his or her constituents. But the real pain will be felt by the men and women serving our country, who will see arbitrary cuts to the resources they so desperately need. They will be asked immediately to do more with less and accept greater risk in a world that is becoming more dangerous by the day. This is an unconscionable position and a dereliction of duty. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta recently stated, ""If sequester happens, it is going to badly damage the readiness of the United States of America. We have the most powerful military force on the face of the earth right now. It is important in terms of providing stability and peace in the world. If sequester goes into effect, and we have to do the kind of cuts that will go right at readiness, right at maintenance, right at training, we are going to weaken the United States. And make it much more difficult for us to respond to the crises in the world."" Gen. Martin Dempsey went further in recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee and stated that sequestration would put our military on a path where the ""force is so degraded and so unready"" that it would be ""immoral to use the force."" Two weeks ago, the Defense Department announced its decision to indefinitely delay the deployment of the Truman carrier strike group to the Middle East, denying our combatant commander in the most volatile region of the world the capabilities he urgently requires. The Air Force estimates that if the cuts go into effect, two-thirds of its aircrews will not receive the training hours needed to stay mission-capable. The Army says that an astounding 80% of its combat brigades will be forced to skip necessary training. And nearly a quarter of a million troops could be forced out of the service as the result of layoffs. Such precarious times should spur meaningful action from the president. Yet every indication we've seen, including his lecturing at the State of the Union address, suggests that his White House is more interested in disavowing responsibility and blaming others. While the president sits idly by, we have worked tirelessly to spare our military from these devastating cuts. The House voted twice for a proposal sponsored by Rep. Paul Ryan that would replace sequestration with reforms to mandatory spending programs and voted four other times in support of finding a solution to sequestration or forcing the White House to be transparent in how it would implement the cuts. Members of the Senate -- including most recently Sens. Kelly Ayotte, John McCain and Lindsey Graham -- have repeatedly put forth reasonable and common-sense proposals to the same end. We have pleaded with the president to, at the very least, accept our proposals as a starting point for a meaningful compromise agreement.  We have held multiple hearings and passed the Sequestration Transparency Act so that Congress, the president, and every American would fully understand the truly shocking consequences of sequestration. Though the hour is late, we remain hopeful that this president will set aside political posturing and finally get serious about working with Congress to find a lasting solution to sequestration. The men and women in uniform deserve nothing less.","Republican legislators: President Obama said forced budget cuts wouldn't happen .

"Vietnamese Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, who helped communist forces push French and later U.S. troops to withdraw after decades of war in the southeast Asian country, has died, according to local media reports. He was 102. Giap helped form Ho Chi Minh's communist rebels into an army while France tried to hold onto colonial rule in French Indochina after World War II -- and he eventually led the rebels in a key 1954 battle that led to France's withdrawal. After the French left and Vietnam was partitioned into the communist North and the U.S.-backed South, Giap -- the North's defense minister and military commander -- helped guide the communists in a bloody 20-year war with the South and U.S. troops. The North took the entire county in 1975. In 2004, Giap told CNN that a nation that stands up and knows how to unite will always defeat a foreign invader. Giap made the comments after he was asked about the United States' involvement in Iraq -- but they also came as Vietnam was marking the 50th anniversary of the battle he led to spark France's withdrawal. ""When people have the spirit to reach for independent sovereignty ... and show solidarity, it means the people can defeat the enemy,"" Giap told CNN. Born into a family of rice farmers, Giap got involved in politics at an early age. At 18 his politics got him thrown in jail, under suspicion of revolutionary agitation. He earned a doctorate and students remember him as unusually passionate about military strategy.  Theory became reality for Giap in the 1940s when he joined Ho Chi Minh and battled French colonial forces. In 1954, Giap led the communist force in one of his most famous victories -- a 55-day seige of French forces at Dien Bien Phu, in the north of the country. The siege ended when the French troops, worn down by constant artillery barrages and unable to resupply by air, surrendered on May 7, 1954. That defeat saw the French withdraw, followed by the partitioning of Vietnam. When American forces became involved in Vietnam, Giap championed guerrilla tactics, which became one of the hallmarks of the conflict. Giap was the North's defense minister during the Tet offensive against U.S. and U.S.-backed forces in 1968. The surprise attack during the Vietnamese New Year festival targeted dozens of cities in South Vietnam, and both sides suffered heavy casualties before the offensive was repulsed. The Tet offensive is considered as a turning point in the conflict, with the United States soon reducing the number of its troops in Vietnam as the U.S. public increasingly turned against the war. The bulk of U.S. forces withdrew after the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973. But fighting between North and South continued until April 1975, when communist forces took over the South's capital of Saigon, now known as Ho Chi Minh City. The 1954-1975 Vietnam War  cost about 2 million Vietnamese military and civilian lives, the deaths of 55,000 U.S. troops, and about 6,000 service personnel from South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand. Reflecting on the Dien Bien Phu victory, Giap told CNN in 2004 that the Vietnamese could never be slaves to anyone else. ""Nothing is more precious than freedom,"" Giap said. U.S. Sen. John McCain, who as a Navy pilot was held prisoner by the North Vietnamese for more than five years after his plane was shot down, marked Giap's death on Twitter Friday. ""Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap has passed away -- brilliant military strategist who once told me that we were an 'honorable enemy,'"" McCain tweeted.","Man who helped form Ho Chi Minh's rebels into an army reportedly dies .

"Russia called for ""stability and order"" in neighboring Ukraine on Wednesday as thousands of protesters kept up their demonstrations against the government in Kiev. Speaking to a visiting Ukrainian delegation in Russia, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev told Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Yuriy Boyko that Moscow was watching the events that have plunged its neighbor,  whom he called an important strategic partner to Russia, into a political crisis. ""We're watching what's happening in your country. It's an internal affair of Ukraine, though it's really important to have stability and order there,"" he said, according to Russian news agency RIA Novosti. Thousands of demonstrators kept up the pressure on the Ukrainian government Wednesday, tightening their blockade of key Cabinet offices, angry about its U-turn away from integration with Europe. In the biggest protests since Ukraine's Orange Revolution nine years ago, they have also stayed put in the main Independence Square as they demand new elections. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov, who survived an opposition bid to topple his government  in parliament Tuesday, has called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis. ""We are open to dialogue, we are ready to discuss with peaceful demonstrators all terms of our agreements,"" he told parliament Tuesday, according to a government website. Azarov said he was extending his hand to the opposition but warned that he was working from a position of strength: ""If we find a fist, I say frankly, we have enough forces."" Azarov said the government is supported by most Ukrainians, who want the government to restore order ""and continue the course to democratic transformation, to European integration."" But opposition leaders Vitaly Klitschko and Arseniy Yatsenyuk have called on President  Viktor Yanukovich, currently on a trip to China,  to sack the Prime Minister and his government by executive order. Klitschko, who gained fame as a boxer, vowed that the opposition would make sure its demands were met. Among those demands was for someone to be held responsible for the violence against the demonstrators, he said. ""It's not enough to tell just 'sorry,' it happens,' "" Klitschko told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""How many times do we have to listen to that?"" The battle over Ukraine: Towards a new geopolitical game . Blockades . Since the weekend, tens of thousands of protesters have been descending  on the capital's Independence Square to voice their anger, and demonstrations show no signs of abating. The crowds have blocked the government's main headquarters, preventing employees from going to work. Some have also taken their protest to Yanukovich's office building. The scenes are reminiscent of the 2004 Orange Revolution -- a populist movement that booted Yanukovich, then Prime Minister, from office. ""I hope they (the demonstrators) will be able to keep this up,"" Volodymyr Valkov, 26, told CNN, speaking from the western town of Lviv, where he said protesters had taken to the streets as well. ""The Orange Revolution has provided for things to happen."" The protests have been largely peaceful, though violence flared Sunday when demonstrators using a bulldozer were met with stun guns and tear gas as they tried to push through barricades at the President's administration building. That night, police chased and beat protesters with batons. Dozens were hurt on both sides. NATO has condemned the use of violence against the demonstrators and called on all parties to refrain from violence. ""Obviously we fully respect Ukrainian decisions on their alliance affiliations and to which organizations they want to belong or with which organizations they want to cooperate,"" NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. ""But I would expect such decision-making processes to be truly democratic."" In Brussels, Belgium, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said there was ""very powerful evidence"" that Ukrainians want to be associated with the European Union. ""We stand with the vast majority of the Ukrainians who want to see this future for their country,"" he told reporters. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland is to visit Ukraine on Wednesday, he said, adding that he himself was looking forward to visiting the country ""when it too gets back on the path of European integration and economic responsibility."" Yanukovich told reporters on Monday he supports a peaceful resolution to the ""questions brought on by our citizens."" But he also warned his opponents: ""As for the politicians participating in this, I consider any radicalization of the political process will only have negative consequences."" As the protests grip the nation -- split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east, Ukraine's central bank said it would seek to maintain financial stability. In a video statement, National Bank of Ukraine chairman Ihor Sorkin urged depositors to have confidence in the banking system and not withdraw their savings. Opinion: Beware Russia's power play in Ukraine . The cause of the protests . At the heart of the protests is Ukraine's about-face after a year of insisting that it would sign a political and trade agreement with the European Union. Last month, Kiev suspended talks with the EU, angering many Ukrainians, who say the agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. Chief among Yanukovich's reasons for backpedaling was Russia's opposition to it. Russia threatened its neighbor with trade sanctions and steep gas bills if it forged ahead with an EU deal, but promised deep discounts on natural gas if it were to join the Moscow-led Customs Union instead. Yanukovich was also facing an EU demand that he was unwilling to meet: Free former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, his political opponent. The Orange Revolution that swept him from office also swept Tymoshenko to power. Two years ago, she was found guilty of abuse of office in a Russian gas deal and sentenced to seven years in prison in a case widely seen as politically motivated. Her supporters say she needs to travel abroad for medical treatment. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the protests Monday, saying they are unrelated to Ukraine's turn away from the European Union. He called them reminiscent of a ""pogrom"" rather than a revolution and an effort by the opposition to destabilize the government,  RIA Novosti said. Yanukovich on Monday asked the European Commission to receive a Ukrainian delegation to discuss ""some aspects"" of the agreement Kiev had been expected to sign, according to a statement from Brussels. Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso acceded to the request but noted that the commission was not prepared ""to reopen any kind of negotiations.""","Russia says it is watching events in Ukraine .

"Attorney General Eric Holder has been bruised and battered by Republicans who made him the first-ever sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress. He's been knocked around in behind-the-scenes White House battles with some of President Barack Obama's top advisers. But more than 1,700 days after being the first black man sworn in as attorney general, Holder has defied expectations that he was on his way out. And he's planning on staying for a while longer. Sources close to the attorney general say he plans to stay in office until well into 2014, at the President's behest. He's changed his mind before. This past summer, he and the President spent time together during their vacation at Martha's Vineyard. Holder was considering leaving later this year, and the President asked him to stay as long as he could, sources said. Holder: New strategies needed for 'active shooter' situations . These days, Holder appears to be more at ease in the job. Last week, he went toe-to-toe with Jamie Dimon, chief of JPMorgan Chase, taking a hard line on the bank's tentative $13 billion mortgage securities settlement. At recent news conferences, the attorney general has even invited additional questions from reporters. Not long ago, Holder's battles with Republicans and even with Obama's top lieutenants fueled years of speculation about how long he would remain on the job. The attorney general attracted Republican criticism early on after the President handed him the job of leading legal efforts to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Weeks after taking office in February 2009, Holder tangled with Rahm Emanuel, who was then White House chief of staff, over comments Holder made suggesting the need to revive the assault weapons ban, according to people familiar with the matter. Emanuel was angry that Holder's gun control comments could provide fodder for opponents of the President's legislative agenda. By 2010, Emanuel succeeded in getting tighter White House control of Holder's public statements amid disagreement between the two men on how to deal with terrorism trials in New York of the accused 9/11 plotters. In the meantime, Holder had to contend with efforts by other White House advisers, including David Axelrod and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, to rein in his public role on the administration's behalf. Many of Holder's troubles with White House officials were detailed in a book by journalist Daniel Klaidman. A series of challenges . Matthew Miller, who was a top aide to Holder during some of those early troubles, says being tasked with the Guantanamo review began a series of challenges for Holder that became compounded with the 2009 Christmas Day underwear bomber case. Then the scandal over the botched gun sting called Fast and Furious and more than a year of congressional investigations and hearings added to the attorney general's problems. ""Even he would say that in the first few years, he was unable to focus on the things he wanted to do as attorney general,"" Miller said. Fast and Furious, in which agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed suspected smugglers to buy about 2,000 firearms, squandered much of Holder's tenure. Amid congressional hearings and Republican calls for his resignation, the attorney general assumed a more low-key public presence. Source: U.S. to allow ATF agent to write 'Fast and Furious' book . It wasn't until September 2012, after a Justice Department inspector general probe cleared Holder of wrongdoing in Fast and Furious, that he began to emerge, giving media interviews and doing major speeches. By that time, Congress had held Holder in contempt in a fight over documents related to the gun sting. Back on his feet . In recent months, Holder appears to have regained his footing. He has spent recent months focusing on efforts to remove mandatory-minimum sentences for some nonviolent drug offenses and boosting the department's efforts to enforce the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court struck down a key component of the law. He's also trying to complete some big financial crisis cases. Justice Department sues North Carolina over voting law . He's even managed to find a few Republicans to support some of his initiatives. Rep. Jim Sensebrenner of Wisconsin is working to try to rescue the civil rights law. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah are working to put into law some changes Holder is making on mandatory-minimum sentences. Miller says the difference has been that Holder is now focusing on matters he cares about. ""And you're seeing the results,"" Miller says. He still takes fire, as he did this summer for targeting journalists in aggressive leak investigations. He announced some changes in the way prosecutors pursue such cases that appear to have quelled the outcry. One of Holder's harshest critics, California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee, hasn't been quieted by Holder's attempts to turn the page. In a June appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" at the time of the controversy over Holder's testimony to Congress about the leak investigations, Issa said: ""It's hard to have confidence in what this attorney general says -- or his people say -- when so often it turns out not to be true.""

"""Great Train Robber"" Ronnie Biggs -- one of the most notorious British criminals of the 20th century -- has died, his publisher told CNN on Wednesday. He was 84. Biggs, who despite his crimes became the subject of books, films and TV shows and even recorded a single with the Sex Pistols, had been released from prison in 2009 on health grounds. Cliff Moulder, of publisher MPress, told CNN that close family and friends informed him that Biggs passed away early Wednesday. Moulder published Biggs' most recent books, ""Odd Man Out: The Last Straw,"" and ""The Great Train Robbery -- 50th Anniversary Special."" Biggs earned his nickname from that train robbery, an infamous 1963 heist dubbed the ""crime of the century."" It was an act that transformed him from a petty London thief into one of the most wanted men in Britain. Biggs and 14 other professional criminals made off with the equivalent of 2.5 million pounds in used bank notes -- an amount that would equal tens of millions today. The thieves held up a mail train from Glasgow to London early in the morning. In the course of the robbery, the train driver was badly beaten with an iron bar. Most of the gang, including Biggs, were soon picked up in a massive manhunt after police discovered fingerprints at a farmhouse hideout where the robbers had holed up to split their spoils. Biggs was sentenced to 30 years but escaped over a London prison wall after serving just 15 months -- and spent most of the rest of his life as a celebrity fugitive. After undergoing extensive plastic surgery in Paris, Biggs made his way to Australia, living there with his wife and two children. Tracked down by police, he fled again in 1969, this time to Brazil. Five years later, Biggs was traced once more, this time by a newspaper reporter. Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Jack Slipper, who had led police efforts to bring the train robbers to justice, flew out to Rio de Janeiro to arrest Biggs, allegedly greeting him in a beachside hotel, ""Long time no see, Ronnie."" Efforts to bring Biggs home were frustrated because by then, he had fathered a young Brazilian son -- Michael Biggs -- and authorities rejected British requests for his extradition. Return by private jet . Biggs continued to live openly in Rio, trading on his notoriety by entertaining tourists, selling T-shirts and even recording the single ""No One is Innocent"" with the Sex Pistols in 1978. In 1981, he was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers and smuggled to Barbados. But legal efforts to have him brought back to the UK once again stalled and he was allowed to return to Brazil. By the late 1990s, Biggs was running out of cash and in poor health after a series of strokes. In 2001, he flew back to the United Kingdom on a private jet trip arranged by the Sun newspaper. He was promptly locked up in a high-security prison but then moved to a facility for elderly prisoners. After that, Biggs and his family campaigned for his parole on compassionate grounds. This was finally granted in 2009, after he had been in ill health for some time. He had been refused parole shortly before that because he ""had shown no remorse for his crimes nor respect for the punishments given to him,"" said Jack Straw, who was then justice secretary. Michael Biggs said then that his father had expressed regret for the robbery, but did not regret ""living the life he had."" Britain's Telegraph newspaper, in its obituary, makes the point that while Biggs won notoriety for the heist and his subsequent life on the run, ""people tended to forget that he had seriously wounded the train-driver, Jack Mills, who died six years later having never recovered his health."" Biggs' death coincides with the release in the United Kingdom of a two-part BBC series about the 1963 train robbery that made him famous. A Twitter account that publicizes Biggs' books, @RonnieBiggsNews, said Wednesday: ""Sadly we lost Ron during the night. As always, his timing was perfect to the end. Keep him and his family in your thoughts."" People we've lost in 2013 .","Family, friends of Ronnie Biggs tell his publisher he died early Wednesday .

"(CNN)After days of vehemently denying claims in the media, high-profile lawyer Alan Dershowitz wants a judge to step in -- specifically, to ""strike the allegations"" against him of sexual misconduct involving teenage girls. Dershowitz has been outspoken since a court filing last week named him as one of several prominent people accused of having sex with minors with help from self-made billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. But he took his defense to a new level Monday, with a pair of filings in federal court. In a motion, the Harvard University professor asked the court to erase the allegation naming him -- as part of a lawsuit against the federal government, though he hasn't been charged or sued -- from the docket. He also asked the judge to issue a ""show cause order against"" the lawyers for the woman making the claim, to compel them to give evidence in court in support of their allegation. Read the filing (.pdf) Such attempts to have allegations erased from court documents have been denied before, though Dershowitz argued that his situation is different. He accused his accusers of ""character assassination,"" claiming that courts have the ""authority to strike material that is 'scandalous, immaterial or redundant.' "" ""The docket sheets and courtrooms of the United States District Court for (southern) Florida should not be used as a bulletin board to which irrelevant, baseless, and ill-willed reputational attacks can be tacked up without consequence,"" he argued. Paul Cassell, one of the lawyers representing the alleged victims, told CNN on Tuesday that his clients ""do not oppose Mr. Dershowitz having an opportunity to present his arguments to the court."" Referring to one of his clients by the name used for her in court documents, Cassell added, ""Jane Doe #3, however, has been viciously attacked by Mr. Dershowitz. We have requested an opportunity to meet with (federal prosecutors) so that we can seek their assistance in presenting evidence ... that will help Jane Doe #3 respond to these unfair attacks."" Cassell and lawyer Bradley Edwards filed suit Tuesday against Dershowitz, alleging defamation. They say statements he made to the media recently are ""defamatory per se directly attacking the fitness of the plaintiffs (in this case) to engage in the honored profession of the practice of law,"" according to a court filing obtained by CNN. They pointed to an interview Dershowitz gave to CNN. In a written statement Wednesday, Dershowitz said the suit will require depositions from Cassell, Edwards, Jane Doe #3 and him. ""I hope they will not try to hide behind litigation and other privileges, so that the truth will come out,"" he said. Prince Andrew also denies tie to sex ring . Along with Britain's Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the federal court filing in Florida last week as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through Epstein. Epstein, an investment banker, pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation, but there were no federal charges after he and authorities signed off on a nonprosecution agreement. But some of Epstein's alleged victims aren't on board with the deal, thinking he should have stiffer charges and penalties. Four of them took federal prosecutors to court, suing them to reopen the case because they believed their rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act were violated by the nonprosecution agreement. Two of them entered the discussion in the court filing late last month, including the one described as Jane Doe #3. The filing alleged she was a minor when Epstein made her a ""sex slave"" and made ""her available for sex to politically connected and financially powerful people."" Those big names included Prince Andrew, who through Buckingham Palace has rejected the allegations, and they also included Dershowitz. According to the filing, ""Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands."" Dershowitz: 'Totally false' claims could 'damage my reputation irrevocably' The celebrity lawyer and professor subsequently issued an adamant public denial, saying the case ""is all about money"" and ""completely made up."" He went further in his court filings, including a sworn affidavit in which he said ""lawyers for Jane Doe #3 ... leveled totally false and outrageous charges against me that have been reported around the world and threaten to damage my reputation irrevocably."" ""Never under any circumstance have I ever had any sexual contact of any kind, which includes massages or any physical contact whatsoever, with Jane Doe #3,"" he added. Dershowitz said, for instance, that his wife and daughter accompanied him on his sole visit to Epstein's Caribbean island as well as the one time he went to Epstein's New Mexico house -- at which point it was under construction and no girls were visible. ""Let me assert categorically, without reservation and with full awareness of the risks of perjury,"" he stated, ""that I did not ever, under any circumstances, have any sexual contact of any kind with Jane Doe #3.""","NEW: Alan Dershowitz indicates he will give deposition for defamation suit against him .

"(CNN)Jami Smith Lane clearly remembers saying goodbye to her 14-year-old daughter, Sierra Wilder, for the last time. It was a typical interaction between a parent and a teenage child. Sierra had just got into her uncle's jeep, ready to set off for a vacation in Florida. ""I put her bags in the back, and I said, 'You get over here.' And I made her open that door, and I gave her a hug and a kiss on the cheek -- and she kind of rolled her eyes at me. And I said, 'I love you,'"" Lane recalled. The fleeting moment has become a precious memory for Lane. ""That's something you can't ever, ever take away,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday. The small plane carrying Sierra back home from vacation crashed Friday in western Kentucky. Sierra and three others on board the plane were killed. But her 7-year-old cousin, Sailor Gutzler, somehow survived the disaster. 'We thought we had so much more time' Sailor's extraordinary tale of survival and the tragic deaths of four of her family members -- her mother, father, sister and cousin -- have captured worldwide attention. At the same time, the family and the community in the small town of Nashville, Illinois, are still trying to come to terms with the loss of four beloved members. ""This town and this world is just going to be so different without them,"" said Lane. ""They were all such beautiful, beautiful people -- inside and out."" She described her daughter as ""a girly girl"" who loved music, dancing, clothes, makeup and her friends and family. ""Sierra was so kind to everybody, and she looked at the positive in everything,"" she told CNN. Lane said the loss has taught her a powerful lesson that she hoped other people would take away from the disaster. ""You don't know if somebody's going to walk out that door and you're never going to see them again,"" she said. ""That's what all her friends are saying at school -- they thought they had so much time with her, just like we did. We thought we had so much more time."" Sierra had four brothers and also loved taking care of her younger cousins. Family members are coping as best they can. ""We're helping each other out and leaning on each other,"" Lane said. ""We have a lot of kids in the family and we were very close, so it's very difficult. The children are doing as well as I think can be expected."" 'I can think of her kicking a soccer ball' The other family members who died in the plane crash were Sierra's uncle and aunt, Marty and Kimberly Gutzler, and Piper, their 9-year-old daughter. Piper loved sports, particularly soccer, basketball and softball, according to an obituary published Monday. ""I can think of her kicking a soccer ball or running around -- that`s what I think about,"" Michael Brink, a school superintendent in Nashville, told CNN affiliate KTVI. Piper also enjoyed ""going to the beach and being with family,"" the obituary said. Marty Gutzler, 48, owned a furniture store in Nashville and loved flying, boating and spending time with his family, his obituary said. Chris Collins -- the director of the airport in Mount Vernon, Illinois, where Gutzler housed his Piper PA-34 -- said they'd known each other for more than 20 years. ""He was on a first-name basis with everyone. That's how Marty was. He knew everyone. And everyone knew him,"" Collins told CNN affiliate KFVS. He said what he remembered about Gutzler, a pilot of more than 30 years, was ""his friendliness, his smile -- he never met a stranger."" 'A devastation for our community' Kimberly Gutzler, 46, ""loved her animals, traveling, painting and spending time with her family,"" according to her obituary. She and her husband were pillars of the community, according to Travis Volz, a family friend. ""They were just a mainstay for every event, everything, everything that happened, every sport, every activity they were always involved in it,"" Volz told KTVI. Marty Gutzler's pastor, Matthew Wietfeldt, at the Trinity Lutheran Church, said the loss of the four family members ""is a devastation for our community."" ""We're hurting,"" he told CNN. ""We're so saddened by the loss and are grieving the loss of Marty and Kim and Piper and Sierra."" Lane said the community was rallying around the family and remembering the dead by repeating the phrase ""fly high."" ""Everyone's opening their arms and sending well wishes,"" she said. ""And all of them are telling everyone to 'fly high.'"" I was the sole survivor: 4 stories of plane crash survival .","""We thought we had so much more time,"" Jami Smith Lane tells CNN .

"Sheriff's deputies delivered the fatal wound that killed a man who, along with his wife, gunned down two police officers and a civilian in Las Vegas on Sunday, a sheriff's department official said Wednesday. Authorities had earlier said the woman shot and killed her husband before taking her own life. But Assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill told reporters Wednesday that a review of forensic evidence at the scene and autopsy results showed that police fatally wounded the gunman. ""We made a determination that she did not shoot him. He did suffer a gunshot wound, and we believe the entrance wound was here,"" McMahill said, pointing to his own collarbone. In fact, he said, the fatal wound was delivered from a rifle fired by police. McMahill said three officers fired on the suspect. ""We do not believe any of her shots hit him,"" he said. McMahill said investigators were reviewing a ""tremendous"" amount of graphic video of the suspects during the rampage. ""The video shows you exactly how vicious and coldblooded these murderers were,"" he said. In the Walmart security video, released by police, the Millers are seen in their final moments. They are lying wounded in an aisle with various store items surrounding them -- items, police say, they used for cover. They hold firearms, which they at times point at each other. At the end of the video, Amanda Miller turns the gun on herself. The latest developments came as still-shaken colleagues of the fallen officers wore black bands to pay tribute to Igor Soldo, 31, shot in the back of the head, and his partner, Alyn Beck, 41, struck by a bullet in the neck. The killers apparently considered law enforcement as oppressors, authorities said. They placed a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and a Nazi swastika on one officer and left a note saying, ""This is the beginning of the revolution,"" on the other officer's body, authorities said. After gunning down the officers, Jerad and Amanda Miller ran to a nearby Walmart, police said, where they killed a bystander before barricading themselves inside the store during a firefight with responding officers. On Wednesday, authorities revealed that police had previous contact with the couple on three occasions this year -- in February, April and on May 31 -- without incident. ""There was no indication provided by the suspects of their anti-police feelings,"" McMahill said. In February, detectives from the Southern Nevada Counter-Terrorism Center investigated threats made by Jerad Miller against the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, McMahill said. Miller threatened to shoot staff at the agency after his suspended driver's license was taken from him during a traffic stop, according to Danielle Dean, a spokeswoman for the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Detectives who interviewed Miller did not perceive the ""potential for an ongoing threat,"" McMahill said. A second contact came on April 10 when officers interviewed the Millers as witnesses in a domestic violence case, McMahill said. The couple provided voluntary statements about the alleged assault and did not display any ""anti-police"" sentiments, he said. On May 31, the Millers again provided statements to police officers about an alleged sexual assault of a neighbor without incident. ""Because an individual may online espouse ideology that is anti-government or anti-police does not make them translate into a murderer,"" McMahill said ""What happened to change these two people into murderers, we don't know."" Authorities said three weapons were recovered from the suspects: a Smith & Wesson M&P 9 mm handgun, a Ruger .38-caliber revolver and a Winchester 1300 12 gauge shotgun with a pistol grip. The weapons were not registered, as required by law. Police officers have been kneeling in front of a makeshift memorial overflowing with flowers and miniature flags, and vowed to honor the slain officers and the uniform they deeply cherished. ""It's one thing to die in the line of duty when you're actually in the act of doing something,"" said Sgt. Trey Gethoefer of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. ""It's a complete different feeling when your two officers are basically assassinated because of the uniform they're wearing."" The officers said they will wear their badges with pride. Las Vegas police will double up in patrol cars for the next few days as they mourn their two colleagues. ""We are the only thing that stands on that line every day between good and evil,"" Gethoefer said. ""And we have to draw that line in the sand so the good people can enjoy the freedoms on a daily basis."" Who were the victims? Husbands, fathers . Beck and Soldo were both married with children: Beck left behind a wife and three children; Soldo, a wife and a baby. ""He had three children and a wife, he had everything to concentrate on,"" Gethoefer said of Beck. ""When you're a beacon in your community, out of uniform and in, that speaks volumes about a person's character."" Beck walked the walk, he said. He believed in policing by foot and handshakes. His partner, Soldo, shared the same commitment. His parents fled Bosnia-Herzegovina with their two sons in 1995 to escape a bloody war. They settled in Nebraska. The two teenage brothers grew up to be police officers, a job they loved and cherished after the ethnic intolerance in their homeland. Their relatives are devastated to lose their son in a country they fled to for refuge. Las Vegas residents also mourned the officers. ""When I first found out, I was so upset,"" said a tearful Angela Austin. The officers were a constant in her neighborhood, she said. Opinion: Honor my brave friend, a good cop . 'I got five deaths on my shoulders' As more details emerge, so do the signs. Kellie Fielder said one of the suspects, Amanda Miller, was her best friend. The Millers were staying with her for about two weeks before the shooting. She saw them leave on that fateful day, armed to the teeth. ""There were two duffel bags in a cart. They had two duffel bags on their back,"" Fielder said. ""She just hugged me and said, 'I love you, thank you for everything.' "" She said she never thought they were planning the carnage. ""I was stupid, I guess,"" Fielder said. ""I got five deaths on my shoulders. I should have called the cops,"" she said, crying. ""I'm so so so sorry -- to everybody. I'm sorry."" Victim's friend: 'You never expect it' Targeting officers at random . Police believe the couple acted alone and targeted officers at random. The bystander who was shot was identified as shopper Joseph Wilcox, 31. He was going to confront the suspects.

"New York (CNN) -- In one of the largest single-day operations against the Mafia in FBI history, federal agents working with local law enforcement fanned out across Italy, New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island to arrest 127 people allegedly involved in organized crime, officials said. Alleged members from the five prominent New York families -- the Gambino, Colombo, Bonanno, Genovese and Lucchese families -- were arrested Thursday, based on 16 indictments in four different jurisdictions, Attorney General Eric Holder said during a news conference in New York. ""Today's arrests and charges mark an important step forward in disrupting La Cosa Nostra's illegal activities,"" he said, referring to the criminal organization by its Italian name. Ninety-one members and their associates, including one in Italy, were charged with federal crimes that include conspiracy, arson, extortion, narcotics trafficking, illegal gambling, labor racketeering and murders that date back as far as 1981, according to a U.S. Justice Department statement. An additional 36 suspects were charged for their roles in the alleged criminal activity, the statement said. About 125 people, including several high-ranking members and much of the Colombo family leadership, are currently in custody following a raid that Holder described as the largest single-day operation against the notorious crime network. Four of those charged were previously in custody, officials said. Members of the New England Patriarca family and New Jersey-based Decavalcante family are also accused of related federal crimes. ""Some allegations involve classic mob hits to eliminate perceived rivals,"" Holder told reporters. ""Others involve senseless murders."" He described two murder victims who were allegedly killed in a public bar over a dispute concerning a spilled drink. Holder's appearance in New York with leadership from local and federal law enforcement perhaps underscores the significance the Justice Department attributes to Thursday's sweep. Television images showed several men handcuffed and hand-checked by federal agents -- an apparent part of the ""unprecedented"" 800-person task force involved in the raid. The move comes amid concerns about a possible resurgence of organized crime despite a scattered recent history of defections, beginning with acting crime boss of the Lucchese family, Alphonse D'Arco, who admitted to ""cooperating with the federal government"" starting in 1991. Gambino family underboss Salvatore ""Sammy the Bull"" Gravano defected later that same year, providing testimony -- in exchange for a reduced sentence -- which led to the conviction of the infamous Gambino kingpin John Gotti. ""If you look at the mob in the '50s and '60s and '70s, there were virtually no informants,"" said New York Waterfront Commissioner Ronald Goldstock. ""The picture has changed dramatically today. The mob is practically unrecognizable."" But Thursday's sweep may now do away with ""the myth"" of the mafia and the widely held notion that ""La Cosa Nostra is a shell of its former self,"" said Janice Fedarcyk, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York Division. ""I think we made a serious dent today,"" Fedarcyk said, but she warned of a new generation of criminal leadership ""coming up behind them."" The mob revival concept, however, is the subject of debate. ""Their leadership ranks have been battered by federal and local law enforcement over the years,"" said James B. Jacobs, a professor at the New York University School of Law. ""It's very hard to see to how they could have ever reconstituted in the way they were before."" Attorney General Holder said organized crime is not resurgent and no longer nationwide, but still subtracts millions of dollars from local businesses by way of a ""mob tax,"" or tribute exacted through corrupt local officials. Holder described the phenomenon as ""a major threat to the economic well-being of this country."" On Thursday, New Jersey and New York prosecutors identified more than a dozen New Jersey residents with alleged mob ties who worked as officials for longshoremen's unions, charging them with racketeering and other related offenses, according to a joint statement from district attorneys in both states. A man described as a ""soldier in the Genovese organized crime family"" allegedly collected money from port workers, extorting payments after the workers received their annual Christmas bonuses. Police say workers from the International Longshoremen's Association, Local 1235, were forced to pay corrupt officials between $500 and $5,000 each year if they hoped to rise above entry-level dock jobs, according to New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. ""Organized crime means what it has always meant on the waterfront: Mobsters getting rich on the backs of dock workers,"" he said. Despite declines in mob activity in other industries, dockyards in the U.S. Northeast are places where organized crime remains a threat, according to Waterfront Commissioner Goldstock. And with law enforcement focused on preventing terrorism and providing port security, organized crime is often left without the ""day-to-day pressures"" it may have felt in years past, he said. Last April, 14 members of the Gambino crime family -- including Daniel Marino, who was then considered the family head -- pleaded guilty to charges that included murder, racketeering, extortion and prostitution of minors, court officials said. CNN's Mary Snow, Deborah Feyerick, Terry Frieden and Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.","NEW: Some 125 people are currently in custody, says Attorney General Holder .

"(CNN)The smallest of clues can help to crack a case. That's what authorities in Oklahoma are hoping in the 34-year-old murder of Tracey Neilson. They've released images of an old cable repair ticket book, and are asking for the public's help in identifying the owner of that book. The last ticket in the book is for work done at Neilson's home the morning she was murdered -- January 5, 1981. She was celebrating her 21st birthday that day. ""At 5 o'clock that evening, Jeff Neilson, Tracey's husband of only five months, found her dead inside their apartment at the Jamestown Square Apartments in Moore,"" the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. ""Tracey had been stabbed numerous times. Moore police responded to the scene and began investigating. The next day, the Moore Police Department requested OSBI assistance with the case. During the next 34 years, dozens of OSBI agents would work on the case."" They followed more than 1,500 leads, the statement said. On a bottom corner of the book is a box for an employee name. Authorities want to identify the three letters written in that box. They are offering up to $11,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who killed Neilson.","Tracey Neilson was stabbed to death January 5, 1981 .

"Two sources inside Mitt Romney's inner circle tell CNN that while Romney isn't planning a presidential bid, he's listening to a lot of people who want him to get in the race -- although he remains skeptical himself. ""A lot of people in Romneyland are rooting for him to get in,"" says one source. ""He's not one of them."" Another source close to Romney puts it this way: ""I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't bet either."" The key, these sources say, is that Romney wants to see a Republican candidate who can win the White House. So there's a willingness to wait to see who will run for the GOP nomination. While these sources say that, as of today, it's not likely Romney would run, it can't be ruled out entirely -- and if the early seeding were to produce a weak field, Romney might be in a position to be a late entrant. But as one ally points out, this is all ""in the realm of the truly hypothetical,"" and still remains ""very unlikely."" Even so, Romney allies are now indulging in the hypothetical. ""If Romney were to run,"" one source says, ""he would be the last guy in the race."" Several sources have said if Jeb Bush and Chris Christie are running, Romney would be less likely to enter the race. One source adds that Romney is telling people that ""he wants to see someone run who can beat Hillary Clinton. He believes the world has become a very dangerous place."" There are differences among those close to Romney about who could best beat Clinton. Romney, according to one of the sources, thinks Bush would be a winnable candidate. Others in Romneyworld disagree, saying he is too tied to Wall Street and is too rusty. Christie is another candidate who could have some appeal to Romney supporters, although to varying degrees. One former adviser says the Romney boomlet is "" a byproduct of everybody else notdoing  a great job"" of starting their campaigns. He says if Jeb Bush were to decline a run, that would probably increase Romney's chances of running ""by about 20 percent,"" but he still says it's a longshot . Related: How many ways can Romney say ""no"" to 2016? On the road again? One big question is Romney's wife, Ann, who will be the key to any decision. She said ""never again"" after the last run. ""I am over it,"" she told CNN in June 2013. ""It's still hard to watch things and watch the news and feel like you wish you were there, but you move on."" Related: Mitt and Ann Romney open up to CNN . Ann Romney was a reluctant warrior on the second presidential bid in 2012. But lately, she's been more publicly cagey about it, telling Neil Cavuto on Fox, ""We will see, won't we?"" Romney himself has also been less definitive about his future -- clearly enjoying this spate of redemption, popularity and relevancy as a campaign surrogate. Big GOP donors have not ruled out the Romney third-time-is-a-charm scenario, but they're mostly not engaging right now. ""They will start committing after the midterms, as that's when the early train begins,"" says one 2012 Romney financial supporter. He also added, however, that Christie now has the largest advantage ""given his relationships with key donors in the Northeast."" There is some benefit, this financial supporter says, to having a candidate who has been vetted multiple times. The downside, he adds, is putting the family through it again. In the year after their presidential loss, Mitt and Ann Romney were not shy about saying their time has come and gone for a presidential bid, after losing twice. ""It's not my time,"" Romney told me in June 2013. ""I didn't win. It's time for someone else to get in there and give it their best shot."" Romney on 2016: It's time for someone else . Although, in that same interview, Romney spoke of the experience of running as a ""thrill."" ""And frankly I'd do it again, but -- but it's not my time,"" he said then. That was one year ago. Out of the limelight . Since ending his 2012 campaign, Romney has mostly stayed out of the limelight. He has hosted an annual conference of policy and political leaders and donors in Park City, Utah, to discuss some of the nation's problems and talk about solutions. This year, he has appeared at a number of fund-raisers and public events for candidates, proving to be one of the Republican Party's most popular surrogates -- and fiercest critics of President Barack Obama's foreign and defense policies. He wrote a Washington Post op-ed earlier this month arguing against defense budget cuts, saying policy makers ""...will choose whether to succumb to the easy path of continued military hollowing or to honor their constitutional pledge to protect the United States."" On Monday, he appeared at a rally for GOP candidates in Colorado, focusing his criticism on the President's remarks on ""60 Minutes"" that the nation's intelligence community had underestimated ISIS. ""For the President to say, 'Gee, we underestimated ISIS' suggests he wasn't looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him,"" he told the audience, explaining that ideas about how to deal with the terrorist group were brought to him as early as January. ""I guess he was busy doing other things -- vacations, golf, fund-raising. He just hasn't done the job he promised to do."" Besides the Colorado event and a fund-raiser for Virginia House candidate Barbara Comstock Tuesday, Romney appeared this month at a birthday event for Christie, who some Romney supporters criticized for being too close to Obama during the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Romney will be stepping up his surrogacy work as the campaign heads into the home stretch, with part of his itinerary taking him to some of the key battlegrounds for control of the Senate. On Wednesday, he goes to a fundraiser for Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal; on Thursday, he'll stump with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and also attend a rally with Michigan GOP candidates.  Friday, Romney travels to Louisiana for Senate nominee Rep. Bill Cassidy, and later goes to Utah for House candidate Mia Love. The Romneys also spend a lot of time with their 22 grandchildren. They told the New York Times' Mark Leibovich in an upcoming article they are scaling down. They're selling their Massachusetts townhouse and are considering doing the same with their seaside home in La Jolla, California -- which sparked some negative press when word leaked they wanted to add a car elevator there -- and will make their home in Utah, where one of their sons lives. 3 reasons Mitt Romney will run in 2016  (and 4 reasons he won't)","Romney advisers have tried to interest him in another run for the White House .

"Under a clear night sky on a rocky arid outcrop, South African astronomers are waiting for the stars to come out and play. Sightings of faraway galaxies, black holes and the Milky Way are just part of the job for the starwatchers at the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). ""The site is in an ideal location because there is very little light pollution so the skies are extremely dark,"" said Nicola Loaring, an astronomer at SAAO. ""We don't get extreme seasons here, so it's good conditions for our research all year round."" Based in Sutherland -- a four-hour drive from Cape Town -- the observatory is home to one of the largest single optical telescopes in the world and is symbolic of South Africa's growing commitment to astronomy. The appropriately named South African Large Telescope is the jewel of the observatory, capable of detecting a candle flame as far away as the moon and light a billion times too faint to be seen by the naked eye, according to SAAO's astronomers. Read more: Tech cities and mega dams: Africa's giant infrastructure projects . Loaring said: ""(SALT) is used to study a range of astronomical objects from asteroids to exoplanets, which are planets orbiting other suns."" The telescope is funded by a consortium including South Africa, the United States, Germany, Poland, India, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In 1996, the South African government, under the leadership of the late Nelson Mandela, identified astronomy as a key area for investment. In a white paper, lawmakers recognized that if South Africa failed to invest in ""flagship sciences"" then the country would be viewed as a ""second-class"" nation ""chained forever"" to the need for food and clothing. Kevin Govender, director of the IAU Office of Astronomy for Development, said that through investment in science and technology, the government can help tackle some of South Africa's social problems. Read more: Will 'world's biggest' hydro power project light up Africa? Last year, the government, led by President Jacob Zuma, announced it would invest 200 million rand (around $20 million) in astronomy training over the next five years. Govender added: ""The target that we have is to spend 1% of GDP on science and technology. We haven't reached that yet."" But he added that the benefits of financing astrophysics are already paying off by boosting higher education, employing more professors and contributing to the ""knowledge economy."" ""This is a an exciting time for astronomy in Africa,"" he said, ""inspiring young people toward education, having the skills to develop economies on the continent and build infrastructure."" Govender added: ""When we train an engineer to do a job, they gain the right skills, meaning they can go out and contribute to the country's economy in a number of different ways."" In 2018, construction will begin on the ambitious Square Kilometer Array (SKA), an extremely powerful radio telescope based in the deserts of South Africa and Australia, in a partnership with more than 20 countries. SKA South Africa project director Bernie Fanaroff said: ""It has already attracted a lot of young people into science and mathematics in South Africa and from other African countries and it's attracted a lot of top-rate scientists."" Read more: Bright sun, bright future: Can Africa unlock its solar potential? While South Africa boasts the best resources on the continent, it is just one of the nations leading the way in the pan-African astronomy drive. Observatories of all shapes and sizes are scattered across Africa in locations such as Burkina Faso, Namibia, Nigeria and Egypt to name a few. Other countries are focusing on training the next generation of astronomers, with the University of Nairobi in Kenya, for example, offering an undergraduate course in astrophysics, designed to train young people to work in observatories. Telescopes and observatories will continue to spring up in Africa as international cooperation and investment flows into the continent, according to Abiy Tekola, assistant secretary-general at the East African Astronomical Society (EAAS). He said such a trend ""will eventually feed into the economic development of the region."" Established in 2010 to promote awareness of astronomy, EAAS members include Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. And development in the region is already taking off. In October, Ethiopia opened East Africa's largest observatory, in the Entoto Mountains on the outskirts of the capital Addis Ababa. The facility -- run by the Ethiopian Space Science Society (ESSS) -- is the first step towards a space program, according to group director Solomon Belay. He said the project, which includes two large telescopes and cost $3.4 million, will inspire children ""towards science and technology especially in physics, mathematics, medicine (and) engineering."" Read more: Earth, wind and water: Ethiopia bids to be Africa's powerhouse . Despite Ethiopia's mantle as one of Africa's fastest-growing economies, agriculture makes up the lion's share of output with over a quarter of the population remaining below the poverty line. But Belay believes the observatory will have a profound impact on the country's progress. ""The effect of the program in Ethiopia is scientific development (and) the transformation of an agricultural-based economy to an industrial-based and knowledge-based economy,"" said Belay. The ESSS hopes the telescopes will also boost tourism, as space fanatics visit the Horn of Africa nation to admire the country's first observatory. Belay added that he wants Ethiopia to become a ""world-class research"" center for satellite technology and earth observation by 2025. ""(The program intends) to see a transformed society in Ethiopia and Africa as a whole,"" he said.","Funding astronomy and science in Africa could promote economic growth .

"(CNN)As Bill Cosby faces a slew of sexual assault allegations, two women are joining a defamation lawsuit against him. Linda Traitz told CNN that she and  fellow accuser Therese Serignese are joining the suit, which was originally filed by Tamara Green. Traitz, Serignese and Green are three of at least 23 women who have accused the comedian of sexual misconduct ranging from groping to rape. And after each came forward with the allegations, they were called liars by representatives for Cosby, the defamation suits says. Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has called the spate of sexual assault accusations against the comedian ""ridiculous."" He told CNN it defies common sense that ""so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years."" CNN was unable to reach Singer for comment about the latest development. Here are the claims of the three women in the suit: . Linda Joy Traitz . Traitz said Cosby pushed himself on her when she worked as a waitress at a restaurant in Los Angeles that Cosby co-owned when she met him in 1969. Traitz was either 18 or 19 at the time, she said; she did not recall exactly. But she was fresh out of high school and new to the city, she said. Cosby offered her a ride home but on the way, told her he'd like to swing by the beach with her in his Rolls Royce, she said. They parked, and he offered her drugs, an array of brightly colored pills, ""to relax,"" she alleged. She said no, a few times. ""He kept offering me the pills,"" she alleged. She claimed that he then groped her chest, pushing her down in the seat and toward the door, and tried to lie on top of her. Singer, Cosby's attorney, has said her account was not true. ""Ms. Traitz is the latest example of people coming out of the woodwork with fabricated or unsubstantiated stories about my client,"" Singer has said. Numerous arrests speckle Traitz's rap sheet, including on suspicion of theft, battery and types of deception -- fraud and impersonation -- often in connection with drug possession. But Traitz spoke openly about her record to CNN, including her last arrest in 2008, which led to more than three years in prison for drug trafficking and possession. ""When I got sent to prison ... it saved my life,"" Traitz said. ""It was a great experience for me."" She said it ended her addiction to pain pills, and she's been clean ever since. Therese Serignese . Florida nurse Therese Serignese, 57, told ABC's 20/20 that she was a 19-year-old model visiting Las Vegas when Cosby told her to take some pills in a private dressing room following a performance. After taking the pills, she remembered ""feeling drugged, and I was kind of leaning forward, and he was behind me having sex with me. And I -- I remember it because it was not good."" Serignese never made public accusations in the immediate aftermath. She explained her decision in an article she wrote in Friday's New York Daily News. ""Cosby was everywhere. Everyone thought he was a great family man. I knew he wasn't. I just couldn't prove it with anything but my word. There was no video camera or DNA evidence. No one else had accused him publicly yet,"" Serignese wrote. Serignese says she wanted to testify in support of Andrea Constand, who filed a civil lawsuit against Cosby. ""When the first victim came forward in 2005, I was angry that he called her a liar. I wanted to back her up. But even then I worried about the repercussions. I had younger children then,"" Serignese wrote. ""Ten years ago, the climate still wasn't right,"" she said. ""We would have all been humiliated. Now, I could see it was time, and I would be safer. I wouldn't be alone. It took me 38 years to feel safe. Tamara Green . According to her lawsuit, Green was an aspiring model in 1970 who met Cosby through a mutual friend. The two met for lunch, even though Green was feeling ill, the document states. Cosby allegedly gave Green some pills, saying they were cold medicine -- but Green started feeling ""weak, dizzy and woozy."" Cosby took her to her apartment and started ""groping me and kissing me and touching me and handling me and you know, taking off my clothes,"" Green told NBC's ""Today"" show. Cosby allegedly left two $100 bills on her coffee table and left, the lawsuit says. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Three women are suing Cosby for defamation .

"(CNN)The flashing neon advertising signs and crowded crosswalks of Tokyo may not resemble the slow suburban settlement of Maseru -- the capital of the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho in southern Africa. But the two countries are now being linked by an unlikely dish: trout. Thanks to Highlands Trout, and their operation 2,200m above sea level in the Maluti Mountains, supermarket shoppers in Osaka, Kyoto and Tokyo can now get their seafood fix from the landlocked African nation. ""Lesotho provide(s) ideal, pristine environmental conditions for the farming of large trout,"" explains Fred Formanek, managing partner of Advance Africa Management Services, who has developed the Highlands Trout project since 2009.  ""Water temperatures are close to ideal [for trout] for most of the year due to the altitude."" Production started in 2012 with a haul of 500 tonnes of trout in the first year. During the current financial year, the company aims to produce three-times that amount. While the business says the Japan-bound fish are stuck on a ship for four weeks, executives insist the added logistics -- and extra costs -- are worth it. ""The price premium that we currently receive... makes up for any additional logistics costs,"" says Formanek. Business beginnings . The production process starts with the fish arriving in Lesotho from Denmark as eggs. They are then stored in temperature-controlled pens until they become ""fingerlings"" weighing around 10g. The baby fish are so fragile at this stage that the water quality is monitored regularly. Once they become fingerlings, the fish are transferred to small nursery cages in the Katse dam -- Africa's second largest. In these more natural conditions, the fish grow to around 20cm in length and a weight of around 150g. They are then moved to larger ""grow cages"" where they live their last days in the mountain kingdom. Through this whole process, which takes around 20 months, some of the fish grow as heavy as 2.8 kg -- lean fish meat fresh for sushi, soups and sizzling grills. And it's the vast majority of these fish -- 85% -- that will be gutted and loaded onto 40ft refrigerated containers and shipped from the South African port of Durban to Asia.  The remainder is sold to South Africa  (10%) and Lesotho (5%). Foreign inputs . But it's not just the fish that make a long journey to keep this business afloat. Using materials and expertise from abroad has been key to the success of the project. Specially designed cages have been imported from Norway (which is also where the farm manager was based for 20 years), while most of the protein rich pellets the fish nibble on whilst growing come from France. But not all aspects of this operation are imported. ""We employ just over 100 [local people] on a permanent basis,"" explains managing director of Highlands Trout Grant Merrick. ""The bulk of the employees are directly involved with the growing and processing of fish....We have many employees who have never been in formal employment prior to starting at Highlands Trout."" This is an important consideration in a country where 24% of the population was unemployed in 2008 -- the last year records were collected.  Government estimates from figures collected in 2010/11 show that 57% of the country lives in poverty. Future fish . While this might be a significant operation now, the project has had to deal with difficulties to get to where it is today. ""The extremely remote area, developing a high-tech business with the highest levels of food safety certification, in a country where aquaculture and fisheries did not exist, presented plenty of challenges,"" explains Formanek. And when the business is compared to the global market the impact is limited. Expert Peter Rand of the IUCN Salmon Specialist Group describes the production figures as ""very small"" compared to other sectors. He explains that salmon production in countries like Norway and Chile ""is more than 1 million metric tons per year."" But the Lesotho is showing no signs of shrinking in the face of the competition. ""Projected growth is ramping up by some 750 tonnes per annum,"" explains Formanek. ""Expansion into a second dam in the Highlands called Mohale Dam is in planning."" While Highlands Trout may not swamp the supermarkets anytime soon, their use of Lesotho's natural resources and remote mountain landscape could help the operation see some success.

"Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday ordered three U.S. diplomatic officials expelled from the country, accusing them of conspiring against his government. The announcement comes after the U.S. State Department expressed concerns about the state of affairs in Venezuela. Three anti-government protesters died in clashes last week in Caracas, and authorities have issued an arrest warrant for an opposition leader on charges including conspiracy and murder in connection with the violence. ""We are deeply concerned by rising tensions, by the violence surrounding this February 12 protest and by the issuing of a warrant for the arrest of the opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Saturday. ""We join the secretary general of (the Organization of American States) in condemning the violence and calling on authorities to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the death of peaceful protesters."" But the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry fired back at the Obama administration. ""The U.S. government is lying when the denounced the arrest of anti- peaceful protesters,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""The world must know that there is sufficient evidence that the groups that have caused violence in recent days are headed by Mr. Leopoldo López."" Lopez's party, Popular Will, has accused the government of being responsible for violence during the protests. In a YouTube video posted from an undisclosed location over the weekend, Lopez called for new anti-government protests Tuesday and vowed to show his face in front of Venezuela's Justice Ministry and hand over a list of demands from the Venezuelan people to government officials. ""It has been said in recent days that they want to see me held prisoner. I will be there to show my face. I have nothing to be afraid of. I have not committed any crime. I have been a Venezuelan committed to our country, to our people, to our constitution and to our future,"" he said. ""If there is some decision to illegally imprison me, well, I will be there, to assume this persecution and this infamous decision by the state.""

"London (CNN)Britain's Prince Andrew does not have plans to take legal action against a woman who has named him in a sex abuse lawsuit in Florida, CNN learned Tuesday. The allegation that he had sex with an underage girl, made in a federal court filing in Florida last week, has been firmly rejected by Buckingham Palace. ""It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation,"" the palace said in a statement Monday. A palace spokesman, who is not named per custom, pointed out Friday that Prince Andrew is not a direct party to the ""ongoing civil proceedings in the United States."" At the same time, prominent U.S. attorney Alan Dershowitz, facing a similar accusation, has filed a motion asking a federal court to ""strike the allegations made against him"" regarding alleged sexual misconduct involving underage girls. In the same document, filed Monday, Dershowitz requested ""a show cause order"" against the lawyers for the woman making this claim ""and awarding such other relief that the Court deems just and proper."" Along with Prince Andrew and others, Dershowitz was named in the court filing in Florida as one of the prominent people who had sexual contact with teenage girls through self-made billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who pleaded guilty some years ago in Florida to a state charge of prostitution solicitation. Dershowitz, a Harvard University professor and high-profile lawyer, has never been charged with a crime in this case, nor has he been sued by the alleged victim. He rejected the allegations in an interview with CNN's ""New Day"" on Monday and later, while speaking to CNN's Hala Gorani. 'Greatest man there is' Amid the swirl of allegations, Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson reportedly gave strong backing Monday to her former husband, the Duke of York. She spoke to reporters in Verbier in the Swiss Alps, where she had been on a ski holiday with Andrew and their daughter Eugenie, according to UK media reports. ""The York family is a tight unit. We've always been a tight unit,"" the Telegraph newspaper quoted Ferguson as saying. ""He is the greatest man there is. It was the finest moment of my life in 1986 when I married him. He is a great man, the best in the world."" Andrew is a son of Queen Elizabeth II and a brother of Prince Charles, the next in line for the British throne. State plea deal . The federal court filing alleges that the woman, referred to as Jane Doe #3, was forced to have sex with several men when she was a teenager. Roberts made the allegations in the civil motion filed last week in U.S. District Court in southern Florida, joined by another unnamed woman. While Roberts was not identified by name in the filing, her name was widely reported in the British news media over the weekend, and Buckingham Palace included it in the statement. (Dershowitz noted that in his CNN interview, it was CNN that identified her by name.) Roberts and another woman are seeking to join two other women who are arguing in federal court for the U.S. government to take a fresh look at its case involving Epstein. The investment banker agreed to a state plea deal in 2007 and began serving an 18-month sentence in 2008, according to The New York Times. Epstein was the subject of a federal investigation, but a deal allowed him to plead guilty to a lesser state charge and avoid a potential federal case, the Times and The Washington Post reported. Prince Andrew has been photographed with Epstein. The prince previously issued an apology for his friendship with the scandal-plagued billionaire. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and Max Foster reported from London, with Greg Botelho writing from Atlanta.","CNN learns that Prince Andrew will not take legal action over the allegations .

"Surabaya, Indonesia (CNN)It is impossible to measure a family's grief after a disaster like the crash of AirAsia Flight QZ8501. And for one family, they're grappling with the loss of seven loved ones on the aircraft. Two of their family members have been found so far. A total of 37 bodies have been recovered out of 162 passengers and crew members on board the AirAsia flight. We were invited to a Surabaya funeral home where the family held a visitation for The Meiji Thejakusuma and her daughter, Stevie Gunaman. Stevie had just turned 10, two weeks before the flight. The two were on their way to a New Year's trip in Singapore with five other members of their family, including Stevie's father, grandmother, brother, sister, and her sister's fiancee. The remaining five have not been found yet. ""I am devastated,"" said Suyono Tedjakusuma, a relative of the victims. ""And now, the waiting for the rest of the family is so difficult."" While the funerals for The Meiji and her daughter will take place on Friday, friends and families gathered this week to pay their respects to the mother and her young child. ""My sister was a businesswoman,"" said her sister, Ie-wah Thejakusama. ""She worked hard. She was kind to everybody."" Stevie was described as a bright girl by her relatives. She was always full of cheer, they said. In a Buddhist ceremony, friends and family members lit candles on an altar and bowed in front of the two caskets. They also folded paper into what resembled money as part of a Buddhist tradition of burning ""money"" to symbolically provide for their loved ones in the afterlife. Earlier last week, they continued to hold out hope that some or all of their family members might have survived the crash. But with the discovery of mother and daughter's bodies, the hope for a miracle has all but disappeared. While they mourn and plan a funeral, they still have to monitor the news and wait for any word about their five other loved ones. ""I cannot accept this. I cannot believe it. Where are my family's bodies? Where is my mother? My heart is breaking,"" said family member Suyono. They told me it's like a nightmare you can't wake up from. The Meiji was going to spend her 46th birthday in Singapore. Instead, her birthday was the day her body was found.​ .","Family mourns the loss of seven loved ones on AirAsia Flight QZ8501 .

"Washington (CNN) -- If you think cutting the government's budget is as easy as taking the ax to some unpopular federal programs, a new national poll suggests that you should think again. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Friday, most Americans think that the government spends a lot more money than it actually does on such unpopular programs as foreign aid and public broadcasting. The poll's release comes one week before current funding for the government runs out. If there is no budget agreement between congressional lawmakers by next Friday, some government programs and offices may shut down. ""The public has a better idea of how much the government spends on programs like Social Security and Medicare, but there is a related problem -- cutting them has little public support,"" says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""The result: cutting unpopular programs would probably not cut the deficit very much, and cutting the deficit would probably require cuts in programs that Americans like."" Let's start with international assistance. Sixty percent of people we questioned say they'd like to put foreign aid on the chopping block. So would that make a dent in the deficit? No -- but try telling that to the American public. According to the poll, on average, Americans estimate that foreign aid takes up 10 percent of the federal budget, and one in five think it represents about 30 percent of the money the government spends. But the actual figure is closer to 1 percent, according to data from the Office of Management and Budget from the 2010 fiscal year's $3.5 trillion budget. OK. Let's try more low-hanging fruit -- funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Our survey indicates nearly half of all Americans would like to see major cuts. According to our poll the public estimates that the government spent 5 percent of its budget last year on public television and radio. Not even close. The real answer is about one-tenth of 1 percent. Want more examples? Cutting pensions and benefits for government workers is popular, but once again most Americans overestimate how much that costs the government. On average, Americans think the federal government spent 10 percent of its 2010 budget on pensions and retiree benefits; the OMB figures indicate the real number is about 3.5 percent. A sizeable minority would like to see food and housing assistance for the poor on the chopping block, but Americans' estimates of how much the government spends on those programs are three to four times higher than the actual price tag. Cuts in military spending also have some support -- more than a third of all Americans favor cuts in that area. But the public, once again, overestimates the amount of military spending. They told us 30 percent in our poll. In reality only 19 percent of the 2010 budget went towards military spending, according to 2010 OMB figures. What Americans got right are the programs they don't want to cut. When we ask Americans to guess how much Social Security cost the government in 2010, the median estimate was 20 percent. Not bad, given that OMB figures indicate that Social Security represented 20.4 percent of the federal budget in 2010. ""Budget experts agree that cutting a target that big would be a good start toward getting the deficit under control. Problem is, 87 percent of people we surveyed don't want to decrease the amount of money spent on Social Security -- and four in 10 would like to see that figure grow. The same is generally true for Medicare and Medicaid, which combined made up 19 percent of last year's budget,"" adds Holland. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey was conducted March 11-13, with 1,023 people questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. -- CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .","Most Americans think the U.S. spends more than it does on foreign aid and public broadcasting .

"With the new trailer for ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,"" we get a glimpse of Robin Williams in one of his final roles. ""Secret of the Tomb"" is the third movie in the ""Night at the Museum"" franchise, and it's one of the four completed projects Williams left behind when he died in August. The third ""Night at the Museum"" sees Ben Stiller return as a night security guard at the American Museum of Natural History. This time around, the magic that helps bring all of the museum's historical figures and creatures to life for those raucous adventures is in danger of running out. Williams starred in the family movie franchise from the start, portraying former President Theodore Roosevelt. ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,"" which also stars Owen Wilson, Ben Kingsley and Dan Stevens, opens December 19. After that, there's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and the ""Divergent"" sequel ""Insurgent"" to look forward to in 2015 -- and both now have new trailers. On Wednesday, eager fans were treated to an extended look at ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" which opens May 1. If the trailer Marvel released in October didn't give you enough chills, James Spader's opening cackle as the psychotic villain Ultron will probably do the trick. On the ""Divergent"" front, Wednesday also brought our first look at the second installment of the film series, which is adapted from Veronica Roth's best-selling young adult books. With ""Insurgent,"" Shailene Woodley's Tris Prior is no longer learning the ropes of what it means to be in her daredevil faction. In the aftermath of the first film's heartbreak and loss, a fugitive Tris has cut her hair down to a pixie and is clearly still fighting to defeat Kate Winslet's cold and calculating Jeanine Matthews. If you haven't read the books, the first look at ""Insurgent"" isn't going to fill in any blanks. Not to worry; with that movie due out March 20, there are plenty of other trailers to come.","Robin Williams' ""Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb"" has a new trailer .
