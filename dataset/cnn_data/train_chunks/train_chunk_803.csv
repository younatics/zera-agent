"By . Louise Boyle . A socialite has been charged with defrauding millions of dollars from the trust fund of a 92-year-old close friend who suffers from dementia. Nancy Tsai, 66, a former darling of the Toronto charity circuit where she was known as a 'Glitter Girl', was arrested last week in Florida for allegedly scamming money from Helga Marston, who has been her friend for 40 years. Tsai, the ex-wife of the late billionaire investor Gerald Tsai, is accused of using her ailing friend's riches to buy a $2.3million beachfront penthouse condo, a $170,000 Bentley, a $28,000 private jet day-trip from Florida to Canada and a $7,000 dinner at Cafe L'Europe in Palm Beach. Nancy Tsai, 66, a charity socialite, has been charged with defrauding millions of dollars from her 92-year-old friend's trust fund in Palm Beach, Florida . Tsai, the founder of the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation, was Martson's trustee and had power of attorney. Tsai's daughter E. Sarah Paul was the beneficiary of Marstonâ€™s most recent will. Tsai was pictured in 2009 with Ms Martson at a lavish charity ball in Palm Beach, Florida, according to the New York Social Diary. Police told the New York Post that Tsai was having an affair with Dennis Melchior who was the broker of the trust until he lost his job at UBS last year. Melchior denied any wrongdoing and said that Ms Marston, who has 'zero mental capacity' and lives in a nursing home, benefited from the money being spent. Tsai was arrested on April 22 at her beachfront home. After nine hours in custody, she was released on $30,000 bond. Ms Tsai rose to prominence in the 1980s when she was part of a group of women in Toronto who threw over-the-top charity fundraisers using their husbands' extreme wealth.

Tsai was arrested last week after she allegedly scammed millions from Ms Marston . According to one Canadian social columnist, fashion designer Valentino even attended a lavish party at Nancy's home in 1986. Nancy Paul met her first husband, real estate mogul Vincent Paul, when she was an air hostess on Air Canada in 1966. Mr Paul died in 1996. She then went on to marry billionaire investor Gerald Tsai but the couple divorced in 2006. Mr Tsai died two years later. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Tsai's attorney. Ms Tsai allegedly spent $7,000 on a meal at Cafe L'Europe in Palm Beach, Florida using money from her elderly friend's trust fund .","Nancy Tsai, 66, a former darling of the Toronto charity circuit where she was known as a 'Glitter Girl', was arrested last week .

"By . Associated Press . A pair of recently discovered early stories by prize-winning science fiction author Octavia Butler will be coming out as an e-book in June. Open Road Integrated Media, a digital publisher, announced Tuesday that A Necessary Being and Childfinder will be compiled in a single volume titled Unexpected Stories that will be released June 24th. The book will include an introduction by Walter Mosley. Finally coming out: Two titles by Octavia Butler (pictured) were recently discovered, and will be released this June . 'Unexpected Stories reveals the . themes that would become Butler's lexicon: the complicating mysteries we . assign to power, race, and gender,' Mosley writes. 'Reading these tales . is like looking at a photograph of a child who you only knew as an . adult. In her eyes you can see the woman that you came to know much . later; a face, not yet fully formed, that contains the promise of . something that is now a part of you; the welcomed surprise of . recognition in innocent eyes,' he continued. Serious act: Butler was posthumously inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame . Butler's literary . agent, Merrilee Heifetz, found the stories, written in the early 1970s, . among the author's papers at the Huntington Library in San Marino, . California. According to Open Road, A Necessary Being tells of how the . leaders of two ancient tribes 'must broker a delicate peace to ensure . that their peoples are to survive.' In Childfinder, a young woman 'locates children with budding psionic powers and teaches them to . protect themselves from society.' Butler, who died in 2006 at age 58, was one . of the first black science fiction . writers to receive mainstream attention and was known for such books as . Bloodchild and Other Stories and the novel Parable of the Sower. Butler was the first science fiction writer to receive the MacArthur Fellowship, in 1995.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . After years of castigating Barack Obama for his economic stewardship and his health insurance overhaul, real estate billionaire Donald Trump has cut the president some slack. Seated behind a cluttered desk in his Trump Tower building in New York City, Trump said he could think of one Obama administration accomplishment that he found praiseworthy. 'You could say the only thing would be the execution of the man who knocked down the World Trade Center,' Trump told MailOnline Tuesday, referring to the Navy SEAL raid that took out terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. Then, with an abrupt head-turn, Trump took a deep breath. Donald Trump praised Obama for the bin Laden kill raid -- for a moment -- before shifting all the credit to the U.S. military . Obama bin Laden led al-Qaeda through the 9/11 attacks in 2001, but then went into hiding, spurring a years-long intelligence chase that culminated in Barack Obama's 'go' order nearly a decade later . Spectator: President Obama 'happened to be there, and he said, ""Yes, go get him"",' Trump insisted . 'But in all fairness, that was the military that was after him for years,' he said. 'The guys that got him did a great job. When the Navy SEALs went in, they did fantastic work. Obama happened to . be there, and he said, ""Yes, go get him.""' The American intelligence operations that ultimately located bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan began in earnest in 2002, during the first George W. Bush administration, when CIA interrogators at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility learned a code name used by the terrorist's most trusted courier. Through nine years of work, most of them during the Bush years, the CIA and military intelligence assets worked out the courier's real name and picked up his trail. The location of the al-Qaeda leader's Pakistan hideout was first confirmed just one year after Obama took office. From there an intelligence operation taking more than a year and costing tens of millions of dollars zeroed in on bin Laden, with a CIA official and the admiral in charge of the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) making a presentation to the president in January 2011. Obama, it turns out, learned of bin Laden's whereabouts after the tactical options were already worked out. Obama spent part of his 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner speech playfully mocking Trump over the business magnate's involvement in a media scrum over his birth certificate . Trump told MailOnline that he enjoyed the ribbing, which included this White House mockup as Obama imagined it in a Trump administration . Trump, who has rhetorically body-slammed the president at nearly every opportunity, had kind words to say about a comedy routine the president recited at his expense during the 2011 White House Correspondents Association dinner. 'I thought it was funny,' he told MailOnline. 'I really had a good time.' 'Obama was telling jokes about me. It was just fun. And I said to my wife, ""This is amazing. Here's the president of the United States, he's up in front of 6,000 people, and all he's talking about is me. I love it."" I had a great time.' On the night of that speech, history now shows, Obama was waiting for word from the CIA and JSOC about whether the bin Laden raid was underway. Trump, though, was dismissive about the president's part in it all. 'Obama made the decision, but who wouldn't have made that decision?' he asked. 'Would somebody actually have said, ""Don't go after him""?'","Trump sat down with MailOnline and cited the Osama bin Laden 'kill raid' as an example of something Barack Obama did well .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . If reports of giant rats across Europe weren't enough, new figures state they're not only getting larger, their numbers are increasing rapidly. Scientists believe a rise in global rodent numbers is on the way - and with it a rise in the diseases they carry. The increase in rat populations is being directly linked to a decline in large wildlife, meaning rats have better access to food and shelter. In the Middle Ages, fleas carried by rats were responsible for spreading the Black Plague. Today in East Africa, they remain important carriers of plague and many other diseases, including Bartonellosis, a potentially dangerous human pathogen which can cause spleen and liver damage and memory loss . A study by Hillary Young, assistant professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, looked at the relationship between the loss of large wildlife - known as defaunation - and the risk of human disease. In this case, they analysed Bartonellosis - a group of bacterial pathogens which can cause spleen and liver damage, and memory loss. ‘We were able to demonstrate that declines in large wildlife can cause an increase in the risk for diseases that are spread between animals and humans,’ said Professor Young. ‘This spike in disease risk results from explosions in the number of rodents that benefit from the removal of the larger animals.’ Declining numbers of zebra, antelope and other big grazers cause rodent populations to rapidly increase, a new study has shown. Hillary Young and colleagues from the Kenya Long-Term Exclosure Experiment show that the rise in rodent population brings with it fleas and various diseases that can be passed on to humans . Inside specially-designed plots that excluded large animals, rodents doubled in number. More rodents meant more fleas, and genetic screens of these fleas revealed that they carried significantly numbers of disease-causing pathogens. Pictured is a male rat flea (Xenopsylla sarodes) In the UK, a swarm of 'super rats' was recently spotted across the country. Figures have revealed that in some regions the number of vermin has already surged by 50 per cent since April last year. And experts believe the rat population could soar from 80 million to 160 million by the end of the year. It comes after many local authorities have shelved free pest control for homes as they battle funding cuts. And in some towns, councils have reduced bin collections to just once a month - leaving mountains of rotting rubbish to lure in the creatures. It is feared some of these larger rats are becoming increasingly resistant to poison and are far more difficult to kill. The researchers discovered this effect by using powerful electric fences to experimentally exclude large species like elephants, giraffe and zebra from study plots in Kenya. Inside these plots, rodents doubled in number. More rodents meant more fleas, and genetic screens of these fleas revealed that they carried significantly numbers of disease-causing pathogens. According to Professor Young, these rodent outbreaks and associated increases in disease risk may be exacerbating health problems in parts of Africa where diminishing wildlife populations are rife. ‘This same effect, however, can occur almost anywhere, where there are large wildlife declines,’ Professor Young said. ‘This phenomena that we call rodentation - the proliferation of rodents triggered by large wildlife loss - has been observed in sites around the world.’ Big animals have been becoming scarcer for at least 10,000 years. But as well as access to better food and shelter due to their decline, there are other, more subtle, reasons for the increase in rat numbers. ‘The heavy feet of big grazers trample everything underfoot,’ said Oxford University's Meredith Root-Bernstein, writing in the Conversation. A giant, 2ft long rat caught in Liverpool. A swarm of 'super rats' spotted across the country is expected to outnumber humans two to one by next year.  It is feared that some of these larger rats are becoming increasingly resistant to poison and are far more difficult to kill . ‘Their grazing also keeps the grass short. When these animals are around, rodents and other small mammals try not to get stepped on and hide from predators in the patches of long grass. ‘Without the big grazers, the trampling is gone and the grass grows tall, and rodents thrive.’ In the UK, a swarm of 'super rats' was recently spotted across the country.

"By . Snejana Farberov . A sorority at University of Central Florida has been suspended indefinitely in the aftermath of a hazing scandal involving forced binge drinking. Three members of the Chi Omega Greek organization on campus resigned after two freshman pledges came forward with allegations of hazing. A 19-year-old UCF student identified in a police report as Cheyanne Fannan has revealed to the authorities in a videotaped interview that sisters at Chi Omega forced her to drink rum until she blacked out. Scroll down for video . New sisters: University of Central Florida freshmen Cheyanne Fannan (left) and Carlee Stetson (right), both 19, claim they were hazed while pledging to Chi Omega . On thin ice: The sorority has been suspended indefinitely for breaking the code of conduct in the aftermath of the hazing scandal . The alleged incident took place on the night of April 4 at an arboretum off campus, and it involved Fannan and another 19-year-old freshman identified as Carlee Stetson. ‘I had too much alcohol in my system that I just kind of went numb,’ Fannan told police after the ordeal. ‘I've never blacked out before,’ the station ClickOrlando reported. The teenager, from Tampa Bay, recounted how at around 10pm on April 4, three sorority sisters picked her up along with Stetson, blindfolded them and led the two girl sto a wooded area near the Orlando college campus. The two 19-year-olds were then allegedly ordered to tilt their heads back and open their mouths to allow the sisters to pour Dragon Berry Bacardi rum down their throats. Caught on camera: Fannan revealed to police during a videotaped interview that she was ordered to open her mouth and tilt her head back while blindfolded so the sisters could pour rum down her throat . Not out of the woods: Police have concluded their probe into the incident, but the UCF is still investigating Chi Omega . The new Chi Omega members were later instructed to finish the entire bottle while blind-folded. Once Fannan and Stetson consumed all the alcohol, they were allegedly taken to a campus parking lot and abandoned there without any means to get home. Ms Fannan recalled said that she was so inebriated she could not stand on her own and had to be carried by Stetson and her boyfriend, who came to their aid. Fannan also suffered scrapes to her hand after she fell over while wandering around the parking lot in a drunken stupor. Held accountable: Chi Omega sister Lauren Hartwell, 19 (pictured left and right) is one of three members of the sorority who resigned earlier this month over the hazing incident . Sticking together: Stetson (bottom row, third from left) and Fannan (fifth from left) both declined to press criminal charges against the three Chi Omega sisters . The teenagers were allegedly instructed by the sorority sisters to lie to police about the incident, but they came forward with the information about the suspected hazing. However, both pledges declined to prosecute the Chi Omega sisters, which means that they will not face criminal charges. The sorority girls, identified in the police report obtained by Orlando Sentinel as Maribeth Snyder, 20; Lauren Hartwell, 19; and Marae Watkins-Creel, 22, have since resigned from Chi Omega. The university has reserved the right to discipline the former sisters and punish the sorority for breaking UCF’s hazing, alcohol and disruptive conduct rules. video platformvideo managementvideo solutionsvideo player .","University of Central Florida freshmen Cheyanne Fannan and Carlee Stetson told police they were forced to down Dragon Berry Bacardi rum .

"It sounds like the punchline to a horrible joke, but dozens of people who attended a summit on food safety certainly weren't laughing when they fell ill after consuming a meal served at the event. In a suspected case of food poisoning, more than 100 people reported getting sick at the Food Safety Summit held at the Baltimore Convention Center from April 8-10. Officials won't yet confirm that food poisoning was the culprit, but they're dealing with an outbreak of gastroenteritis that has caused many attendees  to report symptoms like diarrhea and nausea. More than 100 people have now reported they got sick with suspected food poisoning at a national Food Safety Summit held earlier this month in Baltimore . One in four people interviewed after the summit reported getting sick from a meal served during the event . About 1,300 people attended the conference - and of the 400 who have spoken to health officials so far more than 100 were sick - prompting concerns that many more people may be affected, NBC News reports. 'We are working on evaluating possible exposures and doing testing at the Maryland state public health laboratory to attempt to identify an agent,' read a letter from the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene sent to summit guests. Ironically, among those affected were members of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 'A couple of our folks indicated that they had experienced symptoms associated with food poisoning after the summit,' said FDA spokeswoman Juli Putnam. Peggy Daidakis, who runs the Convention Center, told NBC she was determined to get to the bottom of it. 'We're not trying to hide anything,' she said. 'If there is something, we'll take the corrective measures. 'None of us are very happy when we hear these things.'","One in four people interviewed after Food Safety Summit reported falling ill .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . An overachiever who drove a sports car and was on track 'to become CEO of a company one day' was discovered dead an outhouse on April 19 where he was apparently seeking refuge from the cold.

"By . Associated Press . A New York carriage driver has been accused of altering a hoof brand to make a 22-year-old draft horse with a breathing ailment appear to be a healthier horse nearly half its age. Frank Luo branded the wrong hoof identification number on an aging horse named Ceasar, who was supposed to be resting on a Pennsylvania farm, so he could work under a license issued to a 12-year-old horse named Carsen, city health officials said in an administrative order last month. The details of the case, obtained by The Associated Press through a Freedom of Information request, come as Mayor Bill de Blasio and animal-rights activists are pushing to ban the city's carriage industry as inhumane to the horses. Drivers have responded by saying they care for the horses like their own children. New York carriage driver, Frank Luo, has been accused of altering a hoof brand to make a 22-year-old draft horse with a breathing ailment appear to be a healthier horse nearly half its age . In the written order, officials said a city vet noticed that the horse had Carsen's ID number on its hoof, but its 'physical characteristics and medical condition was that of the older horse.' Ceasar had a mild, chronic condition called 'heaves,' which is similar to asthma, city officials said. Luo told The Associated Press on Friday that the vet simply got it wrong. 'I did not switch the horses. It's just very confusing because they look alike,' he said. Initially, Luo submitted paperwork intended to prove that the horse really was Carsen, including a handwritten note from a Pennsylvania farmer who said Ceasar had been on his farm for months. The city asked for more proof, including a veterinarian's evaluation. Five days later, Luo's lawyer informed the department that he couldn't afford to have the horse sitting idle and had shipped him to Pennsylvania and sold him. 'It's all settled now,' Luo said. He said he would continue to operate his business using other horses. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has announced a plan to eliminate the horse drawn carriages due to animal cruelty . The sale effectively ended the investigation by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which monitors the horses' health. But the Department of Consumer Affairs, which regulates the drivers, is still investigating. Luo's regulatory problems date to September, when he was cited for working at least two horses without active licenses. He also was accused of working Ceasar for nine days in July when the horse was supposedly in Pennsylvania. City regulations give the horses five weeks of pasture time each year. Also in September, the Department of Consumer Affairs cited Luo for false advertising, overcharging customers and operating a carriage for more hours than allowed. Luo's company, the Manhattan Carriage Co., agreed in January to pay a fine and restitution. In an unrelated incident, a horse Luo was driving in September bolted on 8th Avenue and hit a car. It suffered minor injuries. A 2007 audit by the city comptroller noted that health certificates kept for carriage horses sometimes contained physical descriptions that changed from year to year, suggesting they weren't the same animals. In 2008, a stable owner pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct to resolve allegations that he tried to bribe a city investigator. Carriage owners have denied any subterfuge and maintained that their animals are among the healthiest and most tightly regulated anywhere. 'I did not switch the horses. It's just very confusing because they look alike,' Frank Luo said after being accused of forcing a sick 22-year-old horse to work .

Thomas 'Tommy D' DiFiore had applied to be released on $4m bail at a hearing in Brooklyn Federal Court last month, claiming his Type 2 diabetes was out of control. But prosecution witness Dr Robin Edwin said the 70-year-old's commissary purchases revealed he had been buying food which would not have helped the condition.

Dr Edwin reportedly told the court: 'These all would cause his sugars to go up quite high and it would be very hard to control diabetes while they're consuming these foods.' Federal Judge Allyne Ross denied DiFiore's bid for release, ruling he was a danger to the public. He was arrested on extortion charges in January. DiFiore's lawyer Steve Zissou said the commissary purchases were for other inmates and were not consumed by his client.

"By . Louise Boyle . Diane Keaton today reiterated her support of her friend and longtime collaborator Woody Allen following allegations of abuse made earlier this year by his daughter Dylan Farrow. The 68-year-old actor appeared on the Today show on Tuesday to promote her latest memoir, Let's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty. After charming presenter Matt Lauer by saying that she had looked up pictures of him on the Internet and that he had a 'nice chest', the conversation then turned to Allen. Scroll down for video . Diane Keaton appeared on the Today show on Tuesday where she stood up for Woody Allen, calling him a 'genius' Lauer asked if Keaton had any trepidation when accepting a lifetime achievement at the Golden Globes this year on the director's behalf. Keaton replied that she would be 'nowhere' without Woody Allen, saying that he gave her 'the greatest gift anyone has ever given me' when he cast her in Annie Hall. She added: 'He's a genius.' The 68-year-old, who won an Oscar for her role in Annie Hall, also said during the interview that she had coped with 'lifelong insecurity'. She said that she regretted never getting married but no one had ever asked her. When she was younger 'becoming a movie star was my dream come true', Keaton said. She also talked about her past boyfriends including Warren Beatty but said: 'Warren married Annette Bening. That was a good choice.' She also admitted that she was 'so in love' with Al Pacino while they were filming the Godfather in the early 1970s. In an interview with People earlier this month, Keaton also defended Allen, who she was romantically involved with during the early days of her career. She told the magazine: 'I love Woody. I don't want to say anything about [Dylan's accusations which he denies] except I'm Woody's friend and I believe him. That's the bottom line for me. 'I worry for him and everybody else involved, and I hope it works out the best for everyone.' Revelation: Diane Keaton and ex-love Woody Allen in Annie Hall back in 1977. She has repeatedly defended the director following allegations of abuse from his adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow . Earlier this year, Dylan Farrow renewed allegations that her adoptive father Allen had molested her as a child, calling out some of Woody's famous collaborators - including Keaton - in a letter to the New York Times. In the letter she accused her adoptive father of sexually assaulting her when she was seven-years-old and chastised Hollywood for nominating the director for a slew of awards. 'For so long, Woody Allenâ€™s acceptance silenced me,' she wrote. 'It felt like a personal rebuke, like the awards and accolades were a way to tell me to shut up and go away. 'What if it had been your child, Cate Blanchett? Louis CK? Alec Baldwin? What if it had been you, Emma Stone? Or you, Scarlett Johansson? You knew me when I was a little girl, Diane Keaton. Have you forgotten me?,' she asked. Woody, 78, has denied all the allegations, saying in his open letter in . the New York Times on February 7 that he blamed his ex-partner Mia . Farrow for exploiting their adopted child, would be his 'final word' on . the matter. After . reading the filmmaker's response, the 28-year-old released the . following statement: 'Once again, Woody Allen is attacking me and my . family in an effort to discredit and silence me - but nothing he says or . writes can change the truth.'

"By . Louise Boyle . David Wise, 52, is on trial at Marion Superior Court in Indianapolis for the alleged rape of his ex-wife . A mother-of-two has accused her ex-husband of drugging and raping her while she was passed out, then taking sordid videos of the attacks with his cellphone. The 36-year-old woman, who has not been identified, testified on Monday against her former husband David Wise, 52, at Marion Superior Court in Indianapolis. She has accused Wise of drugging her several times during their 12-year marriage and once, she woke up with a pill dissolving in her mouth. She told the jury that at times she woke up feeling like her body had been 'messed with', according to the Indianapolis Star. The woman, who barely looked at Wise, said that there were times that she woke up not wearing any underwear but had no memory of taking it off. She said that later she found three sex videos of herself on her husband's cellphone in 2008. She said that she recognized her husband's hand with his wedding ring in the videos. The couple divorced in 2009. Wise is facing rape and criminal deviate charges. The videos of his alleged assaults will be shown to jurors as part of the trial. The alleged rapes took place two-and-a-half years before the woman reported them to police. She said that she didn't report the attacks sooner because she didn't want her son and daughter to grow up without a father. Defense attorney Elizabeth Milliken said that Wise's wife was 16 years younger than him and liked to drink and smoke marijuana, going out regularly with her friends. Ms Milliken said that the jury should be skeptical of the authenticity of the videos. The prosecution also plans to provide evidence of letters and emails that Wise wrote to his ex-wife, admitting to taking advantage of her. The trial is expected to end this week.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A startling video has revealed truckers texting and calling on their phones while driving on New York City's busy highways - risking the lives of their fellow motorists. The footage was revealed by WABC as the families of victims who lost their lives to distracted truck drivers called for stricter penalties for using devices behind the wheel. The video shows one driver on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway texting on his phone, while another driver on the Long Island Expressway looks down to dial on his phone before chatting away. Scroll down for video . Danger: In a video taken by WABC, a driver in the New York City area apparently texts on his phone . Unaware: Another driver chats with his passenger as he apparently checks his phone behind the wheel . And in one particularly shocking clip, one bearded driver can be seen using one hand to speak on his phone, before switching hands to continue a conversation on a second phone. If stopped for talking on their cell phones, the drivers would face penalties such as a $150 fine - or up to $400 if it was a repeat offense - and five points on their licenses. But officials and families of victims say that is clearly not deterring the drivers. The adult children of New York couple George and Kathy Weed, who were killed when a driver slammed his tractor-trailer in the back of their car as he allegedly texted on his cell phone, said the drivers need to think about the potential results of their actions. Brazen: These images from the video show one driver keeping up two different phone conversations by switching hands to speak in separate phones. If stopped in New York, drivers face a $150 fine . Oblivious: This driver could get five points on his driving license if stopped by police, the news channel noted . Their father was slowing to stop when the truck hit their car from behind and forced them into another truck, killing them. 'We're an extremely close-knit family,' daughter Tricia Weed told WABC. 'And this utterly destroyed us. I mean devastating beyond words.' NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said he was shocked to see the drivers on their phones and that the penalties needed to be addressed. '[The video] indicates a lot of people driving commercial vehicles are still using personal electronic devices and that would indicate the enforcement side of it is not strong enough,' he said.

"By . Tara Brady . Air France plans to cancel a number of flights as a result of possible national strike action throughout May. The month-long strike is because France's biggest pilots' union is unhappy about the rules surrounding their right to strike. Air France has said it believes the delays and cancellations could threaten its recovery. Air France plans to cancel a number of flights as the result of possible national strike action throughout May . The strike is being organised by the union SNLP France Alpa and will last between May 3 and May 30. A spokesman for the airline said in a statement: 'This strike action is unusual both for its significance, lasting nearly a month, as well as for its methods which will penalize Air France flights at two peak times of day.' France's largest pilots union is calling for strikes for two hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon and most of the affected flights will be cancelled, Air France said in a statement. Unions want a law repealed that forces pilots to inform their companies that they intend to go on strike for 48 hours before the walk-out. This is because airlines need to get information to affected passengers in advance. Connections at the Charles de Gaulle Paris airport, north of Paris, would also be affected . However, unions believe this law undermines the impact of their industrial action because it allows airlines to draft in pilots from other countries. A recent EasyJet strike did not result in any flight delays or cancellations despite the fact that 85 percent of pilots walked-out, according to the union. Air France CEO Frédéric Gagey has sent an open letter to the president of the union calling for him stop the strike. 'To avoid this situation and out of respect for its customers, Air France will be forced to cancel the majority of flights operated by striking pilots. 'Only a very limited number of flights will be rescheduled,' it said.","Pilots' union unhappy about the rules surrounding right to strike .

"By . Meghan Keneally . A legendary 83-year-old jewelry thief has been sent back to prison after her latest heist. Doris Payne has gained a reputation for her knack of walking out of jewelry stores across the globe with million-dollar baubles and her latest theft shows that the octogenarian is still able to pull off a steal. Unfortunately for Payne, authorities are so familiar with her history at this point that they were quick to catch her. Paying for her crimes: Doris Payne has been caught a number of times (pictured here in 2005) for her jewelry thefts but it hasn't stopped her from continuing to walk out of stores with millions in diamonds . Last fall, she had just been released from prison three months earlier when she stole a $22,500 diamond and white gold ring from a Riverside, California jewelry store. She got away with the theft by doing her typical move- trying on jewelry and chatting with the shop owner until they forget she is wearing it as she walks out. Icon of sorts: Payne, now 83, has been the subject of a documentary and a movie about her life- rumored to be starring Halle Berry- is reportedly in the works . In this case, the Los Angeles Times reports that the manager of El Paseo Jewelers only realized that the ring was missing hours after she had gone. She sold the ring to a nearby pawnshop for $800, and as part of the sale, she had to give her thumbprint, which eventually tipped off authorities. Payne was sentenced today to spend two years in jail and two years under mandatory supervision. 'The judge tempered punishment with compassion about her age,' Payne's attorney Gretchen von Helms told the newspaper. 'He took into account the taxpayers' pocketbook. And do we really need to incarcerate a nonviolent offender- yes, a repeat offender, that's true- who's ill, who has emphysema, who's elderly?' Payne has been working her cons for more than five decades and has been the subject of a documentary, titled 'The Life And Crimes Of Doris Payne'. There is speculation that a biopic is in the works with Academy Award winner Halle Berry set to star as Payne. In the documentary, Payne revealed how she first learned the distraction trick as a teenager when a store clerk eagerly ditched her when a white customer came into the store. From there, she worked her way up from bargain jewelry to some expensive stores across the globe, with a heist in Monaco listed as one of her most storied accomplishments. Over time, she has been connected to 20 aliases, nine dates of birth, and five Social Security numbers. 'There’s never been a day that I went to steal that I did not get what I went to do,' she said in the documentary. All a ruse: Over time, she has been connected to 20 aliases, nine dates of birth, and five Social Security numbers (Payne pictured in a Las Vegas courtroom in 2005) 'I don’t have any regrets about stealing jewelry. I regret getting caught.' That sentiment proves problematic for judges who she is put in front of. In 2010, she asked the judge to be lenient because she was 'truly sorry that this went on as long as it did,' but that wasn't enough. 'You won't stop,' Judge Frank Brown said at the time, explaining his decision to sentence her to five years which was at the high end of the possible verdicts. 'That’s the problem here... She’s a thief. She’s charming. Santa Claus’s wife, that’s who she is.'","Doris Payne, 83, has been stealing diamonds and jewels for five decades .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Science and law have led to the exoneration of hundreds of criminal defendants in recent decades, but big questions remain: How many other innocent defendants are locked up? How many are wrongly executed? About one in 25 people imprisoned under a death sentence is likely innocent, according to a new statistical study appearing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. And that means it is all but certain that at least several of the 1,320 defendants executed since 1977 were innocent, the study says. From 1973 to 2004, 1.6 percent of those sentenced to death in the U.S. — 138 prisoners — were exonerated and released because of innocence. Troubling: A new report says that data shows that up to 1 out of every 25 inmates sentenced to death could be innocent . Carlos De Luna was executed in Texas in 1989 after he was convicted of murdering a gas station attendant. Evidence later showed that De Luna was likely innocent . But the great majority of innocent people who are sentenced to death are never identified and freed, says professor Samuel Gross of the University of Michigan Law School, the study's lead author. The difficulty in identifying innocent inmates stems from the fact that more than 60 percent of prisoners in death penalty cases ultimately are removed from death row and resentenced to life imprisonment. Once that happens, their cases no longer receive the exhaustive reviews that the legal system provides for those on death row. Gross and three other researchers, including a biostatistics expert, looked at the issue using a technique often used in medical studies called survival analysis. Yale University biostatistics expert Theodore Holford, who wasn't part of the study, said the work done by Gross ""seems to be a reasonable way to look at these data."" Because of various assumptions, it might be best to use the margin of error in the study and say the innocence rate is probably between 2.8 percent and 5.2 percent, said University of South Carolina statistics professor John Grego, who wasn't part of the study. The study is the first to use solid and appropriate statistical methods to address questions of exoneration or false convictions, an important subject, said Columbia Law School professor Jeffrey Fagan, who also is a professor of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health. The research combines data from three independent sources, a rigorous approach used by few studies on capital punishment, he said. Jesse Tafero was executed in Florida in 1990 after getting convicted of murdering two police officers. After his death, another man admitted to killing the officers . The research produced an estimate of the percentage of defendants who would be exonerated if they all remained indefinitely on death row, where their cases would be subject to intense scrutiny for innocence. The study concluded that the number of innocent defendants who have been put to death is 'comparatively low. ... Our data and the experience of practitioners in the field both indicate that the criminal justice system goes to far greater lengths to avoid executing innocent defendants than to prevent them from remaining in prison indefinitely.' Death sentences represent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of prison sentences in the U.S., but they account for 12 percent of known exonerations of innocent defendants from 1989 to 2012. One big reason is that far more attention and resources are devoted to reviewing and reconsidering death sentences. 'The high rate of exoneration among death-sentenced defendants appears to be driven by the threat of execution,' says the study. 'But most death-sentenced defendants are removed from death row and resentenced to life imprisonment, after which the likelihood of exoneration drops sharply.' The study estimates that if all defendants sentenced to death remained in that status, 'at least 4.1 percent would be exonerated. We conclude that this is a conservative estimate of the proportion of false conviction among death sentences in the United States.' Johnny Garrett was executed in Texas in 1992 after he was convicted for murdering a nun. After his execution, serious doubts about his guilt were raised . The study notes that there has been no shortage of lawyers and judges who assert confidently that the number of false convictions is negligible, citing Judge Learned Hand and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. 'Our (criminal) procedure has always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted. It is an unreal dream,' Hand said in 1923. In 2007, Scalia wrote that American criminal convictions have an 'error rate of 0.027 percent — or, to put it another way, a success rate of 99.973 percent.' The study said Scalia's numbers 'would be comforting, if true,' but added: 'The rate of error among death sentences is far greater than Justice Scalia's reassuring 0.027 percent,"" based on the number of death row exonerations that have already occurred. The study said that ""most innocent defendants who have been sentenced to death have not been exonerated, and many — including the great majority of those who have been resentenced to life in prison — probably never will be.' *Jesse Tafero was convicted of murdering two police officers in Florida in 1976 during a routine traffic stop. The driver of the car in which Tafero was riding admitted to killing the officers after Tafero was put to death in 1990 . *Johnny Garrett was convicted of raping and murdering a nun in Texas in 1981. After his 1992 execution, DNA evidence showed that another man who had been arrested for committing similar crimes in the same area likely was the person who killed the nun Garrett was put to death for murdering. Garrett also was 17 at the time of the crime and was severely mentally handicapped, which led to heavy criticism of the state of Texas for allowing a person who is both a juvenile and mentally handicapped to be executed. *Carlos De Luna was executed in 1989 after being convicted of the 1983 murder of a 24-year-old gas station attendant in Texas. An investigation published by the Columbia Human Rights Law Review cast serious doubt on De Luna's guilt and offered new evidence that suggested a man who looked similar to De Luna, Carlos Hernandez, may have committed the murder.","The study suggests that several of the 1,320 people executed in the U.S. since the death penalty was reinstated in 1977 have been innocent .
Between 1973 and 2004, 138 condemned prisoners were exonerated and released before they were executed .
The study's author says that the great majority of innocent people who are sentenced to death are never identified and freed, and subsequently put to death for crimes they didn't commit ."
"By . Ryan Lipman . China claims to have conclusive proof that Japan forced Asian women to work as sex slaves during World War II. Officials said that the evidence was found in a trove of 89 documents from the archive of the Japanese military police corps. The atrocities are said to have taken place between 1932 and 1945. Some historians believe that up to 200,000 women - mostly from the Korean peninsula - were made to work in frontline brothels as 'comfort women'. Recognition: Supporters of comfort women have continued to demand an formal apology from the Japanese government for their treatment in World War II . Appalled: Archive director Yin Huai said the documents' contents left staff chronically depressed . Shocking: China has released documents, which it claims prove the Japanese Army forced women into World War II brothels in Japan-controlled China . Since the . war, Japanese politicians and authorities have repeatedly refused to be . held accountable for the abuse of the women who were forced into . prostitution. As . recently as 2007, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe caused . international outrage when he denied that they were made into the former . Japanese Imperial Army's sex slaves, the Telegraph reported. Comfort . women were forced to work in occupied China, where brothels were set up . in between 20 to 30 counties in the country's north-east region. Jilin . provincial archives research fellow Zhao Yujie told Reuters that . documents show the Japanese military used the national general . mobilisation act to forcibly conscript Korean comfort women. He added that these Korean women sex slaves were dispensed to high-ranking officials. Japan refuses to directly compensate surviving comfort women, stating all claims were settled by a bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic ties in 1965 . Protestors wear the masks of Japanese political figures including prime minister Shinzo Abe (second right) during the rally . Another . released document shows the recorded amount of women sent to have sex . with Japanese soldiers in parts of occupied China in the 10 day period . from February 1, 1938. In Nanking region there were reportedly 141 women and 2,500 Japanese soldiers. Detailing . the full extent of the atrocities, China research centre on comfort . women director Su Zhiliang said these figures equated to one woman being . tortured 178 times in 10 days. 'The . archives of Kwantung army unveiled this time and other times showed . clearly that Japanese military and government implemented sex slavery in . the army. The mechanism was influential and forcible. It was against . the personal wills of these women. Second, it was widely adopted,' Su . said. Some historians believe 200,000 women were sexually abused between 1932 and 1945 on the frontline . Japan . refuses to directly compensate surviving comfort women, stating all . claims were settled by a bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic . ties in 1965. In . 1995, a privately run Asian women's fund was set up, but because it . relied on donations, many women refused to accept any compensation not . paid by the Japanese governmernt and this resulted in the fund ceasing . in 2007. The . military police corps was part of Japan's Kwantung army, which was the . occupying force sustaining the Manchuria regime in Manchuria in the . early 1930s. Newspaper . articles, letters from Japanese soldiers, military files discovered in . the 1950s and kept at the Jilin provincial archives in north-east China . as well as the regime's national bank documents are included in the . archives. The archive's director Yin Huai said the contents of the documents were shocking. 'Going . through the bloodiest parts of these archives, many of us experts have . succumbed to chronic depression,' he said, according to the official . China News Service. Zhao Sujian, 81, has been an archive employee since 1948 and said a People's Liberation Army unit discovered the documents in November 1953, while soldiers were digging close to remains of the Japanese bases where they were fixing electric cables and laying pipes. Among the 89 documents, details of the Nanking massacre were also revealed . Emotive disputes linked to Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule over the Korean peninsula have left relations between Tokyo and Seoul at their lowest ebb for years. The issue of comfort women, in particular, has contributed to a virtual freeze in diplomatic ties between the neighbours. Historians say up to 200,000 women, mostly from Korea but also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Taiwan, were forced to work in Japanese army brothels. Japan has long maintained that all issues relating to the colonial period were settled under a 1965 bilateral treaty that normalised diplomatic ties with South Korea. According to the government official cited by Kyodo, the offer of another apology and further compensation would be formalised only after confirming the issue 'has been completely settled' to ensure that South Korea never brings it up again. Japan previously offered money to former sex slaves through the Asian Women's Fund, a private body set up at Tokyo's initiative in 1995 and run until 2007. But some survivors refused the cash because it did not come directly from the government.Japanese politicians have expressed exasperation at Seoul's repeated requests for contrition. Repeated wavering since the apology among senior right-wing politicians has contributed to a feeling in South Korea that Japan is in denial and not sufficiently remorseful. There are 55 surviving former comfort women in South Korea. He said . the documents completely filled a truck, but because they had been . buried for so long, many unusable because they rotted into a single mass . or were stuck together. The . archive in Changchun, the provincial capital, analysed the documents in . 1982 after receiving them from a local law enforcement office. Yet . today, most of the documents remain untranslated, due to the poor . quality of the material and also a lack of Japanese-speaking . researchers. While . it was not clear why Jilin Provincial Archives released the 89 . documents on Friday, Chinese state media believes it could be a reaction . to on-going claims by conservative politicians that the comfort women . were not forced by the military or government officials. Experts . have said the archives provide important historical value because they . contest the denial of war crimes by the Japanese right-wing. The . 25 previously confidential files relating to sex slaves include . telephone records, documents mentioning sexual enslavement of women and . other reports, according to Chinese media. A . telephone record taken from the national bank of Manchuria in 1944 . shows the Japanese imperial army spent 532,000 yen on establishing what . they called comfort stations, according to the Global Times. Other records reveal how the Japanese army abducted women from the Korean peninsula. Also . revealed are details of the Nanking massacre, in which Japanese . soldiers killed up to 300,000 people during their 1937 to 1938 . occupation of Nanking, now known as Nanjing, according to Chinese and . western historians. Japanese authorities also dispute this figure, while far-right commentators have gone as far to claim China fabricated the massacre. Japan caused outrage in South Korea and China this year when it announced plans to re-examine a 1993 statement, where the government acknowledged for the first time the military's role in forcing women into sexual slavery. At the time, the government's chief spokesman Yohei Kono, apologised for the women's suffering, but demands that the Diet (houses of representatives and councillors) vote to approve the statement, were not met. Public figures close to Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe have also increased tensions between the country and South Korea by claiming Japan was unfairly singled out for criticism of its wartime conduct. Abe has since confirmed he will not change the statement, which has been maintained by the following Japanese administrations since its issue more than 20 years ago by then chief cabinet secretary Yohei Kono. An elderly woman joins a group who say they were used as sexual slaves by Japanese soldiers during World War II and commonly referred to as comfort women, during a in 2013 . The impact of the war on Japan's relationship with China and South Korea was further tested on Monday, when a member of Abe's cabinet visited the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo. The shrine honours the 2.5 million Japanese killed in the war, including 14 leaders who were convicted of class A war crimes by the allies. Viewed by Beijing and Seoul as a symbol of Japanese militarism, the visit by Tomomi Inada, a state minister in charge of administrative reform, proceeded a visit just days earlier by almost 150 Japanese MPs. Abe used Obama's visit to the Japanese capital last week to say the country regretted the pain it caused in the past, particularly in Asia. The release of the documents comes after US president Barack Obama recently said the use of comfort women is a violation of human rights. 'Violation of human rights': US president Barack Obama has demanded Japan detail the full extent of sexual abuse of women at the hands of its military . While visiting Seoul at the weekend, Obama demanded Japan fully detail the sexual abuse of women at the hands of its military. He said: 'This was a terrible, egregious violation of human rights.' 'Those women were violated in ways that, even in the midst of war were shocking,' he said. 'They deserve to be heard. They deserve to be respected. And there should be an accurate and clear account of what happened.' On Sunday, he went a step further when he told reporters the plight of the comfort women was 'heart-wrenching'. Moving forward? Japanense prime minster Shinzo Abe said the plight of the women was heart-wrenching .","On Friday, 89 archive documents were released by China revealing the Japanese Army forced women into World War II brothels .

There . was a time that Ferguson, whose show won a Peabody Award in 2009, was . considered a strong contender for that job. But 'The Late Late Show' has faded in the ratings, particularly with the arrival of Seth Meyers in February as competition in the same time slot. 'CBS and I are not getting divorced, we are consciously uncoupling,' Ferguson said. 'But we will still spend holidays together and share custody of the fake horse and robot skeleton, both of whom we love very much.' He told the audience it was his decision to leave, adding, 'CBS has been fine with me.' CBS Entertainment Chairwoman Nina Tassler said Ferguson 'infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television.'

The Scottish-born Ferguson, 51, became a U.S. citizen during his tenure on the show. He already has a new job lined up, as host of 'Celebrity Name Game,' a syndicated game show set to debut later this year. But he joked about his plans with the audience. After his stint ends, 'I'll go and do something else. Probably, I'm thinking, carpentry. But I haven't made my mind up yet. ... I feel like doing this show for 10 years, that's enough,' he said. Guest LL Cool J told Ferguson that 'I hate to see you go.' It's been an unusually busy period of personnel changes in the late-night television arena. Jimmy Fallon took over the 'Tonight' show on NBC from Jay Leno in February and was an instant sensation, ascending to the top of the ratings against Letterman and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel. Letterman announced that he would be leaving CBS after more than three decades in late-night TV. Chelsea Handler also has said she will be leaving her late-night show on E! CBS said it plans to continue 'The Late Late Show' and will be searching for another host. There's another opening at Comedy Central, which is looking to replace 'The Colbert Report' when it ends at the end of the year.","The 51-year-old Scottish comedian announced his retirement during Monday's taping .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Accused fraudster: Craig Siegel is charged with defrauding 19 people in a rental scheme and dumping urine over the head of a building inspector . A Florida man under investigation for fraud was arrested Monday after throwing a bucket of urine at a building code inspector on his property. The inspector was on Craig Siegel’s Siesta Key property because he built an addition last year without building permits and also was running a scheme defrauding potential renters, authorities said. Police charged the 44-year-old chiropractor with 19 counts of fraud for his rental scheme. He was also charged with criminal mischief and battery on a code inspector for dousing the worker in urine. The inspector was on site at 7.20 a.m. to ‘dismantle the modifications,’ according to the Herald-Tribune. Seigel had other ideas, and dumped the bucket of urine on him to stop the work, police said. Authorities accuse Seigel of duping people into paying for what they thought was rent on a 12 bedroom mansion when in reality it was a five bedroom McMansion. Payments totalling about $53,000 were made to a rental company owned by the accused urine thrower. Victims either accepted their downsized fate or found other accommodations, sources told WWSB. Others demanded their money back. Where it happened: The Siesta Key home where Seigel reportedly doused an inspector in urine . Seigel insisted they sue him because the money was gone. (I said) You give me my money back,’ victim Denise Blair recalled to WTVT. ‘He said no, we are not in the financial position to do that.’ But he did have the money to make more than $170,000 in contributions to a retirement account last year, officials said. He is being held in jail on a $55,000 bond.","Craig Siegel dumped the urine on a city worker sent to take down an unsanctioned addition to his home .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Accused: Leslie Boyd Altstatt has not worked as a doctor since the mid-1980s but he faces charges of sexual assault that range from 1964 to 1982 . A retired pediatrician has been arrested after three female relatives accused him of sexually assaulting them decades ago when they were children. Leslie Boyd Altstatt has not worked as a doctor since the mid-1980s but he faces charges of sexual assault that range from 1964 to 1982. During that time, he worked as a pediatrician and researcher at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in D.C. and police fear that because of this role, he had access to many other children who could have been victims but have not come forward. The 83-year-old doctor has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer argued that Altstatt never worked as a doctor at the military medical facility but only as a researcher. He is charged with child abuse, five counts of committing a third-degree sex offense and six counts of committing an unnatural and perverted sex practice. The three women, who have not been named due to the nature of the crimes, are said to be related to the accused and their families were said to be close with Altstatt but something happened recently and the women called the Montgomery County police department two months ago to lodge a complaint. The Washington Post reports that the first victim talked to him about the abuse and he denied the accusations and then admitted to the same accusations later. The second alleged victim confronted Altstatt several times over the years and 'he apologized for his behavior'. Back in the day: The alleged abuse took place when Altstatt worked at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which closed in 2011, though he claims he did not have access to young patients . Local station WJLA reports that Altstatt admitted to wrongdoing but his lawyer does not support that claim. 'I . am unaware of any admissions of any nature... He will certainly plead . not guilty when the opportunity presents itself,' attorney Richard Finci . told WJLA. The first victim said that the abuse started in 1964 when she was 10-years-old. That victim claims that the abuse carried on for four years. The specific details about what exactly happened have not been revealed for any of the victims, but the charges against Altstatt imply that they are sexual in nature. The second victim had a similar situation, as her abuse began a year after the first and lasted for four years as well. Her age at the time of the abuse has not been reported. Ailing: Altstatt, 83, is in hospice care (left) and needs to have an oxygen tank with him (right) at all times . The third victim was the youngest and her abuse reported spanned nearly a decade. She was 6-years-old in 1972 when the abuse reportedly began and she was abused 'hundred of times' before it stopped when she was 15-years-old. That timeline between these three victims would put the abuse as beginning in 1964 and ending in 1981. Boyd had to bring a portable oxygen tank with breathing tubes because he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 'I was appalled to see my client wheezing during the hearing,' his attorney Richard Finci told The Washington Post. Boyd is in hospice care and has lived in Silver Spring, Maryland for decades without causing any alarm to his neighbors. 'It's not somebody you would consider a predator, that you'd be afraid to have in your family,' neighbor Sharon Kornely told WJLA.","Leslie Boyd Altstatt, 83, is accused of sexually abusing three female relatives between 1964 and 1982 .

"By . Associated Press . John Kerry, the U.S. secretary of state, has said he chose the wrong word in describing Israel's potential future after being criticized for saying the Jewish state could become an 'apartheid state' if it does not reach a peace deal with the Palestinians. In a statement released yesterday by the State Department, Kerry lashed out against 'partisan political' attacks against him, but acknowledged his comments last week to a closed international forum could have been misinterpreted. He pointedly did not apologize for the remarks, but stressed he was, and is, a strong supporter of Israel, which he called a 'vibrant democracy.' Scroll down for video . Secretary of State John Kerry has said he chose the wrong word to describe Israel's potential future after saying it risked becoming an 'apartheid state' He said his remarks were only an expression of his firm belief that a two-state resolution is the only viable way to end the long-running conflict. And, he stressed, he does not believe Israel is, or is definitely on track to become, an 'apartheid state.' 'I will not allow my commitment to Israel to be questioned by anyone, particularly for partisan, political purposes, so I want to be crystal clear about what I believe and what I don't believe,' Kerry said after U.S. lawmakers and pro-Israel groups criticized him, with some demanding his resignation or at least an apology. 'First, Israel is a vibrant democracy and I do not believe, nor have I ever stated, publicly or privately, that Israel is an apartheid state or that it intends to become one,' he said. 'Second, I have been around long enough to also know the power of words to create a misimpression, even when unintentional, and if I could rewind the tape, I would have chosen a different word to describe my firm belief that the only way in the long term to have a Jewish state and two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two state solution,' Kerry said. On Sunday, The Daily Beast reported that Kerry had told a closed-door meeting of the Trilateral Commission in Washington on Friday that Israel risked becoming an 'apartheid state' with two classes of citizens if negotiations to forge a peace deal fail and a two-state solution is not reached. In his statement, Kerry defended his general point, noting that numerous Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and predecessors, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, have offered similar assessments in the past. Palestinians waving Palestinian flags as they gathered last week to celebrate the newly made reconciliation deal between Fatah and Hamas, ending a seven-year split . But, he said while Barak and Olmert, and Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, 'have all invoked the specter of apartheid to underscore the dangers of a unitary state for the future, it is a word best left out of the debate here at home.' The report of Kerry's 'apartheid' comment to the Trilateral Commission was immediately assailed by many the pro-Israel community in the U.S. House GOP leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., said Kerry should apologize, while the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee described his use of the term as 'offensive.' Another pro-Israel lobby group demanded that Kerry resign, a call echoed by Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in a speech on the Senate floor . Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California was also critical of Kerry's comment, saying in a tweet that: 'Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East and any linkage between Israel and apartheid is nonsensical and ridiculous.' In his statement, Kerry defended his general point, noting that numerous Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (pictured) and predecessors, Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert, have offered similar assessments in the past . Kerry has invested significant time and energy since he became America's top diplomat last year into bringing the two sides to the negotiating table with the goal of reaching a deal in nine months. That deadline expires on Tuesday with the parties having failed to reach that settlement, a less ambitious framework deal or even an agreement to extend the negotiations. The State Department said on Monday that U.S. envoy for Mideast peace, Martin Indyk, had returned home from the region and had no immediate plans to return. President Barack Obama, along with Kerry and other U.S. officials, has blamed the impasse on negative steps taken by both sides over the course of the last several months. On the Israeli side, those include a decision not to release a group of Palestinian prisoners it had earlier agreed to free and announcements of new Jewish settlement construction on land claimed by the Palestinians. On the Palestinian side, they include a move to join numerous U.N. conventions they had agreed not to join while the negotiations were underway and, most recently, the announcement of a unity government with the radical Hamas movement, which Israel, the U.S. and Europe regard as a terrorist organization.","John Kerry says he chose wrong word to describe Israel's potential future .

A man in southern California was sentenced to 16 years in prison Monday for running over and killing his wife's Chihuahua named Cow-Cow in the middle of their bitter divorce.

Parker backs the car up before quickly speeding over the helpless 5-year-old dog, which tries and fails to move out of the way. The car is then seen exiting the alleyway while Cow-Cow lays motionless on the ground. A passerby later saw the dog, placed it in a bag and moved the carcass to the side of the alleyway. Another person noticed the body a week later by the smell.

"By . Sam Webb . The iconic skyline of San Francisco appears to be nestled among the clouds in this series of ethereal images taken in the early morning fog. Photographer Ali Erturk, 33, hiked to a beauty spot at 4am to capture the stunning sight of the city and the Golden Gate Bridge immersed in the dense swirls of fog. Only the very tip of the bridge is visible above the thick cloud. At times, the 746ft structure across the Golden Gate strait, the mile-wide, three-mile-long channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean, was completely hidden from view. City in the sky: The skyline of San Francisco blanketed in fog. The unworldly pictures were taken by German photographer Ali Erturk . Mr Erturk, 33, hiked to the spot at 4am to capture the stunning sight of the Golden Gate Bridge immersed in the dense swirls of fog . Earth, water, wind and fire: After a number of failed attempts, Mr Erturk was delighted to finally get the conditions he needed . Mr Erturk, a neuroscientist, spent around three hours taking photos from Slacker Hill, overlooking the scene and the city from the north. He said: 'Since I moved to San Francisco a few years ago, I have been trying to catch the fog early in the morning. 'I did a few attempts before, but could not get the conditions as great as this one. 'A typical sunrise shooting session starts about two hours before sunrise as I also like to do a few shots of the bridge among the stars. 'I had to drive for 15 minutes and then hiked pretty fast to be up there as soon as possible. 'While I drive, I can see whether there is fog or not and on a few previous occasions have returned back home because there was no fog. 'On best-case scenarios like this one, the fog covers most of the bridge and the land, but only the poles of the bridge and highrises of the city are visible.' From day into night: At times, the 746ft structure across the Golden Gate strait is barely visible . Mr Erturk said: 'The fog in general moves pretty fast, and the level of visibility changed every minute' He added: 'I was very excited to finally have the conditions that I was dreaming of and immediately started shooting with a wide angle lens. 'I also tried having some foreground, free of the fog that could show the fog covering the scene like a blanket. 'The fog in general moves pretty fast, and the level of visibility changed every minute. 'This reminds me of a ghost moving fast through the bay. While most of the time some parts of the bridge and city was visible, sometimes everything was covered and invisible.' Mr Erturk, from Munich, Germany, said he was pleased with his photographs.

'He said that he was getting married one way or another, no matter what,' paramedic Rob Leuthold told the station. 'He wanted it to happen.' Pizzuto, meanwhile, 'was a nervous wreck' as she rode in the front of the ambulance while Adams was in the back, EMT Belt Walter told KDKA. 'She herself had had five heart attacks,' Walter said, 'so they were all worried about her.'

"By . Lydia Warren . Locked up: Michael Jones, 34, had sex with the 16-year-old student at school and at his home . A high school technician has been sentenced to 13 years behind bars for having sex with a student half his age as many as 40 times - often on school property. Michael Jones, a 34-year-old married father-of-two from Ormond Beach, Florida, must also join the sex offender's register and serve 15 years probation after his release from prison. Before Jones was sentenced for having sex with the then-16-year-old girl - whom he met when she was just 14 - his family and friends had testified that the girl was also responsible for the affair. But the judge slammed these claims as 'absurd', the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported. 'To make that comment I think flies in the face . of reality when you are looking at a 32-year-old man and a 16-year-old . child,' Circuit Judge Leah Case said. 'To even put those two people on the same level . playing field is absurd.' Prosecutors said that Jones, who worked as a technician at the school for seven years, had the girl excused from class so they could have a tryst at Seabreeze High School. They met when the girl was just 14, but had sex for the first time two years later. 'I think what makes it particularly aggravating in this situation is that this is not a person who met up with (the victim) at a bar and didn't know her age,' Case said. 'This is a person who knew her when she was 14 years old.' Trysts: He began texting her after getting her number from one of her friends, and they went on to have sex as many as 40 times before maintenance workers caught them in the auditorium . The victim, who is now 19, said she first thought Jones was creepy when she texted him after getting her number from one of her friends. Eventually, she started speaking to him more, and realized they had both lost their fathers when they were young, a fact they bonded over, the News-Journal reported. The pair first had sex when a school club he had set up went on a trip to St Augustine. They later had sex at school, Jones' house, the girl's house and in a car in a parking lot. The girl said they had sex as many as 40 times, whereas Jones claimed they had sex about 20 times. Their affair eventually came to an end in October 2012 when workers checking a fire extinguisher in the auditorium stumbled across the couple. Jones had shouted that he was sleeping and the girl hid in a separate room - but the fire extinguisher the workers were checking was in this room. Jones testified that he had not pursued the girl, saying: 'It's not something I went after, it's something we did together.' Jones . had pleaded no contest to two counts of sexual activity with a person . under 18. He had faced up to 30 years in prison.","Michael Jones, 34, met the girl when she was just 14 and started texting her when she was 16 after getting her number from one of her friends .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Business magnate Donald Trump is reportedly set to add one of the world's most famous golf courses to his portfolio. The U.S. tycoon is close to completing a £35million deal to buy Scotland's Turnberry Golf Course, following months of secret negotiations. The South Ayrshire course, which is tipped to host its fifth Open in the next 10 years, is currently owned by Leisurecorp, a subsidiary of the Dubai government. Billionaire U.S. businessman Donald Trump is reportedly close to securing a deal to buy Turnberry Golf Course in Scotland . Britain's first purpose built golf resort, Turnberry has hosted The Open championships four times in its history and is tipped to host the competition again in the next decade . They bought the complex, which includes a five star hotel, luxury self catering accommodation and a spa, for £52million in 2008. But since the financial downturn swept the globe, the course has been unofficially up for sale. One source told The Times: 'Turnberry will be the gem to crown Trump's golf portfolio and it is 95 per cent certain to go through. 'It is an open secret that Mr Trump had wanted an Open venue. This would be a tremendous coup for him.' Billionaire property developer Trump recently added a five star golf resort on the west coast of Ireland to his collection, bringing the total resorts he owns across the world to 16. Turnberry is currently owned by Leisurecorp, a subsidiary of the Dubai government, who bought the complex for £52million in 2008 . Trump Organisation is expected to buy the resort, which boasts three courses, for £35million . The first purpose built golfing . resort in Britain, Turnberry boasts three stunning courses, the Ailsa . which has hosted the Open, the Kintyre and the Arran. It was designed by Scottish architect James Miller and completed in 1906. For many years golf at Turnberry was enjoyed only by locals. That was until the development of the railway as lines extended into Scotland, luring visitors from across the UK. To capitalise, South-Western Railway built its line from Ayr to Girvan, and the Station Hotel at Turnberry. Rolling hills, sandy dunes, and a refreshing breeze blowing off the coast, draw thousands of golfers to the resort each year. Turnberry's . fairways have been shared by the game's elite players and amateur . enthusiasts from all four corners of the globe. Turnberry boasts three stunning courses, the Ailsa which has hosted the Open, the Kintyre and the Arran . The course was used as an airbase during the First World War and a landing strip built at the time remains, though is now no longer in use. The Royal Flying Corps trained at Turnberry and the resort's hotel was used as a hospital for the wounded. After the war the first and second courses were rebuilt and renamed Ailsa and Arran and a memorial to honour airmen who lost their lives during the conflict was erected and still stands overlooking the 12th green of the Ailsa course. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Turnberry was once again transformed, to play its part in the war effort. The hotel was commissioned as a hospital and the courses were seconded by the RAF. It is thought as many as 200 servicemen lost their lives training at the base. Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus in action during the 1977 Open Championship . Golf course designer Philip Mackenzie Ross restored Turnberry's courses to their pre-war glory and the Ailsa course was reopened in 1951. The course first hosted The Open Championship in the late 1970s and . since four spellbinding tournaments have graced the fairways and greens - . the 106th in 1977, the 115th in 1986, the 123rd in 1994 and the last . one in July 2009. It is reported to be in line to host its fifth Open in the next decade. The Ailsa has also hosted many other important tournaments, including the Women's British Open in 2002, the Walker Cup in 1963, the Amateur Championship in 1961, 1983, 1996 and 2008 and the Senior Open Championship six times between 1987 and 2006. The Women's British Open is to be staged at Turnberry next year. The other two courses at Turnberry are the Kintyre Course and the nine-hole Arran course. The Kintyre, designed by Donald Steel, opened in 2001 and is Turnberry's second championship standard course, that has hosted final qualifiying for The Open. The new Arran Course opened in 2002. Turnberry is also home to the Colin Montgomerie Links Golf Academy, and a pitch and putt course. In 2003 the 18th hold of the Ailsa couse was renamed Duel in the Sun, in honour of the famous battle between Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus during the 1977 Open tournament. The . resort is also served by a 149-bedroom five star hotel. The luxury . collection hotel first opened in 1906 and underwent a multi-million . renovation programme prior to hosting the 2009 Open tournament. To play the Ailsa course between May 1 and October 12, will cost a visitor £250 per round. For the Kintyre course the price for that period is £90 while visitors will have to pay £40 per round on the Arran. Prices range throughout the year from £110 per round on the Ailsa to £250, £55 to £90 on the Kintyre and £25 to £40 on the nine-hold Arran. In February he lost a high-profile court battle after taking the Scottish government to task over their approval for an offshore wind farm in Aberdeen Bay. Trump claimed the development would have a negative impact on the views from his luxury £750million links course in Menie. As a result Trump announced his Trump Organisation would be focusing 'all of our investment and energy' on the Irish Doonbeg Golf Club in County Clare, with views over the Atlantic coast and renamed the Trump International Golf Links Ireland. Donald Trump has said Menie golf resort in Aberdeenshire is not for sale. The claim came after the property magnate pulled the plug on any future major investment after losing in his court battle with the Scottish government over plans to build an offshore windfarm in Aberdeen Bay.

"By . James Rush . and Ashley Collman . Sarah Shourd (pictured in 2010 following her release) has described how she spent her days in solitary confinement 'full of rage' A woman who was locked in solitary confinement for more than a year after accidentally crossing into Iran has described how she spent her days pacing her cell and 'full of rage'. Sarah Shourd was one of three American hikers who were imprisoned after the holiday they took to Kurdistan in 2009 quickly turned into a nightmare when a guide led them astray. Ms Shourd spent 410 days in solitary confinement, while her travelling companions Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal spent more than two years in prison. She has now described the effect her time in solitary confinement had on her during a discussion on HuffPost Live about the findings of a PBS Frontline documentary called Solitary Nation . Ms Shourd said: 'In the beginning, it reduces you to an almost animal-like state. 'I spent all my days pacing my cell, punching the air, just full of rage. And then I would fall into deep depressions.' She described how she would crouch by her door in an attempt to hear a human sound, such as a cough or a footstep, so she could be reminded she was 'in the land of the living.' She also described how at times she lost her sanity and beat up the walls of her cell. Last month it was reported Ms Shourd, Mr Bauer and Mr Fattal were telling their side of the story in the new book A Sliver Of Light. Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Josh Fattal speak at an event in February 2012. Mr Bauer and Ms Shourd were married in May 2012 . Ms Shourd became severely depressed during her imprisonment, but there were a few periods of unexpected joy - including the time her boyfriend Mr Bauer proposed to her using strings he pulled from a towel fastened with a staple. Following their release, Shourd and Bauer were married in May 2012. After a year behind bars, Ms Shourd was released for a 'medical condition' and she joined the many on the outside championing for her friends' release. At a dinner with Sean Penn and then-girlfriend Scarlett Johanssen, Ms Shourd got the actor to promise to ask Hugo Chavez about her friends' wrongful imprisonment. Shane Bauer, Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd wave in delight while boarding a flight back to the U.S. in September 2011 . Chavez, the-then president of Venezuela was personal friends with Iran's then president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In the end, the hikers were convicted of illegal entry and espionage and sentenced to eight years in prison. But Mr Bauer and Mr Fattal were released in September 2011 after Omani officials posted $500,000 bail.","Sarah Shourd spent 410 days in solitary after crossing into Iran .

"By . Simon Cable . and Mia De Graaf . Billy Connolly blew a raspberry down the phone as his doctor delivered the devastating news that he had both cancer and Parkinson's disease. The comedian was standing in his living room when the surgery called - and his instinct was to laugh. 'I remember I went through to the . bedroom to answer the phone, and Pamela was behind me - I thought she . was going to catch me,' he said. Defiant: Billy Connolly blew a defiant raspberry when he heard he had both cancer and Parkinson's disease . 'She sort of held me, and I went, ""Oh, Jesus...""' 'But when we went into the living room I went: ""Phrrhrht"" [blowing a raspberry]. 'I think they're very closely related, deep despair and laughing.' Ever . unconventional, the Glaswegian also revealed in an interview with the . Radio Times that he is treating his Parkinson’s with crosswords instead . of taking medication. The . comedian has revealed that he doesn’t want to rely on the drugs . prescribed by doctors so instead he challenges himself to word puzzles . to stave off memory loss caused by the degenerative condition. 'I've put myself on a strict regime of crossword books,' he said. 'They remind me of everything. I have to train my memory. 'I have got a notebook with all the words I tend to forget. It’s the same ones cropping up again and again. The drugs can increase the signs, give you the Parkinson’s face – expressionless, sort of slack.' The comedian, pictured with his wife Pamela in 2002, now self-medicates by doing crosswords, he revealed . The Glaswegian was given the all-clear from cancer last year but there is no cure for Parkinson's disease . It is 'early days' with the disease, . he said, and his doctor will 'put me back on them [the drugs] when the . symptoms come back’. Last . September the 71-year-old announced he had undergone surgery for . prostate cancer and was being treated for the early symptoms of . Parkinson’s, a neurological disorder which affects the central nervous . system and brain. While Connolly was given the all-clear from cancer last year, there is no cure for Parkinson’s. Billy Connolly opens up about coping with Parkinson's in the new issue of Radio Times . The . Glaswegian said he sometimes suffers from shaking hands during moments . of strain but has made the symptoms part of his stage act. He . confessed that he has not written a will, something which he insists . has the approval of his wife, actress turned psychologist, Pamela . Stephenson. And he said he dismissed any talk of dying when it was brought up by doctors. ‘When he [the doctor] said, “First of all, you’re not going to die”, I was shocked. I said: “Of course I’m not going to f****** die!” It never crossed my mind. It was all very businesslike.’ But Connolly is not letting his health woes slow down his stellar career. He is currently on a world stand-up tour and recently filmed scenes for the final Hobbit film, as well as an ITV documentary, Billy Connolly’s Big Send Off, which airs next month. He will also tour the UK later this year but no details of dates have yet been revealed. Connolly has denied that Parkinson’s has caused momentary memory loss on stage. Of a show last year when he was accused of forgetting his lines, he said: ‘Oh that was bulls***! I have lost my train of thought  all my career! It’s what makes me different from everybody else; “Where was I, what was I saying?” ‘I just ramble off and come back ages later. I once had a guy following me from [a gig in] Morecambe to get the second half of a story. Eventually he got it in Blackpool.’","Comedian blew a raspberry when told he had Parkinson's and cancer .

"By . Dan Bloom . A top Olympic official has slammed preparations for the 2016 Games in Rio saying they are the 'worst that I've experienced'. John Coates, vice president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), made the damning public attack after an unprecedented task force was set up to deliver the Games on time. IOC staff will be parachuted into Brazil's second-largest city to speed up construction delays which have been described as worse than the Athens Games in 2004. Work in progress: The Olympic Park in Rio pictured last month. The IOC said there are unprecedented delays . A long way to go: The fabric of Rio's Olympic Stadium is largely completed, but despite this the IOC has said the situation is worse than in Athens in 2004, with work held up by strikes and bureaucracy . Mr Coates told delegates today at an Olympic forum that preparations were still in chaos, with strikes delaying construction and one crucial department employing just two people. Dwellers of the city's famous favelas (slums) have taken to the streets in increasingly violent protests as tensions rise over the multi-billion dollar works, which will destroy many of their homes. Thousands of troops were deployed to Rio's slums in February to wrest . them back from the control of drug gangs and criminals. FIFA has also warned Brazil over its drastically late preparations for the football World Cup, whose group stages start in just six weeks. Dire: John Coates warned there is no plan B . But Mr Coates warned there was no 'plan B' to find another host for the Olympics, and they would have to be held in Rio regardless. The Australian, 63, told delegates in Sydney construction delays were worse than in the 2004 Athens Games, where the Olympic stadium was finished just two months before the opening ceremony. He added infrastructure was significantly behind schedule and water quality was a major concern. 'In Athens, we were dealing with one government and some city responsibilities,' he said. 'Here, there's three. 'There is bureaucracy, there is little . coordination between the federal, the state government and the city - . which is responsible for a lot of the construction. 'The flow of funds . from the federal government is not happening quickly enough. We think we . need to help facilitate tha. 'And . this is against a city that's got social issues that also have to be . addressed; a country that's also trying to deal with the FIFA World Cup . coming up in a few months. 'It's the worst that I've experienced.' The . first Games in South America have been plagued by delays, rising costs . and poor communication between the Brazilian government and organisers, . prompting criticism from sports federations. Redevelopment: Last week the Perimetral overpass was demolished as part of Rio's Porto Maravilha (Marvelous Port) urbanisation project ahead of the Olympics. Mr Coates said infrastructure was not on track . Workers: Builders on strike outside the Olympic Park earlier this month. Employees have clashed with guards . Earlier this month the IOC set up its task force, just one of a series of measures to kick-start the lagging preparations. They also include employing extra monitors and sending project managers and teams of experts. 'The . IOC has adopted a more hands-on role,' Mr Coates said. 'it is . unprecedented for the IOC but there is no plan B. We are going to Rio. 'We . have become very concerned - they are not ready in many, many ways. We . have to make it happen and that is the IOC approach, you can't walk away . from this.' Mr Coates has made six visits to Rio as a member of the IOC's coordination commission. Rio has the same number of staff as London did two years before the Games, but Mr Coates said they lack experience. He pointed to only two staff working in the Games' tests department, even though test events are due to start this year. Protest: Strikes such as this one earlier this month have delayed construction work on the Olympic site . Unrest: Tensions have risen between the authorities and those living in favelas (slums). This photo shows residents of Pavao-Pavaozinho protesting last week over the shooting of Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira . Work has not yet begun at Deodoro, a . complex for eight Olympics sports venues, and the course that will host . golf's return to the Olympic program for the first time in more than a . century does not yet have any grass. Water pollution, meanwhile, could cause upset at events like sailing. 'The IOC has adopted a more hands-on . role. It is unprecedented for the IOC but there is no . plan B. We are going to Rio' - IOC vice president John Coates . Concern over the delays hit crisis point earlier this months at a SportAccord meeting in . Belek, Turkey, where 18 . sports federations publicly aired concerns over Rio's preparations. Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes fired back at the complaints, saying the federations were demanding facilities which the city's residents would not use after the Games. The IOC will send executive director Gilbert Felli to Brazil as part . of a series of emergency measures to tackle the delays threatening the . games. Mr Coates said other experienced, high-level staff will soon be . appointed. As Australian . Olympic Committee president, he also said the country's sports leaders . and team managers were 'not getting answers' to any of their questions . on visits. Clashes: A riot police officer fires tear gas towards residents of the Pavao-Pavaozinho slum last week .

Work has not yet begun at Deodoro, a complex for eight venues, and the course that will host golf's return to the Olympic program does not yet have any grass (file photo) 'Can they use the carparks in the village for recovery centres?' he said. 'What will be the time to take from this venue to this venue? 'All of those things, they're being fobbed off. 'But again, we just have to make it happen - and that's the IOC's approach. You can't walk away from this.

The taxi driver left his cigarettes in his cab that was still parked near the visitor's center Monday and his daughter's inhaler and other medicine were in the hotel room where he lived, according to his family. The park has marked trails, but beyond the paths are tangles of old growth trees, swamps and underbrush.

"By . Paul Donnelley . Swearing has been banned in films, television and music in Russia after the lower house of parliament passed a new law. Russian President Vladimir Putin must sign the new edict into law but last year he agreed to a similar ban on foul language in the media. The new rule means that some of Russia’s best known actors and singers could be fined or even banned from working if they flout the law. Russian rock singer Yuri Shevchuk (with guitar) performs in central Moscow. Shevchuk who challenged President Putin on free speech in 2010 claims that the new law is part of a Conservative trend in the country and could 'devolve into a dark age' Russian rocker Yuri Shevchuk who challenged President Putin on free speech in 2010 claimed that the law is part of a Conservative trend in the country and could ‘devolve into a dark age’. He said: ‘I’m against all bans. I’m against all government interference in arts. We have these bans within each of us, in our morality. They’re formed by upbringing and religion.’ The fines start at 2,500 roubles (£41) for individuals and rise to 100,000 roubles (£1,600) for businesses. Repeat offenders could be banned for a year. Russian President Vladimir Putin must sign the new edict into law but last year he agreed to a similar ban on foul language in the media . Videos, audio tapes and books that contain swearwords will be required to be sold in special packaging featuring an explicit language warning. Critics point out that there is no firm definition for what constitutes bad language, a similar problem that faced the law that President Putin passed last year. The law states that ‘words and phrases not meeting the norms of modern Russian literary language’ will be outlawed. A group of ‘experts’ will determine what those words and phrases are. It remains unclear if films and television shows that bleep out rude words would fall foul of the ban.In recent years swearing has become more prominent in Russian films and plays. Media companies have already faced difficulties with the ban and the news agency Rosbalt was briefly closed after It aired two videos that included swearing.","Law would affect Russia's best known actors and musicians who could be fined or even banned from working .

' Asked if either partner was violent, Mr Cramer said the fight involved 'a slight push'. 'The row escalated', Mr Cramer told MailOnline because: 'Edie Brickell is from Texas. She likes to have things direct. Paul is from Queens. She wanted to talk it out. Paul didn't want to have a discussion and he tried to leave (the cottage) and Edie blocked the door.' Asked if Simon then pushed his wife, he said: 'I don't think he started the shoving. I believe the mother was there and made a call. 'Paul wanted to leave and Edie didn't want him to leave.

"By . Sami Mokbel . Follow @@SamiMokbel81_DM . Ajax manager Frank De Boer will hold talks with Tottenham about becoming their next manager - and he could bring Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp with him to White Hart Lane. Spurs have begun identifying candidates to replace current boss Tim Sherwood, who is set to leave this summer. De Boer is a favourite among the Tottenham hierarchy, and speaking on Dutch TV On Tuesday the Holland legend confirmed the Barclays Premier League club’s interest. Tottenham’s intention to discuss the managerial role with De Boer was made directly to Ajax director of football Marc Overmars. VIDEO Scroll down to see Tim Sherwood complain about managers discussing his job . Approach: Ajax boss Frank de Boer will wait to the end of the season to talk to Tottenham Hotspur . On top: De Boer, 43, secured his fourth Eredivisie title in a row with a draw at Heracles on Sunday . Assistant: Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp (pictured right with Jaap Stam, left) is assistant to De Boer . ‘Spurs haven’t had contact with my agent yet. They have approached Ajax, but that’s it,’ said De Boer. ‘Spurs have let Ajax know they would eventually talk to me when the season’s finished. ‘After the last league game (against NEC on Saturday) I’ll think about it,’ said De Boer. ‘I’ll . talk to them and listen to what they have to say. I would like to add . something to a club like Brendan Rodgers did at Liverpool. ‘I see a perspective at Tottenham Hotspur, just as Liverpool and Newcastle United sometimes are, they are sleeping giants.’ Tottenham’s interest in De Boer brings up the sensational possibility of Bergkamp joining his colleague in north London. The . 44-year-old is currently De Boer’s assistant at the Amsterdam Arena, . with the pair forming a strong working relationship; winning three . consecutive Eredivisie titles together. Hot seat: Spurs boss Tim Sherwood's current deal has him in charge until the end of the 2014-15 season . Success: De Boer says Tottenham could be a 'sleeping giant' of a club, like Liverpool and Newcastle . Influence: De Boer believes he can emulate the kind of success Brendan Rodgers has had at Liverpool . Should . he end up at Tottenham, it is understood De Boer is keen on continuing . his partnership with Bergkamp but realises the delicate nature of his . countryman’s sitaution. Bergkamp, . who made 417 appearances for the Gunners, is still revered in the red . half of north London and even has a statue outside the Emirates Stadium. The . former Holland forward still has huge affection for Arsenal, while . members of the club’s hierarchy have earmarked Bergkamp as a possible . future Gunners boss. Big ask: Bergkamp's emotional and historical ties to Arsenal make it unlikely he'll go to Tottenham . Club legend: A statue of Bergkamp stands outside Arsenal's Emirates Stadium . And given his emotional ties with Arsenal, it seems highly unlikely Bergkamp would agree to join bitter rivals Tottenham. Realising . the special circumstances, it is believed De Boer would look to bring . Hennie Spijkerman - who also works under him at Ajax - with him to . Spurs. Tottenham were non-committal with regards to De Boer’s claims, which have cast more doubt on Sherwood’s position as head coach. De Boer was last night installed as the new bookmakers favourite to land the Spurs job. However, Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino remains a strong contender according to Tottenham sources. Contender: Southampton boss Mauricio Pochettino is also highly regarded within Spurs' hierarchy . The .

"By . Emily Crane . A couple who let their toddler urinate in the middle of a busy Hong Kong street have sparked a huge debate about acceptable standards of behaviour in Chinese society. The woman was filmed holding a nappy under her two-year-old daughter as she relieved herself in the middle of Mong Kok, one of the world’s busiest shopping districts, last Tuesday. A row quickly erupted after the toddler’s parents tried to make off with the memory card from the camera of a young man who filmed the incident. Scroll down for video . A Chinese mother allowed her toddler to urinate on a busy Hong Kong street as the lines for the public toilet were too long . Another passser-by recorded the altercation that ensued and the footage has gone viral with more than a million people viewing the video on social media site Weibo. Much of the furore centres around the perceived gap between standards of social behaviour in mainland China and on the former British colony of Hong Kong. It is illegal to let a child relieve themselves in the street in Hong Kong and doing so can result in a HK$2000 fine. However, the practice is relatively common in mainland China. The incident in Mong Kok last week occurred because there was a long line for a public toilet and the child could not wait, according to the Want China Times. Onlookers surrounded the family to take pictures and then blocked their path as they tried to flee with the child and the pram. The Chinese couple got into a physical altercation as they tried to take the memory card from the camera of the young man taking photos of their daughter . ‘The child was going to pee in her pants, what do you want me do?’ the mother can be heard telling onlookers in the video. She was arrested for allegedly slapping one of the locals across the face and ramming another with the pram. The row came to light after a Hong Kong reporter, Luqiu Luwei, posted the details on her blog. An anonymous user of China’s popular online forum, Tianya.cn, has now escalated tensions by calling on mainland parents to bring their children to Hong Kong this week and let them urinate in the streets in protest. ‘Bring children to Hong Kong and let them urinate in Hong Kong’s streets. Let’s see who will come and take photos. They will see it as natural after they have been familiarised with the act,’ user Haijiao No68 posted, according to the South China Morning Post. Since being posted online, the video and images of the toddler has drawn more than one million comments on Weibo social media alone. ‘Why don't the couple let the child wear the diaper as a precaution in the first place?’ Ivan lam posted on Weibo. ‘They could talk to the people in the line to let them use the bathroom first or let the child pee inside the bathroom instead of on the street.’ But Chinese citizens weighing in on the debate have hit back at the treatment of the couple and child. ‘The man had no right to take pictures of a little girl peeing and violate her privacy,’ Weibo user youyouyu wrote. A passser-by recorded the altercation and the footage has gone viral with more than a million people viewing the video on social media site Weibo .","Chinese mother lets two-year-old urinate on busy Hong Kong Street .

"By . Mike Dawes . Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has been banned for life from the NBA and fined $2.5million after being found guilty of making racist comments on tape. The 80-year-old had found himself at the centre of huge controversy in the USA after American network TMZ had broadcast Sterling apparently telling a girlfriend not to bring black people to the team's games. Banned for life: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling cannot be involved in the team's operations after racist comments allegedly made by him were made public . His comments had led to Clippers . players making a silent protest ahead of their NBA Western Conference . play-off series defeat to the Golden State Warriors on Sunday evening, . while financial backers have been withdrawing their support for the . club. The NBA has taken a . dim view of the furore and a statement on the league's Twitter account . revealed Sterling had 'violated league rules through his expressions of . offensive and hurtful views, the impact of which has been widely felt . throughout the league'. He . is therefore banned from any association with the Clippers or the NBA, . meaning he may not be allowed to attend any games or practice sessions. The . sanction also means Sterling may not 'be present at any Clippers office . or facility, or participate in any business or player personnel . decisions involving the team'. NBA . commissioner Adam Silver said at a news conference: 'The views . expressed by Mr Sterling are deeply offensive and harmful. That they . came from an NBA owner only heightens the damage and my personal . outrage. Tirade: The recording stemmed from a conversation between Sterling and his girlfriend V. Stiviano (right) after she posted this photo with Magic Johnson to her Instagram account . Interested: Johnson has expressed interest in buying the team . Standing up: Protestors at Tuesday night's NBA playoff clash against the Golden State Warriors . Disgusted: Several groups made their voices known before the clash against Sterling .

Local businesses: AQUAhydrate, Lumber Liquidators, Yokohama Tire Corporation, Commer Hotel & Casino, Southern California Ford dealers association,  Chumash Casino Resort, LoanMart . 'Sentiments of this . kind are contrary to the principles of inclusion and respect that form . the foundation of our diverse, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic league. 'I . am personally distraught that the views expressed by Mr Sterling came . from within an institution that has historically taken such a leadership . role in matters of race relations, and caused current and former . players, coaches, fans and partners of the NBA to question their very . association with the league. 'To . them - and pioneers of the game, like Earl Lloyd, Chuck Cooper, . Sweetwater Clifton, the great Bill Russell and particularly Magic . Johnson - I apologise.' Silver . will urge the NBA's governors to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, . and the news was hailed by several prominent figures. 'Commissioner .

'Current and former NBA players now know that in Commissioner Adam Silver we have a great leader leading our league.' Miami . Heat star man LeBron James said on the social networking site: . 'Commissioner Silver thank you for protecting our beautiful and powerful . league!! Great leader!! #BiggerThanBasketball #StriveForGreatness.' Dallas . Mavericks owner Mark Cuban added: 'I agree 100% with Commissioner . Silvers findings and the actions taken against Donald Sterling.' While questions remain concerning Sterling's future ownership of the team, and the impact of his comments on the players, the NBA's stern decision has unquestionably lightened the Clippers load. 'I am drained,' Rivers told reporters before the start of Game Five against the Golden State Warriors in their best-of-seven playoff series, which they won 79-74 to take a 3-2 lead. Discuss: The Rev. Jesse Jackson (centre) talks to Los Angeles Clippers' Chris Paul and Jamal Crawford . 'But not drained enough not to go out and coach this game. 'I thought that was the sigh of relief we needed,' Rivers said, referring to Silver's announcement earlier in the day. 'Is this over? No, it's not over. But it's the start of a healing process that we need. 'We're going to let this whole thing run its course and then we'll all have better clarity. I want my players to be comfortable, honestly. I think that's the most important thing.' Silver, who has urged the NBA's owners to vote to force Sterling to sell the Clippers, has received universal backing throughout the league for his handling of the incident. 'My team mates and I are in agreement with his decision,' said Clippers guard Chris Paul, who is also the NBA's Players Association president. 'We appreciate the strong leadership from Commissioner Silver and he has our full support.'Fans at the Clippers' home Staples Center venue appeared to share Paul's sentiment, and the earlier ruling took the steam out of what was expected to be an unsettled environment.

"By . Richard Spillett . Music mogul Simon Cowell has ditched Max Clifford as his PR advisor after the publicist was found guilty of a string of indecent assaults. Clifford, 71, has worked for Cowell, 54, for over a decade, representing him in the media and handling his public image. But the pair have reportedly parted company following Clifford's conviction on eight counts of indecent assault at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. Scroll down for video . Simon Cowell has employed Max Clifford as his PR adviser for years, but has cut ties with him after the publicist's convictions for indecent assault yesterday . A source told the Sun that Cowell was 'horrified' by what the court heard during Clifford's three-week trial and is now 'distancing' himself from his former PR man. Despite the split, Clifford's company, Max Clifford Associates, was still using a picture of Cowell on its website this morning before the whole site was taken down around midday. The website claimed: 'Clifford's unique combination of protection and publicity helped cement [Cowell's] place as one of the world's most successful music/TV moguls in the world.' Clifford's company website also featured a photo of him with Olympic cyclist Chris Hoy, although the site listed Hoy among the firm's 'past clients'. Despite the reported split, Max Clifford Associates' website was still using a picture of Simon Cowell this morning and listing him among its 'current clients' before it was taken down around midday . It was reported yesterday that Clifford, who during the trial had boasted to the jury of his charity work, had been axed as patron of two organisations near his home in Hersham, Surrey. Shooting Star Chase children's hospices and Woking and Sam Beare Hospices have both said Clifford is no longer a patron of their charities. A spokesman for Shooting Star Chase said: 'Max Clifford became a patron of Shooting Star Chase childrenâ€™s hospice in 2011. 'Prior to this, he was a supporter of CHASE hospice care for children. Safeguarding the children and families supported by Shooting Star Chase is of upmost importance. 'None of our patrons have unsupervised access to the children or young people and all staff with access to children under go Disclosure and Barring Services checks. 'Furthermore all staff are required to attend a yearly mandatory safeguarding children training session. 'In light of Mr Clifford being found guilty of indecent assault, Shooting Star Chase can confirm that Mr Clifford is no longer a patron of the charity.' Cowell is believed to have first hired Clifford when he became a TV judge on the Pop Idol TV series in 2001. It is believed the music boss was treated as one of the firm's top clients, whose public image was handled exclusively by Clifford himself. The relationship helped see Cowell become a huge TV personality, with the public growing to love to his cruel comments and put downs to fame-hungry contestants. Cowell even featured a film by Louis Theroux in 2002, when the documentary-maker followed Clifford for a BBC Two programme. Max Clifford has spent at least 12 years handling Simon Cowell's deals with the media . Cowell and Clifford were seen talking at an event organised by Clifford for children at the Royal Marsden Hospital in west London. But Clifford admitted he was 'disappointed' when his most high-profile client revealed in a biography that he had an affair with fellow TV judge Dannii Minogue. Clifford, who had spent years protecting the secret, described Cowell's decision to reveal the affair as a 'massive own goal'. He said at the time: 'This is a man who for 10 years I protected and always was desperately, desperately keen to have a private life and keep his private life very private. 'We've had a close relationship for many, many years, I think the world of the guy.' Despite Clifford's arrest by Operation Yewtree detectives in December 2012, Cowell continued to use him to handle his publicity. The PR expert's empire began to crumble as one of his victims told of her joy that justice had finally caught up with him. The victim, who Clifford was found guilty of indecently assaulting, was groped when she went to his office as an aspiring teenage model in the 1980s. She told the Sun: 'I'm delighted he has finally been exposed. Now the world knows the real Max Clifford. Clifford is ushered into a car after he was bailed yesterday ahead of his sentencing hearing on Friday . 'He is a predatory, manipulative, monster who thought he could take what he wanted from young, vulnerable women."" The woman, now in her late 40s, said Clifford told her she 'couldn't be shy in this industry' before launching himself at her. As with other women involved in the case, Clifford promised her fame and told her he could get her a role in a Bond Film, name dropping famous producer 'Cubby' Broccoli. The victim told the paper she was traumatised after the attack and stayed indoors for days. She added: 'I was terrified of other agents after that. I got one really lucrative job but didn't turn up for it because I was so scared. 'When I heard the verdict I wept tears of sadness.' After being charged with 11 counts of indecent assault, he was found guilty of eight yesterday. He was cleared on two other counts, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on another. It emerged today that there were 23 victims who came forward to police, but prosecutors decided to proceed with what they perceived to be the seven strongest cases. Clifford will be sentenced on Friday. The maximum sentence for indecent assault was two years at the time the offences were committed.","Clifford has handled Cowell's dealings with the media for at least 12 years .

The Old Bailey’s matron, wearing a distinctive blue nurse’s uniform, sat in the packed public gallery during the hearing. Mrs Clarence is originally from South Africa and moved to Britain with her husband some years ago. A plea and case management hearing will be held at the Old Bailey on July 15. Judge Brian Barker, the Recorder of London, allowed Mrs Clarence to be released from prison under the Mental Health Act. He told the Old Bailey he made the unusual move because it was an 'exceptional case' and to allow her to receive hospital treatment. He said: 'There is a combination of circumstances here that makes this an exceptional case and allows this court to take an exceptional course. 'It isn't bail, but what we are doing is ordering for her to be subject to a Section 35 Order under the Mental Health Act, so she can then be remanded effectively for review of her condition.' She was remanded to a secure hospital which cannot be identified. The judge said the order should be processed by the end of the day and the case would be reviewed again in 28 days time.

"He said it was his job to 'seduce, amuse and entertain'. And a now a new exhibit shows how the legendary fashion photographer Helmut Newton succeeded on all three fronts. From this Saturday dozens of his glamorous color and monochrome images, taken between the mid-Sixties and late Seventies, will go on display at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles. The selection features several of his greatest hits, including a provocative image of a woman on a bed wearing a riding saddle. Tongue-in-cheek: The late fashion photographer Helmut Newton said it was his job to 'seduce, amuse and entertain' and a new exhibit shows how he succeeded on all three fronts . Another shows a model wearing stockings and suspenders reclining on a sofa with her back to the camera to reveal the full length of her thighs. Newton's iconic 1981 self-portrait is also set to tantalize gallery-goers. It shows the reflection of him in a mirror as he photographs a nude model. His wife June watches on as she sits to one side. The photographs were made specifically made for the exhibition and produced in large-scale format - some reaching nearly six-feet-high. Art of seduction: A scantily-clad model poses at the luxury hotel, Villa d' Este, in Lake Como, Italy in April 1975 . Iconic: Newton's 1981 self-portrait is also set to tantalize gallery-goers - his wife, June is seen seated . All were selected from three of Newton's popular coffee table books - White Women (1976), Sleepless Nights (1978), and Big Nudes (1981). David Fahey, a gallery owner and a longtime friend of Newton's, described his images as 'sexually charged' and 'edgy'. 'I like to call them . mini-narratives,' he explained. 'They’re stories within a story. And they’re stories that . say: ""Women can be as powerful and as dominating as men. And sexual . curiosity is normal.""' Several black-and-white images Mr Fahey took of Newton are included in the display, which will run until September 8. Striking: Newton preferred to shoot his photographs in streets or interiors rather than studios - this image was taken in 1975 in Rue Aubriot, Paris . Girls out in force: This shot, titled Here They Come II, is from Newton's 1981 photo series Big Nudes . They show the photographer posing at . the upscale Hollywood hotel Chateau Marmont, where he and his wife used . to winter every year. In addition to the more than 100 prints displayed, the exhibit will feature two films about Newton. Helmut by June, a documentary film . shot and directed by June Newton, Newton's wife of 56 years, shows him behind-the-scenes on shoots with models Cindy Crawford and Helena Christensen. It also provides an intimate glimpse . into his private life and the couple's remarkable relationship. Best of friends: Jane and Helmut Newton by the pool at Chateau Marmont, Los Angeles, in March 1985 . Living the dream: Newton, pictured here in March 1985, died as a result of a car accident aged 84 . Additionally, the Annenberg Space . for Photography has commissioned an original documentary film titled Provocateur, which examine the cameraman's impact on fashion, women and photography. Wallis Annenberg, CEO of the Annenberg Foundation, said of Newton: 'If Newton's work was controversial, I believe it's because he expressed the contradictions within all of us, and particularly within the women he photographed so beautifully: empowerment mixed with vulnerability, sensuality tempered by depravity. 'Newton deepened our understanding of changing gender roles, of the ways in which beauty creates its own kind of power and corruption. 'On top of that, his compositions were brilliantly precise, cinematic in their scope and in their storytelling.' Signature style: The photographer became known for his use of bold lighting, controversial scenarios and striking compositions - he is pictured here in 1981 . Newton, neé Neustädter, was born in Berlin and was of Jewish heritage. In 1938 he was forced to flee the Nazis before the First World War. Finding his way to Australia some years later, he changed his name to Newton and embarked upon the photography career. At the age of 36, he landed his first commission with Vogue, and went on to work with dozens of publications including Playboy. He became known for his use of bold lighting, . controversial scenarios and striking compositions. In his later life, he lived in both Monte Carlo and Los Angeles. He died as a result of a car accident on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood  in 2004, aged 84.",More than 100 of Newton's 'sexy and edgy' prints will be displayed at the Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles from June 29 .

"By . Sophie Borland . GP out-of-hours firms are putting patients at risk by hiring doctors without checking they are competent, according to the NHS watchdog. The Care Quality Commission identified safety concerns at four out of ten organisations which included doctors being allowed to use faulty equipment and ineffective medicines. One firm responsible for the care of 154,000 patients in Essex admitted hiring locum GPs without checking they were competent nor if had a criminal record. The Care Quality Commission identified safety concerns at four out of ten organisations which included doctors being allowed to use faulty equipment and ineffective medicines . Managers at South Essex Emergency Doctors employed medics they knew nothing about and failed to even ask for references from their previous employers. Other firms were found to be putting patients at risk by allowing doctors to use potentially faulty equipment and unsafe medicines. Out-of-hours GP services have been under scrutiny ever since 2008 when pensioner David Gray died at the hands of an incompetent German locum GP Daniel Ubani. Dr Ubani - who was exhausted after flying in for his first shift - prescribed the 70 year old ten times the legal dose of morphine. It later emerged that the out of hours firm, Take Care Now, based in Cambridgeshire, had failed to carry out basic checks on his competence nor ability to speak English before employing him. The CQC is currently inspecting all major out of hours firms in England and this Summer will give each one a rating of ranging from excellent to poor. It has just published the findings of its first round of inspections into ten organisations which found that four were potentially unsafe. Out-of-hours GP services have been under scrutiny ever since 2008 when pensioner David Gray died at the hands of an incompetent German locum GP Daniel Ubani, pictured . They include South Essex Emergency Doctors - based at two centres in Basildon hospital and Thurrock hospital - which hired locums without carrying out criminal records checks nor asking to see references from previous employers. The CQC’s inspection report said there ‘was a risk that unsuitable doctors might be employed by the service to deliver patient care.’ Another, M Doc Limited, which runs out of hours services for 88,000 patients around Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, kept medicines in a faulty fridge meaning they might not work. And the Partnership of East London Co-operative, (PELC), which is responsible for out-of-hours care for 1.1 million patients in East London, allowed GPs to use equipment such as stethoscopes which could be unhygienic and faulty. Inspectors also found the firm was storing medicines in areas where they could be tampered with or potentially stolen by drug addicts. Jamie Reed MP, Labour’s shadow health minister, said: ‘Patients will be concerned to hear about these failings. The reports risk driving even more patients to turn to A&E out of fear, when hospitals have already had their worst year in a decade. ‘This is indisputable proof that NHS services are going downhill on David Cameron’s watch. He wasted billions on a reorganisation that nobody wanted and placed NHS finances on a knife-edge. ‘Under this Government, care problems are becoming more likely, not less. ‘Ministers must get a grip - patients deserve reliable alternatives to A&E.’ But health secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘Inevitably when you impose a more rigorous inspection regime you uncover more problems but it is in the best interests of patients to acknowledge where there is poor care instead of trying to cover it up. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured, said: 'Labour made the disastrous decision to abolish expert led inspections which we have now reversed' ‘Labour made the disastrous decision to abolish expert led inspections which we have now reversed.’ The CQC is currently inspecting 36 major out-of-hours organisations and is due to publish a report on its findings in June. Chief Inspector of General Practice, Professor Steve Field, who is overseeing them said: ‘These inspections mark the first phases in the changes that we are making to inspections of primary medical services, the results of these first inspections show that some services are serving their communities well but others still have some work to do. ‘We’ll take what we have learned from these first inspections to help us develop and improve the process.’","Care Quality Commission found concerns at four out of ten organisations .

"Soaring numbers of over-50s are taking in lodgers to beat loneliness and make extra cash. The number of middle-aged homeowners advertising rooms has increased by 40 per cent over the last two years. Rental website SpareRoom.co.uk said 32,000 people aged 50 and over took in a lodger in 2011, with the number jumping to nearly 45,000 last year. Soaring numbers of over-50s are taking in lodgers to beat loneliness and make extra cash. The number of middle-aged homeowners advertising rooms has increased by 40 per cent over the last two years . These ‘live-in landlords’ can make an average of £466 a month in rent, which can double the income from their State pension, currently worth a maximum of £113.10 a week. And SpareRoom.co.uk said they can also benefit from the Government’s ‘Rent a Room’ scheme, which can earn landlords up to £4,250 a year tax-free from letting out a furnished room or an entire floor. Paul Green of Saga, which provides insurance and holidays for the over 50s, said: ‘There are many older people who have spare rooms because their children have left home. Some people will be doing it for the extra income. For other people, it is nice to have somebody around.’ It also has other perks, such as help to walk or feed pets, he said. Caroline Abrahams, director of charity Age UK, said: ‘We know rising costs and loneliness and isolation are major issues for many older people, and this helps to explain why there has been such a big increase in older people wanting to rent out rooms in their homes.’ Matt Hutchinson, of SpareRoom.co.uk, added: ‘There is far less stigma around taking in lodgers among the older generation, many of whom grew up in the post-war years when lodging was widespread.’ Adrian Morley, 70, a retired wine importer, lives in a four-bedroom house near Croydon,  South London, and started renting out a self-contained flat in his home two years ago. He said: ‘After the death of my wife, I decided against downsizing because I didn’t want the hassle of moving plus I have too many happy memories here. ‘The lodgers I’ve had so far have been friendly and reliable, so I’ve been able to take frequent holidays without fear of anything untoward happening.’","SpareRoom.co.uk said 32,000 over 50s took in a lodger in 2011 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Defence minister Anna Soubry said more had to be done to change the way alcohol is treated by the forces . The army was today ordered to end the booze-fuelled culture of ‘drinking to the point of oblivion’. Defence minister Anna Soubry said binge-drinking in the forces could not be justified as just a form of ‘comraderie’ or ‘letting down of the hair’. She was challenged by a committee of MPs about cheap alcohol on offer to troops, where a triple gin and tonic can cost as little as £1. The forces have long had a drinking culture, with officers viewing it as part of the bonding process between recruits and a way to relive stress from serving on the frontline. But Ms Soubry, a former health minister, said more had to be done to change the way alcohol is treated by the forces, and called for less binge-drinking by serving personnel. It follows high profile cases of debauchery, inappropriate behaviour and allegations of sexual assault fuelled by alcohol. Last week Army recruit Gavin Hope, 22, was fined £300 by the RSPCA for swallowing his pet goldfish as part of the NekNomination drinking game. He filmed himself drinking a pint glass of beer, spirits, a raw egg and some fish food, before downing a glass of water containing the unfortunate fish. The video was uploaded to his Facebook page along with the comment: ‘Not a proper man unless you drink fish.’ Today Ms Soubry insisted was not a ‘killjoy’ and recognised from her time as a barrister that people with stressful jobs needed to let their hair down. But she said the ‘vast amounts’ consumed by the armed forces were unacceptable and must be scaled back. ‘I am not convinced that we couldn't do more about the culture of drinking in our armed forces,’ she said during a hearing of the defence select committee. ‘I'm not some killjoy. But sometimes there has been an attitude in the past that it was acceptable, as part of that de-stressing process, to all go out and consume vast amounts of alcohol as part of that camaraderie and that letting down of the hair. ‘There is nothing wrong with some of that, but the levels of drinking to the point of oblivion and all the rest of it is a culture which I don't welcome in any workforce. ‘The incidence of binge drinking, the quantities of alcohol, across society are beginning to diminish. I would hope that would be the same in the armed forces.’ Swallowed: Gavin Hope and the goldfish Neknomination which lead to him to being brought before Gateshead magistrates court . Ms Soubry suggested that her determination to act had been strengthened by the death of a serving member of the armed forces. ‘I read the coroner's report recently into a very sad suicide case of a serving person. There were many things in that report that concerned me. ‘One of them, quite clearly, the culture of heavy drinking,’ she said. A guide for senior commander on how to deal with alcohol is to be overhauled in the light of research into alcohol abuse in the armed forces which is due to be published soon. But she acknowledged that a cultural shift could not be encouraged purely by rules and regulations. ‘You can't just put out edicts to change a culture,’ she said. ‘You can have all the most wonderful guides and manuals in the world but what's most important is the implementation of them and that is something that I am looking at, I can assure you of that.’ Labour MP Madeleine Moon said ending the ‘high level of subsidy’ enjoyed at military bars would contribute to curbing consumption. She said she got the ‘fright of my life’ when she was charged only GBP1 for a triple gin and tonic while visiting forces in the Falkland Islands two years ago. ‘One thing that could be done about alcohol problems in the armed forces is tackling the high level of subsidy in bars in military units - perhaps so they were the same price you would pay in town.’","Anna Soubry calls for an end to binge-drinking in the armed forces .

"By . Steve Doughty . Couples should be able to get a divorce simply by signing a form at the register office, the country’s most senior family law judge said yesterday. Sir James Munby also backed fault-free divorce, which would mean neither party would have to take legal blame for the breakdown of a marriage. In a radical package of reforms to the laws on divorce and relationships, he said consenting couples should no longer need the approval of a judge to end their marriage. Couple wanting to end their marriage should be able to divorce at a registry office, according to Sir James Munby . Instead their break-up should simply be recorded by a registrar in the same way as births, marriages and deaths. And he said the grounds of adultery and unreasonable behaviour should disappear from the statute book. In . a speech to fellow judges he said: ‘Has the time not come to legislate . to remove all concepts of fault as a basis for divorce and to leave . irretrievable breakdown as the sole ground?’ Sir . James, who as President of the Family Division is the head of the . courts that deal with family break-ups and custody of children, also . called for a cohabitation law to protect women who face ‘the scrapheap’ after parting with a man they have lived with for years but never . married. Such a law would . see live-in couples treated as married people in the eyes of the law . once they have shared a home for a set period of time. Government . advisers have already suggested a live-in couple should be bound by law . after two years if they have  children and five if they do not. But . critics said the proposed divorce and cohabitation laws would be open to . abuse and hard to operate. Sir James also backed fault-free divorce, which would mean that no husband or wife would have to take legal blame for destroying their marriage . After . his speech, Sir James told journalists: ‘There are countries where the . system is that a divorce which is by consent and where there are no . children is treated as an administrative matter dealt with by what, . using our terminology, one might describe as the registrar of births, . deaths, marriages and divorces. It seems to work.’ He . said he ‘would not contemplate it in cases other than cases where there . is consent and cases where there are no children of the family’. Sir . James said the process of deciding where the children of separated . parents should live has already been ‘uncoupled’ from divorce, and he . hoped the system for dividing up goods and setting maintenance payments . could be similarly detached from the legal declaration of the divorce . itself. Current divorce law dates from 1969, when liberal reforms introduced elements of a no-fault system, but said couples must wait for a divorce on grounds of separation alone . He acknowledged that . he has not discussed his plans with ministers, but said his proposals . ‘would make divorce no easier than it is at present’. He . added: ‘All one is doing is actually bringing a bit of intellectual . honesty to the situation and getting rid of an unnecessary process which . simply makes life more complicated.’ Any . changes to divorce law would need parliamentary  legislation to be . drawn up and pushed through by the Justice Secretary. Ministers have . indicated that present Justice Secretary Chris Grayling will not . consider divorce reform before the election. Yesterday, lawyers and family researchers warned that Sir James’s proposals are fraught with risk and difficulty. Patricia . Morgan, author of a study on the collapse of marriage, The Marriage . Files, to be published shortly, said: ‘It would be the end, the . demolition, the abolition of marriage. ‘These ideas would mean an end to any declaration of public commitment by a couple. ‘They . would open the door to the monster state, which would arrange your . affairs and divide your money whether you like it or not.’","Sir James Munby says couples should divorce at a register office .

"By . James Chapman . Court of Appeal Judge Sir Alan Moses (pictured) will head the new Press regulator IPSO, which is replacing the Press Complaints Commission . The judge who presided over the Soham murder trial is to head the new Press regulator being set up in the wake of the Leveson inquiry. Court of Appeal Judge Sir Alan Moses, who was said to have been so enraged by 'sensational and lurid' coverage of the Soham case that he threw a pile of newspapers across the courtroom during a pre-trial hearing, will take up the new position next month. The new Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) has been set up with the backing of most newspaper groups and is expected to be in operation in June, replacing the Press Complaints Commission. Contracts will bind publishers to IPSO and give the regulator tough powers of investigation, enforcement and sanction, including fines of up to £1 million for serious and systemic wrongdoing. Sir Alan, who has been in the Court of Appeal since 2005, and was due to retire in May, said he would aim to strike a balance between protecting the public and the need to encourage freedom of the Press. 'The public and the Press are entitled to a successful system of independent regulation. I recognise it is a big responsibility to achieve this,' he said. 'I believe that such a system should be designed to protect the public against a repetition of the breakdown in standards in some parts of the newspaper industry in recent times. At the same time it should affirm and encourage the vital role of a free and fearless Press.' He said he was determined there would be 'no hesitation in dealing with bad practice by newspapers and providing support and vindication for those who suffer as a result of any future breakdown'. 'This new organisation will have to listen to and learn from the Press and their critics in the period ahead,' he added. 'To those who have voiced doubts as to the ability of IPSO to meet the demands of independent regulation, I say that I have spent over 40 years pursuing the profession of barrister and judge whose hallmarks are independent action and independent judgment. I do not intend to do away with that independence now.' Sir Alan was the unanimous choice of an independent selection panel chaired by Whitehall grandee Sir Hayden Phillips, who led a review of political party funding and was previously permanent secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Judge Moses is said to have been so enraged by coverage of the Soham case that he threw a pile of newspapers across the courtroom during one of Ian Huntley's pre-trial hearings. Pictured here are Huntley's victims, Holly Wells (left) and her best friend, Jessica Chapman, both 10 . Sir Hayden said he believed the judge's reputation for being 'quick, forthright and fearless' meant he was someone 'whom the public can depend to tackle abuses by newspapers where they occur' but also a figure who 'believes firmly in independent self-regulation of the Press and in the vital democratic role of a free Press in a free society'. The new Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said last week that he sees no further role for the Government in the issue of Press regulation. A proposed Royal Charter to oversee press regulation, agreed in a cross-party deal with the Hacked Off lobby group, appears dead in the water, since publishers have refused to sign up. The Government has passed legislation meaning that newspapers that refuse to join a regulator approved under the Royal Charter could be hit with 'exemplary' damages in libel cases. But Mr Javid said: 'The work has been done, and it is now a decision for the Press what they want to do next. I don't see any further role for Government in this. 'Notwithstanding the fact that any industry has its bad apples, I think our Press is the best in the world. It is fearless without favour.' Sir Alan, 68, was appointed as a high court judge in 1996, before joining the Court of Appeal in 2005. Among the trials he has presided over as a judge was the prosecution of MI5 officer David Shayler for passing classified information to the Press in breach of the Official Secrets Act. He was also the prosecutor in the Matrix Churchill trial, when a Customs case against directors of the company accused of selling arms-related equipment to Saddam Hussein collapsed in 1992. Publishers of the Times, Sun, the Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Daily Telegraph, Daily Express, Daily Star and virtually all regional newspapers and magazines have announced that they will sign up to IPSO. The Financial Times has announced that it will instead appoint an editorial complaints commissioner, while the Guardian and the Independent have yet to decide whether to join the new regulator. By GUY ADAMS . Sir Alan was appointed a High Court judge in 1996, and moved up to the Court of Appeal in 2005 . A few years ago, Sir Alan Moses went on Radio Four to discuss trendy proposals to stop some judges wearing wigs and wing collars. If listeners expected a turgid, legalistic conversation about the minutiae of the British court system, they were to be pleasantly surprised. Instead, after the presenter had (somewhat rudely) suggested that judges were widely seen as 'out of touch', Sir Alan hit the proverbial roof. 'It is the most monstrous suggestion, I think,' he declared. 'Is it suggested that if we listened to the Arctic Monkeys rather than listening to the  South Bank Symphonia we would be more in touch? Why? 'Don't even think that we are not [in touch]. Don't even dare to suggest that we are not!' The comments were extraordinarily outspoken by the standards of a senior judge, so ended up being widely reported. In a  career spanning more than four decades, the 68-year-old has built a reputation for having an acute legal mind – and being  unafraid to speak it. 'Alan is nobody's fool, and nobody's patsy,' says one long-standing professional  acquaintance. 'He is often called “outspoken”. What that actually means is that he's independent.' As head of the new Independent  Press Standards Organisation, Sir  Alan will lead a rigorous new watchdog backed by 90 per cent of national  newspapers and a vast majority of the regional press. Supporters of a more draconian form of political regulation, of the kind sought by the celebrity anti-Press lobby group Hacked Off, will doubtless argue that this now makes him a puppet of the newspaper industry. Sir Alan's track record suggests, however, that he is anything but. During a pre-trial hearing for the 2003 Soham murder trial after the killings of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, for example, he is famously said to have been so angered by 'sensational and lurid' reporting of the case  that he threw a stack of newspapers across the courtroom. The previous year he rejected  attempts by David Shayler – a former MI5 agent who passed secret documents to journalists – to defend himself by arguing that he had been acting in the public interest. Instead, Sir Alan found that Shayler, who was jailed for his crime, had displayed 'blinkered arrogance' in breaking the Official Secrets Act. More recently, as flagged by a CV  circulated yesterday, he found against the newspaper industry in two  important – if complex – 2010 and 2011 Appeal Court cases. Sir Alan has often rattled the cage of governments. Only last year, for example, he delivered a damning after-dinner speech describing the Coalition's reforms of legal aid as 'a joke'. In 2008, he described efforts by the Ministry of Defence to ban reporting of alleged abuse of Iraqi civilians by British soldiers as 'barmy'. For a man so unafraid to tangle with the Establishment, Sir Alan has the most blue chip of backgrounds. The son of a barrister, he was raised in Sevenoaks, Kent, and educated at Bryanston (where fees are now £28,000 a year) and University College, Oxford. Called to the Bar in 1968, he worked as junior counsel for the Inland Revenue in the 1980s before acting as prosecutor in the 1992 Matrix Churchill trial, where directors of the machine tools firm were accused of selling arms-related equipment to Saddam Hussein. After that case was abandoned, on Sir Alan's advice, he gave scathing evidence to the subsequent Scott Inquiry into the arms-to-Iraq affair, saying that Whitehall officials had withheld evidence that 'anyone with a basic sense of justice' ought to have disclosed. Despite his outspoken comments, he was appointed a High Court judge in 1996, and moved up to the Court of Appeal in 2005. Were it not for his new appointment – he was chosen from a field of 200 – he would have been due to retire next year. On the personal front, Sir Alan has three grown-up children by his first wife Penny, daughter of Sir David Hopkin (the former metropolitan stipendiary magistrate) whom he divorced in 1984. One of them now works as a deputy production editor on the sports desk of the Guardian. Since 1992, he has been married to Dinah Casson, the daughter of the famous architect and artist Sir Hugh. She is a prominent interior designer who specialises in staging museum and gallery exhibitions. He enjoys hill-walking, has climbed  Ben Nevis, lists as his club the Union Socialista La Serra in Italy and spent six years on the Council of the Royal Academy. The judge also sings in the newly formed Bar Choir.

"By . Vanessa Allen . Andy Coulson, pictured outside the Old Bailey in London during his trial . Andy Coulson would not have been appointed as Conservative Party spin doctor if he had admitted he knew about phone hacking at the News of the World, his trial heard yesterday. The former editor told the hacking trial he doubted the job would have been given to him if he had revealed he knew his newspaper had hacked David Blunkett's messages. Coulson, 46, has told the jury he met David Cameron and George Osborne ahead of his appointment as the Tories’ director of communications in 2007, and that he took on that role at No10 after the 2010 election. He was not asked about what he said during those meetings, but conceded that he was unlikely to have been given the job if his role in the Blunkett expose had been known. Coulson has now admitted he was played voicemails from the then Home Secretary to his married lover, Kimberley Fortier, before the Labour politician was confronted over the affair. He conceded the messages were hacked but denies he was part of a six-year conspiracy of ‘industrial-scale phone hacking’ at the now defunct tabloid. Andrew Edis QC, prosecuting, asked: ‘If what you had done in relation to Blunkett had become public, you would never have got that job, would you?’ Coulson replied: ‘It may be that if I had explained what I have explained to the jury now, the job would not have been offered to me.’ He told the Old Bailey the Blunkett tapes were the ‘first and only’ time he heard hacked messages and denied his role in the affair meant he was part of a ‘cover-up’ at News International. During nine days of evidence he has denied knowing that several of his staff were involved in hacking phones, including journalists Dan Evans, Greg Miskiw and James Weatherup, who have all admitted phone hacking. He also admitted his royal editor Clive Goodman appeared to have accessed the phone records of Prince Harry’s then girlfriend Chelsy Davy while he was at Sandhurst military academy. Goodman . sent Coulson an email claiming the blonde was ‘driving Harry nuts’ by . bombarding him with texts and calls, including 60 calls to the young . royal in one month. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson admitted his royal editor Clive Goodman appeared to have accessed the phone records of Chelsy Davy, pictured right, the former girlfriend of Prince Harry, pictured left, while he was at Sandhurst military academy. File picture . Andy Coulson has said Prime Minister David Cameron, left, may never have hired him as Tory spin doctor if he knew of hacking at News of the World. The former editor has now admitted he was played voicemails from the then Home Secretary David Blunkett, right, to his married lover, Kimberley Fortier, before the Labour politician was confronted over the affair. He wrote: . ‘Chelsy is driving Harry nuts, she won’t leave Harry alone... She’s . blitzing him with dozens of calls and texts when he should be . concentrating on his training. ‘Family likes her well enough but they’re worried that she’s incredibly needy just at the time when Harry needs to be concentrating on himself.’ Coulson said he remembered journalists discussing ‘phone traffic’ and said he should have considered if that meant they were in breach of the Data Protection Act, by accessing mobile phone records, but told the court he had not fully understood the legislation. Coulson, a married father-of-three, denies he was part of a conspiracy to hack phone or corrupt public officials. All seven defendants in the case, including Goodman, 56, deny the charges against them. The trial continues.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ministers were today accused of being so desperate to sell off Royal Mail they were prepared to accept 'any cost'. MPs on the influential Business Select Committee attacked the Government for privatising the company on the cheap - leaving taxpayers more than £1billion out of pocket. But Business Secretary Vince Cable and Business Minister Michael Fallon insisted the sale, last October, had been a success. Tory MP Brian Binley said the claim was 'absolutely Alice In Wonderland'. Business Secretary Vince Cable has come under fire from all sides over his handling of the controversial Royal Mail sell-off . Mr Cable claimed Royal Mail workers were to blame for the low share price - for threatening to go on strike over pay. He said that two weeks of strike action by the Communication Workers Union would have 'wiped out' the company's profits. The Lib Dem minister said: 'One of the key uncertainties was the threat of industrial action. We could have found ourselves selling in significantly worse conditions.' Mr Fallon added: 'It is the one missing piece of this whole story: had we got a pay deal on time, from April 1 last year, and had a settled industrial relations climate, it is wholly possible that we could have achieved a higher price at the sale.' Union chief Billy Hayes attacked the claim and demanded Mr Cable resign or be sacked. He said: 'For Cable and Fallon to continue to claim industrial action was the main reason they sold Royal Mail at a low share price is utterly ridiculous. 'The Committee heard that 'relatively few days had been lost to industrial action'. The shares were 24 times oversubscribed so for the Government to say they wouldn't have been able to get a good deal for the taxpayer is wrong.' Tory minister Michael Fallon (pictured) has defended the privatisation of the Royal Mail - amid growing public anger that taxpayers were left short changed . He accused Mr Cable of being 'completely incapable or downright careless'. Mr Hayes said: 'It's clear Cable needs to go - this is a man who lost the taxpayer a billion pounds. 'A postal worker who lost a valuable item would be sacked and the same standard needs to apply to Mr Cable - he can't carry on as Secretary of State. 'It's beyond belief that the Government see nothing wrong with the sell-off and that shows the fundamental difference between them and Britain.' Mr Fallon told the committee that he stuck by the initial share price at the time of last year's flotation - even though the value of shares soared by 38% on their first day on offer. Mr Cable also claimed that the world economy was in much better shape than it was at the time of the flotation - allowing the company's share price to rise. But the Lib Dem minister accepted that there had been a big surge in the valuation of the company since the government sold it off. Mr Cable said: 'It is true there is a very high level of volatility in the share price.' But he insisted that Royal Mail was 'still a fragile company' whose shares could go up or down. The Committee's chair Adrian Bailey claimed the approach of the Government was to sell the Royal Mail at any cost, with value for money for the taxpayer only a secondary consideration. He added that there was 'robust evidence' that the shares were under-valued. Mr Bailey said: 'The whole approach of the ministers I find quite bizarre in terms of selling something. 'The approach of the department seems to have dwelt on the negative, which if you are selling something - and particularly when that something is a public asset that the public were entitled to get money for - seems, quite frankly, utterly ridiculous.' But Mr Fallon said: 'I don't accept that. It was a successful flotation. 'I have not seen any evidence that the shares were under-valued at the time of the flotation. I stick by the share price.' Tory MP Brian Binley said the level of interest in the shares, which were oversubscribed many times, should have led the Government to consider a higher price. He asked Mr Fallon: 'Are you generally telling me that all of that oversubscription would have fallen away if those shares had been priced at higher than 330p?' But Mr Fallon told him: 'Facebook was oversubscribed by 25 times, it fell 10% on the first day of trading. There is no link between oversubscription and the actual price.' Labour committee member Katy Clark told the ministers: 'You were the custodians of a public asset. The impression that's been given is that you were not going to let anything stand in the way of selling off this asset as soon as possible and anything that might cause delay was just going to be swept aside.' Senior Liberal Democrat minister Vince Cable has faced calls to resign over his handling of the Royal Mail privatisation - but has insisted he has nothing to apologise for . Mr Fallon told her: 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I'm quite confident we got the best price we could at that particular time bearing in mind all the circumstances.' Mr Bailey said: 'That's absolutely Alice In Wonderland. The fact is that you didn't get the best price because on the day of sale the share prices soared. That's just an astonishing assertion.' The minister responded: 'That was on a small number of shares. There is no evidence that people would have paid more than 330p for 600 million shares, whatever they were prepared to pay for a handful of shares on the day.' Labour's Willie Bain said: 'I think the public will be flabbergasted that ministers are happy with the advice that has been tendered given that they have foregone hundreds of millions of pounds as a result of this flawed transaction.' He added: 'No one put the long-term return to the taxpayer first.' Mr Cable insisted: 'We were overwhelmingly concerned with the long-term interests of the taxpayer. That is what drove the whole process.' Royal Mail workers were unhappy with the sell-off - despite receiving free shares from the Government as a sweetener . Mr Fallon added: 'Two years ago we had a loss-making Royal Mail. Today we have one of Britain's top 100 companies, with every prospect of a secure future and able to deliver on a sustainable basis the six-day-a-week service that our constituents rely on. That's a success.' The Business Secretary acknowledged that there were lessons to be learned about the way privatisations were handled, but insisted he had nothing to apologise for over the Royal Mail sell-off. He said: 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but on the basis of the facts we had, the information we had, the knowledge we had of the company, this was a successful transaction. 'We don't apologise for it and don't regret it.' He added: 'The lesson to be learned from this whole exercise is 'is this the best system for getting the maximum value for taxpayer assets?' 'We accept the need to look at different methods and I suspect we may come back to the conclusion that the IPO route was the only one that made any sense.' When the Royal Mail floated last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was looking for long-term stability from ‘the right kind of investor community’. As a result, 16 of the City’s investment giants were singled out from the 796 which wanted to buy shares and given favoured status. This group was awarded a much larger tranche of shares – about £46million worth each – while 506 received nothing and the rest between £600,000 and £6million worth. But few of the ‘priority’ investors – believed to include Legal & General, Threadneedle, BlackRock, and Fidelity – have been as long-term in their approach as Mr Cable had hoped. The NAO said: ‘Almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within weeks.’ In one example, Standard Life bought nearly 12million shares in October, but now owns just 118,480. On the first day of trading last year, Royal Mail's shares closed at 455p, 38 per cent higher than their sale price. This meant the shares were £750 million higher on their first day of trading than the government sold them for. The National Audit Office said Mr Cable's department took a 'cautious' approach to a number of issues, which led to shares being priced at a level 'substantially below' the initial trading price. The Government could have kept 110 million more shares, worth £363 million at the 330p offer price, while still privatising the business, the NAO report said. Today's committee hearing follows a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee yesterday at which a city regulator said the spike in the share price of Royal Mail on the day of privatisation was at the 'top end' of what would be expected when a firm floated - but insisted there was no need to launch an inquiry into the sale. Financial Conduct Authority chief executive Martin Wheatley said there was nothing to suggest a failure of regulation about the way the shares were sold. He told the MPs: 'If you wanted to look at where the failure was, the failure was in the pricing decision, not in the regulation.' Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge called for an inquiry into whether investment banks involved in the sale had properly followed the rules preventing them sharing information with their asset management arms, which were allocated Royal Mail shares. The NAO report said that of the seven investment banks in the syndicate that advised the Government on the sell-off, at least five were given shares on behalf of their asset management arms for distribution to their clients.","Business Secretary Vince Cable defends privatisation to MPs .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Elsa Carneau, 25, was found face down in the swimming pool at Virgin Active in Kensington, West London . A former model who behaved in a 'bizarre' way before being found lying unconscious in a top-of-the-range health club swimming pool had been admitted to hospital twice that week after drinking too much alcohol, an inquest has heard. City worker Elsa Carneau, a French . national described as ‘very thin’ and ‘fragile' by one witness, was discovered face down in the water at Virgin Active in Kensington, London, on December 2011. The . inquest heard today how Miss Carneau, who had a history of fainting and alcohol problems, had collapsed twice in the days leading up to the tragedy. She also passed out several times at work because of drinking too much, the inquest heard. Two empty bottles of vodka were found in Miss Carneau's locker and post-mortem results showed she was more than twice over the legal drink-drive limit, the jury was told. Pathologist Dr Simon Poole, who gave the . cause of death as drowning, told the jury there was a smell of alcohol . around Miss Carneau's body and that her liver was inflamed, which is in . line with chronic alcohol dependency. She also had traces of valium in her bloodstream, a tranquiliser also known as diazepam. The inquest had previously heard from a swimmer who chatted between lengths with Miss Carneau and described her as 'euphoric'. She had been making 'bizarre' and 'strange' remarks, the jury had been told. But the inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court, which is being held at the High Court in London, heard how efforts made to revive Miss Carneau, who worked as an analyst, were hindered by one worker who . filmed the unfolding drama. Firefighter Ben Young told the inquest that a worker pulled out his mobile to record the scene as the swimmer lay dying in the water. When Mr Young asked what he was doing, the worker - who has not been identified in court - replied it would be 'something to remember this by if she survived', the inquest was told. Firefighters and paramedics tried to revive Miss Carneau for almost one hour after running to the scene from a nearby fire station, but she was pronounced dead after being taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Mr Young said he noticed the worker filming the scene at the Richard Branson-owned health club when his team were carrying out CPR. He said: 'He identified himself as staff. He had his mobile phone out filming, I grabbed the phone. An inquest into the death of the former model heard she had been admitted to hospital twice that week, after collapsing due to excess alcohol . Miss Carneau was found unconscious in this pool at the Virgin Active club in Kensington . 'He became quite aggressive and said I couldn't do that. I deleted the film. I said 'what are you doing?'. 'He said 'If she makes it she has something to remember this by' which I was quite astounded by. 'When I said I was impounding the phone he said 'you can't take my phone'. I found the video and deleted it.' Brian O'Keeffe, watch manager at the Kensington fire station, said he asked Mr Young to take the phone off the man after the bright lights from the device distracted him. He said: 'I was doing compressions and noticed a flash or bright light. I looked up and there was a member of staff filming us on his mobile phone. 'It was a distraction and in my opinion illegal to interfere with the emergency services in this way. 'I asked him to stop and he didn't - he continued and I asked a member of my staff to get him to stop which he did. 'Firefighter Young took the phone, deleted the image and gave it back to him.' The jury at Westminster Coroner's Court heard how a member of staff at the gym allegedly filmed her on his mobile phone as she lay unconscious . Paramedic Wendy King also told the inquest she noticed the man filming from the bridge above the pool and found it 'absolutely despicable'. But she told coroner Kevin McLoughlin that she would not be able to recognise the person. Today's session also heard from toxicologist Professor Atholl Johnston, who said there had been 181 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of Miss Carneau's blood. The legal limit is 80mg. He said: ‘The alcohol had been taken quite recently and . it takes some time before he alcohol gets into the urine. ‘The levels in her blood were higher than in the urine which suggests she drank acutely and died soon after.’ Two empty vodka bottles were found in Miss Carneau's locker and the inquest heard her blood reading was twice over the legal drink-drive limit . The jury heard Miss Carneau also weighed just 8st 11lbs and had a Body Mass Index . (BMI) of 17.5. The recommended minimum BMI figure is 18.5. One witness, gym member Lily Ho, described her as ‘very thin’ and ‘fragile’ looking. Dr Poole gave the cause of death as drowning, saying Miss Carneau's lungs were water-logged. But he said the autopsy did not show what specifically caused Miss Carneau to drown. He . said the swimmer could have fainted in the pool, but there were no . physical signs to prove that. During the hearing, Dominic Kay, who represents Virgin Active in the inquest, said Miss . Carneau was admitted to hospital twice that week after she collapsed from alcohol . abuse. She also passed out several times at work because of drinking too much, he said. The inquest also heard concerns from firefighter Mr O'Keeffe about the methods used to try and revive Miss Carneau and the way staff handled the situation. Mr O'Keeffe told the jury that members of the public who should not have been there at the time were either unaware of what was happening, or watching. He also said the club's lead first aider Natalia Roman was not using the defibrillator 'competently', a concern which he reported to the fire service after the incident and said could have affected Miss Carneau's chance of survival. He said: 'When I first went to the poolside there were a lot of people in the area and the same man who was filming became aggressive when I asked him to leave. 'He told me he was a member of staff. He just seemed to be looking in fascination at what was unfolding, he was transfixed by it. His reaction when I asked him to leave was quite disturbing.' Mr O'Keeffe also believes the firefighters could have been called to the scene earlier, saying the health centre staff were 'overwhelmed' by the 'emotional situation'. In a statement read at the inquest, Miss Roman said she rushed to the poolside after hearing the panic alarm. She said: . 'I removed vomit from her face and rolled her so she could vomit then . checked her airway to see if she was breathing. I noticed her stomach . muscles in spasm.' Veronique Carneau (left front) and Pierre Carneau (right), the parents of Miss Carneau, leaving the inquest into their daughter's death . Another . witness, fitness instructor Amy Johnson, said she and other staff . members were sent to break into a number of lockers to find out Miss . Carneau's identity after the hospital phoned asking for details. It was there that they found a beige . handbag containing ID and clothing, as well as ten Marlboro cigarettes . and two small empty alcohol bottles. Yesterday, the jury heard how Miss Carneau had made a series of ‘bizarre’ and ‘strange’ remarks to swimmers before the incident, including that she swam underwater as she found it peaceful. Rupert Hill, 46, who works in finance in . the City and was a member of the gym, said he had several conversations with Miss Carneau between lengths of the pool. He later noticed Miss Carneau lying underwater, seemingly holding her breath. When she did not surface for around a minute, he pulled her out of the water and onto the side and first aiders were called. He said: ‘She seemed extremely exuberant in the way she was speaking. She made a couple of comments that were slightly strange.' The jury was also shown CCTV footage of Miss Carneau getting in the pool in a red swimming costume at around 6pm on Saturday December 3, 2011. She swam 23 lengths of the small pool, before getting out of the pool for 30 seconds, and then returning to swim two more lengths. Paramedic Ms King said the ambulance staff did everything they could to try and save Miss Carneau, including intubating her. She said: ‘It was a very difficult physical situation. There was so much water about which we were trying to clear but it was refilling all the time. ‘With all that and having to stop to shock the patient (with a defibrillator) it became a difficult thing to achieve.’ The inquest continues.","Elsa Carneau, 25, found face down in water in West Kensington, London .

"By . Katie Nicholl . and Jo Knowsley . It is a picture of elegance  and decorum: a group whose members are at ease in the most exclusive dining rooms and salons of the capital. Yet behind the smiles of  these society figures lie tensions and rivalries which will be exposed on a new reality show, dubbed ‘the biggest celebrity catfight ever caught on camera’. It will be screened this summer. Even posher than Made In Chelsea, Ladies of London is supposed to be a compelling account of the lives of established – and very glamorous – businesswomen as they manoeuvre their way around the social circuit.

Her clipped accent and polished appearance irritate cast members, who brand her ‘Miss Perfect’. She falls out with fellow participant and former best friend, American former glamour model Caprice Bourret, but is unrepentant. ‘Two cultures. One city,’ she remarks snootily.

"By . Tara Brady . Gas company officials said they shut off supplies after sending a final demand to Nawaz Sharif's office for arrears . The Pakistan president's home is one of 18 government buildings to have electricity cut off because of unpaid energy bills. Gas company officials said they shut off supplies on Sunday evening after sending a final demand to Nawaz Sharif's office for arrears of more than £28,000. Pakistan’s power ministry said today it would cut off supplies to major offices, including the prime minister’s in a crackdown on customers not paying their electricity bills. Pakistan’s economy is crippled by persistent blackouts lasting up to 12 hours a day partly because influential families, politicians and bureaucrats do not pay for their use while the poor often cannot afford rising utility bills. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif promised to fix the power cuts as one of his priorities. But today Pakistan’s minister of state for water and power said the campaign to eradicate non-payment would now target his own office. 'Electricity to all state institutions and individual consumers who haven’t cleared their dues will be disconnected,' Abid Sher Ali said in televised remarks. 'There will be no discrimination.' The minister, who is from the ruling party, said he had ordered the Islamabad Electricity Supply Company to disconnect power to the President House, Prime Minister’s Secretariat, the parliament building, the official residence of the chief justice and many other offices. There was no immediate comment from those affected. A spokesman for Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited said the prime minister’s residence and a string of other government buildings were cut off over bills totalling almost £100,000. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif promised to fix the power cuts as one of his priorities . Power cuts have worsened in Pakistan in recent years, becoming one of the main sources of discontent in the South Asian country, often leaving entire neighbourhoods without power for up to half a day in the sweltering summer months. Pakistan’s state power companies are notoriously inefficient but critics have long questioned just how far Sharif will be prepared to go to overhaul an important sector dominated by decades-long alliances, industry loyalties and lobby groups. Targeting government offices as part of the campaign would send a powerful message to ordinary people in Pakistan that Sharif is serious about reform and that no one would be spared in his campaign against non-payment of bills.","Final demand for arrears of more than £28,000 sent to Nawaz Sharif's office .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A cruel dog owner in Croatia paid a canine 'hitman' to kill his unwanted pet, because he was too tight-fisted to have the animal disposed of humanely. The owner, who has not been identified, paid just £4 to have the dog shot and thrown into a river, rather than paying £30 to have a vet euthanise the healthy animal. But the dog - formerly called Olly but now nicknamed Lucky - somehow survived both the shotgun blast and the plunge into icy water. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Olly the dog was left for dead when his cruel owner paid a 'hitman' just £4 to have him executed and dumped in a river. However the pet survived and is now recovering at an animal shelter (right) Olly's owner, who has not been identified, aid the hitman because he was too tight-fisted to fork out £30 to have a vet destroy the healthy animal humanely . After being blasted with buckshot Olly, who had been nicknamed Lucky, was left in an icy river to drown . The dog's limp body was spotted floating down the river by fishermen who took him to a local shelter . He was shot on the banks of the Drava River near the northern Croatian village of Orehovec, and then hurled into the water by his would-be killer. Fortunately for Lucky, he was spotted as he floated downstream by some fishermen. 'My son saw him,' said Pawel Brodzky. 'He was floating like a log past us and suddenly his front leg moved, as if he was waving at us. Olly's attacker was caught after fishermen who spotted his body saw a man loading a shotgun into a car . The would-be killer is now facing court as animal workers believe he is behind a string of canine executions . Olly will now spend the rest of his days at the centre unless another owner comes forward to adopt him . 'We pulled the poor creature from the water and took him to a local animal shelter, where he was said to be in poor shape but strong enough to survive.' Brodzky got the number plate of a hunter further down the river after he saw the assassin putting a gun in the boot of his car. Animal welfare workers believe the same hunter also shot several other dogs in the past. He now faces up to a year in jail on animal cruelty charges. Horrifying images of Olly's injuries show he was riddled with buckshot when he arrived at the animal shelter . Surgeons spent hours removing shot from Olly's head and legs. He is expected to recover in two months . Olly's attacker could be facing a year behind bars if he is found guilty of animal cruelty charges . Lucky will now live out his days in an animal shelter unless he is adopted. He needed surgery for head and leg wounds from the buckshot but should be up and about within two months.","Croatian dog-owner paid just £4 to have pet Olly shot and dumped in river .

"By . James Rush . A Cambodian man was beaten and stoned to death by a mob of about 600 people after they accused him of sorcery, according to reports. Pov Sovann, 36, was accused by villagers of killing several elderly people over the past two years through sorcery, police have said. He was killed during a six hour attack as a group, initially of about 200, in a village in the Bati district of Takeo Province, southern Cambodia, was joined by hundreds of others from nearby areas. A 36-year-old man in Cambodia was stoned and beaten to death by a mob of about 600 people after he was accused of sorcery (file picture) Officers have said they were unable to stop the mob as they attacked the man, The Cambodia Daily has reported. Police believe the death of a 54-year-old woman sparked the attack. Bati district penal police Khut Lo told the paper: 'My police could not do anything because there were many people who carried stones and clubs and were very violent.' District police chief Ngann Sary said an ambulance was also forced to turn back by the mob. He said villagers believed seven people, mostly believed to be elderly, had died without being diagnosed with any diseases, over the last two years. He said villagers blamed Mr Sovann, who had practised traditional healing for a number of years. Pov Sovann was killed during the attack in a village in the Bati district of Takeo Province, southern Cambodia . It is not uncommon for people accused of being a sorcerer to be harassed and killed in rural areas of Cambodia. In January, The Sydney Morning Herald reported a Cambodia man was decapitated by villagers after being accused of sorcery. The 55-year-old victim was attacked by people armed with axes while villagers celebrated a rice harvest ceremony nearby, police said. Som Chantha, district police chief in the southern province of Kampong Speu, said: 'He had some magic powers and some people accused him of practising black magic.'","Police say officers were unable to stop the mob as they attacked 36-year-old .

Henwood, of Enfield, north London, made the comment on Twitter in . response to a speech by Henry in which he said ethnic minorities were . under-represented on British TV. The resignation comes as Ukip today launched a purge of extremist members with Nigel Farage launching a fightback against claims his supporters are racist. Scroll down for video . William Henwood, pictured left, has resigned his Ukip membership after making comments about Lenny Henry, right. The comments came after the comedian made a speech in which he said ethnic minorities were under-represented on British television . Nigel Farage today launched a fightback against claims Ukip supporters are racist as he accused his rivals of 'slinging mud' On a campaign visit in Slough, the Ukip leader accused his critics of slinging mud at people who have concerns about immigration . One man has been suspended for being a . member of the far-right British National Party while a second was . discovered to have been a donor to the Engilish Defence League. William Henwood, a Ukip member who told comedian Lenny Henry to 'emigrate to a black country', has now agreed to leave the party. A Ukip spokesman said Mr Henwood had . resigned his membership of Ukip after it was 'mutually agreed this would . be the best course'. Ukip is expected to win elections to the European Parliament on May 22, which Mr Farage predicts will trigger a ‘political earthquake’ in Westminster. But his £1.5million campaign has been dogged by claims it is racist and features actors and party employees as ordinary members of the public. Mr Farage claimed attempts to portray Ukip as racist will prove a 'disastrous mistake' for the established political parties. But today it emerged the party has been forced to suspend two members with far-right links. A spokesman said: 'UKIP is a non-racist, non-sectarian party and we are determined to uphold those values. 'Part of that process is maintaining vigilance against the possibility of infiltration either on an organised or individual basis by those who do not subscribe to our values.' The men have not been identified by the party as they still have the right of an appeal in writing to Ukip's national executive committee. William Henwood, a Ukip candidate in Enfield, north London, tonight resigned from the party. It followed a row over a tweet he sent about Lenny Henry . saying: ‘He should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live . with whites.’ A UKIP Spokesman said: 'Mr Henwood's remarks about Lenny Henry caused enormous offence and UKIP MEP candidate for the West Midlands Bill Etheridge spoke for many in the party with his strong condemnation.' Former Labour immigration minister Barbara Roche today launched a cross-party campaign to condemn Ukip as racist. ‘Ukip's campaign needs to be exposed for what it is, a racist campaign,’ she told The Guardian. ‘The party is practicing what is in effect a form of ‘Euracism’.’ The Migration Matters campaign has been co-sponsored by senior Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi and Lib Dem peer Lord Dholakia. But . on the campaign trail in Slough today, Mr Farage hit back and accused . his opponents of use ‘discrgraceful slurs’ against the British people. He . said: ‘I am really sorry that millions of people who have decided to . vote UKIP next month now find themselves accused by the political . establishment of supporting racism.’ Ukip is expected to win the European elections on May 22, despite rows over racism . A new poll shows how Ukip's support is highest in England . A Ukip MEP has defended saying it is OK to dislike gay people. Roger Helmer said the choice was like having a favourite cup of tea. He told The Sun: 'Different people have differenttastes. You may tell me you don’t like Earl Grey tea. 'That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don’t like it.' He was defending comments made as Tory in 2000 when he said people find homosexuality 'distasteful if not viscerally repugnant'. He likened it to the moment Labour leader Gordon Brown dismissed pensioner Gillian Duffy as a ‘bigoted woman’ during the 2010 election after she voiced cocnerns about immigration. ‘This time it is not merely one person being slandered by one establishment party but huge numbers of decent British people under attack and all three Westminster parties levelling the charge of racism and bigotry. ‘When UKIP was perceived mainly as a threat to the Conservative Party, it was David Cameron and his colleagues who used this tactic. Now we are recognised as a threat to the entire establishment it is all three parties that are slinging mud. ‘The electorate is not in the mood to be intimidated by the political establishment and Messrs Cameron, Miliband and Clegg have just made another disastrous mistake. ‘I call on all fair-minded British people to swing behind UKIP and teach these creeps a lesson they won't forget in a hurry.' Jacqui SMith, the former Labour Home Secretary, also questioned the anti-Ukip campaign. 'I am not convinced that condemning the many voters thinking of voting Ukip as stupid racists is a good electoral strategy, she wrote for Progress. It comes as a new survey showed Ukip’s appeal is much stronger in England than it is in Scotland or Wales. The research suggested that in England, Ukip is challenging Labour for first place in the European Parliament elections on May 22. Prospective Ukip councillor William Henwood, . left, agreed to quit the party after posting a tweet saying Lenny Henry should 'emigrate to a black country' Mr Farage likened the attack on Ukip to the moment Labour leader Gordon Brown called pensioner Gillian Duffy a 'bigoted woman' after she raised concerns about immigration during the 2010 election campaign . A survey found 29 per cent of people in England intend voting for Nigel Farage's party, just behind the 30 per cent set to back Labour. A total of 22 per cent said they would vote for the Conservatives, while 11 per cent said they would be voting Liberal Democrat. But in Scotland, only one in 10 of those surveyed said they would be voting Ukip, compared with the 33 per cent who plan to vote SNP and the 31 per cent who said they would back Labour. Scottish support for the Tories in the European elections was put at 12 per cent, while for the Liberal Democrats it was 7 per cent. In Wales, support for Labour was almost twice the level of support for Ukip, with the survey suggesting 39 per cent of voters would back Ed Miliband's party compared with the 20 per cent who said they would vote Ukip. A total of 18 per cent of Welsh voters who were surveyed plan to vote Tory, with 11 per cent backing Plaid Cymru and 7 per cent supporting the Liberal Democrats. Within England, Ukip support was found to be stronger among those who identified themselves as being English rather than British.","William Henwood has resigned his membership of the party after Twitter comment .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . For many, the prospect of yet another coffee shop opening on the local high street is enough to keep them awake at night. Others, however, welcome any chance to feed their caffeine addiction – and the big coffee companies are only too happy to oblige. British-owned Costa is opening shops across the country at the rate of three a week, it emerged yesterday. Perks: Costa is opening UK outlets at the rate of three a week as it taps into a growing coffee shop culture and a backlash against US rival Starbucks . Caffeine rush: Many high streets appear to have hit saturation point in terms of the big chain coffee shops, however Costa insists there is room for hundreds more . It already has 1,755 outlets nationwide and plans to add another 150 this year, taking it towards a target of 2,200 by 2018. The chain, part of the Whitbread group, has become so successful that is has now exporting its format from Paris to Beijing. It has around 1,000 coffee shops overseas, including 326 in China, with plans for many more. Traditionally, . coffee shops have been busiest around lunchtime and in the early . afternoon as workers take a break from their desks, however Costa has . built its success on extending the trading day. PUGH CARTOON PG 3.jpg . Last . year it introduced a new breakfast range, including all-day-breakfast . rolls and hot buttered toast, for workers who do not have time to eat . before leaving home. The . firm has also extended its reach with thousands of Costa Express . machines in hospitals, universities, supermarkets and offices. Last night Whitbread chief executive Andy Harrison denied the high street had reached coffee shop saturation point. He . suggested that the chain’s outlets have become a destination point for . socialising, much like Central Perk, the famous coffee shop in the US . comedy series Friends. ‘The . market is growing and we are benefiting from the move to online . retailing where people are spending less time shopping and more time . enjoying themselves in Costa,’ he said. Globally, . the chain sold 400million drinks in the year to February 27 with total . takings up some 19.4 per cent to £1.2billion. Underlying operating . profits grew by 21.9 per cent to £109.8million. The . chain overtook Starbucks in terms of the number of coffee shops on .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Presenter Susanna Reid drew just over half of the audience of her old BBC colleagues when she launched ITV’s new breakfast show, Good Morning Britain, according to overnight figures. The programme, which began broadcasting yesterday, had an average audience of 800,000 viewers while Reid’s old show, BBC Breakfast, pulled in 1.5million. The launch of GMB was also markedly down on the first-morning figure for its predecessor, Daybreak, which pulled in one million viewers when it began in 2010. Scroll down for video . Sofa so good: There was initial criticism that Ms Reid spent too much time behind the show's desk, with her acclaimed legs hidden from view . Not feeling so blue: Susanna Reid was beaming during day two of her Good Morning Britain career . ITV chiefs can draw some comfort from the new show proving more popular than the audience levels of around 600,000, which axed Daybreak had recently been achieving in recent months. Yesterday’s Good Morning Britain launch peaked at 1.2million viewers. But its distance behind BBC Breakfast is marked, and even more so when analysing . audience reach, which adds up the total number of people watching at any . time during the broadcast for at least three minutes. For BBC Breakfast, the reach is 6.81million, for Good Morning Britain it's 3.08million. On Daybreak, which ended last week, it was 2.32million. In terms of audience share, Breakfast got 35 per cent of viewers yesterday and Good Morning Britain 18 per cent. What's more, Breakfast's peak number of viewers on the day Good Morning Britain launched was higher than its peak the previous Monday. Reid was the big signing to launch the new show after being lured from the BBC, where she had proved to be a popular figure. Her profile increased hugely late last year in the wake of her appearances on last year’s Strictly Come Dancing. Reid - who wore a dazzling red dress for launch day - has been joined on the weekday ITV show by Ben Shephard, Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher. For viewers, one of the biggest changes to predecessor Daybreak - along with the presenting team - was the introduction of a glass desk at which the hosts were seated for much of the show, although they moved to sofas later in the show. Twitter storm: Many people took to social media sites to voice their discontent about Good Morning Britain looking similar to Good Morning America . Many observers have interpreted the discussions around the desk as more of a US-style approach, taking its cue from ABC’s popular Good Morning America. Viewers were divided on the show, with some lamenting the passing of its predecessor while others praised its fast pace and gloss. The programme also featured Andi Peters presenting a regular ‘Wheel Of Cash’ competition slot from a different location each day, inviting the public to win prizes. The big reveal: Susanna later moved and showed off her legs in her knee-length dress . Smiles better: Reid and Shephard laugh together on the sofa during the debut Good Morning Britain show . Teamwork: Reid with co-presenters Sean Fletcher, Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins . Helen Warner, ITV’s director of daytime, was pleased with the performance and said: ‘The launch was a fantastic team effort, and we are focused on building a strong breakfast brand going forward.’ Media commentator Steve Hewlett believes it stands a fighting chance of succeeding, not least because of its poaching of Ms Reid from Breakfast. He told MailOnline: 'This is a major throw of the dice - there's a new production team and new presenters. It's a major move, but on paper it stands every chance of working. Susanna Reid is a great booking. 'The question is whether Good Morning Britain gets to know its audience and whether it gets the right tone.' Mr Hewlett said that arrogance was the cause of Daybreak's failure. He said: 'With Daybreak corporate hubris took over at ITV. In one fell swoop they demonstrated everything that can go wrong in one show. They hired Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley, an amazing partnership on The One Show, but transplanting chemistry from one place to another is very hard to do.' He added: 'It would be really good, not least for the BBC, if ITV manage to make a success of Good Morning Britain, because if it gets traction the BBC will be forced to react. Not having competition is not good for the viewer.' Dawn arrival: Ms Reid pictured turning up to the ITV studios on Tuesday, carrying a large bag and the papers . Ms Reid’s ITV debut initially drew mixed reactions, with criticism that the show looked too similar to its U.S counterpart and that Ms Reid’s figure was obscured by a desk. As the show began viewers took to Twitter to complain that the legs of the 43-year-old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £400,000 and as much as £1million a year - were hidden from view. One viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage #gmb.' Another wrote: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.' Co-presenters: Ben Shephard, left, and Charlotte Hawkins, right, who joined ITV from Sky . The dismay was short-lived, though, as Ms Reid, dressed in a knee-length red dress, soon moved to a sofa. Speaking recently about the desk and the new set of the show, Susanna said: 'Our set is different, fresh and it's not what people have been used to over the last couple of years in breakfast television. 'It is something new and exciting for us. We all start behind the desk, which hasn't happened for a while.' Sky News anchor Kay Burley told MailOnline that she found the show too frantic. The presenter, who was a reporter on Good Morning Britain's distant cousin, TV-am, in 1985, said: ‘The show itself is just too busy for me at the moment but I'm sure it'll settle down after a couple of weeks. ‘Breakfast viewers just need to know that the world is still turning, they can get to work on time and what the weather is doing...'But she added: ‘I love Susanna. I think she has all the ingredients a great presenter needs. Smart, presentable, serious when she needs to be and fun when she doesn't.’","Good Morning Britain had an average of 800,000 viewers on its debut .

"By . Jason Groves . Ministers splurged almost £100million a day on foreign aid in December in a frantic bid to hit David Cameron’s controversial spending target, a report claims. The Commons International Development Committee warns today that vast sums appear to have been ‘rushed out at the end of the year’ to meet the target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s total income on foreign aid. The committee says it is astonishing that the Department for International Development (DfID) spent a quarter of its total budget in one month and calls on ministers to show that the spending was ‘rational and cost-effective’. Spending: Ministers splurged almost £100million a day on foreign aid in December in a frantic bid to hit David Cameron¿s controversial spending target, a report claims . Support: The report also accuses ministers of spending too much on 'middle income' countries such as Nigeria, Pakistan (pictured) and India . The report also accuses ministers of spending too much on ‘middle income’ countries such as Nigeria, Pakistan and India, which have the resources to help themselves, rather than focusing aid on the world’s poorest. MPs in the committee also warned that Britain is shouldering too much of the burden of cleaning up global humanitarian disasters. Britain’s spending on Syria, for example, has hit £600million, compared to just £10million spent by France. Aid spending averaged £560million a month for the first ten months of last year. It then doubled in November to more than £1.1billion, before soaring to £2.6billion in December as the deadline for hitting the target neared. Cost: Britain's spending on Syria, for example, has hit £600million, compared to just £10million spent by France . Britain’s foreign aid spend is now more . than double the G8 average. The US spends 0.19 per cent of its total . income on foreign aid, for France it is 0.45 per cent and Italy is at . just 0.13 per cent. Last night, a DfID spokesman denied it had struggled to spend its budget, saying the high spending in December resulted mainly from ‘several long-planned annual contributions to agencies like the World Bank and EU’. The spokesman added: ‘DfID constantly assesses where UK aid has the biggest impact to ensure it helps those who really need it.’ Britain spent £11.4billion on foreign aid last year.","Commons International Development Committee warns sums appear to have been 'rushed out at the end of the year'

The effect of that summer’s day in 1966 was so terrifying that it would be the last time the 31-year-old housewife ventured outdoors for nearly half a century. Proud: Patricia Cooper with grandson Kevin, left, and pictured right at the height of her agoraphobia with her daughter Sally, who's now 30 . In all that time, mother-of-two Mrs . Cooper never went more than a few yards from her front door, never . walked her children to school or took her grandchildren out and could . not even go shopping. Imprisoned . by agoraphobia and in dread of what might happen if it struck her . again, she kept in touch with her family by telephone – or, in recent . years, the internet. Meanwhile, . outside her Darlington home, the world was transformed by the rise in . the number of cars, the ease of foreign travel and the decline of the . high street. That passed Mrs . Cooper by, until  her 26-year-old grandson Kevin Nicholson was awarded . the British Empire Medal. Mrs Cooper was so proud that she summoned the . courage to be outdoors for the first time since that August day 48 years . ago. Fear factor: Mrs Cooper said that seeing her grandson receive the award was 'terrifying, but worth' Connected: Mrs Cooper says that she keeps in touch with family and friends using Facebook . Agoraphobia is 'a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult, or help wouldn't be available if things went wrong', according to the NHS website. The site explains that it's often thought that the condition is a fear of open spaces, but it's not quite as straightforward as that, with some sufferers also fearing public transport and shopping centres. When agoraphobics are exposed to their fears several symptoms can sweep over them, including a feeling of nausea, rapid heartbeat and breathing, nausea and rising temperature. The cause of agoraphobia can vary from person to person, with some people developing a fear of a certain situation or place because they experienced a panic attack there and then try to avoid it. Others may develop the condition through a fear of crime or being involved in an accident. Treatments may involve counselling, relaxation training or taking antidepressants. NHS Direct says: 'In the UK, up to two people in 100 have a panic disorder and it is . thought around a third of those will go on to develop agoraphobia as a . result.' Source: NHS Direct . In an almost . clandestine operation to get to the presentation ceremony last week, she . was ushered into a car that drew up at her door, driven for a few . minutes to the venue and introduced to the Lord Lieutenant of County . Durham and the town mayor after they presented the medal to Mr Nicholson . for his services to a local community centre. Then she sat in a garden . for a time with him – and went back indoors again. Yesterday . she told the Mail: ‘It was really scary but I’m glad I did it. Kevin . didn’t have any idea I’d be there and he was thrilled. I’m glad I stayed . to watch the ceremony but the only thing I really wanted to do was get . back home.’ Mrs Cooper, now . a 78-year-old great-grandmother, told how her self-imposed confinement . began as she walked to her local post office. She was swept by an unexplained feeling of panic. Voices around her suddenly became distant and everything went hazy. ‘I . was rooted to the spot,’ she said. ‘I actually thought I was going to . die. The only thing I knew I needed to do was get home as soon as I . could. I shut the door... and I didn’t answer it again for the next . three years. I can’t explain it, but I just couldn’t face going out . again.’ Mrs Cooper, already . divorced from husband Brendon, was told electric shock treatment would . cure her but she refused. Instead she became a recluse. Neighbours did . her shopping and her mother helped her to raise daughter Sandra, now 48, . and son John, 50. She has lived every day in terror of injuring herself . and needing treatment. ‘If I had to be rushed to hospital the . experience would probably kill me,’ she said. ‘I just wouldn’t go. It’s a . terrible feeling. You just can’t control it.’ Here are some of the things Patricia Cooper has missed since developing agoraphobia . Although . she has been smuggled to her children’s homes for the occasional . Christmas or Mother’s Day, she had not spent time outside for five . decades until last week, when she was collected from the care home where . she has spent the last seven years. Of . the short drive to the ceremony, she said: ‘There are cars and . motorbikes everywhere and everyone seems to drive like Evel Knievel.’ Yet indoors she has easily embraced new technology – she uses an iPad, has a Facebook page and shops online. Her biggest regret is that agoraphobia robbed her of the chance to spend more time with her family. What . would she do now if she could lead a normal life outside? ‘Go to the . tulip gardens in Amsterdam... visit Disneyland... go to where my . grandmother was born in County Cork... spend lots more time seeing my . family... it’s the simple things you miss out on,’  she said. There is one thing she hasn’t missed since 1966, however: England winning the World Cup again.","Patricia Cooper, from Darlington, became agoraphobic back in 1967 .

"By . Amanda Williams . Police and firefighters were called to the rescue when ten little ducklings fell down a drain. The tiny birds were following their mother along the busy road in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire when they fell one by one through the grating in the road. A passerby heard their calls and raised the alarm and the emergency services dashed to the scene. A team of police and firefighters rescued ten little ducklings when they fell down a drain . The tiny wildfowl were following their mother along the busy road in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire when they fell one by one through the grating . Police made the area safe from oncoming traffic, and a member of the firecrew lifted the heavy grid and gently lifted the ducklings one by one into a cardboard box. It is not clear where their mother is, but Cambridgeshire Fire Service said all the birds were fine and had since released 'to a safe location in the wild'. A spokeswoman said: 'We were called by police to this incident where a number of small ducklings had become trapped in a drain. 'We were happy to help rescue the ducklings and return them to the wild. Cambridgeshire Fire Service said all the birds were fine and had since been released 'to a safe location in the wild' 'We would much rather be called to an incident where an animal is trapped rather than see a member of the public potentially put themselves in danger trying to rescue an animal.' In October, a puppy had a lucky escape after fire crews were called to lift her to safety when she somehow got herself stuck 50ft up on a precarious cliff ledge. Nine month-old cocker spaniel Ruby had run off after being involved in a road crash on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday. Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were reunited with Ruby thanks to West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.","Birds were following mother along busy road in Cambridgeshire .

"By . Wills Robinson . A drummer from the heavy metal band Scorpions, the group behind the anthem Rock You Like a Hurricane, has been jailed for a month for getting drunk and flashing his middle finger at Muslims in Dubai. James Kottak, 51, allegedly started swearing and took his trousers down after drinking five glasses of wine on a flight from Moscow. He was on his way to Bahrain, where he was due to a perform at a Formula One Grand Prix concert, when he was arrested and detained. Sentenced: Scorpion drummer James Kottak has been jailed in Dubai after getting drunk and offending Muslim passengers at an airport . Rude gesture: The drummer was said to have pulled his trousers down and shown his middle finger to passengers . The American was said to have gotten angry and started shouting when he entered the transit hall by mistake. When he saw the Pakistani and Afghan passengers, witnesses said Kottak swore at them and began talking about 'non-educated Muslims'. An officer claimed he then said: 'What is that disgusting smell', according to The National. A 27-year-old employee at the airport, said: 'When he [Kottak] saw the Pakistani and Afghani passengers, he covered his nose and said that there was no way he will travel with them.' His . lawyer had earlier argued that Kottak did not commit an indecent act, . but only wanted to show his tattoo to members of the public. Famous: He was due to play with the band at a Formula One concert in Bahrain . Kottak refuted the charges, telling prosecutors: 'I don’t remember saying these words and I did not flash my middle finger.' His lawyer, Hamid Al Khazraji told the Dubai Court of Misdemeanours that his client was innocent and that the witnesses' statements were contradictory. Kottak has been fined Dh2,000 (£323; $544) for . drinking and will be deported. He admitted to drinking, but denied . gesturing indecently in public and cursing Muslims. The drummer from the band, whose hits include Rock You Like a Hurricane and No One Like You was  jailed for a month, but will be released soon as he has already spent time in custody.

"By . Jennifer Newton . These are the cartoon style artist's impressions which police hope will help them catch a sexual predator. The unusual images were released by police as they advised women in the Shaftesbury area of Dorset to be extra vigilant following a sexual assault. A woman in her 30s, bravely fought off the would-be attacker and managed to escape from the incident uninjured. Dorset Police released this cartoon-style artist's impression following a sexual assault . Dorset Police released the e-fits, which were hand-drawn rather than computer generated. Detective Constable Andy Marsh, of Western CID, said: 'The images - derived from a full account by the victim - have been drawn by a specially trained artist.' The attack happened at about 11.15 pm on Tuesday, February 11 when a man, who was wearing distinctive work boots, approached the victim as she walked home alone. The hand-drawn image has been drawn by a specially trained artist . He is described as six foot tall, of slim build and wearing a hood over his head. Detective Constable Marsh added: 'I strongly suspect the man to be local to the Shaftesbury area and I urge anybody who knows this person to come forward and speak with the police in confidence. 'This is a rare and isolated incident, however we would advise members of the public to be extra vigilant.' Witnesses and anyone with information should call Dorset Police in confidence on 101. This artist's impression was released by police in Texas wanting to track down a man, who robbed two women at knifepoint . Facial composites are used by police in investigations into usually serious crimes in the hope to recreate a person's face as remembered by a victim. They are sometimes drawn or painted by specially trained artists in consultation with victims or witnesses. However, computer generated images are more common now using E-FIT software. This e-fit was released by police in Bolivia but helped them to track down a suspect . Earlier this year, police in Texas came under fire after a poorly drawn composite sketch was released after two women were robbed at knifepoint, which looked more like a cartoon character. In 2009, Bolivian police released a sketch of a suspected murderer which looked nothing like an actual person, however they did manage to catch a suspect. Portuguese police did not do much better in their search for Madeleine McCann, showing local business owners a faceless, egg-shaped head.","Dorset Police release images of a man wanted in connection with sexual assault .

"By . Richard Spillett . A mayor has been swindled by his own deputy in a cowboy building scam which left him with a £6,000 repair bill. Civic leader Mike Kennedy, 60, had to pay another builder to fix his leaky roof after town hall colleague Paul Jones failed to complete the work during months of delays. Father-of-five Jones, who made a string of excuses for delaying the job and then failed to finish it, has now been given years to repay the money he owes Mr Kennedy and another victim. Mike Kennedy, Mayor of Winsford, Cheshire (left), was ripped off by his own deputy, Paul Jones (right) Despite taking more than £1,000 from his senior colleague and repeatedly insisting he would mend his roof, Jones failed to fix the leak . Mr Kennedy, pictured with his wife Hilary cutting the ribbon at an opening ceremony, was left with a £6,000 repair bill . After Jones admitted fraud by false representation, magistrates ordered the compensation come out of his benefits at a rate of £5-a-week. Mr Kennedy, mayor of Winsford, Cheshire, hired Jones to stop rainwater getting into his garage after the Labour councillor bragged about his successful construction firm. But after Mr Kennedy handed over £1,600 towards the work, Jones gave his colleague and another disgruntled customer a string of excuses for delays. Jones, 36, falsely claimed he was undergoing treatment for testicular cancer, had been been undergoing psychiatric treatment and had lost his building materials in a fire. When trading standards were called in, it emerged Jones was a penniless bricklayer and did not employ anyone. The disgraced official, who campaigned against dangerous dogs and fly tipping during his time in office, has since quit as deputy mayor and given up his council seat. Jones, who has since stepped down from his civic role, was ordered to pay £7,000 to his two victims at a rate of £5-a-week . Mr Kennedy has hit out at the 'two years of lies' spun by Jones . Mr Kennedy, who will get a £4,250 share of the £7,000 compensation Jones was ordered to pay, said: 'I now firmly believe Jones only wanted to be the mayor of the town for his own kudos and self-esteem. 'I cannot believe how anyone on earth could fantasise to the extent he did. The lies he has told in the last two years have been unbelievable. In fact, so unbelievable they were believable. Mr Kennedy and his wife Hilary during civic duties in Winsford, Cheshire . 'Once he came to the council he said he had a building company and had his own business cards and t-shirts. Our garage roof was leaking so I asked him to do it because I thought I could trust him. 'He seemed believable and told us what he would need to do. 'But over the next 18 months every excuse under the sun came out. He was phoning some fictitious person at Dover docks who had supposedly been in touch about rubber for the roof. It allegedly came from Holland. 'He even came to my house phoning someone called Gary who was supposed to be his foreman saying ""oh right Gary, I want to make sure nobody gets the new vans filthy"", but there weren't any. There was absolutely no work force.' Jones was . elected to Winsford Town Council in Cheshire in 2011 and urged . colleagues and voters to address him as 'Councillor Jones' whenever they . saw him. He . was elected as Deputy Mayor in May 2013 with his wife Kelly acting as . Deputy Mayoress at the same time Mr Kennedy was elected mayor with his . wife Hilary, 66, serving as Mayoress. But . trouble began when former furniture shop owner Mr Kennedy hired Jones . in September 2011 and handed over a deposit of £1,400 in cash, with a . further £200 for 'materials' and payments for his 'workers'. Jones initially told the mayor he had to meet a man at Dover Docks to retrieve materials being sent from Holland. He . also claimed he had just bought two JCBs for his builder's yard so was . short of money to purchase materials for the job and he was currently . working on three barn conversions so had little time on his hands. He . also claimed he had lost building materials in a fire at the yard of . his supposed company 'New Images Construction & Build'. Later Jones placed tarpaulin in the leaking areas - forcing Mr Kennedy to leave buckets on the floor to collect the rainwater. Mr Kennedy asked Jones to carry out the work after his deputy bragged about his 'successful construction firm' But Jones repeatedly delayed the work, citing a range of excuses which Mr Kennedy described as 'so unbelievable they were believable' He . eventually rang the Kennedys while they were holidaying in Torquay last . September claiming the work was completed and 'brilliant' but, when they . got back home, they discovered the roof had not been touched and contacted . the authorities. Chester magistrates heard Jones also accepted £730 from another householder, Margaret Kernick, after he promised to undertake guttering work on her home - only to never start the job. Adam Simpson, prosecuting on behalf of Cheshire West and Chester Trading Standards said: 'Mrs Kernick approached the defendant as a builder and town councillor and asked for a quote and was quoted £730. She paid £300 up front and she believed he would be a trustworthy source. 'In the following weeks he said he had bought the materials and would start soon but made excuses about poor weather for not starting. He went to her house and said he was ill and undergoing tests for testicular cancer. 'He said he wouldn't be able to make money if he was going to hospital so she gave him money to assist. He then texted her saying he would return to start the work. But he did not honour the promise so she went to the town council. Jones placed plastic sheeting over the leak, which had led to rainwater dripping down into the Kennedys' home . The roof of the Kennedys' home after it was eventually fixed by another builder . 'He later said he was sorry he was messing her around and would come round with a full refund but did nothing.' Jones, now of Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, who is currently on Employment Support Allowance pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation. He resigned from the council citing 'personal reasons' in October last year. In mitigation, defence lawyer Guy Dodd said his client suffered from depression, bipolar disorder and OCD. He added: 'The victims approached him in both cases because they knew him in his capacity as a councillor at the time and knew he had previously worked in the building industry. 'He accepts he was never going to be in a fit state to carry out the work. He has been very seriously in debt. It is currently about £40,000 so he is effectively insolvent and considering the option of bankruptcy.' Jones was sentenced to six weeks in prison, suspended for 12 month and given a 12 month community supervision order. He was made to pay £730 compensation to Mrs Kernick, £4,250 to Cllr Kennedy, £2,295 prosecution costs and an £80 victim surcharge.","Mayor of Winsford Mike Kennedy was scammed by his deputy, Paul Jones .

"By . Steph Cockroft . Sameer Babar, 35, from Luton, Bedfordshire, stabbed his neighbour Leonard Flower to death in an 'unexplained' attack . A religious fanatic who was unknowingly suffering from paranoid schizophrenia stabbed his neighbour to death in an 'unexplained and frenzied attack’. Leonard Flower, 67, known as Len, was stabbed 17 times - including through the heart - by Sameer Babar, 35, as he was doing odd jobs in his garage in Luton, Bedfordshire. His wife, Linda, to whom he had been married for 47 years, was just metres away inside the couple's home when the brutal attack took place. But Mrs Flower only found out about her husband's death when he was found lying in a pool of blood by a couple who were delivering leaflets around the area. During the hearing yesterday at Luton Crown Court, Babar denied murder, but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The court was told Babar, who lived opposite Mr . Flower, a retired computer analyst, had fled the scene after carrying out the attack on October 22 last year by stealing the couple’s car. He then drove north up the M1 motorway but was arrested five hours later in Kenilworth, Warwickshire. Psychiatrists now believe Babar - who has written two books containing extreme religious rhetoric - was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia in the years leading up to the attack. He has now been detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act. Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Flower said she was 'heartbroken and devastated' about her husband's death. She said: 'We have lost a good husband, father, grandfather and a kind man who was liked and respected by everyone who met him.' Mr Flower, 67, was stabbed 17 times  as he worked in his garage. His wife Linda, to whom he had been married for 47 years, was just metres away in their home but had no idea what had happened . At the hearing, Judge Michael Kay QC said Babar's behaviour had been 'bizarre' in the year or two before the attack, but there had been no warning that he would be violent. The court was told that Babar had written two books in 2011 and 2012 containing extreme religious rhetoric, which had led to angry reactions from local mosques. Babar had also been planning to hold a lecture at Luton library and had been referred to a crisis mental health team, to be treated for depression, after contact with police. The court was told that the defendant . had even been visited by police the day before the killing but had refused to let . them in. Police had no power of entry and were forced to leave. The killing took place around . lunchtime the next day. Prosecutor Beverley . Cripps said: 'The defendant was in the grip of mental . illness, which has since been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia. Babar, who lived opposite Mr Flower, fled the scene after stealing the couple's car but was later arrested in Kenilworth, Warwickshire . After Babar was found by police, he was detained in a mental health unit until the court case. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility . 'He had been treated for depression but not significant mental illness.' When Babar was arrested he was fit to be interviewed, the court was told. A month later he made a statement saying he had little memory of the day. A . psychiatrist who is now treating Babar told the court that Babar was probably suffering from paranoid schizophrenia for a number of years, but it . had not been diagnosed. Judge Kay said: 'Words are inadequate to describe the extent of the tragedy which hit the Flower family completely out of the blue on October 22 last year. 'One’s . heart goes out to that family. He was a good husband, father and . grandfather, a man liked and respected by many people. Nothing anyone . can do can put matters right. Mrs Flower said her husband was 'kind, generous and caring' and that he was liked and respected by everyone he met . 'There is no doubt that this was a wholly unexplained and frenzied attack. 'There was no suggestion of any ill feeling or problems between you and anyone in the Flowers family.' Speaking after the hearing, Mrs Flower said: 'I’m heartbroken and devastated at the way my husband’s life was taken. 'Len was a kind, generous and caring husband for 47 years - still fit and able. He helped anyone who asked for a favour. 'As a computer analyst he was an intelligent man, described as such by all who knew him and also very practical. 'I am lost without him as I am housebound and he was my full-time carer. Mr Flower was only found when a couple who were delivering leaflets in the area spotted him in his garage, lying in a pool of blood. He was pronounced dead at the scene . 'We did everything together. The fact that a good, decent man died in such a way hurts me too much.' Senior Investigating Officer Detective Inspector Liz Mead, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'The Flower family find themselves in tragic circumstances. 'They now have to cope without Len who should be enjoying his retirement with his wife. 'Len was killed in his own garage, where he should have been safe, but on that October afternoon Sameer Babar carried out a violent attack which has now changed the course of so many innocent lives. 'The medical experts have agreed that at the time of Mr Flower’s death, Sameer Babar was suffering from a mental illness and continues to receive the appropriate medical attention for his condition. 'Today sees some closure for the Flower family but nothing that has happened in this court room will fill the void that Len’s death has left.'","Leonard Flower was stabbed 17 times in his garage in Luton, Bedfordshire .

"By . Jill Reilly . A group of friends were refused service at a pub by staff who concerned they were members of the English Defence League because they were wearing shirts with England flags across them. Peter Kinselley, 52, went to the Hobgoblin Pub, in Bath, Somerset, with eight friends after work to toast to St George's Day. The group, who were dressed in patriotic garments including England football shirts, white waistcoats with red crosses and St George's top hats were outraged after they were refused service due to their attire. But a barman told MailOnline the pub has previously had trouble with members of notorious far right EDL on St George's Day and that the group became aggressive when asked if they were members. A group of friends were refused service at a pub because they were wearing clothing with England flags on and staff feared they were members of the English Defence League . Mr Kinselley, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, said: 'We weren't being abusive - if we were, I could understand the reason why he didn't serve us. 'We weren't singing or shouting or anything like that - we just wanted a drink. I am not racist in any way myself.' One of the group added: 'We only went in for a quiet pint after work and got dressed up a bit for St George's Day. 'What's . wrong with that? Everyone gets green gear on for St Patrick's Day. But . apparently that made us look like racists. It's ridiculous.' Peter Kinselley, 52, went to the Hobgoblin Pub, in Bath, Somerset, with eight friends after work to toast to St George's Day . A barman refused to serve the group of factory workers - and claimed they 'looked like trouble' The English Defence League has been described as the biggest populist street movement in a generation, posing a headache to police and dividing political opinion as to whether it should be banned. The far-right group emerged in 2009 out of the United Peoples of Luton, formed by Tommy Robinson when Muslim extremists demonstrated in the town against a homecoming parade from Iraq by the Royal Anglian Regiment. The group has no normal joining procedures or membership list and its activities have been characterised by volatile street demonstrations and ‘flash mobs’. It also has a strong online presence. The street demonstrations have frequently been associated with violence, anti-social behaviour and arrests, often after clashes with anti-fascist campaigners. The group's ‘extremist’ image was further enhanced by the news in 2011 that the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik had hailed the EDL as a ‘blessing’ and had written about how he wished to attend EDL rallies. Just under a third of EDL supporters, or 30 per cent, are educated to university or college level and 15 per cent have a professional qualification, according to the report. Its supporters are also overwhelmingly male, at 81 per cent compared with 19 per cent female, according to the Demos report. Mr Kinselley said the group were not 'fanatical' about celebrating the patron saint's day, but that the pub's attitude had made him more determined to mark the occasion. He added they had encountered no problems in the other pubs they visited, and that they had not been drunk. The manager of the Hobgoblin, told MailOnline: 'We have a lot of mixed race people coming here, people of different sexual persuasions and we like to keep that environment. 'On previous St George's Days we have . had some trouble with people from the EDL - they came in dressed . similarly and chanting racist slogans you know which I don't want in my . pub. It upsets my clientele. ‘The men came in dressed the same, they were asked if they were members and they got abusive. ‘They shouted a lot, walked out, bashed on the windows. 'I don’t dislike British people, I just hate racism. 'I feel bad that St Georges day has been overtaken by a small majority that use it to promote hatred.' The manager said that since news of the group being turned away emerged he has been plagued by threatening phone calls. Across the country members of the controversial EDL have been banned from pubs. Last year a Hemel Hempstead pub banned group from holding a meeting there. Protest: Kevin Carroll, former EDL deputy leader, addresses supporters of the far-right English Defence League in May following the killing of Lee Rigby. Mr Carroll also quit the group last year . The previous year a Norwich pub also banned members of the far-right group which emerged in 2009 from meeting there as well. In . September Selfridges came under fire for giving an EDL leader and his . friend a free lunch worth £83 after a sales assistant refused to serve . them. Tommy Robinson was at the high-end store on London's Oxford Street accompanying a friend who wanted to buy a pair of jeans when a member of staff allegedly told his friend 'F*** off, I'm not serving you.' The sales assistant is said to have sworn at Robinson's friend after querying whether he was with the leader of the far-right group. When Robinson, 30, and his friend complained to management, they were given a free £83 lunch at the store's in-house Hix Restaurant, Champagne and Caviar Bar.","Peter Kinselley, 52, went to the Hobgoblin Pub, in Bath, Somerset .

"By . Andrew Levy . It is a film that has earned worldwide acclaim – capped by being named best picture at this year’s Oscars. But award-winning artist Maggi Hambling begged to differ, describing 12 Years A Slave as ‘frightfully boring’ and telling an audience of fine art students that she ‘wouldn’t mind a few slaves’ herself. The comment offended a black  person in the audience and was branded a ‘despicable racist rant’ by an equal rights group. Controversial: Artist Maggi Hambling, who made a comment described as 'despicably racist' during a talk in Ipswich . The 68-year-old, whose work has been displayed in the National Gallery and Tate, sparked the race row while criticising Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave. She described it as ‘that frightfully boring slave film’ and told the audience at the University Campus Suffolk in Ipswich she had ‘never been so bored’ as she sat through the 134-minute movie. ‘In the end I didn’t care about the f****** slave. Anyway, slaves would be very handy. I wouldn’t mind a few,’ she added. Anger: Mature student Jason Haye, 36 - who said he was the only black person among 60 people there - is furious the fine art department failed to take any action against the artist . Fury: Mr Haye claims senior figures are scared to act as they don¿t want to lose Miss Hambling¿s support and patronage . Mature . student Jason Haye, 36, who said he was the only black person among 60 . people there, is furious the university failed to take any action . against the artist and has demanded an apology. ‘I . know Maggi Hambling has a reputation for giving forthright opinions but . her comments about slavery were inappropriate,’ Mr Haye said. ‘It . was humiliating. I know she was joking about how nice it would be to . have lackeys running around for her – but she said it in the context of . the film.’ The third-year student created a protest video, which he posted on YouTube. But he says staff told him to remove it in case it triggered legal action from the artist. Acclaimed: Hambling made her controversial comments during a talk about 12 Years A Slave, pictured, which starred Michael Fassbender, left, Lupita Nyong'o and Chiwetel Ejiofor . Outspoken: Hambling described 12 Years A Slave as 'that frightfully boring slave film' and told the audience at the University Campus Suffolk in Ipswich she had 'never been so bored' as she sat through the 134-minute movie . Mr . Haye was backed by equality group Operation Black Vote, whose director, . Simon Wooley, described the artist’s remarks as a ‘despicable racist . rant’ in an open letter to the university. Hambling, . who was made a CBE in 2010 for her services to art, is best known for a . sculpture of Oscar Wilde in central London and the Scallop, a 13ft . piece on Aldeburgh beach in Suffolk  dedicated to Benjamin Britten. She refused to comment yesterday, while University Campus Suffolk said it had not received an official complaint.

Everywhere you look at Liverpool games these days there’s a banner saying ‘Make Us Dream’ in reference to a first league title in 24 years that is inching ever nearer. There’s a similar sentiment on show, but you’s have to look a little closer to read it. Philippe Coutinho’s left  forearm bears the inscription: ‘Never Stop Dreaming’. ‘There’s a famous saying in my country, “O Brasileiro Nao Desiste Nunca”, which means Brazilians never give up,’ said the Liverpool midfielder. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Rodgers and Mourinho on the big game . Dream: Philippe Coutinho celebrates his goal, against City that has taken Liverpool within reach of the title . Homecoming: Coutinho still holds out hope of making the Brazil World Cup squad . Sign of the times: Liverpool fans can feel the Premier League title returning to Anfield for the first time since 1990 . ‘It is a sentence I like and a view I take for life. But it fits with Liverpool and the current situation we are in so that makes it even better. ‘I started having the tattoo done at the beginning of the season and it was finished bit by bit. As players, we need to keep dreaming if we want to reach the objectives we have in mind. ‘The players know how important these remaining games are, and we will fight and do our best on the pitch to make winning the League happen. ‘It is a very special moment, with  Liverpool going for the title and my country staging the World Cup. Don’t forget the saying “Brazilians never lose hope” — I still hope to play for Brazil at the World Cup. This could be a very special two months.’ While the first part of this double will be a near-certainty if Liverpool beat Chelsea at Anfield tomorrow, the  second is looking less sure. Remarkably, one of the Barclays  Premier League’s most naturally gifted players has just one Brazil cap — a friendly against Iran four years ago — and has been consistently overlooked by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. Crunch match: Liverpool face Chelsea at Anfield in a game that could effectively decide the title . Brazil nuts! Luiz Felipe Scolari has overlooked Coutinho, who has won a single cap, in his Brazil squads . There was little sign of Scolari’s stance changing when he gave a lecture to Sao Paulo University students on Thursday and told them David Luiz, Ramires, Oscar, Willian, Paulinho, Thiago Silva, Fred and Julio Cesar could all count on places in his squad. Every aspect of Coutinho's game has improved this season... 2012-13                                         2013-14     13                      Apps                    30       3                      Goals                    4       5                     Assists                   7     21              Chances made            60   33.4             Passes/game              45.1   74%           Pass completion            80%   43%           Dribble completion         52% . He claimed he had already decided on ‘95-99 per cent’ of his final selection and added, ominously for outsiders like Coutinho, that there would be ‘no surprises’. If a sense of injustice at his likely World Cup snub spreads from the Kop to the Copacabana there is little chance of 21-year-old Coutinho being consumed by resentment. His Christian faith keeps him strong at all times, and he insists he has a lot to be thankful for, after his friend’s gran opened his parents’  eyes to the innate talent that has  lit up English football this season. Coutinho’s liking for football went largely unnoticed at the family home on the northern outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. His architect dad,  Jose Carlos, expected son No 3 would  follow the same scholarly path as his siblings who became lawyers. Lucky break: The Reds youngster was expected to become a lawyer before being spotted by his friend's gran . But it was a lady called Dona Didi who recognised that her six-year-old grandson’s best pal had something special with a ball at his feet. After watching one game on the  futsal (five-a-side) court at the back of her apartment block in Rocha, in northern Rio, she accompanied Philippe back to his parents’ home and told them he was cut out for an altogether different career than brothers Leandro and Cristiano. Acting on her advice, Jose Carlos and his wife Esmeraldinha enrolled him at the local Clube dos Sargentos futsal school, where he broke a series of goal records before joining the larger  Mangueira club. There, despite being the youngest in the team, he won the Rio de Janeiro Futsal League and was their leading marksman. Aged eight he moved on to Vasco da Gama, where a few years later he shot to national prominence by helping the club lift the Brazilian FA Under 17 Cup for the first time. Spotted by Inter Milan when he was 16, he stayed on loan with his Brazilian club until he was 18. Boy from Brazil: The Brazilian made a name for himself at the South America Under-17 Championships in 2009 . Italian job: Liverpool paid Inter Milan £8.5m for Coutinho, which now looks like a remarkable bargain . There have been some inspired signings at Anfield lately, not least Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, but the £8.5million Liverpool paid Inter Milan 15 months ago for Coutinho looks unbeatable value for money after his impact in an advanced midfield role. His dramatic late winner against  Manchester City a fortnight ago, which left Liverpool on the brink of the title, was further evidence of his vital role in Brendan Rodgers’ side. And Coutinho is fully aware that his upbringing in Brazil was fundamental to his development. ‘I was only six but by playing on tight futsal courts in Rio I was able to develop the technical ability that has made me the player I am today,’ explained Coutinho, who could speak no English when he arrived from Italy. ‘It is a small area, so you have to be highly technical. This is where I learned my skills and I will always be grateful for that. Hard man: Inter veteran Marco Meterazzi (R) threatened Coutinho after being nutmegged in training . Five Brazilians could be involved at Anfield on Sunday. It could have been six but Ramires is suspended.PHILIPPE COUTINHOCaps: 1                            Goals: 0LUCASCaps: 24                          Goals: 0DAVID LUIZCaps: 34                          Goals: 0OSCAR Caps: 29                          Goals: 9WILLIANCaps: 5                            Goals: 1 . ‘It meant when I progressed to a proper full-sized football pitch at Vasco at the age of 11, I felt comfortable on the ball and confident about trying to go past defenders and make things happen. ‘But moving to Europe has added an extra dimension to my game. At Inter, Rafa Benitez changed my mentality. He made me more of a team player and encouraged me to move the ball more quickly and get more involved. Now, with Liverpool, I am moving faster still and thinking even more quickly. It just felt right for me here from the outset. ‘The team have been playing with a great deal of freedom in attack and that has helped me adapt so easily. It also helped to move into Fabio Aurelio’s old house, opposite Sefton Park, with my wife Aine, my brothers and our two dogs, Will and Mell. ‘I have visited the docks a few times and been to one or two restaurants, but I’m not a nightclub-goer and I don’t drink alcohol. I pursue happiness through other avenues, like having God in my life.’ Closing in: Liverpool are five points clear at the top of the Premier League with three games remaining . Selfie centred: The 21-year-old lives opposite Sefton Park with his young wife Aine and their two dogs . But the virtuous Coutinho also has a mischievous streak. He marked his first training session at Inter by nutmegging Marco Materazzi and leaving the giant former Everton defender flat on his back. ‘When I got back into the dressing room, the masseur said he would buy me snacks for the rest of the week if I did it again,’ he recalled. ‘Materazzi told me he would put me in hospital. He wasn’t impressed.’","Philippe Coutinho is set on wining the Premier League title with Liverpool .

"By . John Drayton . Ryan Giggs is busy trying to muster something - anything - from the wreckage that is Manchester United's disastrous season, but David Moyes had to get away from it all. The 51-year-old was axed by the club on Tuesday, with Giggs named interim manager. And a day before United beat Norwich City on Saturday, Moyes was pictured in Florida as he tried to put a dismal week behind him in the sun. Getaway: Sacked Manchester United manager David Moyes arrives in Miami, Florida with his wife Pamela . Showing his face: It is the first time Moyes has been spotted since leaving Carrington on Tuesday . Checking in: Moyes must now consider his options going forward in a bid to rebuild his managerial reputation . Moyes was pictured landing in Miami and heading out for a meal in the state, which is home of the Glazer family. The American businessmen own United, and cut Moyes' six-year contract at the club short. It is believed that he has reached a financial settlement with the club, thought to be around £7million. And while he suffered in the week, at least the Scot got to relax with his wife Pamela with a dinner for two in South Florida. A statement for the League Managers Association said: ‘The LMA and Manchester United are pleased to confirm that terms of settlement have been agreed between the Club and David Moyes in respect of the termination of his employment. ‘A settlement agreement is in the process of being finalised. No further comment will be made in relation to this issue.’ There have been allegations of players . mocking Moyes behind his back in his later months of Old Trafford, and . he made no mention of them in his own LMA statement. Part . of it read: 'In my short time at the club I have learnt what special . places Old Trafford and Carrington are. I would like to thank the United . staff for making me feel so welcome and part of the United family from . my first day. And of course thank you to those fans who have supported . me throughout the season. I wish you and the club all the best for the . future.' Sir Alex Ferguson, . the man who hand picked Moyes to succeed him at United, has also spoken . out about the departure, claiming it was 'upsetting the way it came . out.' Time away: Moyes sits down for a meal with his wife in South Florida . Any messages? The Scot is shown checking his mobile phone at the table . Axed: Avram and Joel Glazer moved to get rid of Moyes and are now thought to have agreed a settlement . The difference: Robin van Persie seems much more at ease with Ryan Giggs (left) than he did with Moyes . All smiles: Ryan Giggs larks about with his 'Class of '92' coaching setup at United's training session . On his way: David Moyes was axed on Tuesday after losing 11 Premier League games . Giggs takes charge of his first United fixture on Saturday against Norwich, but Louis van Gaal is the favourite to land the full time role. According to Dutch paper De Telegraaf, which has close links to Van Gaal's camp, the bookmakers' favourite has already sealed the Old Trafford hotseat. Sportsmail understands a meeting took place between Van Gaal's representatives and United chiefs in the last couple of days. And should he take the reins, he would be keen to bring in fellow countryman Patrick Kluivert as his assistant. The new Old Trafford dugout?

"By . Chris Pleasance . For most of us, the thought of scaling the side of a building without any safety gear is enough to induce a nervous sweat. But for Yaroslav Segeda and his friends from Ukraine, standing on top of giant structures without a harness is their idea of a fun day out. Known as 'skywalkers', these brave and slightly fool-hardly adventurers practice a sport known as urban exploration, aiming to find and photograph lost, abandoned, or inaccessible places in cities. While there are many different types of urban explorer, skywalkers, as their name suggests, tend to prefer scaling rooftops, construction cranes and factory towers, as opposed to crawling through old drains or pipe networks. Using their experience, a bit of know-how, and blueprints from library archives, Segeda and his friends select some of the tallest buildings in Ukraine to scale, before stopping for an obligatory selfie at the top. As well as climbing these impressive structures in Kiev, the group has also visited and climbed the International Business park in Moscow, and delved deep underground into a gypsum mine in eastern Ukraine.

"By . Lizzie Parry . When a family decided to sell up and move house, their removals requirement was rather different to most average households. Because the owners of a four-bedroom home in Wigmore near Gillingham in Kent had to factor-in moving a fighter plane from their garden when they put their home on the market. This full-size 1940s Vampire jet has been parked in the back garden of the detached house for the last 12 years. The owners of a four-bedroom home in Wigmore, near Gillingham in Kent, are said to have sold their 1940s Vampire fighter jet since putting their home on the market . The jet fighter plane was dismantled before being lifted into place with the help of a crane. It is now expected to be lifted from the garden of the home in Wigmore, after it was sold privately . But whoever buys the property, which is on the market at £485,000 and described as an 'amazing family home', will not be able to claim ownership of the Cold War fighter plane. Its owners are selling the aircraft privately, in a separate deal to the home sale. The current owner, who asked not to be named, had the plane carefully dismantled after it was renovated and then lifted it by crane into place in their garden, where it was painstakingly reassembled. The aircraft is understood to have been sold already and a crane will be used to gently remove it. The British-built de Havilland Vampire two-seater jet was originally designed in 1942 but did not come into service with the RAF until after the Second World War in 1945. It served as a front-line jet fighter until 1953 when the Vampire was deemed obsolete and was later used as a trainer. The house is on the market for £485,000 and boast four bedrooms as well as the huge garden, which has housed the aircraft for the last 12 years . The de Havilland DH.100 Vampire was a British fighter jet developed during the Second World War. It was designed to harness the newly developed jet engine and entered service with the RAF in 1945. It was the first fighter jet to be powered by a single jet engine. The RAF used the Vampire as a front line fighter until 1953, when it assumed the role of pilot training. The de Havilland Vampire jet achieved a series of aviation firsts, including being the first British plane to exceed 500mph as well as the first jet fighter to cross the Atlantic . It was retired in 1966 and replaced by the Hawker Hunter and Gloster Javelin. The model achieved a series of aviation firsts, including being the first British plane to exceed 500mph and being the first jet aircraft to cross the Atlantic. It took part in several conflicts, including the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Malayan emergency, a guerrilla war fought between Commonwealth forces, the Malayan National Liberation Army and the military arm of the Malayan Communist Party from 1948 to 1960. Around 3,300 Vampires were manufactured. The Royal Navy's first jet fight was the Sea Vampire, a variant of the plane operated from the Navy's aircraft carriers. As such, the Vampire was the first plane to be landed on a moving aircraft carrier.","1940s jet has been parked in the garden of a Wigmore home for 12 years .

Cech dislocated his shoulder during the goalless first leg and Mourinho confirmed last week the goalkeeper will require surgery to help repair the right shoulder joint.

Ryan Giggs’ hopes of winning four straight games as Manchester United manager have been boosted by news that Robin van Persie is approaching match fitness. Few players embodied the up-and-down tenure of sacked United boss David Moyes better than Van Persie. The Dutch striker has struggled with injury all season and was not expected to play again this term after injuring his knee last month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Robin van Persie coming back from injury . Van man: Robin van Persie (L) is ready to play in Ryan Giggs' final three games of the season . Down and out: Van Persie has not played since picking up an injury against Bayern Munich on March 19 . Tensions? The Dutchman was expected to miss the rest of the season... until David Moyes was sacked . With suggestions of issues between the player and Moyes refusing to go away all season, Van Persie has recently been recuperating from his latest setback in Holland. But no sooner had Moyes left than Van Persie was back in training at Carrington and now interim manager Giggs is refusing to rule out a return for the 30-year-old this weekend against Sunderland. Asked about a return to action for Van Persie, Giggs said: ‘We’ll just have to wait and see how he goes this week. He came back last Friday and he trained well. ‘He just needs to work on his fitness now so, yeah, he looked great.’ United are continuing their talks with Holland manager Louis van Gaal this week as they look to replace Moyes. The official line is that the club are talking to other candidates, but Van Gaal remains the stand-out option and agreement could be announced by the end of the week. The future is orange? Van Persie's national coach Louis van Gaal (L) is expected to take over at United . Man hug: The Holland striker had a special relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson after joining United . There were suggestions in Holland last night that one sticking point may be the size of the coaching entourage he wishes to bring to Old Trafford. United, though, said  privately last week that they were willing to be flexible on that matter. The Dutch FA are understood to want the situation clarified so their plans for the summer’s World Cup are not too badly affected. United are sympathetic but cannot afford to make an appointment without considering all candidates — a  mistake they appeared to make when giving Moyes the job after Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement.

The Welshman being in charge has seemingly already lifted the atmosphere and reserve goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard offered an insight as to what the 40-year-old has brought to the dressing room in his new role. Writing in a newspaper in  Denmark, Lindegaard said: ‘Some might question whether it can work to go from being a team-mate to the manager from one day to the next. ‘Normally I have my  reservations, but Giggs’ case is another matter. ‘Ryan Giggs has always held a kind of professional distance to his team-mates. ‘He opened his mouth when it was relevant and people have always listened. Dutch of class: Van Persie will be hoping to replicate the form that helped United win the title last season . Cut from the same cloth: Giggs bears managerial similarities to Ferguson, according to Anders Lindegaard . ‘The parallels with Sir Alex Ferguson are striking, and it is clear that Giggs  has been learning from the most awe-inspiring football manager. ‘His last speech before the team went on the pitch before the match against Norwich was spine-tingling in a way that I have only experienced from Sir Alex Ferguson. ‘It probably sounds rather naive and impetuous but to me  we are dealing with a new Pep Guardiola.’ Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane has ruled himself out of a return to Old  Trafford as Van Gaal’s deputy.","Van Persie could return to play under Giggs after recovering from injury .

"By . Ruth Styles . and Martha Cliff . When David Richards, a 34-year-old former stripper from London began to go bald, his confidence was left in tatters. But while some would have put up with losing their locks, Mr Richards, who now manages the Dreamboys, plumped for an extreme solution - having, what looks like, new hair tattooed onto his head. 'It involves a little bit of pain, a few snuffly moments and watery eyes but the end result is that I look like I’ve got hair,' he explains. Big improvement: Mr Richards chose to have his head tattooed after comb-overs and caps didn't work . Full head: Mr Richards had a full head of hair during his stripping days and was devastated when it began to thin and eventually fell out . 'I had four or five treatments but most people have two. I’m very picky and that’s the beauty of this treatment - you can dictate exactly how you want it.' Mr Richards, who has managed the Dreamboys stripper troupe for 14 years, had been left miserable and lacking confidence after noticing his hair beginning to thin. 'I had gone completely bald on top,' he remembers. 'I did . try to comb it over and cover it up. But it got to the point where . there was nothing else I could do and I just had to shave it off. 'For . me there is nothing more soul destroying for a man than losing your . hair - it’s worse than going grey. 'I first noticed it quite some years . ago when someone at work said to me: “You’re losing your hair” and I said: . “No I’m not” and he said “Yes you are!”' 'It . was a very slow process,' he adds. 'You start to get thinner and thinner up top . and you notice clumps of hair on your pillow in the morning. 'I started . to wear more and more baseball caps. I was sat in the hairdressers one . day and I was looking in the mirror and I just thought, “it’s time to . shave it off"".' Miserable about losing his hair, Mr Richards resorted to baseball caps and comb-overs until bumping into a co-worker whose hair appeared to have mysteriously regrown. 'One of the guys at work had it done,' he explains. 'I . said to him, “You’ve done something done to your hair” and he denied it . and denied it but then he eventually told me he’d been to have his head tattooed. Gone: Mr Richards says he found losing his hair deeply upsetting and had tried to cover it up by wearing caps . Ouch! Mr Richards immediately after having the procedure which he says does make your eyes water a little . I . was like, “Wow I really like it” and went for a consultation at His Hair Clinic and then I thought let’s rock and roll!' Like his colleague, Mr Richards had opted for new treatment: a procedure called Scalp Micro-Pigmentation or SMP which costs between £500 and £3000 and involves having tiny blobs of pigment dotted across the scalp to replicate the look of natural hair follicles. While not as natural as traditional hair transplants, according to fans, SMP is unnoticeable from a distance and can barely be seen close up. 'The results are well worth the pain,' adds a delighted Mr Richards. 'You . can add numbing cream and take paracetamol, but at the end of the day . it’s 12 hours of treatment for the rest of your life. He adds: 'One thing I . would say is that it does make you sneeze a lot and your nose run [during the treatment] - it’s like having hayfever.' Improvement: Mr Richards new hair line was created using SMP which involves tiny tattoos all over the scalp . Despite the pain and the sneezing, Mr Richards says having his head tattooed has changed his life for the better. 'I had gone completely bald on top but now it just looks like I’ve shaved my head,' says the Londoner. 'I’ve got that 5 o’clock shadow look.' He adds: 'I feel so much more confident now and I don’t wear anywhere near as many baseball caps as I used to. 'The biggest thing I’ve noticed is people no longer say I’m bald and if they ever do, I can now just tell them that I shave my head.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Salma Hayek Pinault talks about skincare, adult acne, and taking time for herself in the newest issue of NewBeauty magazine. Mrs Pinault tells the magazine that she has ‘always been conservative of what I’ve done to my skin. I don’t believe in abandoning it and then trying to fix it with something really drastic, really fast.’ In this vein, the actress says that she has never gotten microdermabrasion or a serious chemical peel. Fresh-faced: Salma Hayek Pinault says that her skincare line is meant to enable all women to maintain their youth and beauty . The actress and mother to six year old . daughter Valentina considers herself quite the skincare expert, as she . released her own line called Nuance in CVS stores nationwide in 2011. Mrs Pinault, 47, developed the skincare line in order to utilize tepezcohuite – a plant whose essence is used in burn units in her native Mexico. She believes that it has strong anti-aging properties. 'There were days I used to wake up, look in the mirror and go straight back to bed because my acne was so bad' ‘I could have made my brand a lot more expensive and it would have been a lot more successful. But then it wouldn’t have been accessible to all women who need it,’ she said, adding: ‘Every woman is entitled to her youth and her beauty.’ In addition to anti-aging, the label also addresses a skincare concern close to Mrs Pinault’s heart – adult acne. Of her own experience with the ailment she said: ‘There were days I used to wake up, look in the mirror and go straight back to bed because my acne was so bad, so I get it….most brands still don’t want to give a solution because they think it’s not chic – it’s actually shocking. I think that’s terrible.’ Juggling game: Mrs Pinault says that making time fore herself has become a difficult pursuit, as family comes first . Now a mother, as well as wife to Francois-Herni Pinault, the CEO of luxury conglomerate Kering, Mrs Pinault says that her movie career has become a lower priority. Her family comes first. ‘My rule is that I won’t be away from Valentina for more than a week. And sometimes I won’t do a project because of that,’ she said. ‘It’s a new discipline.

"By . Katy Winter . A baby boy who beat the odds so he could be at his parents' wedding day has lost his battle with a terminal brain illness, just one week after celebrating his first birthday. Amy and Liam Ralph, from Couldson, Surrey, decided to quickly tie the knot in January after they were warned their son Jakub - who was aged just nine months at the time - could have just 32 hours to live. The couple decided to exchange vows at their son's bedside at the Shooting Star Children's Hospice in Hampton, south west London, so little Jakub could share their special day. Amy and Liam Ralph from Coulsdon, Surrey, at their wedding with their son Jakub. Baby Jakub tragically died three months later from his terminal brain illness . The couple hastily organised their wedding ceremony at the Shooting Star Children's Hospice in Hampton, south west London, so their son Jakub could be at the ceremony . After the wedding, Jakub's condition improved and he survived against the odds for three months to celebrate his first birthday on April 22. But the heartbroken couple announced this week that the youngster had lost his fight for life. Grandmother Tracy Gowlett said last night: 'We always knew this day would come, but it’s just come a lot sooner than we would have wanted, and we’re all heartbroken. 'He had his first birthday, which was really good. He reached a lot of milestones that we thought he would not see but he actually did.' Amy and Liam decided to get married in January in the hospice where Jakub had been treated. Amy said: 'He went into the hospice and our palliative care nurse said it was unlikely he was going to last 32 hours. The couple, seen here on their wedding day, organised the day when told Jakub could have just 32 hours to live . Amy and Liam, pictured with family and friends on their wedding day . The wedding was a first for the hospice, and despite being a joyful occasion in itself, Amy admits she couldn't be happy because of their son's serious condition . 'So Liam and I decided instantly to get married. The hospice staff were fantastic and they arranged everything.' But despite marrying the love of her life, Amy said it was difficult to feel happy. She said: 'I know your wedding is meant to be the happiest day of your life, but I couldn't be happy. 'I put on a brave face in front of the guests, but I cried my eyes out whenever I was alone. 'We . stayed with Jakub that night, thinking he'd never pull through. But he . was still here the next morning, even the doctor couldn't believe it.' Liam added: 'He was an . amazing and completely wonderful child.' Liam, an engineer for Virgin Media, proposed to Amy minutes after their . only child Jakub . was born.

"By . Emma Innes . Some 34 per cent of people say they suffer the most allergy symptoms in their bedrooms . It is a place for rest and relaxation, but new research suggests the bedroom is the dirtiest room in the house. Indeed, British bedrooms are so filthy that 34 per cent of Britons say their bedroom is the room in which they suffer the most allergy symptoms. And this is little surprise as 17 per cent of people admit to only changing their bed sheets once a month. A survey of 2,000 Britons revealed 34 per cent sneeze most in their bedrooms, while 33 per cent say their sitting room is the most allergy-inducing room and 18 per cent say they suffer most in their kitchen. London is the dirtiest place – in the capital 12 per cent of people only change their sheets every two months. The survey, by Samsung Electronics UK, revealed that the most common household allergies to be triggered by dirty houses are those caused by dust mites, pet hair and mould. And these allergies are causing 78 per cent of people to start sneezing, 73 per cent to get itchy eyes and 25 per cent to develop skin rashes. The findings suggest the average Briton needs to undertake some serious spring cleaning as 13 per cent suffer symptoms of allergies up to three times a week while six per cent develop symptoms five times a week. While the prevalence of household allergens is causing Britons untold trouble, many are fighting back. About 17 per cent of people in Britain only change their bed sheets once a month . Some 17 per cent of people claim to vacuum their carpets every day, while eight per cent even steam their curtains to remove dust. A Samsung spokesperson commented: ‘With the May bank holiday weekends just around the corner, now is as good a time as any for people to give their homes a good spring clean and make sure they don’t spend any more time than necessary reaching for their tissues as their allergies take hold. ‘However, with a number of products such as vacuum cleaners now being designed with allergy sufferers in mind, it’s important that people don’t suffer in silence and are aware of the help that’s available to them.’","34% of Britons say they sneeze and cough the most in their bedrooms .

"By . Rachel Ellis . As soon as Justine Sullivan’s son Conor was born, he had trouble breastfeeding. Midwives at the hospital gave him formula milk, much to his mother’s exasperation. ‘Conor’s first feed was from a bottle,’ says Justine, 42, a TV producer from London. ‘I was desperate to breastfeed, but they . advised I should top up with formula because it was unlikely he was . getting enough from me. It was frustrating, but I took their advice.’ Justine Sullivan with her children Conor (four) and Arlo (two). Connor always had trouble breast-feeding. Justine went to a breastfeeding counsellor who told her he was tongue-tied and this was the reason he was having trouble. 'I couldn't believe no one had checked before,' she says . For the next six weeks, Justine struggled to get her son to breastfeed. ‘It took hours because Conor couldn’t latch on properly and get enough milk,’ says Justine. ‘He became frustrated and would bang his head against my chest. He’d fall asleep during his lengthy feeds, but as soon as I put him down, he’d wake up and want feeding again. It was exhausting.’ To breastfeed, babies need to be able to stick their tongue forward to latch on. Instead, Conor would chomp with his gums, which is ineffective and incredibly painful for the mother. As a result, Justine had three bouts of mastitis, where the breast tissue becomes painful and inflamed, as well as nipple thrush, which in turn gave Conor oral thrush. However, a simple check carried out when Conor was six weeks old changed everything. ‘I’d seen my GP at least four times and Conor was given treatment for colic and reflux, which causes stomach cramps and vomiting in babies — neither of which he had,’ says Justine. ‘After six weeks, I went to a breastfeeding counsellor and the first thing she did was put her finger in Conor’s mouth. She told me he was tongue-tied and this was the reason he was having trouble. I couldn’t believe no one had checked before.’ Like many people, Justine had never heard of the condition. In fact, tongue-tie is thought to affect one in five babies — it’s where the frenulum, the string-like skin under the tongue, is too short. This restricts movement, making breastfeeding difficult or impossible. It can also lead to speech problems. Justine Sullivan with her children Conor (four, right) and Arlo (two, left). Her sons, like one in five babies, were both born with tongue tie which often prevents them from breastfeeding because they cannot latch on properly . Tongue-tied children may be messy eaters and have dental problems because the tongue is unable to remove food debris from the teeth. Many adults are tongue-tied without realising it. It is thought to be inherited from the father and is more common in boys. The condition can be diagnosed easily by feeling for the tightness of the frenulum. Babies with tongue-tie tend to have heart-shaped tongues because the middle is pulled in by the short frenulum, and they cannot stick out their tongue beyond their lower lip. Signs of the condition in newborns include gulping and clicking while breastfeeding because they can’t latch on properly. Most tongue-tied babies can bottle feed because the teat goes right into the mouth. Breast-feeding is seen as preferable to bottle-feeding by many experts as it is known to protect babies from stomach upsets, chest infections, allergies, sudden infant death syndrome and obesity and may even boost IQ. It has also been shown to reduce a woman’s risk of breast cancer and can help her bond with a newborn. The Department of Health recommends giving babies only breast milk for the first six months of life — mothers are offered £200 in vouchers if they reach this milestone. However, while 69 per cent of women breastfeed their baby at birth, this falls to 23 per cent by six weeks, with just 1 per cent reaching the six-month target. According to Helen Caulfield, a consultant paediatric ear, nose and throat surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital, London, breastfeeding rates could be improved if tongue-tie was treated. Tongue-tie is thought to affect one in five babies.It¿s where the frenulum, the string-like skin under the tongue, is too short. This restricts movement, making breastfeeding difficult or impossible . Indeed, research published in the Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health in 2005 found treating tongue-tie led to improved feeding in 95 per cent of babies. ‘The procedure to release the tongue is quick, cheap and can relieve distress for the mother and baby,’ says Mrs Caulfield. Tongue-tie can be cured easily with a snip of the stringy membrane to release the tongue — an operation called a frenulotomy. Cutting the frenulum takes just a minute. The procedure involves a tiny amount of blood loss and, in many cases, allows breastfeeding immediately. Even if babies are diagnosed, there are only 16 NHS centres offering treatment and waiting lists can be lengthy. The National Childbirth Trust is campaigning for tongue-tie treatment in every maternity unit. Justine was told she would have to wait two months for an NHS appointment because the GP didn’t consider her case urgent as Conor could take a bottle, so she went private. Justine Sullivan with her children Arlo, left, and Conor, right. After Justine¿s experience of tongue-tie with Conor, now aged four, she checked her second son Arlo as soon as he was born two years ago and he too was tongue-tie . However, some argue that many babies with the condition will not need treatment. ‘The vast majority of children with tongue-tie will have a mild to moderate form,’ says Dr Simon Newell, a neonatal consultant at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and vice president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. ‘Half will be able to breastfeed and so surgery is not necessary. But if the mother is having difficulty breastfeeding and other interventions have not helped, a tongue-tie division is a possible course of action.’ While complications of tongue-tie surgery are rare, if the procedure were to be carried out on every child with the condition, ‘we will end up seeing complications in children who didn’t really need it’. What doctors do agree on is that tongue-tie went out of fashion medically for several decades, effectively disappearing as a diagnosis. Mrs Caulfield believes it stems back to the introduction of formula milk in the Fifties.  ‘All babies used to be breastfed. Then it was thought to be unhygienic and unreliable, so went out of fashion and most babies were bottle fed,’ she says. Medical students were not taught about tongue-tie and it disappeared from text books because it was thought to be a cosmetic issue. ‘In the past, checking for this condition was routine after birth — if tongue-tie was found, the midwife would divide it there and then. ‘Now little importance is placed on it. When an edition of the British Medical Journal was dedicated to breastfeeding, there was no mention of tongue-tie.’ After Justine’s experience with Conor, now aged four, and discovering her partner Christopher Johnstone and his father were tongue-tied, too, she checked her second son Arlo as soon as he was born two years ago and diagnosed tongue-tie. She decided to have his operation done privately, both sons’ treatment came to £170. ‘Because Conor wasn’t checked for tongue-tie earlier, his first few weeks were traumatic,’ she says. ‘Parents are not taught about tongue-tie at ante-natal classes, yet an early diagnosis can make such a difference. We need to change that.’ For more information, go to tongue-tie.org.uk .","The string-like skin under the tongue, is too short, restricting movement .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . At 9:56pm U.S. Eastern Time on 20 July 1969, 94 per cent of American TVs were tuned to one thing: live coverage of Apollo 11 landing on the moon. But how did the general public get to be so enamoured by space exploration? The authors of a new book say it wasn’t by accident – Nasa ran a broad and extensive advertising campaign that ensured the public would be sold on the idea of going to the moon. In Marketing the Moon authors Scott and Jurek highlight some of the advertising campaigns Nasa ran in the days of the Apollo programme in order to sell the public on missions to the moon, such as Disney's Tomorrowland (pictured) which imagined the possibilities of spaceflight . The remarkable images in the book reveal some of the advertising campaigns Nasa ran. In hindsight, some of their tricks and methods seem blindingly obvious now. But back in the day, they served to increase the profile of space exploration. In 'Marketing the Moon: The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program', which is on sale tomorrow in the UK and already on sale in the US, authors David Meerman Scott and Richard Jurek tell the story of how Nasa sold the Apollo programme to the public. It is, they say, one of the most successful marketing and public relations campaigns in history. The two of them are avid collectors of space memorabilia and in their book they have compiled over 200 adverts, TV stills and photographs from their private collections they have accumulated for two decades. They reveal how massive campaigns were launched by Nasa in one of the first instances of ‘brand journalism’. They don’t, however, say it was a bad thing – rather, it was deemed necessary at the time in order to drum up public support. Nasa was keen to flaunt its astronauts at every opportunity, leading to them often having many appearances on TV. Here astronauts from the Apollo 15 mission appear on the Dick Cavett show in 1971 . On the left, Apollo 12 Commander Pete Conrad advertises a pair of Revo sunglasses, while on the right Omega advertises their 'space-themed' watch . Some companies were so proud of their involvement in the space programme that they would send reporters detailed schematics and diagrams of the components they had built to garner more press coverage . ‘Imagine convincing the American . public to spend as much as four percent of the national budget in some . years, to send 12 people to the surface of the moon,’ Scott tells . Forbes. ‘It was a crazy thing to do and marketing got us there.’ Co-author . Jurek adds that ‘Apollo was Nasa’s Super Bowl event – targeted, . scheduled, and sustained, with enough global interest to draw a big . audience-share in a world with less media and communication choice.’ But today, the authors say, Nasa is challenged by trying to engage a fractured, global audience in their endeavours. ‘From . a marketing perspective, Nasa is involved in so many areas, that there . is no unified theme that pulls a large enough focused audience. It is a . challenge many marketers face in many industries,' says Jurek. ‘One . needs to think of Nasa like Coca-Cola. If you just defined Coca-Cola by . Coke, then you would miss its many other brands and message channels . like Sprite, Fanta, Dasani, Fresca, etc. ‘We went to space to explore the moon, but in the end we discovered the Earth. ‘Things . might have been completely different if we had found signs of life or . precious metals and raw resources on the moon. Instead, we saw Earth as a . fragile blue marble — and started to look inward.’ Nasa's unprecedented marketing campaign across all forms of media had the goal of getting the public excited about the prospect of a manned space programme and ensuring support for the agency continued to flow . Nasa signed an agreement with Life magazine (left) until 1962 that gave them exclusive astronauts to the astronauts. On the right is a memo sent from ex-journalist Paul Haney to Alan Shepard, Commander of Apollo 14 and later Director of Public Affairs at Nasa, pleading him to keep the actions of the astronauts unedited and unscripted . A host of items including drinks (pictured) were given a 'space-theme' to drum up support for the Apollo programme . Nasa began in rather contentious circumstances – at the outset of the American space programme, the government was unsure whether to leave space exploration to the military or make it a civilian programme. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) became operational on 1 October 1958. Back then it was afforded as much as 4% of the national budget; now it is under 1%. Its annual budget for 2012 was $17.8 billion. It has conducted a host of mission across the solar system. These . include the first manned missions to the moon, the first missions . to the outer solar system and the first rovers on Mars. Thanks to the efforts of Hugh Dryden, Deputy Administrator for Nasa from 1958 to 1967, it was the latter that became the case. Nasa was formally signed into being on 29 July 1958, and with that the cosmic expectations of the nation were placed on its shoulders. The Administrators of Nasa over the next decade, Keith Glennan and then James Webb, were both all too aware of the support the agency would need to succeed in the goal, set by Kennedy in 1961, of beating the Soviet Union to the moon. Thus, with James Webb in particular, he built Nasa not only into a well-rounded scientific agency but also one that had public relations high on the agenda. Nasa hired a host of media veterans to head its PR team, supplying the press with all the material they needed to keep the public informed about the agency’s space efforts. ‘By having journalists work as the conduits for Nasa to the outside world, Nasa was perfectly positioned to deliver news and information content that could be quickly assimilated into the news streams of the day,’ says Jurek. Up until 1962, for example, they signed an exclusive agreement with Life magazine to grant them access to the astronauts and their wives. Across other magazines and newspapers, Nasa began to highlight how space exploration was not necessarily just something of science fiction. Rather, it was creating technologies that would benefit the common person. And their astronauts were not backroom scientists – they were charismatic men, most of them pilots, and Nasa made sure to flaunt them at every opportunity to the public. Here a news channel reports live on Apollo 13, which at the time in April 1970 was stranded in space after an explosion on the spacecraft . Some companies were so proud of their involvement in the space programme that they would send reporters detailed schematics and diagrams of the components they had built to garner more press coverage . The end result of all this intense marketing and PR to boost the profile of space exploration was that on 20 July 1969, 94 per cent of American TVs were tuned in to watch Neil Armstrong take humanity's first steps on the lunar surface . Product placement was also a big deal, with cameras, watches, drinks and more given space-themed reboots. Marketing the Moon shows off some of these public relations attempts made by Nasa in a series of vintage photographs, artwork and advertisements. And this rare collection, containing many unpublished pieces of memorabilia, helps to tell the story of how those 94 per cent of American TVs were all tuned to Armstrong's first steps on the moon. ‘Given their pioneering brand journalism and real-time marketing efforts, Apollo is the single most important case study for modern PR and marketing practitioners in the last 100 years,’ says Jurek. ‘The space program became a victim of its own success, and rather than having its successes extended across all of the government enterprise, the American people missed out on an opportunity for further innovation and productivity. Scott adds: ‘[Apollo] accomplished the most audacious goal ever attempted by humans. I don’t see anything remotely like that today. ‘The reason we haven’t landed humans on Mars is due to a lack of marketing and PR. By invoking a quest, Kennedy motivated us. ‘If we’re ever going to conquer space again, we need a powerful story to get us there.’","New book reveals the intense marketing campaign undertaken by Nasa to drum up support for the Apollo missions .

Even naughtier stars such as Rihanna and Snoop Dogg can rake in the dollars by attaching their image to a brand. But how would these famous faces have fared in the 'golden age' of advertising? One French creative has set out to answer that question through a set of fascinating images. David Redon, an art director at an advertising agency in Paris, has created a selection of prints merging famous vintage adverts with modern-day celebrities. Advertising executive David Redon has merged retro adverts with modern celebrities, including singers Rihanna and Drake in a vintage beauty advert, referencing their single 'Take Care' Pharrel was matched with a toothpaste advert incorporating his single 'Happy' David Redon creates the posters by retouching old adverts. Here he has inserted Daft Punk into a gambling ad . Snoop Dogg makes a fitting bar tender in this poster for gin . Each celebrity is paired with a retro advert referencing their career or personality, whether that's Daft Punk playing poker for a 'Get Lucky' casino poster or Michael Jackson's 'Beat it!' transformed into a poster for mosquito spray. Other cameos include Rhianna and Drake in a beauty ad entitled 'Take Care', Amy Winehouse advertising 'Back to Black' coffee and Pharrel and his 'Happy' Toothpaste. David told Adweek that he had explored the project as of way of showcasing the fine line between art and the consumerism. David Redon cleverly selected adverts that fitted with celebrities he wanted to feature . Outkast's André 3000 is re-imagined as Uncle Sam from the famous 'I Want You' army recruitment posters . Nivana blend seamlessly into an ice cream advertisement . Cypress Hill made a fitting match for a mental health advertisement . Micahel Jordan's Nike campaign is transformed into the famous Rosie the Riveter poster . 'I . like the shift between vintage and modern pop culture, because these . days the border between art and commercial is very small, and artists . work their images like brands do.' The French creative went on to tell Adweek that, surprisingly, the amazingly accurate images aren't as time consuming as you might imagine. 'I started working on this project last summer, but it started to buzz maybe two months ago. It takes me one or two hours to create an ad. I search for the ads I like and then retouch in the artists and sometimes modify the layout, create a logo, etc.' Following his success David's prints have even become available to buy on the American home-wears site, Society6.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Plenty of teachers might be scoring an A for effort but a U for their strategy of motivating pupils ahead of important exams. Teachers who use the fear of failure in a bid to get students to knuckle down and revise hard for GCSEs and A Levels may be having a negative effect on their success, according to a new study. Students who were told that failing an exam would prevent them from finding a good job reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in exams than those given encouragement. Heads down: Students who were told that failing an exam would prevent them from finding a good job reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in exams than those given encouragement. Pupils taking a GCSE mathematics exam are pictured . U.S. scientists recently found that taking notes using a laptop could be harmful to academic performance as they encourage ‘mindless transcription’. They found that students putting pen to paper displayed a better grasp of concepts that they had just learned. Pam Mueller of Princeton University and Daniel Oppenheimer of UCLA studied college students in classrooms where some used laptops and others traditional notebooks. They discovered that the students using laptops were more likely to take more notes in a lecture than those using a pen. But they were also more likely to simply write down what was said in a ‘mindless transcription’. Both groups of students memorised around the same amount of facts from the lecture, but those using laptops did not display as deeper an understanding as those using pens when asked about ideas behind the facts half an hour later. In another experiment students who took hand written notes scored higher in  a test and were better able to study than other students who typed their notes. The study, led by Edge Hill University in Lancashire, looked at different styles of pre-exam persuasive messages used by teachers, the impact they can have on students’ motivation and ultimately, their academic performance. ‘Teachers are desperately keen to motivate their students in the best possible way but may not be aware of how messages they communicate to students around the importance of performing well in exams can be interpreted in different ways,’ said educational psychology expert, Professor David Putwain. The study found that messages that used scare tactics, such as ‘if you fail the exam, you will never be able to get a good job or go to university,’ achieved fewer positive results than messages that focused on success, like ‘the exam is really important as most jobs that pay well require that you pass and if you want to go to college you will also need to pass the exam’. Students who said they felt threatened by messages that frequently focused on failure reported feeling less motivated and performed worse in their tests than students who reported that their teacher used fewer fear tactics. Stress: The study looked at different styles of pre-exam persuasive messages used by teachers, the impact they can have on students' motivation and ultimately, their academic performance. The findings come as many students face stress (illustrated) revising for their GCSEs and A Levels . ‘Both messages highlight to students the importance of effort and provide a reason for striving,’ Dr Putwain said. ‘Where these messages differ is some focus on the possibility of success while others stress the need to avoid failure’. The results of the study which are published in the American Psychological Association’s School Psychology Quarterly, come at a time of stress for many students in the UK who are preparing for GCSEs and A Levels. Researchers interviewed 347 students over an 18-month period leading up to their GCSEs and were asked questions such as: ‘How often do your teachers tell you that unless you work hard you will fail your exam?’ and ‘Do you feel worried when your teachers tell you that your exam is getting nearer?’ The questions were designed to measure how threatened the students felt and they were asked to rate each of them on a scale of one to five, where one was ‘never’ and five being ‘most of the time. Their responses were compared to the students’ final grades after 18 months. Dr Putwain said: ‘Teachers should plan what types of messages would be the most effective and how they could be incorporated into the lesson plans.’","The study, led by Edge Hill University in .

I asked her to share some of her tried-and-tested wisdom .  .  . Can you sum up your attitude to a healthy diet in one sentence? It’s not what you eat some of the time that makes you healthy, it’s what you eat most of the time. What are a couple of your healthy store cupboard staples? Coconut oil – it soothes your digestive tract, keeps your metabolism revved, and keeps you full. I add cinnamon to everything. It’s a great natural sweetener, helps satisfy sugar cravings, balances your blood sugar and contains fibre. You drink quite a lot of tea too, don’t you? Herbal tea, yes. Ginger and nettle help with digestion, South American mate gives me energy and Runa clears my mind. But mainly, tea can be a good way of beating cravings. Should it be five-a-day, seven- a-day .  .  . or even ten-a-day? I tell clients to eat greens until they’re coming out of their ears. Salad wisdom: Robyn Youkilis' taught Ruby how to make the perfect kale salad by 'massaging' the raw leaves with avocado . I started having a kale smoothie for breakfast thanks to you! That’s perfect. But mix it up,  try everything green. What’s your food nemesis and how do you avoid eating it? Peanut butter. I will literally fall into the jar, spoon first, and come out days later. If I end up there it’s because something else in my life is off balance. Our cravings are gateways telling us something else is wrong. I mostly keep it out of the house. What are the most common problems you help clients with? Usually they want to lose weight, and they’re trying to make better decisions but they’re still confused. What’s your one tip for eating healthily even when too busy? Master the simple act of .  .  . chewing! It gives your digestive system time to register that you  have eaten. No pain no gain: Samantha Cameron reportedly enjoyed a Shiatsu massage on holiday . Cherie and Tony Blair were famously fans of a nice firm massage – on the table of fitness guru Carole Caplin. Now it seems Samantha Cameron is getting in on the act, reportedly ‘indulging’ in Shiatsu massage while on holiday in Lanzarote over Easter. I put the word indulging in inverted commas because this Japanese type of body manipulation, which works on the same principal as acupuncture and reflexology, involves lots of pinching, pulling, and pain. It can be used to treat everything from general stress to digestive problems and even migraine. You do feel fabulous afterwards – but it is far from relaxing. The trend for being a weekday vegan might . sound daft in a ‘what IS the point?’ kind of way. But I was interested . to hear that former US President Bill Clinton, who famously gave up . eating meat or animal-derived produce completely in a bid to improve his . cardiovascular health, has started eating fish again on the advice of . his doctor, Mark Hyman. I’ve met Hyman and he sums up his philosophy: . ‘It’s hard being a vegan to eat enough good, quality protein and [easy] . to have too much starch,’ he said. ‘I know a lot of fat vegans.’ I was interested to read that in a recent poll, 42 per cent of US workers had left a job due to an excessively stressful environment. Meanwhile 61 per cent of American workers believe that work stress has been a cause of illness  for them. In a lot of cases, the office environment itself can be to blame – and I for one know that since leaving my job to work for myself, I feel ten times healthier. Not least, it got me away from the office feeders, who loved to crack open the chocolate biscuits  at 4pm every day on the dot. Here's a fitness fashion  must-buy! I recently travelled Down Under to visit friends and family in Australia and came across Vie Active, a new fitness label based near Bondi Beach. I definitely took a bit of time out from my usual exercise routine while I was away, but the brilliant leggings, worn by a model on the left, have inspired me to get back in the gym pronto.

"By . Fiona Macrae, Science Correspondent . Coming up with ideas could be as easy as a walk  in the park. We think more creatively when taking a stroll than when sitting, according to a study. Surprisingly, it is not being outside that matters, it is the exercise itself. Researcher Marily Oppezzo said: ‘Many people anecdotally claim they do their best thinking when walking. With this study, we may finally be taking a step forward to discovering why.’ Thinking time: We could be up to twice as creative while we are walking, a study has found . Dr Oppezzo, of Santa Clara University in California, did a series of experiments in which people undertook tests of creativity, such as playing word association games, while walking or while sitting at a desk. In one experiment, the volunteers came up with twice as many clever ideas when walking. Big idea: What if it applied to our canine friends? The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory and Cognition, also revealed that walking is more important than being outdoors. Volunteers who walked, indoors or outdoors, came up with more ideas than those who sat inside – or were pushed in a wheelchair outside. Dr Oppezzo said: ‘While being outdoors has many cognitive benefits, walking appears to have a very specific benefit of improving creativity.’ The benefits lasted even after sitting down, meaning big decisions needn’t necessarily be made on the hoof. Dr Oppezzo added: ‘Walking before a meeting that requires innovation may be nearly  as useful as walking during the meeting.’ However, some things are best done sitting down. Questions with just one right response were more accurately answered from the desk. Dr Oppezzo said that walking is good for the mind, as well as the heart. However, more research is needed to work out how it fires the imagination.","Academics in California made people undertake tests of creativity .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A brown dwarf star that appears to be the coldest of its kind - as frosty as Earth's North Pole - has been spotted by an American astronomer. The discovery was made using Nasa's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) and the Spitzer Space Telescope. Images from the space telescopes also pinpointed the object's distance at 7.2 light years away, making it the fourth closest system to our sun. A star as cold as Earth's North Pole has been discovered 7.2 light years away. The chilly brown dwarf, which would be the fourth closest system to our sun, was spotted by Nasa's Wise telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescopes (artist's impression of the star shown) 'It is very exciting to discover a new neighbour of our solar system that is so close,' said Kevin Luhman, an associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State and a researcher in the Penn State Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds. 'In addition, its extreme temperature should tell us a lot about the atmospheres of planets, which often have similarly cold temperatures.' Brown dwarfs start their lives like stars, as collapsing balls of gas, but they lack the mass to burn nuclear fuel and radiate starlight. The newly-found brown dwarf, named Wise J085510.83-071442.5, is thought to have a chilly temperature between -48°C to -13°C (-54°F to 9°F). Previous record holders for coldest brown dwarfs, also found by Wise and Spitzer, were about room temperature. Although it is very close to our solar system, Wise J085510.83-071442.5 is not an appealing destination for human space travel in the distant future. 'Any planets that might orbit it would be much too cold to support life as we know it,' Luhman said.'This object appeared to move really fast in the Wise data,' said Luhman. 'That told us it was something special.' The closer a body, the more it appears to move in images taken months apart. Above you can see how the star was tracked over two periods by the Wise and Spitzer telescopes . Airplanes are a good example of this effect: a closer, low-flying plane will appear to fly overhead more rapidly than a high-flying one. Wise was able to spot the rare object because it surveyed the entire sky twice in infrared light, observing some areas up to three times. Cool objects like brown dwarfs can be invisible when viewed by visible-light telescopes, but their thermal glow - even if feeble - stands out in infrared light. After noticing the fast motion of Wise J085510.83-071442.5 in March, 2013, Luhman spent time analysing additional images taken with Spitzer and the Gemini South telescope on Cerro Pachon in Chile. Spitzer's infrared observations helped to determine the frosty temperature of the brown dwarf. Spitzer is designed to detect infrared radiation, which is primarily heat radiation. Its . highly sensitive instruments allow scientists to peer into cosmic . regions that are hidden from optical telescopes, including dusty stellar . nurseries, the centres of galaxies and newly forming planetary systems. The . telescope's infrared 'eyes' also allows astronomers see cooler objects . in space, like failed stars, extrasolar planets, giant molecular clouds . and organic molecules that may hold the secret to life on other planets. Spitzer was launched on August 25, 2003 and was designed to have a lifespan of at least two-and-a-half years. Over . the past decade Spitzer has taken over two million images of the Milky . Way, which have now been stitched together to create the panorama. It has spent 172 days or 4,142 hours taking pictures of the ‘disk’ or plane of the Milky Way in infrared light. Wise J085510.83-071442.5 is estimated to be three to 10 times the mass of Jupiter. With such a low mass, it could be a gas giant similar to Jupiter that was ejected from its star system. But scientists estimate it is probably a brown dwarf rather than a planet since brown dwarfs are known to be fairly common. Combined detections from Wise and Spitzer, taken from different positions around the sun, enabled the measurement of its distance through the parallax effect. This is the same principle that explains why your finger, when held out right in front of you, appears to jump from side to side when you alternate left-eye and right-eye views. Wise 0855 is the fourth closest stellar system to our sun, although it is not thought to either be habitable itself or able to host any habitable planets. However, its discovery suggests there could be more such 'hidden' brown dwarfs lurking near us that are waiting to be discovered . In March . of 2013, Luhman's analysis of the images from Wise uncovered a pair of . much warmer brown dwarfs at a distance of 6.5 light years, making that . system the third closest to the Sun. His . search for rapidly moving bodies also demonstrated that the outer solar . system probably does not contain a large, undiscovered planet, which . has previously been referred to as 'Planet X' or 'Nemesis.' 'It . is remarkable that even after many decades of studying the sky, we . still do not have a complete inventory of the sun's nearest neighbors,' said Michael Werner, the project scientist for Spitzer at Nasa's Jet . Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which manages and operates Spitzer. 'This . exciting new result demonstrates the power of exploring the universe . using new tools, such as the infrared eyes of WISE and Spitzer.'","An extremely cold star has been found in our cosmic neighbourhood .

"By . Mark Prigg . Facebook has bought a fitness tracking app that can tell users exactly where they walked, and how many calories they burnt. Facebook announced the deal today, but did not reveal how much it paid for ProtoGeo Oy, the 2-year-old Helsinki company that makes the Moves app. It is the latest in a spree of acquisitions for Facebook which have included WhatsApp and virtual reality headset maker Oculus. The Moves app allows users to track how far they walk each day, and exactly how many calories they burn - as well as showing them exactly where they went. The app uses a smartphone's built-in sensors to track a person's physical activity, recognizing movements such as walking, cycling and running. The free Moves app has been downloaded more than 4 million times for iPhone and Android phones, according to ProtoGeo. The app can use GPS, or the motion sensor built into Apple's latest iPhone 5S handset. The move gives the social networking company an entry into the nascent market for fitness and health monitoring technology. Facebook did not disclose the price it paid for ProtoGeo Oy, the 2-year-old Helsinki company that makes the Moves app. A Facebook spokesman said the price for ProtoGeo, which has fewer than 10 employees, was not anywhere near what the company had paid for other higher-profile acquisitions recently. Facebook has begun 2014 by going on a shopping spree, paying $19 billion for mobile messaging service WhatsApp in February and $2.3 billion for virtual reality headset maker Oculus VR a couple of weeks later. The app maker took to its blog to announce the deal, and assured custiomers their data would not be gioven to Facebook. 'For those of you that use the Moves app – the Moves experience will continue to operate as a standalone app, and there are no plans to change that or commingle data with Facebook,' it said. Fitness tracking is attracting the attention of large and small technology companies, with companies such as Fitbit and Jawbone selling electronic bracelets that measure the wearer's activities. In March, Google Inc announced a special version of its Android operating system aimed at smartwatches and other types of wearable computers. The Android Wear project will enable devices that can be outfitted with a variety of sensors to track a user's heart rate or measure the distance jogged, Google said. With the Moves app, Facebook can enter the market without developing its own wearable computing hardware. The app can track walking, running and cycling . The app uses a smartphone's built-in sensors to track a person's physical activity, recognizing movements such as walking, cycling and running. Facebook said Moves, which would continue to operate as a separate app, fit into its recent strategy of offering a variety of standalone mobile apps, such as Instagram for photo-sharing, Facebook Messenger for messaging and WhatsApp. Sampo Karjalainen, whose official title is 'designer CEO' of ProtoGeo, began working at Facebook's Menlo Park headquarters last week, the Facebook spokesman said. The free Moves app has been downloaded more than 4 million times for iPhone and Android phones, according to ProtoGeo.","App has been downloaded over 4 million times .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . A Chicago-based entreprenuer has come up with something worth getting egg-cited about after inventing a gadget that scrambles an egg inside its own shell. The £10 ($17) contraption gently spins the egg, blending the yolk and the white without cracking the shell itself. The already-scrambled egg can then be soft or hard boiled - and its creator, Geraint Krumpe, claims the ingenious method makes them taste far better than regular eggs. Scroll down for video . The device, which features a capsule for the egg suspended between two cords, was inspired by a Victorian era child's toy. Pulling the two cords apart causes the capsule to gently spin, mixing the egg's contents without damaging the fragile shell. Mr Krumpe is currently seeking funding for the product, named Goose, on crowdsourcing website Kickstarter and if successful plans to launch the product later this year. It's no yolk: A Chicago-based entreprenuer has invented a gadget that scrambles an egg inside its shell . Egg-cellent system: Pulling the two cords apart causes the capsule to gently spin, mixing the egg's contents . Cracking invention:  Geraint Krumpe, a 37-year-old industrial designer, said the idea for the Goose gadget came about after he found a video online in which a guy claims to make an in-shell scrambled egg with a tea towel . The gadget works by alternating the rotation of an egg back and forth.Pulling the two cords apart causes the capsule to gently spin, mixing the egg's contents without damaging the fragile shell. Because the egg is scrambled inside the shell there, air doesn’t get into the egg.  ‘The result is a much creamier, custardy tasting egg which is far superior to normal scrambled eggs,’ said Mr Krumpe. Mr Krumpe, 37, who is an industrial designer, said: ‘The idea for the Goose all started when I found a video online in which a guy claimed to make an in-shell scrambled egg with a tea towel. ‘I didn't believe it could be done so I decided I had to give it a go. I quickly used up all the eggs in my fridge and not one attempt was successful. ‘Something sparked inside me and I became obsessed with trying to find an easy way of scrambling an egg in its shell every time. ‘I remembered seeing a Victorian child's game that involves pulling two cords apart to spin a disc and thought I could apply the same principals in my design. Eggs-traordinary: The gadget works by alternating the rotation of an egg back and forth. Because the egg is scrambled inside the shell there, air doesn’t get into the egg. The result is a much creamier, custardy taste . Sunny side up: ‘‘In the culinary world people are always looking to create different flavour profiles using the chemistry of cooking and this is exactly what the Goose does’, said Chicago-based  inventor Geraint Krumpe . Eggs-tra special: Gadget took a year to create and is raising funds for development on Kickstarter . ‘I worked on the Goose for one year before I finally got the finished product. The result is a gadget that can fit any egg in and is guaranteed not to break the shell. ‘In the culinary world people are always looking to create different flavour profiles using the chemistry of cooking and this is exactly what the Goose does.’ Because the egg is scrambled inside the shell there, air doesn’t get into the egg. ‘The result is a much creamier, custardy tasting egg which is far superior to normal scrambled eggs,’ said Mr Krumpe. ‘The Goose is all about injecting a little bit of fun back into the kitchen.’ No shell-fishness: ‘The Goose is all about injecting a little bit of fun back into the kitchen,' said Geraint Krumpe .","£10 ($17) gadget was created by Chicago-based designer Geraint Krumpe .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . It has been suggested that the Roman empire, complete with its powerful armies, ambitious architectural feats and impressive reach, came to an end because of lead poisoning. But now an international team of scientists studying the lead content of ancient tap water has largely disproved the theory. The team found that Roman tap water contained 100 times as much lead as water straight from springs nearby, but the lead content was probably not enough to put ancient citizens at risk. Like a game of Cluedo: Scientists and archaeologists are not convinced that lead piping used to transport water to wealthy Romans' villas (pictured) is to blame for the fall of the Roman Empire but say it contained 100 times as much lead as water straight from springs . Lead poisoning is caused by increased levels of lead in the body, which is toxic to many organs and tissues, including the heart, bones and kidneys. Symptoms include abdominal pain, confusion, headaches, irritability and can result in seizures, coma and death. Some historians claim that as lead levels in water drank by powerful and wealthy Romans were high, leaders were incapacitated or killed off, which helped lead to the decline of the Roman empire. However, this latest study largely disproves their theory. There is ongoing debate as to what happened to the Roman Empire in the 4th and 5th centuries but many include the disintegration of political, military, economic and social institutions combined with invasions at the peripheries of the sprawling empire. Jerome Nriagu, a geochemist, argued in a 1983 book that 'lead poisoning contributed to the decline of the Roman empire.' His work centred on the fact that the Romans had few sweeteners besides honey and often made a syrup called defrutum or sapa in lead pots to sweeten wine and food, leading to the creation of lead acetate - as well as drinking water carried in lead pipes and bathing in it in municipal baths. He calculated the level of lead that wealthy Romans consumed and linked the findings to levels of the metal found in preserved bones. However, his work proved controversial and has been criticised by leading historians. Wealthy and powerful Romans drank water from lead cups and jugs, carried to their villas by a complex system of lead pipes, which some historians argue weakened the Roman elite and in turn contributed to the demise of the empire which they ruled. The study says:‘It is now universally accepted that utilisation of lead for domestic purposes and water distribution presents a major health hazard. The ancient Roman world was unaware of these risks. ‘How far the gigantic network of lead pipes used in ancient Rome compromised public health in the city is unknown.’ In a bid to find out, the scientists and archaeologists from the CNRS UMR research centre in Lyon, France, Rice University in Houston and the University of Southampton, took samples of sediment from the harbour basin at Portus, which was an industrious port in imperial Rome, as well as from a channel of the River Tiber. They . compared the lead isotopes in the samples with those extracted from . Roman lead pipes to make a historical record of water in Rome. The team discovered that Roman water probably contained around 100 times as much lead as spring water. However, while the levels are high, the . experts said that the lead content in water was unlikely to be high . enough to be harmful to humans and all but ruled out the role of lead poisoning . as a reason for the demise of the powerful empire, Science Mag reported. Wealthy and powerful Romans drank water from lead cups and jugs, carried to their villas by a complex system of lead pipes, some of which lined aqueducts (like this one on major Roman Road, the Appian way) which some historians argue weakened the Roman elite and in turn contributed to the demise of the empire . The experts said that the lead content in water was unlikely to be high enough to be harmful elite Romans, pictured in this marble relief . Pipes were only one source of lead contamination at the time as lead was used to make cooking pots, to store food and some wine, as well as for jewellery and make-up, which could cause some historians to argue that their theory of lead weakening the Roman elite still has credence. The argument that the Roman civilisation collapsed as a result of poisoning was first made around 30 years ago by geochemist Jerome Nriagu and has even been used by a handful of scientists to try and persuade governments to ban lead from gasoline. ‘Although today lead is no longer seen as the prime culprit of Rome’s demise, its status in the system of water distribution by lead pipes (fistulæ) still stands as a major public health issue,’ the scientists wrote. In their study, published in journal PNAS, the experts charted lead content at major events in Rome’s history, such as  the Gothic Wars in 535AD, Byzantine repairs to Roman aqueducts and the ninth century Arab sack of Rome. ‘The Pb [lead] isotope record shows that the discontinuities in the pollution of the Tiber by lead are intimately entwined with the major issues affecting Late Antique Rome and its water distribution system,’ it says. The scientists think their research will help historians who are tracking the changing character of Italy’s capital. Scientists and archaeologists took samples of sediment from the harbour basin at Portus, which was an industrious port in imperial Rome, as well as from a channel of the River Tiber (pictured near the Mausoleum of Hadrian) to analyse lead content .","Some historians have argued that lead poisoning killed off many elite Romans that drank water carried to their homes by a network of lead pipes .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . From counting to ten to looking away, people have many strategies for preparing themselves for a moment of discomfort, such as injection. Now a study has found that magnifying a body part can help dull the intensity of pain. One expert believes that magnification works because a person’s attention is drawn to the place where they are expecting pain,which allows them to mentally prepare themselves. Magnification decreases pain: A new study has found that magnifying a hand (stock image) can help dull the intensity of pain. One expert believes that this could be because a person's attention is drawn to the place where they are expecting pain and they are able to lessen it because they are better prepared for discomfort . Chronic pain sufferers could soon find relief in an unusual place - by shining a light on the affected area. Researchers at Stanford University have used beams of light to control pain in mice. The team found they were able to switch receptors on and off, raising hopes the same technique could one day be used in humans. 'Patients could be given their own ability to create a pain block on demand,' said Michael Kaplitt, a neurosurgeon and chief scientific officer of Circuit Therapeutics, a San Francisco firm working with the researchers to develop a treatment for humans. In the experiment, scientists shone a blue light on mice with light-sensitive molecules in the nerve endings in their skin to inflict pain and used a yellow light to block nerve impulses. The experiment demonstrated that it is possible to turn on and off nerves causing pain at will. 'This approach may have utility in basic and translational pain research, and enable rapid drug screening and testing of newly engineered opsins,' the team said. In an experiment described in the journal . Neuropsychologia, researchers subjected participants to a pinprick on . one fingertip after using a lens to either magnify or ‘shrink’ the size . of the hand receiving the pinprick. The scientists then compared participants’ responses in the hand that appeared completely normal – neither magnified nor appearing smaller – to them, LiveScience reported. They measured the change in sweat production on the hands to examine the conductance response, or electrical properties, of the skin, which indicates the level of arousal in humans, Daniele Romano, an experimental psychologist at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy, explained. When a human is aroused – scared or excited – the skin produces more sweat - which boosts its electrical conductivity. Scientists found that when participants saw their hand under a magnifying glass, they felt a less intense pain than in the hand that they viewed normally. Differing pain: In a previous experiment, Lorimer Moseley, a professor of pain science at the University of South Australia found that magnifying hands made the pain worse for sufferers of chronic hand pain (illustrated). The opposite findings demonstrate that people have very different experiences of pain . They reported anticipating the pain more when the hand appeared larger, which Dr Romano believes indicates that when people pay extra attention to the body part waiting for pain, they are more mentally prepared for the sensation and it hurts slightly less. However, the science of pain is not precise and people feel it differently. In a previous experiment, Lorimer Moseley, a professor of pain science at the University of South Australia found that magnifying hands made the pain worse for sufferers of chronic hand pain. Professor Moseley said: ‘The brains of healthy volunteers are different than the brains of people with, for example, chronic complex regional pain syndrome.’ Dare to watch: Dr Romano thinks that some people might find getting an injection or a tattoo less painful if they watch the process carefully or if it is magnified . Dr Romano thinks that some people might find getting an injection or a tattoo less painful if they watch the process carefully. ‘What we obtain at the behavioural level, not at the physiological level, is that we change the unpleasantness of the stimulation and not the intensity. The more you anticipate, the less you will respond,’ he said. However, while this might work well for some people, Professor Mosely warned that others might find looking away works better for them.","A psychologist of University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy, thinks magnification works as people are prepared for pain and therefore feel it less intensely .

"By . Emily Crane . An Australian woman who tested positive for the same BRCA2 gene as Angelina Jolie has died, just weeks before she was due to undergo urgent cancer treatment in China. Gold Coast resident Elisha Neave, 36, delayed having a preventative mastectomy and hysterectomy after testing positive for the gene disorder that gives an 80 per cent risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Despite her sisters having the operation, the mother-of-one initially delayed preventative surgery to have more children. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Fighting for the cause: Elisha Neave (pictured left) took part in many cancer fundraisers before losing her own battle with the disease . Her two older sisters, who also tested positive to the gene, had their breasts removed immediately but Elisha decided to wait so she could have another child. She was diagnosed with cancer in March 2012 at the age of 34. Elisha underwent treatment in Australia but with no sign of improvement and weighing just 34kg she travelled to Germany for treatment. Despite the cancer weakening by 95 per cent, it returned in a more aggressive form. She was due to undergo intense and urgent treatment in China but her partner Brendan Hopp told the Gold Coast Bulletin they had to delay the flights because of poor health. Elisha died in hospital early Wednesday morning surrounded by her family. Battling through treatment: Elisha Neave pictured in hospital while receiving cancer treatment . Fighting for life: Brave Elisha sought treatment for the aggressive cancer but her delayed initial preventative surgery . ‘I held her hand the whole time and she passed very peacefully... she had accepted it,’ Mr Hopp said. ‘In February last year, doctors said it would be a miracle if she made it to Christmas 2013 but she made it all the way to April 2014.’ Her family announced her death via a Facebook post on Wednesday afternoon. ‘After the bravest of fights our little girl slipped away peacefully at 12.30 last night with Dad’s tunes on the radio amid the laughter and tears that comes with a typical Neave gathering,’ the post read. ‘As you can imagine we are feeling very fragile broken and so pleased and comforted that she is free from pain and now we have two angels guiding and watching over us.’ Elisha’s father passed away from cancer last year. She is survived by her 10-year-old son Jack.

"By . Oliver Pickup . Updated: . 07:58 EST, 27 October 2011 . It may sound nuts, but a Cornish pasty company has today revealed that grey squirrel meat is its latest tasty filling on offer. The sisters who own Cornish Food Box company in Truro, Cornwall, insist the woodland creatures are the ultimate in free-range, sustainable meat because of their diets. The nuts and berries the animals eat - and a life of scampering up and down trees - makes them a tasty and healthy alternative to more traditional cuts of beef, chicken or pork, according to the company. Tasty? Grey squirrel is now on the menu at the Cornish Food Box company in Truro, Cornwall . They have announced the £2.95 for a ready-to-cook squirrel that will feed a family of four, and remark they are good value when compared to chicken or beef. Co-owner Lucy Jones said the response from customers at the shop had been positive. She told MailOnline: 'We just sell local food - food from Cornwall - and a customer asked up whether we could get grey squirrel meat, so we spoke to our game supplier, and he said it would be no problem. Yummy: Lucy Jones (left) with baker Nicki Foley and her squirrel pasty . Taking a bite: Ms Jones (left) says that her company, which she owns with her sister, focus on sourcing local food . 'The customer who asked for the meat wanted to make grey squirrel pasties. And so we sold the squirrel meat and she made the pasties. 'At a time when people are looking closely at food miles and ethics, grey squirrel is the ultimate in environmentally sustainable meat. 'It's very local and it's very free-range. 'There's the whole thing about Squirrel Nutkin, but that's about red squirrels, not greys. 'Some people say they're cute but if you're willing to eat lamb then why not squirrel?' Ms Jones, a vegetarian who shares the business with her sister, continued: 'I think squirrel is more popular as a meat these days, and I think people are more willing to try new things, and other meats out there. 'We think it is good if people think beyond eating just pork and lamb.' Grey squirrels have been introduced to the UK over the past two centuries and are now thought to outnumber the native population of red squirrels by about 70 to 1. The company is donating any profits made from the squirrel sales to the Red Squirrel Survival Trust, which works to ensure the conservation and protection of the red squirrel in the United Kingdom. Keen baker Nicki Foley suggested putting squirrel into a classic pasty to encourage people to try the delicacy. She left the squirrel chunks to simmer on a low heat with juniper berries and then wrapped the meat in bacon for the pasty filling. 'You don't need a lot of it because it's very strong in flavour,' she said. 'One squirrel would be perfect for a family to have a stew or a curry.'","£2.95 ready-to-cook squirrel will feed family of four .

"Yet it is nothing compared to The Howgate Wonder which weighed in at a astonishing 3lbs 11ozs in 1997, making it a Guiness Book of Records world beater . By . Daily Mail Reporter . A supermarket in China is selling a giant apple for £664 in Nanjing, capital of eastern China's Jiangsu Province. According to supermarket staff, the apple weighs 2.65lb and is from Japan. The freak apple also has a Buddha picture on the front. This was formed by wrapping the growing apple in a bag with a Buddha picture on and over time sunlight caused the image to transfer onto the apple. Yet it would appear that there aren't many takers for the whopper as this particular specimen has apparently been on sale for the past two months. Corker: The giant apple has a Bhudda picture imprinted on the front of it . No takers: Despite its enormous size and splendour there have been no takers for this beauty grown in Japan . But according to expert Oliver Wilkins, head of fruit, vegetables and herbs at RHS Garden, Wisley, the apple's size is insignificant compared to the biggest one ever recorded. The Howgate Wonder weighed in at a astonishing 3lbs 11ozs in 1997, making it a Guiness Book of Records world beater. It was grown by Kent farmer Alan Smith who said he grew the apple on a 17 year old tree and that he first noticed it when it became the size of a ten pin bowling ball. Wilkins added that apples can be grown to these huge sizes naturally and that they are not necessarily genetically modified. Big boy: Compared to the other apples on the shelf it is far superior but coming in at a cost of £664 means nobody has taken it home with them . Overgrown: The apple looks more like a pumpkin or a marrow and has become a source of much amusement for the local shoppers . And despite being worth £664, the . mammoth Japanese grown apple also pales in comparison to some of the world's other most . expensive fruits. Two years ago in Cornwall a pineapple was valued at a . purse-busting £10,000 – making it the world’s most expensive piece of . fruit - and quite a price for something which has spent most of its life . under several tons of horse manure. The . pineapple was nurtured over two years using traditional Victorian . gardening techniques at the Lost Gardens of Heligan, the botanical . attraction in Cornwall. Horticulturalists . created tropical conditions in small greenhouses heated using a . chemical reaction between 30 tons of horse manure and urine, and piles . of straw. A gardener who works at the Lost Gardens of Heligan said the pineapple cost around £1,200 to grow. But even this was pipped in June 2013 when a Japanese buyer spent £10,300 on two melons. The record-breaking . Yubari, or canteloupe, melons were sold during an auction at Sapporo . Central Wholesale Market in northern Japan where they are considered a status symbol. Expensive: Canteloupe, or Yubari, melons like these ones are a status symbol in Japan .","The apple has caused quite a stir amongst Chinese shoppers left amazed by its size and imprint of Buddha .

"By . James Salmon . Dyson, founded by Sir James Dyson in 1993, is launching a £250million expansion programme . British engineer Dyson has confirmed plans to create 3,000 science and engineering jobs as part of its biggest ever expansion. The ambitious £250million programme is a major boost to Britain’s manufacturing industry and will be seen as another sign that the UK economy is springing back to life. Today Dyson is applying for planning permission to build a big laboratory and campus– complete with its own sports pitch -  next to its existing headquarters in Malmesbury, Wiltshire. If it receives approval it hopes to open  the new laboratory in 2016. Some 1,000 engineers and scientists will be employed in the new facility to work on a range of high-tech projects, including domestic robots as well as robot vacuum cleaners. The firm then hopes to build another two laboratories, employing an extra 2,000 staff. Dyson was founded by investor Sir James Dyson in 1993 after he launched the first bagless vacuum cleaner, the DC01. It has become one of the great British manufacturing success stories, producing its 50 millionth machine last year.

"By . Mark Duell . A university is probing claims that some of its Muslim students are enforcing segregation between men and women, it emerged today. Leicester University spoke of its concerns over photos showing hand-written signs requesting that male and female students sit in separate areas at a public talk by the university’s Islamic Society. The meeting - which discussed God’s existence - was addressed by Islamic speaker Hamza Tzortzis, who speaks at various campuses and was involved in controversy at another university last month. Talk: The meeting - which discussed God’s existence - was addressed by Islamic speaker Hamza Tzortzis (pictured), who speaks at various campuses and was involved in controversy at another university last month . As reported by MailOnline, University College London banned his Islamic Education & Research Academy group from its campus after the organisation tried to segregate men and women during a debate. The latest incident in Leicester saw A4 sheets of paper attached to an entrance door with the words ‘brothers’ and ‘sisters’ and arrows pointing in opposite directions, reported the Daily Telegraph. The University of Leicester Islamic Society’s website also said in a separate notice that meetings are open to the public, but it has ‘segregated seating for brothers and sisters at all co-attended events’. Leicester University officials told the Daily Telegraph that they would investigate the signs in the photos and ensure that nobody will be forced to sit apart in the future - unless it is their preference. A spokesman for Mr Tzortzis’s group said genders were sometimes informally segregated at events. Worries: Leicester University spoke of its concerns over photos showing hand-written signs requesting that male and female students sat in separate areas at a public talk by the university’s Islamic Society . But he added that signs did not intend to ‘enforce’ separation - and that there were rarely any problems if non-Muslims chose to ignore the advice on where to sit. 'It is a little bit of a storm in a . teacup. It is down to a bit of a . misunderstanding about the way that Islam is perceived' Islamic Education & Research Academy spokesman . ‘It is a little bit of a storm in a teacup,’ he told the Daily Telegraph. ‘It is down to a bit of a misunderstanding about the way that Islam is perceived.’ Last month the segregation of men and women at the UCL event was halted only when one speaker, U.S. scientist Lawrence Krauss, walked out. Ignoring the jeering audience, he told an organiser: ‘Either you quit the segregation or I’m not interested.’ He objected after three people were removed from the room because they complained when they were told that only men or couples were allowed to sit at the front, with single women at the back. He returned when staff allowed men and women to mix. The public debate between atheist Mr Krauss and Greek Islamic convert Hamza Tzortzis was on the subject of ‘Islam or Atheism: Which Makes More Sense?’ UCL later issued a statement saying the iERA would not be allowed to hold events on its grounds again. Audience . member Dana Sondergaard wrote on her Facebook page: ‘After watching . three people be kicked out of the auditorium . . . Dr Krauss bravely . defended his beliefs of gender equality.’ The iERA later claimed the women had segregated themselves through choice.","Photos showed hand-written signs directing male and female students .

"By . Joel Christie . JP Morgan Chase has reportedly ordered the closure of hundreds of bank accounts registered to the names of people who work in adult entertainment, sparking outrage and confusion across the industry. Chase bank, a subsidiary of U.S. giant JP Morgan Chase, began sending out letters earlier this month to the entertainers, according to CNBC, informing them their accounts will cease on May 11. The letter, which has been posted on social media by several of the industry names involved, says the shut down was a result of a 'review' and apologizes for any inconvenience, however gives no further explanation. Pornographic actress Teagan Presley, who has a masturbatory device modeled from her body, told adult industry blog XBiz News a Chase employee said the reason for the termination was because she was in the 'adult business'. Shafted: Pornographic actress Leyton Benton says she found out her Chase account had been closed when her ATM declined on April 11, with the bank later telling her she was considered a 'risk' No explanation: Hundreds of these letters are said to have been sent out to people who work across the adult industry, however it does not given any real reason as to why their accounts are being closed . Porn star Teagan Presley, 28, said she has had the same Chase account since she was 18, that it remains in her legal name, Ashley Ann Erickson, and is only used for personal reasons . No explanation: Chase bank, a subsidiary of U.S. giant JP Morgan Chase, are yet to comment on the situation . 'I called them and they told me that because I am, I guess, public and am recognizable in the adult business, they’re closing my account,' she told the site. Presley said Chase also intend to close her husband's account, and that they were told it would not be possible to open another with the bank. 'This is personal': Porn star Teagan Presley said she was told by Chase her account was closed because of her profession . The letter reiterates that the terms and conditions of a Chase account state that 'either of us may close your account at any time, without notice and without a reason'. Presley, 28, later posted on Twitter: 'Thank you for @Chase for closing my personal account that I’ve had since I was 18 years old. I was with Washington Mutual before you bought them out. 'It's just ridiculous cause I don't do business with that account. I only pay my house bills with it. That's why it's personal.' The move has come as a surprise, given the adult entertainment industry generated close to $5 billion in revenue last year in the United States, according to Economy Watch. There is speculation the Department of Justice triggered the clampdown as part of a targeted effort to shut down certain industries by preventing them access to banking services, which they have called Operation Choke Point. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed last . Thursday, American Banking Association CEO Frank Keating wrote that the . Justice Department is 'telling bankers to behave like policemen and . judges'. 'Operation . Choke Point is asking banks to identify customers who may be breaking . the law or simply doing something government officials don’t like,' Keating wrote. 'Banks must then ‘choke off’ those customers’ access to financial services, shutting down their accounts.' Among the others to be caught up in the snafu is up-and-coming porn star Dakota Skye, who Tweeted her frustration. '#Chase has f—-d with people before with other issues. Should not get away with s–t like this,' she posted. Up-and-coming porn star Dakota Skye went on an expletive-riddled Twitter rant over the Chase situation . Discrimination: Porn veteran Veronica Avluv said her treatment by Chase was discriminatory because all the work she does is legal . Tegan Avluv said her account was being foreclosed as well, calling the move discrimination because the work that she does is legal. 'If it's a legal job then discrimination shouldn't be allowed. At all,' she wrote to blogger Perez Hilton, who first published one of the Chase letters. Leyton Benton, also an industry name, told TMZ her account was shut earlier this month, April 11, and she found out only when her ATM was declined. She told the site Chase told her she was a 'risk' and wouldn't further elaborate.

"By . Adam Duggan . He has a shambolic personal life and a chronic alcohol addiction which would kill a man with less seasoned liver. Yet despite these foibles, the fictional detective is perfectly capable of cracking even the most fiendishly difficult of crimes. Now a top police officer has called for authors to put aside the stereotypes exemplified by characters such as Ian Rankin’s Rebus in favour of clean-living coppers who are closer to real life. Bad example: Self destructive Inspector Rebus, played here by Ken Stott, is not an accurate description of modern policing, according to Chief Constable Nick Gargan . Inspector Morse (John Thaw), right, another television detective depiction Nick Gargan disagrees with . Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan also said that the work done by one man in many stories would actually be carried out by a team of 40. ‘You see a Rebus or Morse at the scene, recovering forensic exhibits, interviewing the suspect, comforting the family, arguing with the chief constable about resources’, he told The Guardian. ‘What can be a team of 20, 30 or 40 people is concentrated in the person of this one senior investigator. There are some pretty damaged individuals in too many of these books. ‘I'd quite like to see some cheery, well-balanced, well-adjusted, equally successful investigators.’ Jane Tennison (Helen Mirren), right in Prime Suspect: another police procedural series in which writers present a flawed detective taking on the job of more than one person . Chief Con Gargan, who was speaking before a talk at Chipping Norton literary festival, said he accepted that an honest depiction of police procedure would generally put audiences to sleep. But the Queen’s Police Medal winner added that officers had to operate within the law and a Rebus-style approach to policing was not acceptable. Some television viewers might disagree with what he’s saying, but Mr Gargan knows the realities of the modern police force better than most crime writers. Entering the force in 1988, he worked considerably on the investigation into the death of Princess Diana and was awarded the Queen's Police Medal in the New Year's Honours List of 2012. Queen's Police Medal recipient Nick Gargan, who has come out against the depiction of fictional police detectives and called on crime writers to portray them in a more admirable manner . Detective Inspector John Rebus, created by Scottish author Ian Rankin, on the other hand lets his personal and professional issues intertwine and often acts outside the law when making decisions, which would no doubt see him face disciplinary action if he was a real life cop. In January a senior detective in Wiltshire Police was found guilty of gross misconduct after failing to read a killer his rights before he was led to two bodies - behaviour that shows striking similarities to Rankin's fictional character. Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher should have repeatedly cautioned taxi driver Christopher Halliwell as he showed him where two victims, Sian O'Callaghan, 22, and Becky Godden-Edwards, 20, were buried. The double confession was inadmissable in court because Wiltshire Police officer Mr Fulcher, 49, had broken Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) rules. It was a scene that could have been pulled straight out of a crime novel, but with much more serious consequences for the real life detective. 'The rules and laws are there for a reason. It's not heroic to step outside the law. We shouldn't do that. We're the police', Gargan said.","Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan criticises stereotypical depiction of detectives as rule-bending and self-destructive .

"By . David Martosko In Washington . The Obama administration rewrote the CIA's official story about the Dept. 11, 2012 terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, judging from 12 different versions of a summary that emerged Friday. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has claimed that the intelligence community was solely responsible for drafting and revising the document - known now as the Benghazi 'talking points - and that editing by political appointees in the administration was limited to changing no more than two words. But ABC News reported that the State Department had direct influence on the edits, and specifically requested the removal of references to the al-Qaeda-affiliated terror group Ansar al-Sharia, and the deletion of references to CIA warnings in the months before the attack that terror attacks in the eastern Libyan city were expected. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . ABC News uncovered 12 versions of the infamous Benghazi talking points, suggesting that the Obama administration - specifically the State Department - was more involved with editing them than it has admitted . The last version of the talking points, with all references to terrorism removed, shows a final edit - changing 'Consulate' to 'diplomatic outpost - the only edit that White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has linked to administration appointees . In one email leaked to ABC, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland raised a red flag about the CIA-written portion which warned that 'The Agency has produced numerous pieces on the threat of extremists linked to al-Qa’ida in Benghazi and eastern Libya.' 'Since April,' the CIA assessment continued, 'there have been at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants, including the June attack against the British Ambassador’s convoy. We cannot rule out the individuals has previously surveilled the U.S. facilities, also contributing to the efficacy of the attacks.' Nuland emailed White House and intelligence officials, warning that the sentences 'could be abused by members [of Congress] to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings, so why would we want to feed that either?' The words in question did not appear in the final version that was distributed to members of Congress. Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. In subsequent emails, the CIA stuck to its guns, retaining language that said, 'we do know that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa’ida participated in the attack,' naming Ansar al-Sharia. The draft went on to specifically name the al Qaeda-affiliated group named Ansar al-Sharia. After Nuland objected again, saying that terrorist groups should not be named because the administration did not 'want to prejudice the investigation,' a member of the National Security Council staff noted that 'The FBI did not have major concerns with the points and offered only a couple minor suggestions.' But Nuland wrote that 'my building' - likely referring to the State Department's top leadership - was still unhappy. Ultimately, according to the emails ABC News unearthed, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes conceded that the State Department’s concerns should be considered. White House press secretary Jay Carney told the press that the administration had a 'nonsubstantive' role in editing the talking points, but new emails suggest otherwise . UN Ambassador Susan Rice told five different TV audiences one day after the talking points were finalized that the Benghazi attack was the product of a spontaneous protest over an anti-Islam YouTube video. The CIA had already determined, days before, that Islamic terrorists were to blame . Carney has briefed the press and insisted that 'the CIA drafted these talking points and redrafted these talking points.' 'The fact that there are inputs is always the case in a process like this, but the only edits made by anyone here at the White House were stylistic and nonsubstantive. They corrected the description of the building or the facility in Benghazi from consulate to diplomatic facility and the like.' Any input the White House did have likely came at a meeting of White House deputies four days after the attack. 'The significant edits – deleting references to al Qaeda and the CIA’s warnings – came [that] White House meeting,' ABC News reported on its blog. On the day following that meeting, UN Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on five television talk shows and kept to the resulting line that a spontaneous protest – not a terror attack – was behind the destruction of the consulate and the loss of life. Nuland, ABC News adds, was not at the deputies' meeting and did not prepare Rice for her interviews. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland's emails show that the agency, then headed by Hillary Clinton, had a direct hand in altering the official story on the Benghazi terror attack . Inside the White House press briefing room (at right), Jay Carney will brief the press today and is expected to face spiraling allegations that the Obama administration had a hand in editing the now-infamous Benghazi talking points that obscured the cause of a 2012 raid on the U.S. Consulate in that eastern Libyan city . 'We must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities, including those of the State Department, and we don’t want to undermine the FBI investigation,' Rhodes emailed the group reviewing the talking points. 'We thus will work through the talking points tomorrow morning at the Deputies Committee meeting.' Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has become the focus of post-Benghazi political wrangling, with Republicans on Capitol Hill accusing her of stonewalling a congressional investigation and adding accusations of an administration cover-up. Clinton is likely to run for president in 2016, Democratic political analysts predict, making the performance of her agency a political football. The State Department did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens (L) and three other American personnel died in the Benghazi attack, now understood to have been carried out by Ansar al-Sharia and other al-Qaeda-linked groups . The U.S. Consulate was left in ruins after terrorists' pre-set mortars rained down and rocket-propelled grenades caused fires and explosions on Sept. 11, 2012 . But Clinton's tenure at State will continue to be a source of controversy. A career diplomat who was second-in-command in Libya on the night of the Benghazi attack testified before Congress on Wednesday that a commando team was turned back from flying from Tripoli to Benghazi after the State Department intervened. Gregory Hicks quoted an Army colonel telling him over the phone that 'this is the first time in my career that a diplomat has more balls than somebody in the military.'","State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland objected to the CIA's summary, which concluded that terrorists killed four Americans .

Hot . dry winds blowing out to sea whipped embers onto other neighborhoods on . six densely populated hills where people live in poorly constructed . homes without municipal water or sewer connections, fire hydrants or . streets wide enough for emergency vehicles. On Monday, there was no end in sight. Helicopters were flying without pause, dumping water on hotspots. Aid . was flowing in from all over Chile to Valparaiso, where evacuees . crowded into eight shelters. Hundreds of young volunteers climbed hills . carrying bottles of water and shovels to help victims search the ruins . of their homes. 'We're . going to rebuild right here. Where else would we go?' said Carolina . Ovando, 22, who lost the humble home she kept with three small children. Schools were closed, some of them damaged by fires and others jammed with evacuees. Hotspot: Fires they thought were contained 24 hours after they started Saturday kicked up again with Sunday afternoon's winds and raged out of control, threatening more neighborhoods . Exhausted: Firefighters take a break as they struggled for a second night to contain blazes that have killed 15 people, injured 500, destroyed 2,000 homes and forced 10,000 people to flee . Dense housing: With no municipal water or fire hydrants to use, routes to the blazes blocked by narrow streets jammed with abandoned vehicles and countless embers being stoked, fire crews could do little but watch some neighborhoods burn . Picturesque: Valparaiso is a picturesque oceanside city of 250,000 people surrounded by hills that form a natural amphitheater . Powerless: From the sky, 20 helicopters and planes were mobilized to drop water on hotspots, but firefighters were still forced to stand by and watch as neighbourhoods burned out of control . House on fire: ost of the people live in the hills, and the city owes its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site to their colorful homes, built on slopes so steep that many people commute using staircases and cable cars . Danger: What's beautiful in postcards can be dangerous for those who live there: Many people have built on land not fit for housing, and entire communities lack municipal water connections . Navy . officer Julio Leiva said Monday that the death toll rose to 15. Most of . the bodies were too badly burned to identify without DNA tests, the . national forensics service said. More than 500 people were treated at . hospitals, mostly for smoke inhalation. Bachelet . coordinated the emergency response with her Cabinet, cancelling a trip . to Argentina and Uruguay. She asked Chile's neighbors for backup in case . of other fires, freeing Chilean planes and helicopters to join the . fleet in Valparaiso. Argentine . Foreign Minister Hector Timerman promised to collaborate with rescue . teams and water-dumping planes. From the Vatican, Pope Francis sent a . message sharing his prayers. Tragedy: Three of the 15 victims were identified, and the others are so badly burned that DNA tests will be done . Fire emergency: Chile's emergency response system generated automatic phone calls to each house in danger as the mandatory evacuations expanded . Blocked roads: Many people stuffed their cars with possessions after getting these calls, and streets quickly became impassible . Stuck downhill: Water trucks and firefighters were stuck downhill as people abandoned their vehicles and ran. Some carried television sets and others took canisters of natural gas, fearing an explosion if flames reached their homes . Heightened security: Some 1,250 firefighters, police and forest rangers battled the blaze while 2,000 sailors in combat gear patrolled streets to maintain order and prevent looting . Bachelet . put the entire city under military rule, and 5,000 firefighters, . police, forest rangers, soldiers, sailors and civil defense workers . joined the response. Cars were banned from streets leading up eight of . the Valparaiso's hills so emergency vehicles could get through.

It warns, 'Vote for us, or it's time for some traffic problems in Brentwood,' a Los Angeles neighborhood where many Emmy voters live. The warning is a reference to lane closures last year at the heart of the scandal and a now-infamous email about them. Bridget Anne Kelly, a since-fired aide to Gov. Chris Christie, wrote before the closures, 'It's time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' referencing the New Jersey town that saw days of traffic jams. Federal prosecutors are investigating.

"By . Mike Dawes . Magic Johnson is at the center of the racism scandal surrounding the LA Clippers owner but new reports reveal that he may be plotting a bigger role in the eventual ending. The former NBA superstar is reportedly vying for a chance to own the Clippers himself, and is hoping that the recording that features the team's current owner Donald Sterling making racist comments about African-Americans may help Johnson get back in the game. 'Magic's absolutely interested,' a NBA source told Yahoo News. New leadership? Magic Johnson is reportedly interested in buying the LA Clippers amid the racism scandal surrounding the team's coach, Donald Sterling . The retired player is the most famous member of Guggenheim Partners, a financial services firm worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and has worked with them to buy professional sports teams in the past. This wouldn't be the first time that Johnson and Guggenheim Partners bought an area team, as they paid $2.15billion for the LA Dodgers in 2012. More recently, they tried to buy the LA Lakers but the Buss family that owns the team refused a sale. The investment group made another big buy in February, effectively bailing out the area's women's basketball team, the Sparks, when it was about to fold. Analysts have speculated that the move wasn't so much out of equal opportunity goodwill, but really in an effort to get on the good side of the NBA administrators in order to make a future purchase of a men's team more likely. 'This is 100 per cent Magic's plan,' an anonymous league official told Yahoo. Tirade: The recording stemmed from a conversation between Sterling and his girlfriend V. Stiviano (right) after she posted this photo with Magic Johnson to her Instagram account . Not quite a reality: Sterling (left) cannot be forced into a sale by the team or the NBA but Johnson (right) and his investment team have a history of buying local sports franchises . The . fact that Johnson has already been an unintended character in the . racism scandal just makes the hypothetical solution fit even more . nicely. The controversial recording was released over the weekend and is believed to show Sterling condemning his girlfriend V. Stiviano for posting a picture of she and Johnson on her Instagram feed. He goes on in lengthy recording, telling her: 'Don't put him (Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.' A sale to Johnson and the Guggenheim group is far from a done deal, however, as there is no way that the Clippers organization can oust Sterling, who bought the team for $12million in 1981. Owner's spot: Johnson and his financial partners bought the LA Dodgers baseball team for $2.15billion in 2012 and he is a regular at the games (at the 2014 season opener and at right a week later) The Daily Beast suggests that given the current climate of overpaying for relatively-unknown teams, the current pricetag for the Clippers could be boosted from $575million to $1billion. That leaves any and all action in the hands of the NBA which can really only issue fines and temporary penalties but cannot force him to give up the team. 'If the owners can't force (Sterling) to sell, they need to be held accountable to change the bylaws so they can,' an unidentified member of the NBA's board of governors told Yahoo. 'A fine and suspension is meaningless, and that'll be seen as a lack of acceptance that the league and owners are responsible for this a******.'","Magic Johnson and his investment partners have a history of buying LA-area sports teams but has yet to purchase an NBA franchise .

"By . Jack Doyle . The activities of a Chinese IT company are to be probed by security chiefs amid fears of links to cyber-espionage. Telecoms giant Huawei, which was founded by a former Red Army officer, is a major provider of phone and broad technology in Britain following a multi-billion pound deal with BT in 2005. But last month an influential committee of MPs raised concerns the equipment could be used by Beijing to spy in the UK. Telecoms giant Huawei, which was founded by a former Red Army officer, is a major provider of phone and broad technology in Britain following a multi-billion pound deal with BT in 2005 . The company denies both spying and links to the Chinese State and military. Concerns over a lack of safeguards led to the creation in 2010 of a Cyber Security centre in Oxfordshire known as The Cell - to check and approve Huawei equipment. But MPs on the Intelligence and Security committee criticised the ‘self-policing’ arrangements after they discovered staff at the centre were employed by the company and not by GCHQ, the government’s listening centre. Their report said China could ‘intercept covertly or disrupt traffic passing through Huawei-supplied networks’,  adding that oversight of the firm in the UK is ‘feeble’ and suffers from the ‘absence of any strategy’. Yesterday the Cabinet Office announced a review of the site would be carried out by the national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch. He will report to David Cameron later this year. It will consider whether GCHQ should play a bigger role in the centre’s management or even supply all of its employees. Yesterday the Cabinet Office announced a review of the site would be carried out by the national security adviser, Sir Kim Darroch. He will report to David Cameron later this year . A Cabinet Office spokesman said it took threats to Critical National Infrastructure very seriously. But he added: ‘However, we are not complacent and as such we have agreed to the main recommendation of the report to conduct a review of Huawei’s Cyber Security Evaluation Centre to give assurance that we have the right measures and processes in place to protect UK telecommunications.’ Huawei welcomed the review, but defended security arrangements at the site, pointing out that all staff had high level security clearance. A spokesman said: ‘Huawei shares the same goal as the UK government and the ISC in raising the standards of cyber security in the UK and ensuring that network technology benefits UK consumers.’ The company’s technology is contained within the green boxes on British streets which link households to the national phone network. Last year a committee of US politicians urged American firms to stop doing business with the company. warning that China could use equipment made by the companies to spy and threaten vital national communications systems.","Telecoms giant Huawei is major provider of phone and broad .

"By . Graham Smith . Syria has started to move part of its chemical weapons arsenal out of storage facilities, according to U.S. officials. The country's undeclared stockpiles of sarin nerve agent, mustard gas and cyanide have long worried the U.S. officials and its allies in the region, according to the Wall Street Journal. Western nations have looked for signs amid the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad's government of any change in the location of those weapons, believed to be the world's largest stockpile. Syrian policemen investigate a car bomb in Damascus today. The country has started to move part of its chemical weapons arsenal out of storage facilities, U.S. officials have warned . American officials are divided on the reason for moving the arsenal. Some fear Assad may want to use the weapons against rebels or civilians, while others said perhaps he is trying to safeguard them from his opponents. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, travelling with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Phnom Penh, said: 'We repeatedly made it clear that the Syrian government has a responsibility to safeguard its stockpiles of chemical weapons.' She added that 'the international community will hold accountable any Syrian officials who fail to meet that obligation'. President Bashar al-Assad's undeclared stockpiles of sarin nerve agent, mustard gas and cyanide have long worried the U.S. and its allies in the region . The Syrian government denied chemical stockpiles have been moved, the Journal said. Syria is one of eight states - along with Israel and nearby Egypt - that have not joined the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which means the world's chemical weapons watchdog has no jurisdiction to intervene there. The Assad government has in the past denied having weapons of mass destruction. The development comes a day after more than 250 Syrians were reportedly killed after a village was shelled and stormed by pro-government forces. The massacre in the Sunni Muslim village Taramseh, Hama province, would be the worst yet since a rebellion against the rule of Assad began 17 months ago. Civilians were allegedly killed 'execution-style' with shots to the head while others were shelled by tanks and helicopter gunships as their homes were burned down. The Revolution Leadership Council of . Hama said Taramseh was subjected to a barrage before pro-government . Alawite militiamen swept in and killed victims one-by-one. There . were reports of bodies scattered in the surrounding fields, rivers and . houses, with around 60 corpses were taken to a mosque. Fadi Sameh, an opposition activist from Taramseh, left the village before the killings but was in touch with residents. He . said: â€˜It appears that Alawite militiamen from surrounding villages . descended on Taramseh after its rebel defenders pulled out, and started . killing the people. â€˜Every family in the town seems to have members killed.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Neanderthals are thought to have been brutish and ruthless creatures, stopping at nothing to survive their harsh environment. But, it turns out, we may have underestimated our distant cousins. New research reveals Neanderthals made good parents and their children were well-cared for as part of the social group. Happy families: Archaeologists at the University of York have challenged the traditional view that Neanderthal childhood was difficult, short and dangerous . This is according to British . researchers who have challenged the traditional view that Neanderthal . childhood was difficult, short and dangerous. Cavemen children ‘experienced strong emotional attachments with their immediate social group’ according to the study. Researchers at York University also said there was evidence that Neanderthals cared for their sick and injured children for months and often years. The traditional view of cavemen children is that they had a tough upbringing, but that is based largely on biological evidence. However the archaeologists, led by Dr Penny Spikins, looked at cultural and social evidence by examining Neanderthal burials. In research published in the Oxford Journal of Archaeology, it found that children played a particularly significant role in their society, particularly in symbolic expression. Neanderthal groups (skull, pictured) are believed to have been small and relatively isolated, which meant a natural emotional focus on close internal relationships . The study of child burials, meanwhile, revealed that the young may have been given particular attention when they died, with generally more elaborate graves than older individuals. Neanderthal groups are believed to have been small and relatively isolated, which meant a natural emotional focus on close internal relationships. Dr Spikins said: ‘The traditional view sees Neanderthal childhood as unusually harsh, difficult and dangerous. ‘This accords with preconceptions about Neanderthal inferiority and an inability to protect children epitomising Neanderthal decline. ‘Our research found that a close attachment and particular attention to children is a more plausible interpretation of the archaeological evidence, explaining an unusual focus on infants and children in burial, and setting Neanderthal symbolism within a context which is likely to have included children. ‘Interpretations of high activity levels and frequent periods of scarcity form part of the basis for this perceived harsh upbringing. ‘However, such challenges in childhood may not be distinctive from the normal experience of early Palaeolithic human children, or contemporary hunter-gatherers in particularly cold environments. ‘There is a critical distinction to be made between a harsh childhood and a childhood lived in a harsh environment.’ Europeans may be closer to their Neanderthal cousins than previously thought, new research suggests. Breeding with Neanderthals has long been known to have left its traces in the DNA of modern Europeans. Scientists in Edinburgh have now confirmed that the genetic similarity between the two must have arisen after interbreeding in Europe and Asia, before our ancestors spread across the globe. Previous research speculated that modern Europeans and Asians are related to Neanderthals because they originated from a similar sub-population in Africa. Both groups evolved from a common ancestor in Africa before spreading to other parts of the world. The two groups emerged at different times with Neanderthals leaving the African continent more than 200,000 years before humans did. Now scientists at the University of Edinburgh and Wageningen University found the species mated in Europe and Asia thousands of years ago. The research involved dividing up the genetic code of each sub-species to calculate the statistical likelihood of distant or recent interbreeding. They traced the biological ties that exist between humans and the ancient species which are believed to have died out around 30,000 years ago. The research found that the two per cent of neanderthal DNA which exists in people today came from the mating outside of Africa.","Isolated Neanderthal groups had a focus on close internal relationships .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron’s plan to cut immigration could cost Britain £300billion, the official economic watchdog warned today. The Office for Budget Responsibility warned the loss of taxes paid by migrants would far outweigh the costs providing extra benefits or school and hospital places. The Tory plan to reduce net migration to below 100,000 would, over a 50-year period, increase national debt by 20 per cent or £300billion in today’s prices, the OBR claimed. Robert Chote, chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, insisted migrants provide more in tax than they cost in public services . Mr Cameron has pledged to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ but last year it emerged net migration – the difference between people arriving and those leaving - had risen for the first time in two years to 182,000. The OBR has repeatedly put itself at odds with government policy on immigration, claiming in July that the UK would need 7million extra immigrations over 50 years to meet the costs of caring for the elderly. Today OBR chairman Robert Chote told the House of Commons Treasury Committee that immigration boosts national income. He argued that migrants are more likely than native Britons to be of working age and less likely to make use of benefits, pensions and healthcare - even after taking into account additional spending on schools, GP surgeries and hospitals to cater for incomers. Prime Minster David Cameron wants to cut net migration to under 100,000 but in the latest figures it rose to 182,000 . Mr Chote told MPs: ‘Essentially speaking, inward migrants are more likely to be of working age than the population in general. ‘They arrive after some other country has picked up the expense of educating them and in some cases - though not all cases - they leave the country again before you get to the point at which they are most expensive, in terms of pensions, healthcare and long-term care. ‘In terms of the fiscal position, that is what drives the fact that higher net inward migration over this time horizon does tend to produce a more beneficial picture.’ The OBR argues that allowing 140,000 immigrants of working age into Britain each year – totalling 7million over 50 years – would fill jobs and raise taxes for Treasury coffers. The coalition is split on the issue of immigration, with Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable dismissing the Tory target as unworkable and risking the economy. He was backed by Mr Chote, he warned that with fewer inward migrants, ‘the fiscal position would be somewhat worse’. The OBR's Fiscal Sustainability Report, produced last year, predicts that public sector net debt will stand at just under 100 per cent of GDP by 2063 if net migration continues at 140,000 a year. But it will reach as much as 140 per cent of GDP if it is reduced to zero. A half-way point, to model the impact of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands, would lead to a rise in debt as a proportion of GDP of around 20 per cent, the committee was told. Open door policy: Without high levels of migration to Britain, public debt will balloon to become larger than the entire economy, the Office for Budget Responsibility said . Conservative committee member David Ruffley asked whether the OBR had taken into account additional spending on services like nursery and school places for migrants' children and the extra demands they make on GP surgeries and hospitals. Mr Chote stressed that future governments have the power to alter the fiscal outcome of a shift in migration levels by changing policies in other areas: . ‘Clearly if you made a choice on migration, or an assumption on migration, that made the fiscal position look better or worse, then you could adjust other policies to compensate for that. ‘There is no level of net inward migration you have to have for there to be fiscal sustainability. It's an influence on a whole variety of other choices government has to make.’","David Cameron wants to reduce net migration to the 'tens of thousands'

Three other sponsors, Kia Motors America, energy drink maker Red Bull and hardwood flooring retailer Lumber Liquidators, said they are suspending their advertising and sponsorship activities with the team. Insurer State Farm, said it 'will be taking a pause in our relationship with the organization.'

Sterling has become so unpopular that . companies that weren't even officially sponsoring his team have issued . statements. A spokesman for Anheuser-Busch, the 'Official Beer of the . NBA' said his alleged comments were disappointing. A Miller Lite . spokesman told Buzzfeed that the company is 'kind of assessing everything right now,' but added that they 'aren't actually an 'official sponsor of the team.' The Clippers declined to comment. The incident highlights the risks that companies face when they make sponsorship deals. The deals can bring goodwill when things are going well, but brands face a tough spot when they link themselves with teams or athletes that become mired in controversy. Advertising experts say that once the bad news it out there, a negative association could have already been made in the eyes of consumers. Allen Adamson, managing director of research firm Landor Associates, said there's little benefit for brands to stick with their sponsorship deals in this instance. 'There's some benefit in moving quickly,' he said. 'You can always renew your sponsorship later, but the longer you're linking your brand to a brand in trouble, the higher the risk.' Paul Swangard, managing director at Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon, said sponsorships like Carmax and Virgin America can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions, depending on terms of the agreement. He said many brands might be waiting to see what happens at the NBA's press conference on Tuesday. Tirade: The recording stemmed from a conversation between Sterling and his girlfriend V. Stiviano (right) after she posted this photo with Magic Johnson to her Instagram account . Interested: Johnson is interested in buying the team but Sterling cannot be . forced into a sale . 'The early indication is that this could be incredibly damaging to the franchise if things aren't dealt with quickly,' he said . This isn't the first time companies have had to consider whether to keep a sponsorship deal after a controversy erupts. Nike and other sponsors dropped disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong after his doping scandal. But many sponsors stood by golfer Tiger Woods after he acknowledged infidelities and went to rehab for sex addiction. Sterling has come under fire for comments he is alleged to have made in a recorded conversation with a woman. Portions of that conversation were released over the weekend by TMZ and Deadspin, leading to a national outcry. The NBA is planning a news conference Tuesday on its investigation into Sterling. Protest: Los Angeles Clippers players held a silent protest over Sterling's comments . Dropped: A CarMax sign at the dealership in Oak Lawn, Illinois, CarMax on Monday - the firm has told the LA Clippers they will no longer sponsor them while Donald Sterling is owner . 'CarMax finds the statements attributed to the Clippers' owner completely unacceptable,' Richmond, Va.-based CarMax Inc. said Monday in an emailed statement. 'While we have been a proud Clippers sponsor for 9 years and support the team, fans and community, these statements necessitate that CarMax end its sponsorship.' Bloomington, Ill.-based State Farm also described the remarks as offensive and said it will monitor the situation as the facts are sorted out. It will continue to run its Born to Assist ad campaign, which began in December 2012 and features Clippers point guard Chris Paul as himself and a fictional, mustachioed insurance-selling twin, Cliff Paul. State Farm said that campaign is part of its overall sponsorship of the NBA. Kia's suspension of sponsorship and ads with the Clippers does not affect its deal with Clippers star Blake Griffin, who appears in commercials for the car company.","Significant sponsors of LA Clippers announced on Monday that they are to withdraw or suspend their backing of the team while Donald Sterling remains owner .

Brothers Honghui, 20, and Hongtao, 18, were bother struck down with Uremia, a symptom of kidney failure, within months of each other in 2010. Unable to afford the mounting medical bills, their parents, Chuanyou and wife Zheng Tingxia, sold almost everything they owned in search of two matching kidneys to save their son's lives. Then, as time was beginning to run out, Hongtao locked himself in his room and drank pesticide, dying an agonising death. In a heart-rending gesture of brotherly love, his body was found by a note, which included the words: 'Brother, when you are cured, please tell me and it will be enough for me.' Ultimate sacrifice: As a result of his elder brother's death, Honghui (pictured), 23, successfully had a kidney transplant and doctors say he will live . Brother's love: Shutting himself in his room, Hongtao wrote a short note to his family and then drank pesticide before dying and agonising death .

Funan in Anhui province in the central of China. But then disaster struck when the eldest, Honghui, after a month of illness was diagnosed with uremia. Doctors told his parents that only a kidney transplant could save their son's life. But then, just as they were coming to terms with this disaster, Hongtao was diagnosed with the same condition. One step at a time: Father Gao Chuanyou (in background), 44, it is a bittersweet moment, telling local media, 'I wonder perhaps how we can afford to be happy with Gao Hongtao, but we will take it one step at a time.' Grief: Mother Zheng Tingxia lays flowers at her son's grave. His death prompted a flurry of donations, and after a two-year search, a match was found for his brother . The boys' father sold everything they had including their brand-new, almost-finished house and borrowed heavily travelling around the country to various medical institutes in a bid to find a solution. When the money ran out, teachers and friends of the two boys managed to raise another £10,000 for further treatment. But it was not enough. Doctors had hoped that a transplant from the parents might be suitable but the boys' father was not the right tissue match, while their mother fell seriously ill when she learned of her son's condition rendering her inadmissible as a donor. In the note he said: 'Having both of us is ruining you, I hope now that you will be able to concentrate on my brother and save his life. When he survives as I know he will, I simply want him to say to me I made it, and I will be content' Tragic sequence: The boys' mother stands in the family's home. Doctors had hoped that a transplant from the parents might be suitable but the boys' father was not proper tissue match and their mother fell ill rendering her kidney unusable . In order to continue the treatment to keep the boys alive, the parents even began begging on the street. Seeing his parents slowly falling into ruin and after learning that there was no tissue match, locked himself in his room, wrote a short note to his family and drank pesticide. There he died in agony. In the note he said: 'Having both of us is ruining you, I hope now that you will be able to concentrate on my brother and save his life. When he survives as I know he will, I simply want him to say to me I made it, and I will be content.' Moving: Doctors operate on Hongui. As soon as he gets out of hospital he plans to honour a line from his brothers final testament: 'Brother, when you are cured, please tell me and it will be enough for me' Dedication: Hongui is now recovering in hospital under the care of his father who sold everything to save his sons, including their brand-new house . Unfinished: The family had to sell everything, including the home they were building . His selfless act made headline across China and donations flooded in. Then, at the end of last yea, after a two-year search, a match was found. Honghui, now 23, has successfully undergone a kidney transplant and is expected to make a full recovery.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . and Ml Nestel . New Jersey Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski told MailOnline on Thursday evening that Republican Gov. Chris Christie is 'not believable,' and claimed a staffer who pleaded the Fifth during a 'Bridgegate' hearing represents 'just the tip of the cover-up.' Christie, said the lawmaker leading the probe into New Jersey's most improbable scandal since the last New Jersey governor was caught up in one of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history, is either 'a governor who can’t manage his staff or one who isn’t telling the truth.' In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the Democratic assemblyman said he was unimpressed with the governor's claim that he first learned Wednesday morning about a political payback plot involving his most trusted staffers and traffic entering the George Washington Bridge. 'It strains credibility,' he said, 'that a governor who is as hands-on as he is would suddenly have a senior member of his administration go rogue like this.' Wisniewski chaired an unusual public hearing Thursday afternoon in the state's capital city of Trenton, which saw a former Christie transportation appointee invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by refusing to answer questions. That one-time official, David Wildstein, was implicated in a plot to snarl traffic in Fort Lee, N.J. in retaliation for the refusal of the town's mayor, Mark Sokolich, to endorse Christie's 2013 re-election bid. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND DOCUMENTS . Garden State circus: Chris Christie fended off questions about his management on Thursday, taking responsibility for the bridgegate episode but blaming specific staffers who have now been fired . Christie, a possible Republican White House contender, took responsibility for the bridge scandal on Thursday, while announcing that he had fired a top aide . Right hand woman: Bridget Kelly was close to the New Jersey Governor and critics of Christie say she would not have done anything without taking orders . New Jersey Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski told MailOnline that Republican Chris Christie is either 'a governor who can't manage his staff or one who isn't telling the truth' Sokolich slammed Wildstein . directly Wednesday on MSNBC. 'David Wildstein deserves an ass-kicking,' he exclaimed. 'Sorry, there, I said it.' Wildstein resigned his post with the New York New Jersey Port Authority in December. In a raft of emails and text messages published by news outlets on Wednesday, he appeared to be orchestrating the plan along with Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and top Republican political consultant Bill Stepien. A day later Christie dismissed Bill Stepien, . his former campaign manager, who earlier in the week seemed destined lead the . state's Republican Party. Stepien also lost a . lucrative consulting deal with the Republican Governors Association, . which Christie leads. The New Jersey governor also fired Kelly. 'I . terminated her employment because she lied to me,' Christie said. 'I am . embarrassed and humiliated by the conduct of some of the people on my . team.' Wisniewski seemed to roll his eyes through the phone as he spoke to MailOnline. 'This is the takeaway,' he explained: 'Chris Christie can’t be trusted to run the George Washington Bridge. He certainly can’t be trusted to run a country.' A long-time New Jersey political operative told MailOnline that Kelly first worked with Stepien, and was apprenticed to him, during Christie's re-election campaign. She took orders directly from him, said the insider, who requested anonymity, making her the tie between the Christie administration and the state's Republican political machine. Grim: Christie's staff listen sullenly to his press conference hours after he fired a trusted co-worker . Betrayed: Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie said, lied when she was asked whether there was any truth in rumors the bridge closures were arranged . Contempt: David Wilstein faces the cameras before taking the Fifth at a state assembly hearing into the scandal . What me? Christie emerges from a personal meeting with the Fort Lee mayor where he apologized to him . Stepien's job, the source said, 'was to keep the governor's fingerprints off of things,' and Kelly's 'was to put plans into action.' 'If she pulled the trigger on all of this, it was on Bill's urging. He really trusted her.' Wisniewski, who chairs the New Jersey . Assembly's transportation committee, subpoenaed thousands of pages of . records from Wildstein, who refused to answer questions Thursday. He predicted that his committee 'will be issuing subpoenas for Ms. Kelly, for Mr. Stepien, and probably for others as well.' 'We’ve never had a hearing where someone took the Fifth so much,' Wisniewski said of Wildstein's turn on the hot seat. 'I mean, some of the questions were just about figuring out who a text message was from, or who it was sent to. That's hardly the kind of thing that creates legal liability for anyone.' 'David Wildstein is just the tip of the cover-up,' he claimed, referring to Christie administration officials' early explanation for the September traffic backups as part of a study aimed at determining how many toll booths were needed in Fort Lee. 'It’s very clear when you look at the documents that he among others engaged in enormous efforts to come up with a cover story for all of it, and to delay responses to Mayor Sokolich about what was happening.' Nothing on me: Christie departs his press conference after insisting he knew nothing and telling a reporter who asked him if he had considered resigning: 'That's a crazy question' Fall woman: Friends of Kelly told MailOnline that they believe she was deliberately made the 'scapegoat' 'Sad': Christie said he was disappointed in his staff's actions, but claimed it was a measure of leadership to act ruthlessly when you discover something had gone wrong . To support his theory that a cover-up likely reaches the top of the state's executive branch, he cited past hearings where Christie administration officials canceled their testimony at the last minute. 'We've had state officials tell us shortly before they were scheduled to testify in committee meetings that the governor's office told them not to participate. That happens with this governor,' Wisniewski recalled. 'So we know from our own experience as legislators that this governor reaches into his departments, tells commissioners what to do, what they can say. And now he expects us to believe that Bridget Kelly closed down three lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge on her own without his input? It’s just not believable.' Christie said Thurdsay that he was 'heartbroken,' 'blindsided,' and 'embarrassed and humiliated' as the story broke. 'I had no knowledge or involvement in this issue, in its planning or its execution,' he said during his lengthy press briefing. Wisniewski was skeptical. 'While there’s no direct documentary evidence that he’s lying,' he said, 'it strains credibility.' Fort Lee, New Jersey, Mayor Mark Sokolich (R) said former Christie aide David Wildstein 'needs and ass-kicking' Bottleneck: The ambulance took nine minutes to reach Mrs Genova as traffic backed up to cross the double-deck George Washington Bridge which spans the Hudson river between New York City and Fort Lee, New Jersey . Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democratic member of Congress whose district includes Fort Lee, agreed in an interview with the Bergen County Record that Kelly was likely following an order to orchestrate the bridge traffic shutdown. 'I . don't know who the person is that gave the ultimate order,' said . Pascrell. 'This did not, the young . lady did not just wake up one morning – when you see the emails – she . didn't just wake up one morning and decide ""let's screw up the traffic in . Fort Lee.'"" MailOnline spoke with a childhood friend of Kelly, who lamented her 'bad day at work.' 'It's a disgrace what's happening that she's the only one with egg on her face,' she said of the now-former Christie administration official. 'I believe this story is much more multifaceted than just Bridget Kelly. My friend has been scapegoated.' Bridget Kelly kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to Port Authority official David Wildstein on August 13, subpoenaed documents show . New Jersey Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg (R) said criminal charges could be coming in the Christie 'bridgegate' scandal . Wisniewski . also found unconvincing Christie's claim during his Thursday morning . press conference that his team had no motive to target Sokolich for . revenge. The mayor, Christie told reporters, 'was never mentioned to me as somebody whose endorsement we were even pursuing. ... So part of this is, I never saw this as political retribution because I didn't think he did anything to us.' But Wisniewski said there was 'clearly a political motive' in the bridge shenanigans. 'I’ve been told by people that there were political emissaries from the governor who did ask the mayor for an endorsement,' he told MailOnline, 'and he demurred.' And Fort Lee is an important Democratic stronghold, he added, with other political comings and goings beyond the gubernatorial race. 'Bergen County was an important spot for county races and statewide legislative races. This might have been about on of them,' he speculated. Christie met with Sokolich in Fort Lee for 45 minutes on Thursday afternoon, offering the apology that he promised during his morning press event and later calling it 'a very warm and productive meeting between me and the mayor.' Asked what he said, Christie added: 'I apologized. That’s what I came here to do.' Texts between two Christie aides depict a callous attitude toward the traffic chaos they caused, including a swipe at children of voters who supported Christie's gubernatorial candidate, Barbara Buono . Not-so-EZ-Pass: When three toll lanes originating in Fort Lee were suddenly forced to merge into one in September, traffic snarled for a week until authorities in New York City reversed the New Jersey officials' order . Sokolich accepted the apology and added that his 'biggest concern is that we make sure that this never, ever, ever happens again in the future.' 'We were unconditionally provided with that assurance,' the mayor said. Assemblyman Wisniewski said his committee staff would begin releasing the full collections of subpoenaed documents – 'somewhere between 3000 and 5000 pages' – on Friday morning, beginning with the material provided by Wildstein. GOP leaders at the national level . watched the drama unfold with an eye toward the 2016 race, with the . governor's supporters keenly aware that his performance will determine whether he is considered presidential material. Christie is set to be inaugurated for a second term as governor on January 21.

"By . Damien Gayle . A patent application filed by Apple has revealed that its long-mooted iWatch could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist. The innovative design, published for the first time today, reveals the technologies that could one day be seen in an Apple wearable computer. It comes after tidal waves of rumours and speculation on exactly what an iWatch might be like, including a range of designers revealing their take on the 'smart watch' - but none managed to predict what has emerged. A Japanese patent in February detailing Apple's plans for an iWatch followed an earlier application to the U.S Patent Office in 2011. This image, taken from the American Patent Application describes a 'wearable accessory device' which mounts a touchscreen on the user's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap . U.S. patent application no. 20130044215, filed by Apple in August 2011, specifies the technology for a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display'. It describes: 'A wearable video device ... comprising: a flexible substrate having a flat state and a curled state [and] a flexible display disposed upon a first surface of the flexible substrate.' The wrist band type device described in the patent application would attach to users' wrists using the same kind of mechanism as a slap wrap toy. Apple's latest patent application suggests the company is pushing forward with its plans to launch what's been dubbed the iWatch. A patent image, pictured, shows what the strap could look like . Popular among youngsters in the late Eighties and early-Nineties, slap wraps are bracelets consisting of layered, flexible stainless steel bi-stable spring bands sealed within a fabric or plastic cover. The bracelet can be straightened out, causing tension within the springy metal bands, then slapped against a wearer's forearm, causing the bands to spring back into a curve that wraps around the wrist. As expected by many Apple observers, the iWatch-like device described in the '44215 patent app would be 'configured to display information wirelessly transmitted from a portable electronic device', most likely an iPhone. As well as the touch-sensitive display, the application says it would include 'a communication link, allowing two-way communication between the slap bracelet and the portable electronic device.' 'Information generated on either device can be displayed on either the host device display or the flexible display,' the application says. Some of the most interesting innovations described by the application involve the manner in which the device could be powered. 'The battery can take many forms,' it suggests. 'For example, the battery can be distributed in nature by which it is meant that portions of the battery can be placed in disparate locations in the accessory.' It also describes methods in which the battery life could be extended, including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches.' 'An accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power generation, and could lengthen the amount of time between charging,' the application says. Accessory: The device would sync wirelessly with Apple's iPhone to provide a second screen for users to read messages from and input data to their mobiles . The patent application has emerged after a tidal wave of speculation suggesting how the iWatch could look. Apple has not made a single comment about the rumoured new product, but designers have nevertheless rushed revealed their take the 'smart watch' with professional looking mockups of the device, ranging from a glass cuff to a 'claw' design. The rumours started when Chinese websites reported in December that the computer giant is working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It is was claimed it would have a 1.5in screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, which could include an iPhone. Yrving Torrealba's translucent concept of how the iWatch might look has proved to be misguided, if Apple does indeed base their gadget on the technology in their latest patent application . The emergence of the '44215 patent app today appeared to back up some of those claims. 'Active communication between an accessory and a portable electronic device can be accomplished wirelessly,' it says. 'A wireless data connection such as the 5 GHz 802.11n protocol can provide sufficient data transmission bandwidth to transmit a high quality video stream.' Alternatively, 'the accessory device could also connect to the portable electronic device via Bluetooth. 'While it might not carry the same amount of data it may be preferable for situations in which only small amounts of data are being sent back and forth.' Apple has a team of about 100 product designers working on the wristwatch-type device, a report in Bloomberg claimed.","Patent application 20130044215, published today, reveals Apple's technology for a 'wearable accessory device'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 09:34 EST, 1 August 2011 . Counter-terrorism police have asked business owners and members of the public to shop anarchists living in their neighbourhood. A bulletin was released by the Metropolitan police, aimed at alerting locals to levels of threat in the UK from groups including al-Qaeda and Irish-related terrorists. It also gave a security update after the attacks in Norway last month where 76 people died. The notice was made available by the City of Westminster force last week and included a warning about anarchism, a political philosophy. Clashes: Police and demonstrators at the G20 protests in London where there were complaints of police brutality . The release is issued by Project Griffin, an initiative to protect communities from the threat of terrorism. There was no warning about other political groups but next to an image of the anarchist emblem, it reads: 'Anarchism is a political philosophy which considers the state undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful, and instead promotes a stateless society, or anarchy. 'Any information relating to anarchists should be reported to your local police.' The only other image included in the bulletin is one used by al-Qaeda in Iraq. Police asked the public to report any of these seen in the capital. Bloodied: An injured man confronts police as they attempt to subdue the crowds near the Bank of England, during the G20 protests in the City of London . There have been questions as to whether police appearing to criminalise a set of political beliefs constitutes a breach of human rights. Members of the anarchist community criticised the disproportionate response. Yodet Gherez, a member of All London Anarchist Revolutionary Movement (Alarm) who presents a radio show on Resonance FM called The Circle A, said: 'Anarchism is about building a mass movement for social change like the anti-cuts movement. 'The police are trying to demonise us with the same brush as Islamic fundamentalists when we are the opposite of that. 'The reason why the police are acting this way is because they are scared our ideas are becoming more popular.' The Metropolitan Police was unable to issue a comment at this time.","Anarchists should be reported, advises Westminster anti-terror police ."
"By . Sara Malm . Not-so-funny bunny: Hidden inside the ear of the bronze sculpture of Nelson Mandela is the rabbit which Pretoria officials demand be removed . A 30ft sculpture of Nelson Mandela has angered South African officials as the sculptors left a ‘signature’ on the artwork – a sculpted rabbit tucked inside one of the bronze ears. The bronze memorial, which was unveiled outside the government complex in Pretoria, after Mandela’s funeral on December 16, is billed as the largest statue of the South African leader in the world. Officials demand that the miniature rabbit is to be removed from the statue, claiming it mocks Mandela and his life’s work. The department of arts and culture said it didn't know the two sculptors, Andre Prinsloo and Ruhan Janse van Vuuren, had added a rabbit, said to be a discreet signature on their work. The bronze rabbit, sitting on its haunches with one floppy ear, is about half the height of the ear canal. ‘It doesn't belong there,’ said Mogomotsi Mogodiri, a department spokesman. ‘The statue represents what everyone in South Africa is proud of.’ His department said in a statement that there are discussions on ‘how best to retain the integrity of the sculpture without causing any damage or disfigurement.’ The giant work stands with arms outstretched, symbolizing Mandela's devotion to inclusiveness, outside the Union Buildings, where the his body rests. Earlier this week, South Africa's Beeld newspaper quoted the artists as saying they added the rabbit as a ‘trademark’ after officials would not allow them to engrave their signatures on the statue's trousers. They also said the rabbit represented the pressure of finishing the sculpture on time because ‘haas’ - the word for rabbit in the Dutch-based Afrikaans language - also means ‘haste.’ Scroll down for video . The 30ft bronze statue was unveiled day after Mandela's funeral in December . The statue was unveiled after much anticipation following Nelson Mandela's death in December . Paul Mashatile, arts and culture minister, said the sculptors have apologized for any offense to those who felt the rabbit was disrespectful toward the legacy of Mandela. The government had appointed Koketso Growth, a heritage development company, to manage the statue project. CEO Dali Tambo, son of anti-apartheid figure Oliver Tambo, said he was furious when he heard about the rabbit, and said it must go. ‘That statue isn't just a statue of a man, it's the statue of a struggle, and one of the most noble in human history,’ Tambo said. ‘So it's belittling, in my opinion, if you then take it in a jocular way and start adding rabbits in the ear.’ It would be, he said, like depicting U.S. President Barack Obama with a mouse in his nose. Never forget: The bronze memorial, which was unveiled outside the government complex in Pretoria, after Mandela's funeral on December 16, is billed as the largest statue of the South African leader in the world . Tambo said the artists, who belong to South Africa's white Afrikaner minority, were selected for their talent but also in part because the project was a multi-racial effort in keeping with Mandela's principle of reconciliation. He said their signatures could be added on the statue in a discreet place, perhaps on Mandela's heel.","Sculptors hid 'trademark bunny' in the ear of Nelson Mandela statue .

"By . Toby Harnden In Washington . John Boehner's job as Speaker of the House of Representatives is under threat after just 85 members of his Republican caucus voted for a fiscal cliff deal that 151 opposed and nearly all Democrats backed. To add to his woes, Boehner - who faces re-election as Speaker on Thursday - has been lambasted by New Jersey's Governor Chris Christie, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, for failing to bring to a vote a $60billion relief bill for those affected by Hurricane Sandy. Governor Christie denounced the 'disappointing and disgusting' spectacle of fiscal cliff manoeuvrings that showed a 'callous indifference' for the people of New Jersey. Christie said today: 'I called the Speaker four times last night after 11.20pm and he did not take my calls.' Scroll down for video . Shaky ground: House Speaker John Boehner faces an uncertain political future following wranglings over the fiscal cliff and further criticism for not pushing a vote on a Sandy relief bill . Embattled: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said today the John Boehner had refused to take his calls last night over the $60bn Sandy relief bill which is desperately needed in his home state . At one point, Boehner was overheard on the House floor saying: 'Am I having a nightmare, or what?' Boehner took the highly unusual step of voting personally for the Senate bill that had passed overwhelmingly in the other house. Perhaps most ominously for Boehner, his own leadership team publicly split from him over the vote with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy opposing the bill. In another indication of a bitterly divided party, the bill pitted another two top Republican prospects for the 2016 White House race against each other. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida voted no and Representative Paul Ryan, the 2012 vice-presidential nominee, voted yes. According to Republican sources, Cantor and McCarthy voted against the bill even though they had earlier pressurized rank-and-file members to support it, while Ryan - another so-called Republican 'Young Gun' in the House - was expected to join them but changed his mind at the last minute. Tough talk: Paul Ryan voted for the fiscal cliff deal because it was in the interest of the American people . Ryan later said in a statement: 'Will the American people be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative? 'In the final analysis, the answer is undoubtedly yes. I came to Congress to make tough decisions - not to run away from them.' The influential conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer said on Fox News that it was 'possible' that Cantor's opposition to the bill  'is the prelude to a challenge Thursday', when the new Congress elected last November convenes. Krauthammer said: 'It would be naked to do it at this late hour as a result of the split over this vote. Look, there are a lot of conservatives in the Republican caucus in the House who hate the bill and for good reason. 'This is a complete surrender on everything. The ratio of tax hikes to spending cuts is 40 to 1, rather than one to one or one to two or one to three. So, I mean it's a complete rout by the Democrats.' Via Twitter, Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker and 2012 presidential candidate, stated that Republicans had been engaged in 'a two month dance of defeat and surrender'. Disaster: Boats are seen in a yard, where they washed onto shore during Hurricane Sandy, near Monmouth Beach, New Jersey after the storm lashed the East Coast . Long road to recovery: Robert Connolly, left, embraces his wife Laura as they survey the remains of the home owned by her parents in Breezy Point, New York during Superstorm Sandy. There has been a delay on $60bn relief for those affected . Donald Trump chipped in, also via Twitter: 'I am a Republican... but the Republicans may be the worst negotiators in history!' Multiple accounts of the fiscal cliff negotiations revealed that Boehner appeared to lose his composure on a number of occasions, most notably when he told Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the top Democrat on Capitol Hill, to 'go f*** yourself' during a White House meeting. Christie's broadside against Boehner was also notable because he singled out Cantor as having done his best to bring the Hurricane Sandy bill to a vote. But Cantor's apparent attempts to get the fiscal cliff bill passed make him an unlikely rallying figure against Boehner, at least in the short term. Erick Erickson, a leading conservative figure, used his RedState blog to dismiss the votes of Cantor and McCarthy, saying: 'His was opportunism, not courage.' Ron Meyer, spokesman for of American Majority Action, a conservative political action committee, told Breitbart News that 'at least 20 House Republican members have gotten together, discussed this and want to unseat Speaker Boehner'. But he added that 'the one problem these guys face is they need a leader to coalesce behind'.",New Jersey Governor Christie said fiscal cliff manoeuvrings showed a 'callous indifference' to those in his state .
"By . Martin Robinson . The widow of murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence has today sent a personal message of support to the bereft family of Ann Maguire. Frances Lawrence, whose husband was stabbed through the heart at the gates of his west London school in 1995, has sent her 'love and prayers' to the distraught loved-ones of the Spanish teacher. But she admitted 'there are no words' to help them on the 'cruel journey' they have started since Mrs Maguire was stabbed to death on Monday by her 15-year-old student in front of 30 classmates. Mr Lawrence, 48, was hit over the head with an iron bar, kicked and then . stabbed, outside St George's Roman Catholic School in . Maida Vale, north-west London. Support: Frances Lawrence, with a portrait of her murdered husband behind her, has sent a personal message to the family of Ann Maguire giving them her love and prayers for the cruel journey they are on . Similarities: The deaths of Philip Lawrence, and now Ann Maguire, both sparked mass mourning outside the schools where they died . He had seen one of his students being attacked by a gang but was brutally murdered when he intervened. 'Eighteen years ago, my husband Philip Lawrence, a headteacher, was murdered outside his school as he intervened to save a pupil from gang violence,' she wrote. 'By now perhaps I should have learned words of comfort for you, the family and community of beloved teacher, Ann Maguire. 'But I have learned only that there are no words. Instead I send all my love and my prayers and my ongoing thoughts along the cruel journey which you are now forced to begin.'

The . fatal blow was struck by 15-year-old Learco Chindamo, who had denied . the crime but was convicted and jailed for a minimum of 12 years in . 1996. He was the leader of a . Triad-inspired gang of mainly Filipino students who wanted to ‘punish’ a . 13-year-old student after he quarrelled with one of them. Mr Lawrence saw the boy being hit with a metal bar, but was murdered when he intervened. It later emerged Chindamo had bragged to a friend in an amusement arcade that he had ‘killed a teacher’. ‘I’ve turned around as he’s tapped me on the shoulder and I’ve stabbed him in the chest,’ he said.  Just 12 days before he stabbed Mr Lawrence, he had attacked a passer-by with a beer bottle.

Maisey, 19, is claiming sexual discrimination by the all-male staff at . the restaurant owned by celebrity chef Stephen Terry - the best man of . Gordon Ramsey. Trainee pastry chef Miss Maisey told an employment tribunal she was 'scared and upset' after being shut in the freezer. Hearing: Chloe Maisey, left, told a tribunal that she was suffered sexual discrimination at a restaurant run by Gordon Ramsay's best man, Stephen Terry, right. He said the incidents were 'banter' typical to a kitchen . But fellow chef Lorne Hargreaves told the hearing: 'It was in the middle of July and everyone was moaning it was too hot. 'I picked her up and put her on the frozen bread. It was a spontaneous, funny thing to do. 'Everybody is treated the same in the kitchen. It is like a family environment, it is like brother-sister banter.' Miss . Maisey, who resigned after three months, has made 21 allegations of . sexual discrimination at the Hardwick restaurant, regularly named as the . best in Wales. Highly acclaimed: The Hardwick  restaurant near Abergavenny, where Ms Maisey claims she was discriminated against . Owner Mr Terry - a regular star of TV cookery shows such as the BBC’s Saturday Kitchen - told the tribunal that some of the incidents never happened and dismissed the others as 'banter'. He . said: 'Doing service is very stressful and there is a little bit of . banter. You are in an environment where people mess about on occasions, . but the guys are not malicious in any way. 'It is not that she was singled out because of her sex.' But Mr Terry denied being involved in any of the banter himself. 'I am above that,' he said. Miss . Maisey claims she was ogled every day as she changed into her chef’s . uniform at the restaurant which has no female changing rooms. Claims: Ms Maisey, pictured at an hearing in Cardiff yesterday, left, said that at one point a male colleague slapped her bottom. Pictured right is Stephen Terry, the owner of the restaurant, who denies the allegations . She also claims she was 'groped' when a male staff member slapped her bottom. The . tribunal heard how the vegetarian teenager was tricked into eating beef . stock by a colleague who told her it was chocolate sauce. Father-of-three Mr Terry, who trained under Marco Pierre White, did not deny the incident happened. But he told the tribunal in Cardiff: 'I am a restaurateur, I take vegetarians very seriously. 'She did not tell me she felt violated and she did not seem distressed.' Mr . Terry said he was 'shocked to the core' when Miss Maisey’s mother rang . him to complain about her daughter’s treatment at the restaurant near . Abergavenny. 'Distraught': Ms Maisey's mother said that her . daughter (above), who resigned from the position at The Hardwick last . August, said that on one occasion she was hysterical after returning . from work . Mr Terry said: 'When I took the phone call I was . completely shocked at what I was listening to and the three issues . Chloe’s mum raised with me. 'One of the allegations was that one of the chefs had threatened to kill her - and that nearly knocked me off my feet. 'It was a 12-minute phone conversation and I was blown away by it. 'I . immediately went to speak to Mr Hargreaves and I took him outside and . he said: “Chef, that is not what happened” and put it all into context. 'Chloe . had jokingly told him: “I could karate kick you in the f***ing head” and he told her: ""Look at the size of me Chloe, I could kill you"".' 'It was a joke. Speaking to the guys, and having all it all put into context, I didn’t think there was anything to answer.' William . Rees, representing Miss Maisey, told Mr Terry he had failed to . investigate the allegations formally and took the word of his male . employees after one conversation. But Mr Terry said he trusted his senior chefs who had worked for him over a number of years. Mr . Terry said: 'I was shocked to the core by the allegations made by . Chloe’s mum and I told her she needed to put them in writing. 'But . nothing ever came detailing the allegations in more detail. I am an . educated man - I have seen a lot and I talked to everyone there and took . a view on it.' Mr Terry said he was 'shocked to the core' when Miss Maisey¿s mother rang him to complain about her daughter¿s treatment at the restaurant near Abergavenny . Miss Maisie accused sous chef Jamie O'Leary of throwing a sea bass at her. Mr O'Leary, told the tribunal: 'Have you any idea how much sea bass costs?' 'If Stephen Terry caught wind of me throwing a sea bass around the kitchen it would be the end of me. 'I was simply showing her how to prepare a fish and turned the fish head towards her in jest. 'These events have been blown out of all proportion as to what happened.' Miss Maisey also accused Mr O'Leary of throwing a mouse at her which had come into the restaurant in a box of organic vegetables. - Sous chef Jamie O'Leary . Mr O'Leary said: 'We all had a look at it before I carried it into the car park and released it into the hedgerow. 'I wouldn't be the sous chef at the Hardwick if I was flinging mice around the kitchen. It's ridiculous.' Mr O'Leary added: 'I spend more time with the team than with my wife and child. 'The Hardwick is my second family, there is going to be banter, not on a daily basis, but at the end of the day the restaurant is not what it's being portrayed as. 'It doesn't get the high reputation it has, based on the amount of horseplay that is alleged to have gone on. No one has ever complained before.' The tribunal in Cardiff heard there were several female employees Miss Maisey could have talked to about her concerns. The payroll and HR manager Charlotte Hilling told the tribunal: 'I spoke to Chloe after she joined and told her if there was ever any problem she could come to me.' The tribunal has heard male kitchen workers ogled Miss Maisey as she changed into her chef's whites at the restaurant near Abergavenny, South Wales. But Ms Hilling said there was a female employee currently working in the kitchen who used the restaurant's shower cubicle to change. The tribunal continues .

"By . Lizzie Parry . To the untrained eye they look just as they are, a row of old garages ideal for storage space. But to those experienced in playing the property market and investing in hidden gems, the innocuous buildings were too tempting to resist. The six garages, in Parsons Green, London have sold for a staggering £700,000 - ten times their value, after sparking a bidding war when they went under the hammer. The properties were sold by Auction House London, who had valued the row at £75,000. This row of six garages in Parsons Green, Fulham in London has sold for £700,000 - ten times their £75,000 value . The garages, which each have a rental potential of £65 a month, were sold without planning permission for development. But that did not deter interest, with a flurry of bids in what auctioneers have branded 'a first'. The anonymous buyer, who is understood to be a developer, secured the garages for £700,000 - four times the average English house price, and one-and-a-half times the value of a typical London property. They will now have to submit proposals to planning chiefs at Hammersmith and Fulham council. Auctioneer Andrew Binstock said: 'We price things very well and we're used to seeing £400,000 houses selling for a £100,000 premium but we're having to recalculate values. 'They had a guide price of £75,000 and ended up selling for £700,000. I've never seen anything like this before. It is a first. 'The garages were owned by a couple who inherited and they couldn't believe it, they were pleasantly surprised.' The garages, which are off Fulham Road - where average property prices are around £615,000 - were sold to an anonymous buyer who is understood to be a developer. The properties came without planning permission . The sellers, who inherited the garages and had been renting them out, are understood to have carried out a feasibility study with a view to building two, two-bedroom townhouses on the site . Prior to the sale, the owners were renting three of the garages out for £65, £80 and £85 per month. If they were to carry on renting at these rates, it would take more than 250 years to make £700,000 from them. The auction house advertised the freehold terrace of garages as 'suitable for redevelopment subject to planning permission'. It is understood the sellers had conducted a feasibility scheme to redevelop the site with a likely workable scheme of two, two bedroom townhouses. Two-bedroom flats and houses in Parsons Green can reach between £550,000 to more than £1million, depending on the size of the property. Property valuation site Zoopla estimates the average property price in the area, just off Fulham Road, is £615,714 - up nearly £60,000 in the last year. Mr Binstock added: 'It was quite unusual and a very fun part of the auction. It is a prime part of Fulham, but it's also a gamble. 'The garages are clearly not worth £700,000 as they are so the buyer has obviously got a plan for it and it will be interesting to see what it is. 'It is a perfect storm of shortage of stock and strong market forces. It is an unpredictable market, but it is great for sellers.'","Six garages in Parson's Green, Fulham sell for £700,000 .

Turquoise walls: Another of the bedrooms in Carr House with a full length mirror and large windows  looking out onto the grounds . Robin Hood as portrayed by Jonas Armstrong in the BBC series . According to most versions of the Robin Hood story, the famous outlaw died after being bled  - a common medical practice during the Middle Ages. Robin had realised that he was dying and so decides to be bled by his cousin, the prioress of Kirklees. His comrade Will Scarlett is not in favour of this, but nevertheless Robin sets off for the priory, accompanied by Little John having refused to take a bodyguard as recommended by Scarlett. In one version of the tale the prioress lets out too much blood, killing him, while in another the hero was stabbed by her lover Sir Roger of Doncaster. In both cases the prioress was seeking revenge for Robin's side of the family inheriting the land and titles. Other re-tellings leave out the pair's relationship and say the prioress killed Robin so that Maid Marian - who has hidden in the convent and taken orders in the belief that her lover was already dead - will inherit his title and lands, thus allowing the abbey to take on his property. When he realises he is about to die, Robin calls for Little John using his hunting horn, and although he is too late to save his friend, Little John is able to help Robin fire his last arrow from the window of the gatehouse - bowing to bury Robin wherever the arrow lands. Little John wants to avenge the death by destroying the nunnery and killing all the nuns, but is prevented from doing so by Robin - who chivalrously reminds his pal that their code has always prevented them from hurting women. In the film Robin and Marian, it is Maid Marian, now a nun, who poisons Robin and herself when he is seriously wounded in his last battle with the Sheriff of Nottingham and she wants to spare him the agony of never again being the man he once was.","Carr .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Angry mothers staged a mass breastfeeding protest today in a Sports Direct store that asked a woman who was feeding her child to leave because it was against company policy. Around 70 women descended on the shop in Nottingham city centre to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son. Mrs Komar had been sitting on a bench inside the store waiting for her father Edward Morawiec, 63, who was trying on a T-shirts. Scroll down for video . Mothers and their babies gather outside the Sports Direct store in Nottingham as a show of solidarity . But she claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'. The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room. Other customers then took pity on the mother-of-two and helped her to push her buggy outside so she could continue feeding Daniel. Mrs Komar claims she has complained to the store five times since the incident in January but has had no response, although it is believed the firm has now issued her with an apology. New mothers, from left, Lindsay Billsborrow, Ruth Knowles, Catherine Didit and Laura Armitage breastfeed their babies in Sports Direct . A mother discreetly breastfeeds her baby in Sports Direct, as part of a protest . Wioletta Komar, who inspired today's protest with her children Wicotr aged two, and five-month-old Daniel . But other mothers, who wanted to show solidarity with Mrs Komar, went to the Sports Direct store today and said they were defending their right to breastfeed in public places. Organiser of the protest Leah Gibson said: ' We’re here today to stand up for breastfeeding women and their right to feed their children in public without being asked to leave places. 'The turn-out has been fantastic, probably more than I expected. It’s been really peaceful and calm, which is exactly what we wanted. 'We just wanted to show everyone that we can feed in peace, without showing everyone our boobs. 'It’s shocking that we’ve still got this sexual ‘thing’ about boobs. 'Breasts were made to feed a child and to nourish. Only 1 per cent of the population can’t physically feed their child this way so when you look at it like that, it shows you what they are for. Gabriela Burgess, 38, breastfeeds 11-month-old daughter Klaudia in Sports Direct, left, while right, Renee Haddow breastfeeds nine day old son Dylan . 'Some mothers say ""oh I don’t want to feed my baby because my boobs are for my partner"". No, they aren’t - they’re for your child.' The group spent around 15 minutes in the shop and organisers confirmed there were no issues with Sports Direct staff on this occasion. Mrs Komar lives in Boston, Lincolnshire, with her husband Zbigniew, 33, and their sons Wictor, two, and Daniel, who is now five-months-old. She had travelled to Nottingham for a weekend shopping with Daniel and her father Edward as a Christmas present from her husband when they visited Sports Direct. Speaking at the time she said: 'Midwives and doctors say that it (breastfeeding) is best for the child but I feel so upset and frustrated about what has happened. 'I can't understand why a baby has to be punished for being hungry and why I need to feel like a criminal when I just want to feed my baby son.' Heather Vaughan, 29, who was told off for breastfeeding her baby daughter - in a creche . Mrs Komar also received support from other mothers including Laura Whatton - who was ejected from the John Carroll Leisure Centre in Nottingham in 2009. Mrs Whatton, reacted by saying: 'I'm not surprised really. 'Everyone is prudish toward it, even though it's the most natural thing in the world.' Patti Rundall, policy director for Baby Milk Action, explained: 'All mothers have a legally-protected right to breastfeed in public. 'It is important, it's their right and we will do what we can to support them.' Mrs Komar's experience is the latest in a number of incidents where mothers have been told to stop breastfeeding in public. In March, Heather Vaughan, 29, told how she was reduced to tears when staff at a naval museum ordered her to stop feeding her baby in its creche, telling her 'we don’t do that here'. The mother-of-two said she felt victimised and humiliated at the museum in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Bosses apologised, saying it had simply been an 'error of judgment'. Sophie Howes, who was told to stop breastfeeding in her local swimming pool. She is pictured with her eight-month old daughter Connie and mum Virginia Howes . Last . October, a midwife spoke out after she was told to stop breastfeeding in . a public swimming pool because the lifeguard thought it was . 'offensive'. Sophie . Howes was sat on the steps of the learner pool with her eight-month-old . daughter Connie at a leisure centre in Ashford, Kent, when she was . ordered to move. The manager of the centre claims that CCTV footage shows Ms Howes breastfeeding Connie while the baby's head was level with the water in the pool. But the mother said: 'It is irrelevant whether I was in the water or not because that is not what the staff member said to me to begin with. 'She didn't mention health and safety issues, she just said one of her colleagues had been offended by me breastfeeding.' She has now won an undisclosed pay out from the Ashford Leisure Trust, who run the leisure centre, after they agreed an out of court settlement. The Equality Act 2010 states that it is discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding. The act protects women who want to do so in shops or other public places.","Around 70 women staged protest at Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre .

But in order that we can remain in the European Union, the EU must change.’ The Chancellor’s explicit warning that Britain will quit the EU unless other member states agree to a major renegotiation of the relationship came in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt. It will pile pressure on David Cameron to follow suit when he makes his long-awaited speech on Europe later this month. Mr Cameron has said that life outside the EU is ‘imaginable’ but has suggested he is reluctant to include the option of leaving in any referendum. Coalition tensions on the issue were underlined last night when Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable suggested the growing debate about Britain’s membership of the EU was damaging business confidence in the economy. Mr Cable said the issue was ‘a massive disruption and deeply unhelpful in my job’. He claimed that quitting the EU would result in the UK descending into the politics of economic protectionism and nationalism which the single market rules currently prevent. In a surprise intervention, the leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament hit out at those in his own party demanding a hard line against Brussels. Prime Minister David Cameron is due to set out his vision for a new 'settlement' with Europe within the next fortnight . David Cameron's long-awaited speech on . Europe is to be finally delivered in the Netherlands, Downing Street . sources have suggested. Except . no one seems to have told the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte . (pictured), who is in the dark about the contents of the speech and . claims he will be unveiled as a key ally in the battle to have powers . and money returned from Brussels. Stephan . Schrover, official spokesman for . Mr Rutte, told MailOnline that far from being signed up to Mr Cameron's . vision for Europe 'we not aware of information about it'. 'We . do not know where or when [the speech will be). We are very curious,' he added. 'We have not had any involvement in the preparation of this.' And . in a blow to Mr Cameron's hopes of winning backing for Britain to have . looser ties with the EU, Mr Shrover added: 'We are not aiming for opt . outs or something like that. 'We are also not in redefinition of our relationship with the European Union. 'What . we want is a better functioning European Union, strengthening the . internal market, getting the costs down – that kind of thing.' He . insisted Mr Cameron was welcome to visit the country but added: ‘We . don’t have any information about whether he is coming to the . Netherlands.’ Asked if . Britain should stay in the EU, he replied: ‘Of course. We think it is . important that there is Britain the European Union. 'We . have done some common activities about stimulating growth, freed trade… . we have a common stand in those issue but of course there are also many . differences.’ MEP Richard Ashworth said the strident Euroscepticism gave the impression of a Britain that was ‘snarling like a pitbull across the Channel’. He said Britain was ‘making ourselves look pretty darned unattractive’ as a partner in the EU. Discussing Mr Cameron’s ambition to claw back powers from Brussels, he said an ‘evolutionary solution’ was the way to proceed, rather than the ‘nuclear option’ of quitting the EU. But Tory Eurosceptics  welcomed the Chancellor’s intervention. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said Mr Cameron would get the best deal for Britain only if he made it clear the UK was otherwise prepared to quit. He urged the Prime Minister to hold an immediate referendum to give him a mandate to negotiate with Brussels, followed by a second referendum on the deal in which the British people would have the option to leave the EU. Mr Cable, in a speech at King’s College, London, made it clear the Lib Dems would resist any attempt to have a major renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the EU. The Chancellor’s comments came in an interview on Tuesday, but were only published yesterday. In the intervening period, both the US and Germany have warned Britain against holding a referendum on Europe. On Wednesday, US assistant secretary for European affairs Philip Gordon said the Obama administration wanted ‘a strong British voice’ in the EU and warned that referendums risked turning countries ‘inward’. The following day a key ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a sharp warning that any attempt at ‘blackmailing’ member states into accepting change would backfire on Britain. Bundestag European affairs committee chairman Gunther Krichbaum said a referendum could leave the UK isolated  in Europe. A Treasury aide insisted that Mr Osborne’s comments were fully consistent with the Government’s position – that the EU needs to change ‘and indeed is changing’. Downing Street yesterday said that Mr Cameron had talked Barack Obama through Britain’s approach to Europe when they spoke before Christmas, and that the US president was supportive. ‘We want to change our  relationship with the EU and seek consent on that,’ the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said. Britain is on the brink of an unprecedented triple-dip recession after experts suggested that the economy had gone into reverse at the end of last year. It shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2012, according to the think-tank National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR). Another three months of decline at the start of 2013 – seen as a serious threat given forecasts of freezing weather and heavy snow – would result in a third recession in five years. A recession is defined as two or more quarters of decline in a row. ‘A triple-dip recession remains a possibility,’ said Victoria Clarke, an economist at City firm Investec.Britain is trapped in the longest downturn on record and the economy is still 3.4 per cent smaller than it was at its peak in 2008 when boom gave way to bust. ‘We do not expect output to pass its peak of early 2008 until 2014,’ said Simon Kirby, an economist at NIESR. That would mean a six-year slump in the wake of the meltdown of the banking system in 2008. NIESR said its prediction of a 0.3 per cent fall in output between October and December meant there was no growth at all in 2012. The think-tank is forecasting growth of 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, meaning Britain avoids a triple-dip. But Mr Kirby said: ‘Growth was absent in 2012 and the concern for 2013 is a continuation of no growth.’ The Office for National Statistics will give official figures for the fourth quarter of 2012 on January 25. Yesterday it said manufacturing output and construction fell in November.","Chancellor issues ultimatum that the UK cannot stay in the EU as it is .

"By . Richard Spillett . The remarkable story of how a young woman was ordered to host a party on the eve of D-Day to help calm the nerves of military commanders has emerged after 70 years. Stella Broughton, now Stella Rutter, was given the same security clearance as Winston Churchill by British army chief General Montgomery so she could stage the secret event. The then 20-year-old was also told to circulate among top military commanders to make conversation - but had strict instructions not to mention the war. Stella Rutter, then Stella Broughton, was called upon to organise a secret party for top military commanders on the night before D-Day . Mrs Rutter, now 91, has told of the party for the first time after swearing not to talk about it for at least 60 years . The informal party was held on the night of June 3, 1944 and was organised to take the minds of the senior officers off the momentous event that lay ahead of them. Over 60 commanding officers, including US General Omar Bradley, were at the gathering, where many met one another for the first time ahead of the huge operation. Stella made sure they had enough to eat and drink - including alcohol - and danced with them to a band. During the war, Stella was the only woman draughtswoman to work for Spitfire makers, Supermarine, and proved she could be trusted with sensitive information. Her mother brought her up not to repeat gossip, another reason why she was placed on the top secret BIGOT list, which stood for British Invasion of German Occupied Territory. Stella was told in advance when the D-Day landings would happen and learned the names of regiments, commanders and codenames of the Normandy beaches at the party. Stella was trusted to organise the party after doing top secret work for Spitfire manufacturers Supermarine, where she is pictured among fellow-staff . Stella (circled) was told not to mention the war at the secret party, which was ordered by General Montgomery . The party was held in a sunken Nissen hut at Hursley Park, near Winchester, Hampshire, where Supermarine was based. It was meant to have been held the evening before the start of the D-Day operation in June 1944. But Operation Overlord was delayed for 24 hours due to poor weather and paratroopers were dropped into Normandy on the night of June 5 and the landings were on June 6. Stella was told not to mention the party for the next 60 years when all the commanders involved had died. Now aged 91, the widow, from Emsworth, Hampshire, has written an autobiography about her career. The book, titled 'Tomorrow is D-Day', is her own wartime story and is based on the meticulous notes and diaries she kept at the time.

The Allied leaders, for whom the party was thrown to take their minds off the pressure of D-Day . Now a great-grandmother, she was the first woman ever employed in the drawing office at Supermarine and was there when she was approached by Major General Douglas Graham who was in command of Gold beach on D-Day. Montgomery had asked Graham to organise the party and find a suitable and trusted hostess. She said: 'Montgomery wanted a woman to host it and not an official in order to cut the protocol and force the men to make an effort not to speak about the war or D-Day. 'He got in touch with Supermarine and asked if they had a lady who can keep her mouth shut and that lady was me. 'I had been taught since the age of five never to repeat what I heard from others and Iknew how to keep my mouth shut.

'Everyone knew that the invasion of Europe would happen at some point and how everything depended on it, but nobody knew when or where. 'The commanding officers were told on the morning of the party and Montgomery wanted them to be put at ease, to relax and get a good night's sleep and came up with this informal party. 'It was also held so many of them men could meet each other before they went into the field of battle. 'I knew the names of all the commanders of D-Day, the regiments that were going to be involved, the ships and the codenames for the beaches. The day after the party, allied commanders stormed the beaches of Normandy in Operation Overlord . Commando troops land on a beach in Normandy in June 1944. The operation was a turning point in Second World War . 'I was asked not to recall what happened on the night for at least 60 years when everyone involved was dead and I never mentioned it to anyone, not even my husband. 'I had to greet every man as they arrived and I was asked to converse with them for 10 to 20 minutes each. Stella is now telling the inside story of her war in her book 'Tomorrow is D-Day' 'I could . feel some of them were jittery when I shook their hands. I made a point . of calling them mister rather than by their title or rank. 'I spoke to them about traveling abroad, visiting art galleries and museums I spoke about anything apart from the war. 'One US officer broke down on the dance floor and he was shuffled out of the room straight away so that the others didn't see. 'There were buffet tables stacked full of food. There were whole roasted chickens, a baron of beef, a whole leg of lamb and a huge joint of pork. 'On another table there was all the drink you could imagine, apart from Champagne. There were different brands of whisky and gin, wine, liqueurs and beers. 'The men were drinking but nobody was drunk. People said what a jolly good do it was.' As well as Lt Gen Bradley who commanded the US First Army, the commanders of the five Normandy beaches were at the party, including Maj Gen Graham, Maj Gen Thomas Rennie and Maj Gen Rodney Keller. Stella carried on working at Supermarine and left there after the war when she married husband Sydney. Her book 'Tomorrow is D-Day' is published by Amberley and costs Â£16.99. On June 6, 1944, Allied forces, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, on 'D-Day', beginning the liberation of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II. The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies' assault on German-occupied territory. The mission was the largest amphibious invasion in history with over 160,000 soldiers, including 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians, involved and over 5,000 ships. There was an initial airborne assault with 24,000 troops being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn. The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah. The timing of the operation was crucial, with commanders needing the right weather, a full moon and the correct tidal conditions. On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied troops died with a further 9,000 wounded or missing. Total German casualties are estimated at between 4,000 and 9,000. The landings were a turning point in the war, opening up a second front - the Russians were already advancing on Germany from the east - and leading to the liberation of occupied Europe. 'The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory!' Eisenhower said in an historic address after the invasion was launched. Last year, tourist boards along the Normandy coast launched the new D-Day initiative to promote what it calls the 'Secteur mythique' - where much of the action took place.","Stella Broughton one of few women to know about D-Day before invasion .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Just one day after flight delays caused by a computer glitch led to fist fights at an airport outside of London, a similar computer glitch grounded flights at several California airports on Wednesday. The glitch apparently hit the Los Angeles Center air traffic facility about 2:20 p.m., which forced officials to ground departing flights at several southern California airports, including Los Angeles International Airport, Bob Hope Airport in Burbank and John Wayne Airport in Orange County.

"By . Associated Press . and Dan Bloom . Ex-NBA star Shaquille O'Neal has apologized to a Detroit man with a rare disorder for making fun of his appearance in an online post. Best known as Shaq, the former NBA player announced the apology in a Twitter message Tuesday. 'Made a new friend today when I called and apologized to Jahmel Binion. Great dude,' the tweet said, with the hashtags #alwayslearning and #MYBADCUZ. O'Neal followed up Wednesday with a tweet that said: 'Had the opportunity to talk to Jahmel Binion yesterday and apologize about the post on IG!' O'Neal spokesman Rishi Daulat told The Associated Press on Wednesday that O'Neal personally wrote the tweets. Daulat declined further comment. Tweet: Ex-NBA star Shaquille O'Neal has apologized on Twitter, pictured, to a Detroit man with a rare disorder for making fun of his appearance in an online post . Offensive: The photo was uploaded to the Instagram account of Shaquille O'Neal (left) comparing him to Jahmel Binion (right) - who has the rare genetic disorder ectodermal dysplasia. It has since been deleted . Binion has ectodermal dysplasia, which . affects his face, teeth and hair. He told MLive.com that he was . 'confused' when O'Neal posted a picture on Instagram showing him making a . face imitating Binion. 'I was thinking ""Man, he's supposed to be this role model, someone everyone is supposed to look up to. If Shaq does something like this,""' Binion said, everyone who follows him 'will think, ""We should do this.""' The post was later taken down. AP left an email message for Binion on Wednesday afternoon seeking his reaction to O'Neal's call. The National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias wrote an open letter Monday to O'Neal saying 'bullying is never acceptable.' The outrageous photo immediately prompted outrage immediately after it was posted on the photo-sharing website. Jahmel Binion, whose ectodermal dysplasia hinders his ability to grow teeth and hair, was dumbfounded when thousands of internet users imitated and mocked a selfie he took. They included Shaq, who has now apparently deleted the Instagram photo - which said 'SMILE TODAY' - and uploaded one comparing himself to the cartoon ogre Shrek. Mocked: Jahmel Binion (left) had ectodermal dysplasia since he was a baby (right) and has begun an anti-bullying campaign. He said he was disappointed by the NBA star because he saw him as a role model . Famous: NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal has more than 500,000 followers on Instagram and 8.3million on Twitter . But the move was too late to stop a . storm of comments from many of Shaq's 500,000 followers on Instagram and . 8.3million on Twitter. The controversy comes after criticism . of another top figure in basketball, billionaire LA Clippers owner . Donald Sterling, who is embroiled in a racial discrimination row. Many Instagram and Twitter users today demanded Shaq apologized for the photo. And . instead of hiding away, 23-year-old Mr Binion has used the publicity to . start a campaign to raise awareness of his condition. Called . Hug Don't Judge, a Facebook page for his campaign has gained more than . 3,500 fans and been flooded with photos by parents whose children have . the same disorder. The description reads: 'This page is to support my anti-bulling and cyber bullying organization. 'Please be respectful, be positive and share this with the world. Time to make a difference.' Mr Binion, 23, told My Fox Detroit: 'I've been getting teased since I was yea tall - people laugh at me, stare at me. 'I . was kinda hurt because I look up to him and I watch Shaq play . basketball so I was like, why is he making fun of me when he's supposed . to be this role model?' 'I can't let it get to me, then I get hurt and depressed, so I keep my mind positive.' The storm prompted the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias to write an open letter to the NBA legend. Self-mockery: The four time NBA champion has since uploaded a photo comparing himself to Shrek . Executive . director Mary Fete said there were more than 180 forms of the condition . and many left sufferers with missing teeth and unable to sweat. She wrote: 'You might want to consider . making something positive come from this.  Consider giving Jahmel . Binion the gift of a smile, one that others would not make fun of. 'Give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride.' So far Shaq has not responded publicly to the row. Some . users rushed to the 7ft 1in four-time NBA champion's support, saying . people were too easily offended and Shaq may not have known Mr Binion . had a disibility. Anger: One Twitter user's response today . The controversy comes after another top figure in the NBA, billionaire LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, made headlines when a tape of an alleged racist rant was leaked to TMZ. He is allegedly heard telling his girlfriend she can 'sleep with black people' but not bring them to matches. 'You can bring them in, you can do . whatever you want,' the voice on the tape says. 'The little I ask you is not to promote it on that... and not to bring them to my games. 'It bothers me a lot . that you want to broadcast that you’re associating with black people. Do you have to? 'I’m just saying, in your lousy f******* Instagrams, you don’t have to have yourself with, walking with black people. 'Don't . put him (Magic Johnson) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they . have to call me.  And don't bring him to my games.' In 2009 Sterling agreed to a $2.76 million settlement over claims he discriminated against African American and Latinos tenants at apartments he owned. He did not admit any liability. Campaign: Jahmel Binion's anti-bullying Facebook group Hug Don't Judge has already gained 3,500 members . Response: One of the reactions which the NBA star received to the row from his 8.3million followers . Politics: Another user highlighted the NBA star's support for New Jersey 'Bridgegate' governor Chris Christie . Abuse: Some Twitter users were more angry and one called Shaq a 'sad pathetic excuse for a man'. Others, however, defended him saying he may not have known Jahmel Binion had a disability . Dear Mr. O’Neal, . All of us at the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED) are terribly disappointed by the hurtful image that you and others recently posted on social media about a member of our family, Jahmel Binion, who is affected by ectodermal dysplasia. Individuals affected by these rare, genetic conditions often face a lifetime of bullying and negative remarks because of their appearance, which others may consider “different.”  Bullying is never acceptable and we, as a nation, have had some devastating consequences as a result of bullying. However, to be called out on a celebrity’s social media and made fun of is especially reprehensible.  We applaud Jahmel for reacting to this cyberbullying by establishing a positive social media campaign called “Hug Don’t Judge.” Mr. O’Neal, we welcome this opportunity to enlighten you about the ectodermal dysplasias and how we could work together for positive change. The ectodermal dysplasias are rare genetic conditions that affect the development of hair, teeth, skin, glands and nails in men, women and children of all races and ethnic groups.  Of the more than 180 different syndromes, x-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) is the most common and features multiple malformed and missing teeth, the inability to perspire, sparse hair and recurring respiratory infections. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, but in all cases present a variety of challenges. We invite you to attend our NFED National Family Conference, July 23-26 in Columbus, Ohio, and meet families from around the world who, like Jahmel, are affected by ectodermal dysplasias.  You will meet some extraordinary people who are accomplishing profound acts despite the harsh social stigmas, daunting physical challenges, and financially draining dental procedures they’re up against. You might want to consider making something positive come from this.  Consider giving Jahmel Binion the gift of a smile, one that others would not make fun of.  Give him a smile that would give him confidence and pride. We are urging our NFED community to use this opportunity to raise awareness, to make positive change, and to support Jahmel’s “Hug Don’t Judge” campaign (#hugdontjudge). We encourage you to do the same.  Let’s raise awareness of the ectodermal dysplasias. Together, we have the power to make life better for the people it affects. Beauty is diverse. Let us show you. Sincerely, . Mary FeteExecutive Director .","Ex-NBA star Shaquille O'Neal announced the apology in a Twitter message Tuesday, after his post making fun of the Detroit man's rare disorder sparked outrage .

"By . Louise Boyle . and Jessica Jerreat . A South Carolina woman who was ordered to leave a Planet Fitness gym because her pregnancy bump was showing has said the experience has left her feeling broken down. Melissa Mantor, who is expecting her second child in September, says she felt so humiliated after being told to cover up or leave that she no longer feels able to work out in public. Mantor, who has cancelled her membership with the West Ashley gym, said she is still waiting for a sincere apology from the manager over the way she was treated. 'Humiliated': Melissa Mantor says she was asked to leave a gym because her pregnancy bump was showing . The 31-year-old was told by a female employee on April 21 that her outfit - a tank top and leggings - violated the dress code at . the gym. She was 18 weeks' pregnant at the time and told Mail Online that the day she was challenged was the first day she was showing. The owner of the franchise contacted Mantor after her initial complaint, but she said she felt he had adopted a stern tone. The experience has left her feeling 'pretty crappy' and 'broken down to pieces,' she told ABC News. 'I don't understand how they can claim to be a ""no-judgement"" gym and then pick and choose who to judge,' Mantor, who has a three-year-old daughter, added. 'I . was on the treadmill, when a female employee came up to me and said ""I'm going to have to ask you to leave, you are in violation of the . dress code"".' 'She then said: ''I'm going to have to . send you home to get changed because your belly's hanging out and I . need to get it covered up. I told her: ''Of course my belly is hanging . out, I am pregnant.''' Mantor says she was wearing a top that she had worn several times at the gym, including on the day she signed up for membership there. 'The only variable is that I'm now pregnant,' she said, adding that an employee told her to wear a large black T-shirt they would provide, or to leave. Complaint: Melissa Mantor, who was 18 weeks' pregnant when she was told to cover up, wants an apology . Since the incident, which was widely publicized, several attorneys have contacted Mantor and offered to take up her case. But the expectant mom has refused, saying all she wants is a proper apology and for the gym franchise to change its policies which have led to her and many others feeling unwelcome. In a letter she sent to the corporate office of Planet Fitness, Mantor wrote: 'I felt humiliated when a Planet Fitness employee stopped my workout to inform me that my presence was both unwanted and unsuitable to continue. 'I feel as though Planet Fitness should sincerely apologize, not only to me, but to anyone who has become a victim of your discriminatory policy. 'You have made your members feel unwelcome and unwanted because they do not fit the vague parameters you have set on who you would like working out at your gyms.' The stay-at-home mom added: 'I was looking for a place to go to work out, stay healthy, and feel good about myself. 'I was unable to accomplish these things because of poor application of vague and discriminatory policy.' Confronted: The expectant mother was working out at this West Ashley gym, above, when an employee told her she needed to cover up or leave . Policy: The Planet Fitness dress code which is posted on their corporate Facebook page . McCall Gosselin, director of public relations for the gym, said: 'Our corporate dress code policy, which is enforced at the discretion of club staff, states that jeans, boots, men's string tank tops, or revealing clothing are prohibited. 'This particular location also had a stated policy that prohibited bare midriffs. In this instance, staff informed the member of the policy and offered her a free T-shirt to complete her workout. 'She was not asked to leave the gym as a result of her attire.' Planet Fitness's logo is 'No Gymtimidation'. The mission statement says the company provides a 'diverse, Judgement Free Zone'. This is not the first time that Planet Fitness has faced controversy over its heavy-handed tactics on gym-goers' attire. An Albuquerque Planet Fitness refused to let a Muslim woman wear her religious head covering while she tried to work out, according to a lawsuit filed in March. Tarainia McDaniel, 37, recently filed the lawsuit in a New Mexico district court stemming from an October 2011 clash that prevented McDaniel from using the gym - even though court documents said another Planet Fitness had previously let her. The lawsuit said she was turned away at the gym and was told the head covering didn't meet its dress code. Tiffany Austin, from Richmond, California, claimed in March that a branch of Planet Fitness asked her to cover up because her toned physique was intimidating other members.","Melissa Mantor was asked to leave by an employee who said her outfit violated the Planet Fitness dress code .

"By . Jill Reilly . Two inmates have died and more than a hundred have been injured after an apparent gas explosion at a jail in northern Florida. The blast partly leveled the four-story Escambia County Jail's central booking facility, which held roughly 600 inmates, at about 11 p.m., county spokeswoman Kathleen Castro. Roughly 100 -150 inmates and correctional officers were hurt she said, as she confirmed two people had died. The injured were brought to hospitals and the uninjured inmates were brought to jails in neighboring counties, Castro said. Castro described a frenetic scene where officials were scrambling to get people out of the building, provide medical care, and working to make sure inmates were detained and routed to other facilities. She said there was a partial building collapse, a roof collapse and that it is believed that the walls are unstable in the facility. The explosion shook houses for several blocks and the areas has been quarantined by Sheriff's Office personnel. Sacred Heart Hospital spokesman Mike Burke told Pensacola News Journal that 31 people were brought to the hospital by ambulances and law enforcement officers are at the hospital providing security as the inmates are being treated. Kendrick Doidge said West Florida Hospital treated 37 inmates in the emergency room and all have been released back into the custody of the Escambia County Sheriff's Office. An updated statement on the Escambia County website later made no mention of gas, saying only it was an 'apparent explosion' after reporting earlier it was 'an apparent gas explosion'. Castro . didn't know if flooding in the area was a factor but says the jail did . get extensive flooding during heavy rains that drenched the region . Tuesday and Wednesday.

Children pictured at a protest in Bangalore as a 16-year old claims she was raped in similar circumstances to that of a 23-year-old student who died after being gang-raped on a bus in Delhi . Rape is the one of the most common crimes against Indian women. So common, in fact that there is a euphemism coined for the public sexual molestation of women. In refererence to the biblical 'Eve', . 'Eve teasing' implies that women are responsible for the behaviour of their attackers. Rape victims rarely press charges . because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the . attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting . themselves and their daughters from attack. New Delhi is the rape capital of India with a rape reported on average . every 18 hours. Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011. The attack echoes that against a . 23-year-old student who was cremated yesterday after she died from . injuries sustained when she gang-raped on a moving Delhi bus by six men. The . latest attack in India's 'rape capital' will fuel the protests which . have gripped the country since the gang-rape on December 16 and the . victim's subsequent death on Saturday. The 16-year-old girl claims she was raped by an off-duty bus conductor while an on-duty conductor and driver looked on. The . attack is believed to have stopped only when the driver became . disorientated by police barricades set up as a result of protests in . support of the 23-year-old gang-rape victim, and stopped to ask police . directions. Police spotted the traumatised girl in the back and came to her rescue. The victim boarded the bus at . Khayala near Subhash Nagar in west Delhi and was en route to Lajpat . Nagar. The accused has been identified as Ranjit Singh, . 32, a resident of Jhajjar. Indian hunger strikers (foreground) demonstrate following claims made by a 16-year-old rape victim and the death of a gang rape victim in New Delhi . Demonstrators call for the perpetrators of violence against the women to be hanged . He was arrested by the police deployed at the . Mandi House picket and later sent to judicial custody. The transport . department has dismissed the accused as well as the driver and . conductor. In a . sickening twist, the girl is reported to have been running away from her . home in west Delhi after accusing her brother of raping her. She has now been sent to Prayas, a childcare home in Lajpat Nagar. The brother of the 23-year-old gang-rape victim cremated on Saturday believes she could have survived but the decision to take her to Singapore for life-saving treatment came too late. In an interview with the Indian Express . today, he also called for the death penalty to be handed down to the perpetrators. 'The fight has just begun. We want all the . accused hanged, and we will fight for that, till the end,' he said. The trainee physiotherapist was flown to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore four days ago - almost two weeks after she was raped by a gang of six men on a bus in Delhi. 'She could have been saved perhaps, but . the decision came late,' her brother said, adding: 'Mount Elizabeth Hospital had very high standards . of hygiene. They could have prevented the infection.' Tense: The body of a young woman who was gang-raped and brutally beaten on a bus in India's capital was cremated but her family say she could have survived . Poignant: White lilies could be seen in the back of the ambulance as the body was transported through the city . The woman's body was cremated . yesterday after an aircraft chartered by the Indian government brought . it back to Delhi from Singapore where she died on Saturday . while being treated for severe injuries. Her horrific ordeal has galvanised . Indians to demand greater protection for women from sexual violence with . mass demonstrations, candle-lit vigils and street protests with . placards, chants and road blocks. The Indian Congress has put forward plans for chemical castration and 30-year jail terms for all rapists following the attack. A draft Bill has been put together and will be finalised and handed to India's chief justice by the end of January. Meanwhile the victim's father has described his final conversation with his daughter in the Intensive Care Unit in Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi. 'She said, ""aap so jao, main bhi ab soungi"" (you go to sleep, I will also sleep). Then she embraced my hand and slept as a tear dropped from the corner of her eye. Those were her last words to me. Thereafter, she never gained consciousness and didn't talk to any of us,' he said. Her mother was taken to hospital yesterday after collapsing while her daughter was being cremated. It has also emerged that the planned to marry her boyfriend, who was injured in the same attack, according to her neighbours. Aware: The body of the tragic student victim was cremated amid tight security, police said . Her brother paid tribute to her and her partner's bravery in the vicious attack. 'She was very strong. She always said one should never bear atrocities but fight against it. While she was admitted in hospital, she told me that she fought back as hard as she could. She was defending herself by beating and biting them. 'She thrashed them and kicked them too. They were boiling in anger by her defence so they decided to kill her. She told me that they were murmuring 'maar do ise' (kill her). They threw her considering she was dead. 'The boy was equally courageous like my sister. She told me that he guarded her until he became unconscious.' The girl and her boyfriend had spent the evening watching The Life of Pi at a multiplex . in the Saket district of Delhi when they were attacked on the bus home on December 16. It is thought he defended his girlfriend after she was . initially verbally abused by a group of six men. They . were then imprisoned on the bus by a gang for around an hour as . it was driven around Delhi. Their brutal assaults were hidden from view by the closed curtains on the bus. She was also abused with a rod, which . left her with horrific internal injuries. The pair were eventually . hurled naked from the vehicle as it was still moving. Rituals: After the body arrived at the airport, it was taken to the woman's  New Delhi home, where police stood guard outside, for religious rituals before being escorted by police to the crematorium . 'They had made all the wedding preparations and had planned a wedding party in Delhi,' a neighbour told NDTV. 'We know that she was going to get married in February,' she said. 'The whole neighbourhood was excited about it.' Today's private ceremony took place with Indian riot policemen standing guard outside the cremation centre  in New Delhi. Fearing the unrest amidst the public anger, the location and timing of the cremation was not disclosed, but it was held soon after the arrival of her body from Singapore on a special Air-India flight. Her distraught mother collapsed and was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital after her daughter's body was taken away. Premier Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress party, were at the airport to receive the body and meet family members of the victim who had also arrived on the flight. Tragic: The body of the young woman is moved into the funeral home by workers where she was embalmed before being flown home . Coffin: The casket at a funeral home in Singapore which carried the body of the 23-year-old gang-rape victim . After the body arrived at the . airport, it was taken to the woman's home in New Delhi for religious . rituals before being escorted by police to the crematorium. Security was tight, with no access to the public or media at the crematorium. Sheila Dikshit, the senior elected . leader of New Delhi, and junior home minister R.P.N. Singh placed . wreaths beside the body before it was cremated. Details about the girl's identity have not been released to protect the family. But The Hindustan Times newspaper described her as a dedicated student who tutored neighboursâ€™ children to boost her familyâ€™s income . Solace: An Indian activist prays as she takes part in a candlelight vigil in Kolkata for the gang-rape victim . The parents had sold a plot of land nearby as well as land in their village in Ballia district of eastern Uttar Pradesh to fund their daughter's education. 'Now her elder brother, who is preparing for his engineering entrance exams, has no hope to continue his studies. The family had depended on her future career to see them out of their poverty,' a neighbour called Vimla told IANS.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Dr Drew Pinsky has managed to offend not only an innocent couple who phoned in for his help on a recent episode of Loveline, but also endometriosis sufferers around the country and beyond. The reality TV doctor, who has hosted Celebrity Rehab and a number of subsequent spin-offs, interrupted his caller as he was explaining that his fiancee had endometriosis, lactose intolerance and interstitial cystitis. 'These are what we call sort of functional disorders,' he began. 'They're sort of... they're what we call ""garbage bag disorders,"" when you can't think of anything else, you go, ""Eh, well it's that.""' In hot water: Dr Drew (pictured) has come under fire for labeling endometriosis a 'garbage bag disorder' while offering advice to a caller on his radio show, Loveline . He then proceeded to suggest that perhaps she was 'visiting doctors all the time' because she was sexually abused growing up. Surprisingly, the male caller confirmed that indeed she had been sexually abused, at which point Dr Drew somewhat triumphantly leapt into his next diatribe. 'The only way her body, which was suffering during those early experiences, can tell its tale of woe is with pain,' he says, describing the 'unexplained' discomfort as 'somatoform dissociation'. 'She really needs to see a trauma specialist, not a urologist. Know what I'm saying?' In a shock move, Dr Drew promptly hung up, giving his caller no opportunity to ask his actual question. Regretting that now? Dr Drew, pictured during the segment on Loveline in which he made the inflammatory comments, has since semi-apologized amid a fierce backlash . Endometreosis is defined as the abnormal growth of cells, . similar to those that form the inside of the uterus, but in a location . outside of the uterus. Endometriosis can make it more difficult for a woman to conceive a child . Pelvic pain during menstruation or ovulation can be a symptom of the disorder. Treatment of endometriosis includes medication and surgery for both pain relief and treatment of infertility if pregnancy is desired. The internet was quickly awash with angry respondents, many of whom are sufferers of endometrosis - which is defined by medicinenet.com as 'the abnormal growth of cells, . similar to those that form the inside of the uterus, but in a location . outside of the uterus.' 'How can you call it a garbage bag disorder when the patient has actual positive diagnostic tests?' wrote one angry viewer on Loveline's comment section. 'Did my urologist etch-a-sketch ulcers in my bladder? Did my gynecologist doodle in my over growing uterine lining?' Another wrote: 'I am one of 200 million women with this disorder. I miss work every month, Fashion Week, . friend's birthdays, parties, etc. It affects every part of my life.' Indeed, Padma Lakshmi, the stunning host of Bravo's hit show Top Chef, is just one celebrity who has spoken out previously about her very real battle with the disorder. 'I became very angry at the fact that I personally was only diagnosed with endometriosis at age 36,' she said during a TV appearance, describing repeated doctor visits over the course of her life which failed to turn up answers. 'I thought that the doctors knew better. Doctors should listen to patients and patients should listen to their own bodies.' Ms Lakshmi subsequently underwent successful excision surgery to remove her endometriosis and went on to have a child. She is now the co-founder of the Endometriosis Foundation of America. In response to the negative backlash Dr Drew received, he offered a sheepish apology on last night's Lifeline. He told listeners that he didn't mean that all endometriosis . diagnoses were 'garbage', just that in the case of that . particular caller, it sounded like doctors were searching in vain for an . explanation for her pain. Trouble at home: Dr Drew's 22-year-old daughter, Paulina Pinsky (left) recently revealed she had been struggling with bulimia for seven years, without her father or mother Susan (right) noticing . Dr Drew's flippant solution to this problem isn't his only public comment to cause a stir. In 2010, when asked for his parenting opinion in the case of troubled star Lindsay Lohan, he declared: 'If [she] were my daughter, I would pack her car full with illegal substances, . send her on her way, call the police, and make sure she was arrested. I . would make sure she was not allowed to get out of jail.' Ironically for the man with the iron fist, only this year, his own daughter, 22-year-old Paulina Pinsky, revealed she had been suffering from bulimia for seven years, right under the very nose of her father, who is trained in the field of eating disorders. 'This condition, like many, is cunning, and hiding and secrecy is a feature of the condition,' he said of his daughter's public confession.","The reality TV doctor made the comments to a concerned caller on his radio show, Loveline .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Inside Edition correspondent Megan Alexander has opened up about her decision to save her virginity for marriage, . Ms Alexander, 34, who has been married to husband Brian Cournoyer since 2008, has told Fox News that her decision to wait stemmed from her devotion to her Christian faith. ‘I claimed my faith for myself in about junior high,’ she said, adding: ‘I accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and saviour in about 7th grade and made that decision myself and that’s been the best thing I’ve ever did.’ [sic] . Waited for marriage: Inside Edition correspondent Megan Alexander (pictured) has opened up about why she waited to lose her virginity . The Seattle native says that she wanted to speak out about her decision to wait ‘because I feel like young people today, specifically teenagers and millennials in their 20s and 30s, there’s so much pressure to just get involved [physically] and to think that’s normal. ‘I wanted people to know, hey there’s another option. This is the option that I chose and it can work for you too.’ Ms Alexander admits that she is well aware her choice of lifestyle is not for everyone. All smiles: Ms Alexander (with husband Brian) wants young people not to feel rushed into having sex . However, she hopes that speaking out will help influence those who feel pressured to have sex. ‘I want to encourage the next generation to take their time, to value their bodies and to realize that it's okay to wait if you want to. Hoping to influence others: Ms Alexander (pictured with husband Brian and their son) says that while she knows her decision isn't for everyone, young adults should not feel pressured to have sex . ‘And for me, it worked out great and I believe that other people need to hear that message and know that it's just fine to take their time,’ she said. Ms Alexander says that her husband, 34, with whom she has one son, was completely comfortable with her decision to wait. ‘Because we were friends before and [he] knew what I stood for, what I was all about, what I believed in and I did of him,' she said. Keeping the faith: Ms Alexander waiting to have sex because of her strong ties to the Christian religion . The two set physical boundaries as soon as they began dating.

"By . Associated Press . and Francesca Chambers . Senate Republicans blocked an election-year Democratic bill on Wednesday that would have boosted the federal minimum wage to $10.10 from $7.25 an hour. The vote was 54-42 in favor of allowing . debate on the measure to proceed, six votes short of the 60 that . Democrats needed to prevail. Sen. Bob Corker was the only . Republican to cross party lines and vote 'yes.' Reid switched his vote . to 'no,' which gives him the right to call another vote on the measure. No other Democrats opposed the bill. Even if the Senate had voted on passed the legislation, it would have died in the House, which is controlled by Republicans. Scroll down for video . Sen. Tom Harkin's legislation would have hiked the minimum wage up to $10.10 an hour from $7.25 over the next 30 months . The measure's rejection, which was . expected, came in the early months of a campaign season in which the . slowly recovering economy — and its impact on families — is a marquee . issue. 'Millions of American workers will be . watching how each senator votes today. To them, it's a matter of . survival,' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said before the vote. He pointedly added, 'For Republicans, this vote will demonstrate whether they truly care about our economy.' Reid blamed Republican reluctance to pass minimum wage legislation on conservative billionaires David and Charles Koch. President Barack Obama blasted Republicans in a statement after the vote. 'They said ""no"" to helping millions work their way out of poverty,' Obama said. The President characterized the issue of raising the minimum wage as 'a very simple one.' 'Either you're in favor of raising wages for hard working Americans, or . you're not,' said Obama, who named raising the minimum wage as one of . his goals for 2014 in the president's annual State of the Union address . in January. After the vote President Barack Obama blasted Republicans for saying, ' ""no"" to helping millions work their way out of poverty' Republicans, solidly against the Democratic proposal, say it would be too expensive for employers and cost jobs. As ammunition, they cite a February study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that estimated the increase to $10.10 could eliminate about 500,000 jobs — but also envisioned higher income for 16.5 million low-earning people. 'Washington Democrats' true focus these days seems to be making the far left happy, not helping the middle class,' said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. 'This is all about politics,' said No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Cornyn of Texas. ""This is about trying to make this side of the aisle look bad and hard-hearted."" The . legislation, authored by Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, would gradually raise the $7.25 . hourly minimum to $10.10 over 30 months and provide automatic . annual increases to account for inflation. Harkin's bill would also gradually . increase the minimum wage for tipped workers like waiters to 70 percent . of the minimum for most other workers. It is currently $2.13 hourly, . which can be paid as long as their hourly earnings with tips total at . least $7.25. Democrats argue that if fully . phased in by 2016, Harkin's legislation would push a family of three above the federal . poverty line — a level such earners have not surpassed since 1979. The minimum wage was first enacted in 1938 and set at 25 cents. Congress . has passed nine laws slowly increasing it, including one each decade . since the 1980s. The minimum has been $7.25 since 2009. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine who has been seeking a deal with other senators on a lower figure than $10.10, said on Wednesday that she will continue that effort. Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who usually sides with Democrats, said he too favors finding middle ground. But Democratic leaders have shown no inclination to do that — a view shared by unions that favor an increase and business groups that oppose one. 'We're not going to compromise on $10.10,' Reid told reporters after the vote. In a clear sign of the political value Democrats believe the issue has, Democrats said they intend to force another vote on the increase closer to this year's elections. The White House issued a statement urging the bill's passage and saying the administration wants legislation 'to build real, lasting economic security for the middle class and create more opportunities for every hardworking American to get ahead.' 'The senators who voted no today are doing contrary to the wishes of the American people,' White House press secretary Jay Carney said after the vote. 'There is a reason to do this, and we ought to see Republicans acting in the interest of Americans to get it done.' Supporters note that the minimum wage's buying power has fallen. It reached its peak value in 1968, when it was $1.60 hourly but was worth $10.86 in today's dollars. The legislation is opposed by business groups including the National Council of Chain Restaurants and the International Franchise Association. The National Restaurant Association has hundreds of members at the Capitol this week lobbying lawmakers on several issues, including opposition to a higher minimum wage. Also opposed were conservative organizations including Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity. Opposition from Republicans running the House makes it unlikely that chamber would debate minimum wage legislation this year. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, about two-thirds of the 3.3 million people who earned $7.25 an hour or less last year worked in service jobs, mostly food preparation and serving. More than 6 in 10 of those making $7.25 or under were women, and about half were under age 25. Democrats hope their support for a minimum wage boost will draw voters from both groups — who usually lean Democratic — to the polls in November, when Senate control will be at stake. The GOP's hold on the House is not in doubt. Harkin's legislation also would provide automatic annual increases in the minimum wage to account for inflation. The bill could come back up for a vote in the Senate this year .

Jocelyn Kirsch and her former boyfriend Edward Anderton were dubbed 'Bonnie and Clyde' after being convicted in 2007 of stealing almost $120,000 to spend on vacations, clothing, jewelry and even $2,000 hair extensions. The 28-year-old was sentenced to five months at a Philadelphia court after violating her federal probation by shoplifting and failing to pay restitution for her previous crimes. Jocelyn Kirsch, 28, makes her way into court on Tuesday. She was sentenced to five months in jail after she violated her parole by shoplifting . 'Bonnie and Clyde' thieves Jocelyn Kirsch (left) and Edward Anderton (right) spent time behind bars for identity theft. Kirsch, 28, was sentenced to five months on Tuesday for violating her probation by shoplifting . Kirsch was arrested in 2007 after spending thousands of dollars of other people's money on exotic holidays to the Caribbean and Europe . According to philly.com, U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno asked on Tuesday: 'Is the defendant mentally ill or is she a self-indulgent criminal? This court cannot fully answer this question.' Kirsch, wearing a green jumpsuit, refused to answer but her lawyer Ronald Greenblatt said her thefts were caused by the depression and anxiety she suffered from media attention. The prosecution argued that because of her past, Kirsch deserved to be punished. The 28-year-old was busted in 2012 for shoplifting clothes from Banana Republic, BCBG, J. Crew and Nordstrom’s stores at a mall in Walnut Creek, California. She had been living in the state since being released from prison in 2011. The former Drexel University student also failed to make any of the . court-ordered, $250 monthly restitution payments to the victims of a scam . that saw her and Anderton opening credit cards, writing checks and even . just stealing cash from others. Kirsch told a packed courtroom during . her 2008 sentencing that her ‘regret runs bone deep and she will never . repeat this mistake again,’ according to KYW. They spent the money on lavish vacations to the Caribbean, Hawaii, Europe and Morocco. Kirsch, 28, lived a lavish lifestyle by defrauding friends and neighbors. She was jailed again on Tuesday for stealing clothes from Nordstrom . Evidence collected by police revealed that Kirsch (left) had been flying all over the world on other people's money . Anderton and Kirsch dined in the best . restaurants and attended the most exclusive parties. They flaunted their . excess on Facebook and in Philadelphia’s society pages - which . ultimately led to their downfall. They were busted in 2007 after writing a phony check to a Philadelphia salon to pay for $2,000 hair extensions. A . little digging by the stylist led her to a postal box rented at UPS . Store on the campus of Drexel University, where Kirsch was a student. They were arrested retrieving a package of lingerie delivered to the post box but addressed to their neighbor. Evidence recovered from their apartment included a professional ID maker, computer spyware and lock-picking tools. Kirsch was sentenced to five years in prison and Anderton received four years but both . were released early for good behavior.

A photo of a 'college hunk' is making the rounds on social media websites this week, but not necessarily because of the man's supposed hunky-ness, but for his kindness towards an elderly woman who has a hard time standing up for long periods of time. When a mover who works for the College Hunks Hauling Junk moving company in Tampa, Florida, became stuck in an elevator with the older woman, she explained the trouble she has with standing. Rather than respond with an 'oh -- that's unfortunate,' College Hunk Cesar Larios - who is studying at the Art Institute of Florida in addition to being a junk-hunk - got down on his hands and knees and acted as a bench for the older woman.

'The response to the picture is mind blowing.

At first he tried to use a fire extinguisher to tackle the blaze but when that failed to dampen the fire, the officer used his own strength to pull the driver, Uriel Basurto Sierra, free. 'When I tried to communicate and ask him . questions, I realized that he was unresponsive - he was bleeding . profusely from the head,' Putulowski told ABC10. To reach Sierra, the officer had to reach in through the passenger side window and pull him clear of the burning wreckage.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Montana Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the one-month-jail sentence that teacher Stacey Dean Rambold received for raping a 14-year-old girl and will now be re-sentenced for his crime. To national outrage Rambold, 54, was handed the staggeringly light sentence because Yellowstone County District Court Judge G. Todd Baugh said that his victim was somehow complicit in the rape because she was 'in control of the situation.' Victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending and in his verdict, Judge Baugh, who has since admitted his grave error, said that Moralez 'seemed older than her chronological age.' Going to jail for more than one month: The Montana Supreme Court  on Wednesday, April 30, 2014 overturned a one-month prison sentence given to Stacey Rambold, a former high school teacher convicted of raping a 14-year-old student . In their decision, the court found that statements made by Baugh at the original sentencing in August 'reflected an improper basis for his decision and cast serious doubt on the appearance of justice.' Rambold, who was 47 at the time of the crime will be sentenced by a new judge after Baugh's failure to re-sentence him in September. Rambold has been free since completing his sentence last fall. Prosecutors for the state say he should serve a mandatory minimum of four years prison. His attorneys had argued that the original sentence was appropriate. Rambold said that his 14-year-old victim Cherice . Moralez (pictured here) was responsible for his actions because she . appeared older than her age . Tragedy: The victim Cherice Moralez killed herself while the case against Rambold was pending . A disciplinary complaint against Baugh from the Judicial Standards Commission is pending with the state Supreme Court. Justices say that will be dealt with separately. In March, Rambold repeated his claim that Moralez led him on and was as much to blame for their encounter as himself. Under state law, children younger than 16 cannot consent to sexual intercourse. 'Rambold continues to perpetuate the myth that a 14-year-old girl should bear responsibility for her sexual victimization by a 47-year-old teacher,' Assistant Attorney General Tammy Plubell wrote in court filings chastizing Rambold. 'The law, though, rightly defines her as blameless.' District Judge G. Todd Baugh: In August Baugh sentenced Rambold to one-month in jail for raping a 14-year-old girl who killed herself. He has since admitted his huge mistake and even tried to re-sentence Rambold in August but failed . Rambold's attorneys have argued that the original sentence from state District Judge G. Todd Baugh was appropriate. In a brief submitted to the state's high court last month, they urged justices to reject the appeal. Citing Moralez's statements in interviews with law enforcement recorded before her death, Rambold attorneys Jay Lansing and Nancy Schwartz said there was 'no rational basis' to conclude a 14-year-old could bear responsibility only as the offender in a rape case. Stacey Dean Rambold was only given a one month prison sentence for his rape against a 14-year-old victim he said 'looked older than her age' A 14-year-old victim can bear responsibility, too, the attorneys suggested. The interviews are under court seal and have not been made public. Lansing and Schwartz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have turned down previous interview requests. Moralez was a freshman at Billings High School when she was raped. Rambold was her business teacher. She committed suicide in 2010, an act her mother said was driven largely by the rape. The girl's death took away the prosecution's main witness, and Rambold initially avoided prison under a deferred-prosecution agreement that included sex-offender treatment. He violated the agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives' children and having a sexual relationship with an adult woman, according to court documents. That re-opened the case and led to the August sentence from Baugh of 15 years in prison with all but one month suspended. Rambold was released in September. Baugh unsuccessfully sought to impose a longer term after coming under criticism for saying during the sentencing hearing that the victim 'appeared older than her chronological age.' Montana's Judicial Standards Commission has asked the Supreme Court to censure Baugh for imposing an unlawful sentence and blaming the child victim. The panel investigated the case after receiving hundreds of complaints about the judge, including from mother, Auliea Hanlon.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Associated Press Reporter . Sentenced: Albrecht Muth, 49, will spend the next 50 years in prison for strangling to death his socialite wife, 91, in 2011 . A German man who posed as an Iraqi general and other eccentric characters was sentenced this afternoon to 50 years in prison for the murder of his 91-year-old wife in Washington DC. Albrecht Muth, 49, was convicted in January of killing his wife, Viola Drath, a German writer and socialite. She was found dead in the couple's row home in Washington's posh Georgetown neighborhood in August 2011. Muth told police that he found his wife of 20 years dead in a bathroom, but an investigator concluded Drath's death was staged. Prosecutors said Muth, who was decades younger than his wife, beat and strangled her and then moved her body. The 49-year-old convicted killer did not appear physically in court on Wednesday for his sentencing but attended via videoconference from a hospital, the same way he attended his trial. Muth has been intermittently fasting, and that has left him unable to sit or stand. On Wednesday, he lay in a hospital bed staring at the ceiling for much of the hearing, with a blanket partially obscuring his face. His lawyer, Dana Page, read a statement on his behalf in which he said he was innocent and blamed his wife's death on agents from Iran who were trying to kill him, a claim he has made before. ‘I did not kill my wife,’ he wrote. A forensic investigator said Muth (left) appeared anxious and fidgety when she came to the home to take photographs and inspect his the body of his wife (right) But D.C. Superior Court Judge Russell Canan said the evidence of Muth's guilt was ‘overwhelming.’ He said Muth, who has adopted various personas over the years including pretending to be a European count and an Iraqi general, is ‘nothing more than a common domestic serial abuser.’ Canan's sentence means Muth would be older than his wife was when she died if he were ever to be released from prison. Muth, who prosecutors said was motivated by $200,000 in inheritance money, had claimed that his elderly wife died from a fall in the bathroom, but authorities said her injuries were not consistent with someone who had fallen. The killing captivated Washington . because of Drath's longtime connections to the city's diplomatic and . social circles, and due to revelations in the couple's unconventional . relationship. In January, jurors heard about how he masqueraded as a brigadier general in the Iraqi army, strolling around his neighborhood in a uniform he purchased. He also displayed a store-bought military certificate in his home even though he didn't actually have a military background. Muth's lawyers argued that no physical evidence connected him to the killing and said the case against their client was circumstantial. Muth denied guilt, blaming her death on a botched Iranian hit job targeting him. Victim: German journalist and socialite Viola Drath was found beaten and strangled in the couple's D.C. home. Prosecutors said that her much-younger husband had sought inheritance money . Prosecutors cited a pattern of verbal and physical abuse toward his wife, including a conviction for assaulting her in 1992. They said Muth, who lived on a $2,000 monthly allowance from Drath that had recently been reduced by $200, was motivated by money and made a bogus claim to a portion of her estate. Drath was a journalist who wrote often on German affairs for publications including The Washington Times and Handelsblatt, a German newspaper. In 1990, following the death of her first husband, she married Muth, who was nearly a half-century younger. The couple lived together in a row home in Georgetown, where they routinely organized dinner parties for dignitaries. Muth also became romantically involved for several years with a man who eventually sought a restraining order against him in 2004. On the morning of August 12, 2011, following a night of heavy drinking, Muth called police to report finding his wife dead inside a third-floor bathroom of their home. Disinherited: Drath, pictured, had written her much younger husband out of her will . Crime scene: The investigation began after Muth reported finding Drath's body in the bathroom of their home in Georgetown, Washington. He claimed she had fallen but police later ruled it a homicide . He said she had fallen, and investigators initially treated the death as one of natural causes. But the medical examiner's office concluded within days that it was a homicide. During trial, prosecutors presented graphic . crime scene photographs of Drath sprawled dead on the bathroom floor . with what one expert described as a large, bloody gash on her neck and . another wound on the back of her neck. Detectives settled on Muth as the suspect after finding no signs of forced entry. They determined only Muth and his wife were home at the time of her death. They also said he presented Drath's daughter with a phony amendment to her will, even though Drath specifically left him out of it. A forensic investigator said Muth appeared anxious and . fidgety but otherwise emotionless after she came to the home to take . photographs and inspect the body. She said he seemed especially curious . to know the cause of death and whether any trauma was found that could . explain it. After killing Drath, prosecutors said Muth searched the Internet for information about extradition arrangements with Mexico, flights to Iceland and crossing the Canadian border. One of Drath's daughters, Connie Drath Dwyer, testified that Muth had pressured her mother for money and insisted he be able to keep furniture upon her death.","Albrecht Muth beat and strangled Viola Drath in their bathroom in August 2011 but told police that she must have fallen .

"By . Peter Rugg . Eight months after federal agents brought down the man alleged to be running an underground Web site called Silk Road that had become a thriving venue for drug trafficking, not only is the site up and running again but the new version is more vibrant then ever. A report from watchdog group the Digital Citizens Alliance claims the 'online black market economy has done a complete somersault in the . six months since the fall of the original Silk Road. 'New players have arisen, including a second incarnation of . ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’ and a revived Silk Road (which seems to be . thriving, even after law enforcement arrested and charged some of the . new site’s prominent figures) has replaced the original. Months after the feds busted the operator behind 'darknet' site Silk Road, the site is thriving with more than 13,000 listings for drug sales online today . This artist rendering shows Ross William Ulbricht appearing in Federal Court in San Francisco after being accused of operating Silk Road under the pseudonym 'The Dread Pirate Roberts.' A new, anonymous, operator has now adopted the name . The Dread Pirate Roberts is the pseudonym of Ross Ulbricht, 29, who allegedly ran the site, and who now sits in jail awaiting trial on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Ulbricht's lawyer declined to comment for this story and his client has maintained his innocence. The report goes on to claim that Silk Road contains approximatley 13,648 listings for drugs compared to the roughly 13,000 listed before the FBI busted the mastermind behind it, Ross Ulbricht, and shuttered, or at least attempted to shutter, the domain. The site is perhaps the most well-known part of what's being called the 'darknet' drug economy, which taken all together now contains 75 per cent more listings for drugs. The figures come from the report, 'Busted But not Broken,' cited by ABC News in a recent report. A DEA spokesman declined comment. 'That just goes to show that people are still interested in partaking in . this kind of activity, regardless of what happened to the original Silk . Road,' said Nicolas Christin, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Silk Road transactions are often based around Bitcoin exchange - a digital currency largely unregulated and valued at $448 to one Bitcoin as of today . What has changed since the first bust, Christin said, is the feeling that one could operate on the site with impunity, such as collecting money for drugs than disappearing without sending product to the buyer. 'What has been denting consumer confidence are some of the large scams . on those marketplaces,' he said. 'There is no longer a feeling of . invincibility as there might have been during the heyday of the original . Silk Road.' Silk Road 2.0 - which . can only be accessed through a modified internet browser - sells items . such as cocaine, ecstasy, fake utility bills and driving licences using . the encrypted digital currency ‘bitcoins’. The value of one . bitcoin - a currency not backed by a government or central bank - is . currently equivalent to $448. The news that the site is thriving is unsurprising, as it was reported users had taken control only weeks after the site was supposed to be closed on Oct. 2, 2013. Authorities have found listings for marijuana, cocaine, ephedrine, and dozens of other controlled substances on Silk Road . Just weeks later, British-based user 'Saint Nic' said he . was selling '50x Nintendo Mario Allstars 170mg MDMA Ecstasy' and they . would be posted first-class by Royal Mail. The drugs were available for . 1.79 bitcoins (£390). Another . item was a fake Lithuanian passport, which the vendor 'ThreeKings' said . can be used 'for work, migration to EU country, renting a car or other . reasons'. This sells for 7.58 bitcoins (£1,665). Anyone can access . the website by creating a profile - not linked to an email account - and . are greeted by a note from the new Dread Pirate . Roberts. Part of the message . says: ‘It took the FBI two and a half years to do what they did. Divide, conquer and eliminate was their strategy… but four weeks of . temporary silence is all they got. The DEA has declined to comment on the site's resurgence as the alleged original operators await trial . ‘And . as our resilient community bounces back even stronger than ever before, . never forget that they can only ever seize assets - they can never . arrest our spirit, our ideas or our passion, unless we let them. We will . not let them.’ The message - . on the homepage of Silk Road 2.0 - adds that it has ‘implemented a . complete security overhaul’ which ‘marks the dawn of a brand new era for . hidden services’. Other items available for purchase on . Silk Road 2.0 from various sellers include fake jewellery, clothes and . accessories, adult content and hard drives full of music albums and . films.","Site was officials closed in October after agents brought down the head operators .

"By . Lydia Warren . A decomposed body found off a rural road in upstate New York 30 years ago has finally been identified as belonging to an aspiring model who vanished as she headed to New York City. The body found by a hunter in Shelby, New York in October 1983 has now been identified as Shari Lynne Ball, a 20-year-old woman who disappeared after leaving Boca Raton, Florida. After the body was found, it was badly decomposed and could not be identified so was buried beneath a tombstone reading 'Jane Doe'. But cold-case investigators, working with local authorities, requested that the body be exhumed from its grave in October last year and compared with samples in the National DNA Database. Found: Shari Lynne Ball, pictured, vanished in 1983 as she traveled from Florida to New York to pursue a modeling career. A body found four months later in upstate New York has now been identified as hers . There was a match; Ball's mother had provided a sample in 2005, the Sun Sentinel reported. Ball was just 20 when she left her home in Boca Raton on June 27, 1983 and told relatives she was heading north to pursue a modeling career. Two days later, she called a friend from a truck stop in Ashland, Virginia - the last time anyone heard from her. Four months later, in October 1983, a hunter discovered a body in Shelby, Orleans County, New York - nearly 400 miles northwest of New York City, and more than 1,300 miles from her Florida home. But with the body so badly decomposed, she could not be identified, and Ball was declared legally dead in 1988, as her family continued to wonder what had happened to her. Police say they suspect foul play may have been involved in her death, but could not provide further details. Locator: A map shows the distance between where she was last seen and where her body was found . Investigators have traveled to Ball's mother's house to notify her in person that her daughter's body had been found, Lt. Kevin Reyes with the New York State Police told the Sentinel. 'It did give her closure in knowing that she does know exactly what has happened to her daughter... as opposed to it being a mystery,' he said. Records show that Ball's mother, Nancy, had first called police on the night she left before calling again in October 1983, saying no one had seen her daughter for months. But a report was filed saying no foul play was suspected because she was an adult who had left of her own accord. It also noted that Ball and her mother had difficulties in their relationship. Reyes said detectives will now try to establish a timeline of events leading up to her death and start interviewing people who knew her. 'Similarities': Christopher Wilder's name has been mentioned although not directly linked to the case, investigators said. Wilder was known as the Beauty Queen Killer for murdering beautiful women in 1984 . He added that the name of one serial killer had been brought up - Christopher Wilder, who became known as The Beauty Queen Killer, for killing and raping women in Florida in 1984, and one of his victims was raped and stabbed in upstate New York. He was killed in a confrontation with police in April 1984. 'The name has been brought up, but we have no evidence as of yet to link this individual to this disappearance,' Reyes said of Wilder. Ball was 20 years old, white, 5ft4, 100 . pounds, with hazel eyes and blonde hair and was also known to use the . name of Timmerman when she disappeared, police say. Anyone who knew her or who may be able to provide information is urged to contact New .

"By . Snejana Farberov . More trouble: Andrew Nisbet, 32, arrested . last December for sexually abusing at least two boys while working as a golf . instructor in Livermore, California, is now facing solicitation for murder charges . A popular California youth golf coach charged with molesting three of his male students has attempted to hire a hit man from behind bars to kill at least two of the victims, officials said. According to an affidavit, Andrew Nisbet, 32, wrote letters from his cell in Santa Rita Jail in Dublin talking about having two young men 'taken care of.' Nisbet's letters containing information about the alleged victims eventually wound up in the hands of a confidential informant, who told about them to a sheriff's deputy in February. Alameda County district attorney's Inspector Jeff McCort wrote in the affidavit that Nisbet penned additional letters to the informant acting as an intermediary agreeing on a price for each hit. Last month, an undercover district attorney's inspector visited Nisbet in jail posing as a gun-for-hire and secretly recorded their conversation. The agent described himself to Nisbet as a 'mechanic and said he could fix a car for him and made a pistol-shooting motion with his hand,' the affidavit cited by San Francisco Chronicle stated. The suspected pedophile replied by saying that there were two 'cars' that were in need of fixing in Pleasanton and Santa Barbara. According to officials, one of Nisbet's alleged molestation victims attends college in Santa Barbara. The bogus assassin then asked Nisbet to name the Santa Barbara resident, and the former golf coach mouthed the name, adding that the 'car' was 21 years old, McCort wrote in the court document. Instructor: Nisbet had tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore since 2006 and was arrested in December 2013 . Well connected: Nisbet is seen here accepting an . PGA junior league award last year from US Ryder Cup Captain Davis Love . III as his students pass their time in an airport playing cards as seen . on his Facebook page . The Livermore coach also allegedly suggested to the undercover officer that he should steal the victims' cell phones to make the hits look like robberies. Nisbet then allegedly offered to pay for the hits up front to prove to the 'mechanic' that he was serious. When officials searched Nisbet's cell a week later, they discovered driving directions to the home of the victim from Pleasanton and a heap of letters written by the suspect to the informant discussing the alleged assassination plot. In additional to the 75 felony counts he had been charged with in connection to the child sex abuse, Nisbet now also faces three counts of solicitation of murder. He is due back in court June 10. Nisbet, who is married, had tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore since 2006 and was arrested in December 2013 - a day before he was due to receive a PGA award for Coach of the Year at the prestigious Contra Costa Country Club. According to a criminal complaint, Nisbet, who also operated the GRIP Junior Golf Academy, is accused of performing oral sex on his victims - some as young as 12 - in his car from December 2009 through March 2012 and showing them pornography on his phone - including child pornorgrpay. . The complaint also alleges that other sex acts were committed by Nisbet in the golf clubs parking lot and during out-of-town golfing excursions. Livermore police officer Steve Goard said that authorities became aware of the allegations when one of Nisbet's golf students reported that he was abused last November. Worrying: Nisbet was arrested at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore - the day before he was due to receive the prestigious PGA's 2013 Junior Golf Leader Award . Las Positas Golf Course has announced Nisbet has been fired since his arrest. 'He befriended them as the cool coach, gave them rides to and from practice and bought them gifts, including top-of-the-line golf equipment,' Goard said to the San Jose Mercury News. 'He created a coach-athlete bond and, as he did, was figuring out who he could get away with it with.' Nisbet was taken into custody at 10am December 7, 2013, on the golf course while he was working. During his initial interview, police said he admitted some lewd acts with the children. His wife of two years, Kimberly Patrick Nisbet, has not commented on the allegations and appears to have moved out of the family home in Livermore, which is next door to Jackson Elementary School. Wedding day: Andrew Nisbet has been married to his wife Kimberly for two years and they recently traveled to Lake Tahoe to celebrate their anniversary . Arrested: Andrew Nisbet with his wife Kimberly - Nisbet was arrested last year and charged with 75 counts of pedophilia by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office for abuse spanning three years . According to his biography . online, Nisbet majored in professional golf management at Mississippi . State University and had worked as a golf pro at The Country Club of .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . A woman and her boyfriend moved in with her uncle, stole from his bank accounts and then suffocated him before jumping to their deaths off the George Washington Bridge, police said Wednesday. Suffern Police Chief Clarke Osborn said investigators are confident they have pieced together the strange story but acknowledged that with all three principals dead, 'We may never be able to answer some of the questions.' The killing of William Valenti, 70, of Suffern, was discovered Monday by a nephew, Osborn said. The killers, identified as Nickie Hunt, 40, and Gary Crockett, 41, had tried to delay the discovery of the body by posting a note on the back door that said Valenti had been taken to a hospital, the chief said. But Valenti was in his bedroom, dead from asphyxiation. Gary Crockett, 41, and Nickie Circelli, 40, both of Suffern, N.Y.,  died after jumping into the Hudson River about 11:20 a.m. Monday . Osborn said police have not established how he was suffocated or which person did it. Detective Craig Long said Hunt also left a few notes, including one addressed to 'the four most amazing kids this world has ever seen or ever will.' He said that note did not mention the killing or admit guilt but apologized in general for the children's upbringing and Hunt's estrangement from their father. The children did not live with Hunt. 'The tenor of the note indicates that she is going down a dark road' but does not specifically mention suicide, Long said. Crockett left no note, he said. As detectives investigated the killing, they learned about a 'family dispute' — Valenti had accused the couple of stealing more than $1,000 from him and had threatened to go to the police, Osborn said. Note: Officials say Hunt left a suicide note for her children - however, it did not acknowledge the murder of Valenti . Several hours after the killing, a police dispatcher heard about the George Washington Bridge double suicide and mentioned it to detectives. The jumpers carried no identification, but their description — a white man and woman in their 40s — fit the suspects. The key to Valenti's Chevrolet Malibu was in the dead woman's pocket, Osborn said, and the two have since been positively identified. Osborn said investigators believe Hunt and Crockett fled the murder scene in the Malibu, drove the 20 miles to one side of the bridge, walked out onto the span and jumped. He said the car has not been found. Osborn said the killing was the first in Suffern in more than a decade. He said Valenti had no relatives closer than his niece and nephew. Drugs: Hunt and Crockett were known drug users, and authorities say they stole about $1,300 from Valenti prior to murdering him . When Valenti's body was found, an autopsy revealed that had a broken vertebra in his neck, which authorities believe was caused by Hunt or Crockett - or both. Their death has been linked to that of Nickie Circelli's (pictured) uncle in Suffern on Monday . A neighbor told the New York Daily News that she heard a loud 'boom' from Circelli’s relative’s flat on Monday night. Josefina Rodriguez, 42, lives in an apartment above Circelli’s uncle said:  'In the morning I didn’t hear him cough,' she added, referring to the victim. 'He always coughed. And every day I heard his truck. When I didn’t hear his truck, I thought something must be wrong.' She said Circelli’s uncle was found dead on Monday afternoon by his business partner - they owned a catering business. Investigators found a letter in which the couple apologized for their actions, a source told the New York Daily News. The couple did not have identification on them when they were pulled from the water so the letter was a crucial piece of evidence that enabled investigators to identify them. A woman who said she had been a friend of the couple, Heather Becraft of Sloatsburg, N.Y.,  said Circelli had children who live in another part of New York State with their father. She said they 'were very much in love' but had been having problems that she did not disclose, reported North Jersey.com. Another friend, who asked not to be identified, told the website that the couple struggled with drug addiction. The deputy mayor of Suffern, Jo Meegan-Corrigan, said on Tuesday night that a man’s body was found at the home where the couple lived on Washington Avenue. She declined to provide more details, saying she 'would like to give the family time to gather themselves.' Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said workers on the lower level of the bridge saw an object go by them at about 11:20 a.m. When they looked down, they saw the man and the woman in the water .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The military is reviewing its new regulations involving soldiers' appearance following criticism that the changes in hair requirements are racially biased. Earlier this month, the Army issued new . appearance standards that ban most twists, dreadlocks and large . cornrows - styles used predominantly by African-American women with . natural hairstyles. Black women make up a third of the armed forces. Soldiers are 'not authorized to wear braids, cornrows, or dreadlocks (unkempt, twisted, matted, individual parts of hair) while in uniform, or in civilian clothes on duty,' the guidelines note. New guidelines: The hair rules for the military are being reviewed after complaints said the banned styles - twists, dreadlocks and large cornrows - are largely used by African-Americans . But Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called for the review after 16 female members of the Congressional Black Caucus wrote to him, complaining about the updated guidelines. In their original letter, they wrote: 'Though we . understand the intent of the updated regulation is to ensure uniformity . in our military, it is seen as discriminatory rules targeting soldiers . who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain . their natural hair.' They also said that the guidelines calling hairstyles worn mostly by black women 'unkempt' and 'matted' show a lack of 'cultural . sensitivity'. 'I think that it primarily targets black . women, and Iâ€™m not in agreement with it,' Patricia Jackson-Kelley from . the National Association of Black Military Women added to the AP. 'I donâ€™t . see how a woman wearing three braids in her hair, how that affects her . ability to perform her duty in the military.' Under review: The Congressional Black Caucus said they knew the guidelines were meant for uniformity, but that it was discriminatory not to consider what black women might need to maintain their natural hair . Assessment: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, pictured in Mexico last week, wrote back to the women to say he took the matter seriously and would be holding a review over the next three months . In a response letter, obtained by the Military Times, Hagel wrote: 'I want to assure you that, while none of . the Army's revised grooming and appearance policies were designed or . intended to discriminate or disparage against any service members, I . take your concerns very seriously.' Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby says Hagel will have the deputy secretary of defense 'work with the service secretaries and military chiefs to review their respective policies' over the next three months. Each service will review its policy 'as they pertain to African American . women to ensure standards are fair and respectful of our diverse force, . while also meeting our military services' requirements', he wrote. Hagel will then make whatever adjustments . to the policy are appropriate after the review.","New rules ban most twists, dreadlocks and large cornrows .

"By . Associated Press . Defense attorneys for a former Vanderbilt player charged with raping a woman in a campus dorm last June are accusing prosecutors of destroying or not preserving evidence. The allegations were contained in a motion filed Tuesday asking for the case against Brandon Vandenburg to be dismissed. It's the latest filing in the criminal case involving allegations of a gang rape on the Vanderbilt campus. Defense attorney for Brandon Vandenburg (pictured) charged with raping a woman in a campus dorm last June are accusing prosecutors of destroying or not preserving evidence . Earlier appearance: The alleged rape is believed to have taken place in Vandenburg's room, and the victim did not think he would have allowed anything bad to happen to her (Vandenburg seen here on October 16) The case has been fractious between prosecutors and defense lawyers, with both sides trading allegations of misconduct. The attorneys who represent Vandenburg on Tuesday accused prosecutors of ""subterfuge"" and said they intentionally concealed evidence from Vanderburg's defense. A spokeswoman for the Davidson County District Attorney's office said in an email to The Associated Press that prosecutors had not seen the filings. Vandenburg's defense team said in the paperwork filed in Nashville that some of the evidence that was missing was text messages from then-Vanderbilt coach James Franklin (pictured) and phone records and call logs from Franklin . Brandon Banks, 19, of Brandywine, Maryland . (left) and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie, 19, (right) of Woodville, . Mississippi are charged in the crime . Cory Batey, 19 of Nashville, Tennessee, is charged with rape . Vandenburg's defense team said in the paperwork filed in Nashville that some of the evidence that was missing was text messages from then-Vanderbilt coach James Franklin and phone records and call logs from Franklin. The attorneys say the alleged victim . told detectives that Franklin and a former Vanderbilt strength training . coach contacted her during her medical exam days after the alleged . assault, telling her ""they cared about her because she assisted them . with recruiting."" The paperwork doesn't elaborate. The . legal filing also says ""Coach Franklin called her in for a private . meeting and told her he wanted her to get 15 pretty girls together and . form a team to assist with the recruiting even though he knew it was . against the rules."" Franklin took over at Penn State in January. ""The allegations that I did something wrong are simply not true,"" he said in an emailed statement put out by his new school. ""I have cooperated fully with the authorities in this matter but, out . of respect for the legal process, I am not able to comment any further."" Vandenburg is one of four former Vanderbilt players accused of being involved in the gang rape. He . is charged with five counts of aggravated rape, two counts of sexual . battery, unlawful photography and tampering with evidence. Vandenburg and the other accused players have all pleaded not guilty to the charges. The . other football players who face two counts of aggravated sexual battery . are 19-year-olds Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie . The . paperwork filed by the Vandenburg's defense lawyers says they were . given surveillance video from 14 different cameras of the Vanderbilt . dorm parking lot, dorm hallways and surrounding areas. Crime scene: Police say the star player brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where he proceeded to rape her . But they say after reviewing the footage from the 14 cameras ""it became apparent that material video footage has been intentionally removed."" The lawyers allege that about 55 percent of the video footage has been removed. They also say a number of other items are missing, including social media, text messages from other witnesses and texts from the phone of the alleged victim. Prosecutors also have made serious allegations against the defense. They accused one of Vandenburg's attorneys of causing evidence to be destroyed and one prosecutor called the defense attorney an unindicted co-conspirator.

"By . Will Payne . The tragic deaths of a married couple hit by a freight train is now being treated as a murder-suicide with police telling MailOnline they believe the husband held his ill wife as the train sped towards them. Earl and Mary Myatt – who had recently suffered a brain aneurism – were killed after walking onto the tracks together in upstate New York on Sunday. It was initially thought it was a double suicide, but police now believe Mary Myatt’s condition meant she did not know what was going on and the whole event was planned by her husband. Died together: Earl and Mary Myatt, both 59, had been married for 42 years. Police said they are now investigating the deaths as murder-suicide as it is believed that Mary was too disabled to make a decision to end her life . Mr Myatt, 59, had been struggling to cope with the stress of looking after his disabled wife, 59, who had apparently been ‘functioning like a toddler’ since the aneurism in January. He left a suicide note in his car and called his heartbroken son, Brad, two minutes before the impact of the speeding train, telling him he loved him and he and he was sorry. Devastated school teacher Brad said: ‘He called me at 1:35, and at 1:37, they were dead.' Witnesses say they saw Mr Myatt driving up and down the road at the scene of the accident – in Verona, NY - up to 30 times before he parked his car and walked in front of the train with his wife. State Trooper Jack Keller, told MailOnline: ‘We are still trying to piece everything together from that day, but it appears Mr Myatt brought his ill wife to that area and that it was a pre-planned event. ‘He had left a suicide note in the vehicle and contacted his son on the phone basically saying I am sorry for what I am about to do. ‘We are not sure if his wife knew about this, that is something we are trying to work out with the doctors, because we don’t know what her mental capacity was at the time, but it appears to be a murder-suicide. ‘It seems he had this planned, he waited for the train, he held onto her and as the train comes, they both get struck and killed by the train. End scene: State police troopers said surveillance footage shows that Mr Myatt ignored a warning horn and looked to be purposefully waiting until the exact time that the train was approaching to get on the tracks . ‘It is still something we are trying to determine, but at this point it certainly appears that she may not have known that this was the plan that day and that he might have planned to do this for whatever reason. ‘I am trying to be as discreet and respectful to the family as possible, but at the same time, the facts apparently show that this was more-or-less his plan. This is based on security footage and witnesses. ‘We interviewed the conductor and it seems that everything he told us was factual and true. The family have been notified of our findings, they are handling a tragedy of losing both parents.’ He added: ‘It appears from witnesses who live near the tracks that they had been driving around the area for some time, and it appeared to them that they had been waiting for the train to arrive. ‘At this point, there is obviously no one to prosecute, so the case would be closed and the family would be notified. I think that may happen this week. We try to wrap things up as quickly as possible for the family’s sake’. Mr Keller said that it is not clear why Mr Myatt chose that particular point in the train's path, as Verona is about six miles away from their hometown of Oneida. But it is clear that the stress of his wife’s deteriorating health was weighing down heavily on his shoulders since she was diagnosed with the brain aneurysm in late January. She spent a month in intensive care and underwent several surgeries, the most recent only two weeks ago. Her two sons, Brad and Brain, and husband visited her constantly but struggled to see her in pain as her motor functions and abilities were reduced to that of a toddler. Brad explained to Syracuse.com that his mother wasn't the person she had been before the aneurysm, saying she would start a conversation and get lost, that she didn't always understand what was happening around her and she struggled to use the bathroom on her own. Even in her final moments, when Mr Myatt put his wife on the phone with Brad, he said 'I'll see you soon' and he was unable to understand her response, which he said was common after the diagnosis. Close: Brad Myatt (right) said that his father (left) had been stressed in the wake of Mary's brain aneurism and ensuing operations . Then Mr Myatt got on the phone. ‘He just said he loved me and he was sorry,’ Brad said. Brad knew something was wrong and begged his father to tell him where he was, but he hung up. He also told the Syracuse.com that his father had become depressed as a result of his wife’s condition. 'He was saddened by what she had been reduced to... He missed his wife…. she was his world’, Brad, 30, added. 'We’re devastated... but I want everyone to know that my father was a good man, and my mother was an angel who would do anything for anybody.' The couple – who had four grandchildren - met when they were 17-years-old and had been married for 42 years at the time of their death. Mr Myatt rearranged his work schedule at the Mohawk Valley Community College bookstore so that he started at 3.30am and was able to finish earlier in the afternoon in order to spend more time with his ailing wife. Mrs Myatt was apparently the perfect grandmother, loving nothing more than having tea parties or playing in the snow with her beloved grandchildren. Brad told Syracuse.com, ‘It was never about her.’ 'We were spoiled in receiving two fantastic parents.’","Earl and Mary Myatt, both 59, had been married for 42 years before their deaths on Sunday .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Too raunchy? J.D. Wintergreen made his campaign video a parody of an erectile dysfunction ad and played off John Boehner's last name . A Republican congressional candidate's innuendo-filled ad has gotten him fired from his job as an adjunct professor at a Christian college. J.D. Winteregg is running to unseat House majority leader John Boehner in the upcoming midterm elections, and he made his minute-long ad a play on the Republican leader's name. Styled as an ad for a prescription for 'electile dysfunction', the video features smiling couples doing inane activities together with a voiceover warning about possible side effects. 'If you have a Boehner lasting longer than 23 years, seek immediate medical attention,' the ad says. 'Other . signs of electile dysfunction may include extreme skin discoloration, . the inability to punch one's self out of a wet paper bag, or maintain a . spine in the face of liberal opposition.' By contrast, Mr Winteregg sells himself as a solution to the problems facing Boehner's constituents. 'Used on a daily basis, Winteregg in Congress will help you every time the moment is right,' the voiceover says. 'When . using Winteregg, it's important to know the borders will be secure, . second amendment rights protected, Obamacare and planned parenthood will . be defunded, and common sense will be used in solving the nation's . problems.' Joke: The ad plays off the stereotypical ads which feature loving couples doing inane activities while a voiceover warns of the side effects of 'having a Boehner that lasts longer than 23 years' While the video, titled 'When The Moment Is Right', has fans online- with more than 1,300 likes on YouTube- not all Ohioans have found it to be funny. Mr Wintergg has worked as an adjunct French professor at Cedarville University for three years and his contract was not renewed as a result of the ad. The university spokesman specifically told Fox News that the video ran in conflict to the Baptist school's values, but did not confirm why Mr Winteregg's contract was not renewed. '(At Cedarville) we don't get into politics... We are all about Christ-centered education,' spokesman Mark Weinstein told Fox. Out: Winteregg had been working as an adjunct French professor at Cedarville University (pictured) for three years but shortly after the video was released, his contract was not renued . Mr Winteregg said that he knew some people would be offended by the ad but purposefully thought about whether deeply religious viewers would take issue with the more risquÃ© implications, deciding in the end that it was acceptable. 'We actually worked really hard to put something out that I could be comfortable with as a faithful person,' Mr Winteregg said to Fox. 'I knew it might upset some people, but we did the best we could to keep it as a parody.'","J.D.

"By . Joshua Gardner . and Associated Press . Reigning Heisman trophy winner Jameis Winston received a criminal citation Tuesday for allegedly shoplifting $32.72 worth of crab legs from a Tallahassee grocery store. The Florida State quarterback was subsequently suspended from the school's baseball team, on which he plays pitcher when not on the gridiron, must serve 20 hours community service as part of his punishment. The 20-year-old Alabama native has also released an apology. 'I went to the supermarket with the intent to purchase dinner but made a terrible mistake for which I'm taking full responsibility,' Winston said in a statement Wednesday after news of his misdeed--and punishment--had quickly spread. Hungry? Quarterback Jameis Winston #5 of the Florida State Seminoles pictured here after the 2014 Rose Bowl victory over Auburn, is likely not currently celebrating after news broke Wednesday of a criminal citation he received Tuesday for allegedly shoplifting crab legs from a Florida grocery store . 'In a . moment of youthful ignorance, I walked out of the store without paying . for one of my items,' continued the youngest ever Heisman winner. 'I . realize that I am in the public spotlight and my conduct needs to be . above reproach.' Winston has had . previous brushes with the law, including a 2013 investigation over an . alleged rape for which he was never charged. 'Over the last year I've learned that my accomplishments on the fields can be a wonderful thing for my school, teammates, friends, and family,' the athlete's statement said. 'At the same time, I must realize that my mistakes are magnified and can bring great embarrassment to all those who support me every day.' Winston was not arrested. Unless he fails to show up to community service, his record will remain clean. 'He got an adult civil citation,' a police source told Tomahawk Nation of the arrest alternative usually reserved for juveniles. 'If he completes the sanctions it will never show up on his record,' said the source. 'They are now doing it for minor misdemeanors for adults to lower crime rate.' The source also revealed the quarterback will be fined $30. Coaches for both the baseball and football teams officially released statements concerning Winston on Wednesday afternoon. No arrests: The current Heisman trophy holder also has an impressive record pitching for his school's baseball team, but he has a history of near misses with the law outside the alleged seafood incident . The incident allegedly occurred at a Publix, a staple in Florida grocery stores . 'As a result of his citation last night, we are suspending Jameis Winston from the baseball team,' baseball . coach Mike Martin said in a statement. 'I am confident he will complete . his community service obligation and the situation will be resolved . soon.' Football . coach Jimbo Fisher said: 'I fully support Coach Martinâ€™s decision and . will also make sure that Jameis meets all obligations, which I know he . will.' According . to the SB Nation report, Winston was once investigated by police after a . Burger King employee accused him of stealing soda using a ketchup cup. He also faced police questioning for an alleged involvement in a long-running BB gun battle, SB Nation reports. News of Winston's misdeeds come just weeks after the NCAA changed its rules to allow colleges to feed their athletes as much free food as they want. There was previously a cap placed at three free meals per day. The announced rule change came days after Connecticut basketball guard Shabazz Napier's announcement during the Final Four in which he complained of players 'starving.' Hungry: UConn guard Shabazz Napier complained early in April that he often goes to bed hungry because he can't afford food. Days later, the NCAA announced a lifting of restrictions on free food provided to college athletes . It was unclear if Winston was able to take advantage of the rule at the time of his encounter with authorities. 'He . was very cooperative,' Leon County Director of Law Enforcement Michael . Wood said at a news conference Wednesday. 'He seemed fairly honest in . that he did not pay for the item.' Winston is the nation's top-rated passer . and has led the top-ranked Seminoles (13-0) to a spot in the BCS . championship game against No. 2 Auburn on Jan. 6, his birthday. The . former five-star recruit from Bessemer, Alabama, made college football . look easy from his very first game. On Labor Day night, on national television, Winston went 25 for 27 for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a victory at Pittsburgh. 'I . can't explain how truly intelligent he is,' Florida State coach Jimbo . Fisher said. 'He always wanted to know why he had success or why he had . failure so he could either repeat it or fix it.' There . wasn't much failure on the way to becoming the third Seminoles . quarterback to win the Heisman. The last was Chris Weinke in 2000. Winston and . Florida State were cruising toward an undefeated season when news broke . of an unresolved sexual assault complaint against him made to the . Tallahassee Police Department last December. The . dormant case was handed over to the state attorney's office for a full . investigation. A female student at Florida State accused Winston of . rape. Winston's attorney said the sex was consensual. During . three weeks of uncertainty, Winston continued to play sensationally, . while other contenders stumbled or failed to distinguish themselves. Documents released by the police with the accuser's allegations were not flattering to him. The . since-dropped case probably explains why so many voters left him out of . their top three. Last year, Manziel appeared on 92 percent of the . ballots. Winston appeared on 87 percent this year. 'Everyone has their own opinion,' Winston said. 'It's basically a numbers game and I was blessed to have the majority vote.'","The 20-year-old will reportedly serve community service, be suspended from his side gig on the baseball team and faces a $30 fine .

"By . Dan Bloom . Mystery: Marvin Clark was believed to be 75 when he vanished in 1926 near Portland, Oregon . Experts could soon solve the mystery of a 75-year-old man who vanished on a trip to see his daughter in 1926 - making him America's second-oldest missing person case. Marvin A Clark's fate was unknown until loggers stumbled upon a skeleton with a single shot to the skull next to a rusty revolver in the woods, 60 years after his death. Experts now believe the skeleton belonged to Mr Clark, who vanished near Portland, Oregon, and have found three direct descendants with a DNA match. But because the remains were so disintegrated, they need one final piece in the puzzle - another relative of Mr Clark's mother. Incredibly Mr Clark is still listed as an active case on the National Missing Persons Database. That makes his entry - describing him as more than 150 years old, 5ft 8in and walking with a cane - the second-oldest in the country. The only older case is that of Elijah Cravens, an Oklahoma farmer who set off to a meeting on horseback in 1902 but never arrived. Unlike the case of Mr Cravens, however, Mr Clark's disappearance was well-documented at the time. He left the home he shared with his wife to visit his daughter Sidney McDougall, 10 miles away, but did not arrive. His panicked daughter offered a $100 reward ($1,400 in today's money) and ran an appeal in the local newspaper, where he was described as well-known and well-liked. The newspaper . said he had been traced to a terminal in downtown Portland and police across the Pacific Northwest were put on the lookout for him. But despite a wealth of information on Mr Clark, who had partial paralysis on the . right side, a 'halting gait' and couldn't use his right arm, no trace of him was found. Cold case: A photograph of Marvin Clark and an unidentified woman, possibly his wife. His is the second-oldest missing person case in the U.S., beaten only by an Oklahoma farmer who vanished on horseback in 1902 . Appeal: A $100 reward was offered for information on Mr Clark's whereabouts. It is believed he may have taken his own life. Pictured are stories that ran in The Oregonian on November 3, 1926 (left) and November 11, 1926 . That was until May 10, 1986. Loggers . were clearing an isolated section of Portland when they discovered the remains of a . mystery man who had been dead for at least half a century. Near . the skeleton, investigators found an 1888 nickel, a 1919 penny, a . pocket watch, leather shoes, wire-rimmed glasses, a Fraternal Order of . Eagles pocket knife and four tokens with the inscription D&P. A . historian told The Oregonian in 1986 that those where likely tavern . tokens, which were awarded in card games and could be used to buy food . or alcohol. Police also . found a corroded revolver, and an expended .32-caliber bullet. A single . shot had entered the skull at the temple. Medical examiners, who . said it was the oldest case they ever had, ruled the unknown man's . death a suicide and most people assumed the man's identity would not be found. Do you recognise this? A photo which it is believed shows the home of Marvin Clark in Tigard, Oregon . But a few days later, a woman called Dorothy Willoughby came forward and said it might be her grandfather, Mr Clark. She said he had once been the town marshal for Linnton, a small area near the secluded ravine where the body was found. Her hunch, however, was not enough to solve the disappearance and she died in 1991. The case receded again for two decades until Dr Nici Vance, from the Oregon state medical examiner's office, found the file on the suicide and began investigating. Using technology not available before, experts re-examined the remains and created a more detailed DNA profile. With the help of volunteers, it was matched to three of Mr Clark's great-great-grandchildren, all from the paternal line. The match was a weak one, however, partly because of the age and disintegration of the remains. That means another descendant of his mother is needed to fully confirm the skeleton's identity. The mystery deepens: Claims that remains found in the woods near Portland could have been those of Mr Clark were revealed in local newspaper The Oregonian on May 26, 1986. The skull was found with a bullet hole . Ms Vance said: 'There's an association there, but it's not strong at this point. 'They're looking for a maternal link, someone on his mother's side, and following that lineage to shore it up and make the statistics a little better. 'There might have been an item of jewelry . that was found with that person that could trigger a memory of a family . member.' 'We've got somebody that we're looking at right now, so hopefully pretty soon we will be able to determine if the remains that were found were actually Marvin's' - Janet Franson, National Missing Persons Database . Janet Franson, a retired homicide detective who works for the missing persons database, revealed one maternal relative has already come forward as a result of this week's media coverage. 'We've got somebody that we're looking at right now,' she told MailOnline. 'So hopefully pretty soon we will be able to determine if the remains that were found were actually Marvin's.' The missing people database is funded by the National Institute of Justice and consists of nearly 10,000 cases. Among the other oldest cases are two-year-old Mary Moroney, who disappeared in 1930 in Chicago, and 22-year-old hiker Joseph Halpern, who vanished in the Rocky Mountain National Park in 1933. There is one major stumbling block in the case of Mr Clark, however. Reports on the skeleton from 1986 put the age of the deceased at between 35 and 55 - even though Mr Clark was 75 when he died. That means even if more relatives are found, Mr Clark's fate could remain a mystery for many more years to come.","Marvin A Clark was 75 when he disappeared on a trip to Portland, Oregon .

"By . Associated Press . The Plaza hotel can't boot a bicycle-sharing station out of a space across the street from its entrance, a judge ruled Tuesday, rejecting the luxury landmark's claim that the electric-blue bikes are a traffic-clogging eyesore. Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Cynthia Kern said city transportation officials did an adequate review before installing a Citi Bike rack on Fifth Avenue's landmarked Grand Army Plaza, where the famous Pulitzer Fountain splashes a stone's throw from the hotel made famous in fictional settings ranging from the 'Eloise' books to Neil Simon's play 'Plaza Suite' to 'Home Alone 2: Lost In New York.' 'It does not significantly affect the scale, visual prominence or visual context of these landmarks,' Kern wrote, noting that the bike rack isn't as tall as many cars on the street and that there are bus stations, kiosks and other street structures nearby. Going nowhere: A Citi Bike rack in front of New York's Plaza Hotel will be staying right where it is. A judge on Monday tossed out a lawsuit calling for the removal of the station . Legal action: New York City's iconic Plaza Hotel overlooking Central Park attempted to sue the city and Citibank over the 'eyesore' blue bike racks near its entrance . Before it all began: The hotel claims that the bikes takes up a lane of traffic which used to be used by limousines and taxis and has created congestion and litter . Officials were 'very pleased with this decision, which keeps in place one of the most popular bike share stations in the city,' city lawyer Nicholas Ciappetta said in a statement. Plaza lawyer Steven Sladkus said he was reviewing the decision. Launched in May 2013, the short-hop bike rental program has become a part of the streetscape in parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn, to the delight of some and the lament of others. The Plaza said the 147-foot-long Citi Bike station is an advertising-laden intrusion on Grand Army Plaza, where, according to literati lore, Zelda Fitzgerald once took a Jazz Age dip in the fountain. 'We have, here, two landmarks. ... This is not right for that place,' another Plaza lawyer, Stephen Orel, said at a hearing last week. The hotel also argued that the bike rack, which is in a former traffic lane, was causing limousine backups in front of the hotel and condominium during big events. Unnecessary? The 147-foot long bike rack outside the Plaza Hotel is one of the most popular in the city . In the way? The rack is not directly in front of the hotel, but rather at the edge of Grand Army Plaza across the street. The rack measures almost 150 feet . The city said its review was proper, there was plenty of room left for traffic and the location was more than appropriate for a Citi Bike rack. ""This is not only a good location; it's an ideal location. ... It's centrally located, with numerous attractions nearby,"" Ciappetta said at last week's hearing. Central Park is across the street, and the Museum of Modern Art and the swank shops of Fifth Avenue are just blocks away. Citi Bike riders took an average of more than 36,000 trips a day during the summer and fall through the 6,000-bicycle, 330-station system. More than 99,000 people have bought annual passes. But City Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said last month that the program has faced 'significant financial and operational issues,' including failed credit card transactions and problems getting bikes to where riders are. Portland, Oregon-based Alta Bike Share, which runs Citi Bike through a subsidiary, calls the program a success. Congestion: The bike racks occupy what used to be a lane of traffic for waiting limos and taxis .","Judge tossed out a lawsuit calling for the removal of the station .

"By . Ashley Collman . Pregnant Chelsea Clinton beamed Tuesday night as she was honored for her charity work in New York City. The 34-year-old daughter of former President Bill Clinton and presidential contender Hillary Clinton rubbed shoulders with fellow political royalty at the Riverkeeper Fisherman's Ball at Chelsea Piers. The expectant mother posed on the red carpet with Robert F Kennedy Jr., son of the late Bobby Kennedy, and one of the events co-chairs. Chelsea was honored at the event for her work promoting clean and safe drinking water around the world, especially in the wake of Superstorm Sandy in New York. The beginnings of a bump? Chelsea Clinton attended a charity event in New York City Tuesday night nearly two weeks after she announced her pregnancy . Political dynasties: Chelsea was honored for her charity work at the event, which was co-chaired by Robert F Kennedy Jr . 'A #CleanRiver as important as ever for #NYC â€“ thanks to @riverkeeper for all the work you do & for the #BigFish recognition for @ClintonFdn!' Chelsea tweeted about the honor. America is on baby watch after the former first daughter announced she was pregnant earlier this month at an event at the Lower Eastside Girls Club. She told the assembled guests: 'Marc and I are very excited that we have our first child arriving later this year.' There was a cheer from the audience as she revealed the news, before she continued: 'I certainly feel all the better whether itâ€™s a girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many strong, young female leaders. . . Big news: Chelsea announced her pregnancy two weeks ago at an event at the Lower Eastside Girls Club with her mom . 'I just hope that I will be as good a mom to my child and hopefully children as my mom was to me.' Chelsea is likely to be around 13 or 14 weeks along; most women wait until the start of the second trimester to announce their pregnancy because the chance of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Hillary Clinton followed the announcement with an excited Twitter post. She wrote: 'My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be! @billclinton and I are thrilled that Chelsea and Marc are expecting their first child!' Husband Bill echoed her words with a tweet of his own, reading: 'Excited to add a new line to my Twitter bio...grandfather-to-be! @hillaryclinton and I are so happy for Chelsea and Marc!'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A professional skier and parachuting enthusiast was killed in a freak skydiving accident in California earlier this week. Timy Dutton - known in the skiing world as 'Timy Backflip' - and several friends attempted an advanced jump at the Parachute Center in Acampo using wing suits when something went horribly wrong. The high performance suits allow those wearing them to fall at speeds faster than 100 miles per hour. Shortly after jumping from the plane, witnesses say 27-year-old Dutton collided with one of the other jumpers. Dangerous: Pro skier Timy Dutton (center) was killed in a skydiving accident on Tuesday . Safety: The Parachute Center in Acampo faces nearly $1 million in fines for not meeting safety requirements in 2010 and 2011 . Wing suit: Dutton was doing an advanced jump with a wing suit similar to the one in this stock photo . 'The fellow [Dutton] ran into him, hit his head into his foot, evidently . knocked him out, because there was no parachute deployment whatsoever,' Parachute Center owner Bill . Dause told Fox40.com. Dutton, the station reports, did not have an automatic parachute. In addition to being a professional skier, Dutton became a fairly advanced skydiver. Big air: Dutton's acrobatic free skiing earned him a spot on the Freeride World Tour starting in 2010 . According to the United States Parachute Association, in order to use a wing suit a jumper must have completed at least 200 jumps. According to Dause, both Dutton and his friends had completed at least 400 to 500 jumps. Dutton is far from the first person to die in a skydiving accident at the Parachute Center - the owner tells the station that there have been 8 to 10 deaths at the drop zone since 1981. The Parachute Center also is where an 80-year-old woman came close to death when her harness connecting her to her parachute came loose in mid-air. Timy Backflip: Dutton was a professional skier known as 'Timy Backflip' for his acrobatic jumps . Close call: In 2012, an 80-year-old woman slipped out of her harness in mid-air during a jump at the Parachute Center . Luckily, instructors were able to save the woman before she hit the ground. The Parachute Center currently is facing fines for not passing Federal Aviation Administration safety inspections in both 2010 and 2011. Dutton's friend suffered a broken leg and is expected to make a full recovery.","Timy 'Timy Backflip' Dutton was known in the skiing world for his acrobatic maneuvers on the slopes .

"By . Louise Boyle . A suspect in two violent rapes in Boston a decade ago has been freed because DNA testing could not differentiate him from his identical twin brother. Dwayne McNair, 33, was freed by a judge on Tuesday after spending two years behind bars awaiting trial for the rapes of two women, aged 19 and 23. Prosecutors said they plan to conduct additional DNA testing using a $120,000 new test developed by a German company that can distinguish between identical twins and could separate Dwayne from his identical twin Dwight. Rape suspect Dwayne McNair was released in Boston on Tuesday after DNA tests failed to distinguish him from that of his identical twin brother . The 33-year-old McNair's lawyer said that his client realizes he's not in the clear yet. The complex DNA testing could take months to complete. Another man, Anwar Thomas, has already pleaded guilty to the rapes and implicated McNair as a co-conspirator in 2012. Prosecutors said two women, aged 19 and 23, were abducted at gunpoint off city streets within nine days of each other in 2004, pistol-whipped and raped. The 23-year-old was grabbed from the Forest Hills neighborhood of Boston on September 21, 2004. She was forced into a car and repeatedly raped in a garage before being dumped in Franklin Park. Days later, a 19-year-old woman was walking home in Mission Hill when she was kidnapped by two men at gunpoint, dragged into a car and pistol-whipped. She was repeatedly raped in Franklin Park. The courageous victim managed to save a condom used by her attacker which later became DNA evidence. According to court documents, a long-running police investigation finally identified McNair as a suspect in 2007. However although he fitted the DNA profile, detectives were unable to arrest him because his twin brother had exactly the same profile when their semen samples were tested. McNair was indicted in 2012 â€¨after Thomas said McNair was involved, according to the Boston Herald. McNairâ€™s had been jailed on $3.3 million bail since that time. Thomas is due to be sentenced next month and will get a maximum of 16 years if he cooperates with authorities. Suspect Dwayne McNair is accused of raping and dumping two young women in Franklin Park, Boston in 2004, along with Anwar Thomas. He went free on Tuesday because DNA tests could not separate him from his twin brother .","Dwayne McNair, 33, was freed on Tuesday after spending two years behind bars awaiting trial for the rapes of two women, aged 19 and 23 .

"By . Tara Brady . A young woman from Romania who had a death fetish and managed to con a doctor into believing she was a medical student so she could do an autopsy on a dead body has ended up with a cult following of her own.

The incident  resulted in her being sued by the family of the man whose corpse they accused her of defiling. But while the incident would sicken most, Mihaela developed a cult following, with a legion of men willing to pay to chat with her online.

"By . Associated Press . The U.S has offered a $5million bounty for the capture of a Chinese fugitive accused of supplying Iran's weapons program with ballistic missile parts. Li Fangwei, who is also known as Karl . Lee, and two of his companies LIMMT Economic and Trade Company have been on U.S. sanctions lists since 2006 and 2009 respectively. Now the fugitive faces further sanctions as well as charges of money laundering, wire fraud and other crimes as . part of an indictment issued by the New York City Justice Department. Wanted: The U.S has offered a $5million bounty for information regarding Li Fangwei, pictured. He is accused of supplying Iran with missile parts - exchanging millions of dollars with the country . Nearly $7million has also been seized from by companies he allegedly set up as a front to evade sanctions previously imposed on him, prosecutors say. He is thought to have done $8.5million in business in more . than 165 separate transactions through the 'shell' companies. Prosecutors add Li, who is said to control a network of companies in China which have done . millions of dollars in business with Iran, has supplied the . country with ballistic missile parts for many years. Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for Manhattan said: 'Previously having been exposed as a . violator of those sanctions, Li spun a web of front companies to carry . out prohibited transactions essentially in disguise. 'He now stands . charged with serious crimes, and millions of his dollars have been . seized.' John Carlin, assistant attorney general . for national security, said in a statement released: 'These . actions send a loud and clear warning to those involved in the illegal . proliferation of sensitive materials to Iran that the United States will . not spare any efforts to disrupt their actions and bring them to . justice.' U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, pictured, accused the fugitive of spinning 'a web of front companies to carry out prohibited transactions' in a statement released today .

Though . money was moved through U.S.-based financial institutions, no bank is . accused of any wrongdoing, the Justice Department said. The renewed effort to prosecute Mr Li comes as discussions regarding Iran's nuclear program are reach a critical phase.

"Resplendent in beautifully embroidered dove-grey silk and a striking Phillip Treacey fascinator, the Duchess of Cornwall was every inch the royal bride when she married Prince Charles in 2005. Now the Duchess' stunning Anna Valentine gown is to be the centrepiece of an exhibition opening on Saturday at the V&A. And the Duchess of Cornwall isn't the only aristocratic bride to dust off her nuptial frock for the show. Also included is the flesh-flashing Pam Hogg frock worn by Lady Mary Charteris to her 2012 marriage to Big Pink frontman, Robbie Furze, and a truly spectacular white silk-satin gown with an 18ft train sported by Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, on her big day in 1933. Elegant: The Duchess of Cornwall's dove-grey silk Anna Valentine gown was worn to her 2005 wedding to Prince Charles and is one of the highlights of the exhibition . Supermodel style: The John Galliano dress worn by Kate Moss when she married Jamie Hince in 2011 . Spectacular: The beautiful John Galliano designed dress worn by Gwen Stefani at her 2004 wedding to Gavin Rossdale. His suit, also on show, is Hedi Slimane for Dior . Also on show is Kate Moss' John Galliano dress worn when she married Jamie Hince and a Lanvin dress Sarah Jessica Parker wore in an episode of Sex and the City. Other highlights include the dip-dyed pink and ivory John Galliano-designed dress worn by Gwen Stefani to her 2004 wedding to Gavin Rossdale and the unusual purple silk frock in which Dita von Teese married shock-rocker Marylin Manson. The gowns will join dresses dating from the 18th and 19th centuries for an exhibition entitled Wedding Dresses 1775 - 2014, which opens on the 3rd May and runs until 15th March next year. This Lanvin short wedding dress was worn by Sarah Jessica Parker playing Carrie Bradshaw in an episode of Sex and the City, left, while this purple gown by Vivienne Westwood was worn by Dita Von Teese . Intricate: The back of these dresses reveal the delicate stitching and elaborate embellishment that goes into many wedding dresses . Among the most striking is a ravishing silk brocade gown worn by a wealthy . woman named Jane Bailey to her 1780 marriage to James Wickham. Equally . impressive is the lavishly frilled, embroidered and furbelowed dress . sported by New York heiress Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers at her wedding . to Bradford Ferris Duff in 1890. But it's not all pretty dresses with stellar pedigrees. As curator Edwina Ehrman explains, the collection also gives an insight into the changing tastes of British brides over the last 300 years. 'In the 18th century, the most prestigious fabrics for a bride were those woven with expensive gold and silver metal threads,' explains Ehrman. 'This was the choice of most royal brides until Queen Victoria married in white satin in 1840. Ian Stewart specialises in 'flower bomb' dresses like this one . Ethereal: Pale grey slashed chiffon wedding dress designed by Gareth Pugh and veil by Stephen Jones, worn by Katie Shillingford for her marriage to Alex Dromgoole, left, and Norman Hartnell dress with 3.6. metre train worn by Margaret Wigham in 1933 (which she can be seen in below) Ravishing: The embroidered silk satin wedding dress was worn by Margaret Whigham for her marriage to Charles Sweeny . A Victoria corset that would have been worn under a bride's dress, left, and a wedding veil with gold detailling . Pretty: Maud Cecil and Greville Steel leaving church after their 1927 wedding (left) and bride Sara Donaldson-Hudson in a Bellville Sassoon coat at her 1970 wedding. Both dresses are in the exhibition . Unusual: . The daring satin and layered tulle wedding gown worn by Lady Mary . Charteris for her wedding to Big Pink frontman, Robbie Furze . 'However wearing white was also a status symbol.  In the past white garments were very difficult to keep clean and white was associated with wealth and leisure.' Although white and similarly pale shades such as ivory and cream remain popular, as the Duchess of Cornwall's dress makes plain, other hues are becoming increasingly fashionable. Some brides, among them Dita von Teese, choose to dispense with lighter hues altogether, while others such as Gwen Stefani and Jessica Biel opt for subtly coloured gowns. 'We’ve got some excellent examples of . coloured wedding dresses in the exhibition,' adds Erhman. 'Among them are a purple dress . made by a lady’s maid in 1899, a floor-length dress made from colourful . upholstery fabric during World War II and Dita von Teese’s incredible . purple taffeta gown designed by Vivienne Westwood for her marriage to . Marylin Manson in 2005.' But while the coloured dresses are gorgeous, what really catches the eye is the social commentary offered by the rest of the collection; reflecting, as they do, the social upheaval and changing tastes that characterised the 20th century. 'The 20th century witnessed rapid social . change and increasing economic, political and sexual freedom for women,' explains Erhman. 'While most women still wanted a degree of formality in their wedding . dress, the traditional codes of dress gradually lost their power. Beautiful: The corded silk dress worn by Cara Leland Huttleston Rogersin 1890 and the silk brocade gown worn by Jane Bailey for her wedding in 1780 . Delicate: . Silk and leather 'tango' shoes bought from Peter Robinson Ltd. of . London, 1914 and worn by Phyllis Blaiberg for her marriage to Bertie . Mayer Stone . 'In the . 1960s some women celebrated the new freedoms by marrying in . mini-dresses and trouser suits and in the 1990s, the plunging, backless, . strapless wedding dress became accepted even for church weddings. 'The . etiquette of wedding dress for men also relaxed with more men choosing . to wear lounge suits and some buying wedding outfits from shops which . targeted a young and fashion-conscious market.' Modern . dresses included in the exhibition show just how much leeway . contemporary brides have, with everything from dip dye to cutaway . bodices on display. 'I do love the drama of John Galliano’s . 2002 pink and white dress for Gwen Stefani,' adds Erhman. 'It’s incredibly romantic and . slightly shocking: the dress has been designed to make it appear as if . the groom has already tried to start undressing the bride leaving her . dress in disarray. 'It’s also a glorious colour. The hem of the dress . and veil are drenched in pink which gradually fades away into white. I . also love the subtle, sensual elegance of the Ian and Marcel’s pleated . dress and coat, made for an unknown bride in 1989, which the designers . paired with veil decorated with roses drawn in silicone rubber.' From . frilled and furbelowed to silicone and rubber, the dresses on display . at the V&A might not be your average bridal gowns, but they are . certainly fascinating ones.

Whatever she wears turns to gold, and even a week after returning from the royal tour of New Zealand and Australia, the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe choices are still sending shoppers into a frenzy. Website eBay has seen a 95 per cent rise in sales of yellow dresses - a summery hue Kate championed twice during the 19-day trip. Arriving in sunny Sydney wearing a striking, canary-yellow pencil dress by Roksanda Ilincic, Kate looked every inch the immaculate fashionista - and nothing like a banana, whatever the Duke of Cambridge might have thought. The Kate effect strikes again: Kate arrived in Sydney wearing a canary yellow pencil dress, left, and wore a pastel number for Easter Sunday, right, which has sent yellow dress sales soaring by 95 per cent . Four days later, Kate was pictured in a pastel number she designed herself for Easter Sunday at Taronga Zoo with William and George, causing the total sales of yellow dresses on the UK site to almost double. Kate is not alone in her fondness for the citrus shade - Susanna Reid was pictured in a lemon yellow frock for Good Morning Britain, while Hollywood sweetheart Emma Stone wore a vivid full-length yellow gown to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 premiere in London last week.

Manchester City are expected to have financial restrictions imposed on their squad for next season’s Champions League after breaching UEFA’s spending rules. The punishment for breaking the financial fair play rules — introduced so that clubs do not spend more than they earn  — would see City effectively given a  limit on the salary bill of their European squad. That could mean they might not be able to afford to put all their players in their European squad. City are also expected to be ordered to make a cut in the number of players permitted in their squad, which is normally 25 strong, and to be handed large fines when UEFA’s club financial control board meet today and tomorrow.

"By . Associated Press . Perhaps the title overstates the case. The tycoons of the ABC reality series Shark Tank wouldn't feed on your leg. They're not even out to eat the lunch of budding entrepreneurs who come before them in the Shark Tank (actually a stage at Los Angeles' Sony Studios, where the Sharks convene two or three times a year for mammoth taping sessions). They're just after a healthy serving of any future feast. So each Shark must decide whether to invest his or her own cash and expertise in a given opportunity, whether it's a kiddie train ride at the mall, boneless baby-back ribs, or a pot of boiling water that can charge a cellphone. Maybe they try to outbid one another. Often they argue over whether the deal is a winner or a bust. The show, now in its fifth season, airs Fridays at 9 p.m. EDT. This week at 8 p.m., a companion special, Shark Tank: Swimming With Sharks, gathers updates on more than a dozen of the show's more memorable entrepreneurs â€” and the Sharks who bit. The cast: ABC's Shark Tank is comprised of a panel of entrepreneurs who hear pitches from inventors that seek their investment . Recently five of the Sharks (technology specialist Robert Herjavec couldn't make it) joined a reporter for a bite at a Manhattan restaurant, and they said a mouthful. Here's a boiled-down version: . 'Queen of QVC' and inventor Lori Greiner: 'Why did I agree to be on the show? Because they asked!' Fashion and branding expert Daymond John: 'I did it because I wanted to diversify my portfolio, but I was only getting pitched clothing companies. People thought since I was the FUBU (urban streetwear) guy I'd come to a meeting with gold teeth and baggy jeans and start break dancing.' Venture capitalist Kevin O'Leary: 'Because each Shark has made it on his own from different sectors of the economy, we bring different disciplines to the table. Any one of my fellow Sharks might see something in a deal that I don't. To be competitive, I try to see it through their eyes.' Mark Cuban, owner of AXS TV and the Dallas Mavericks: 'On the show, we all have our little branding angles. I try to be the guy who gives the advice. Lori tries to be the one who encourages. Daymond is the homey. Kevin is right to the point; it's all about money. And Barbara is going to be brutally honest.' Real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran: 'The best advice was from (executive producer) Mark Burnett: ""What makes great TV is just to be yourself."" How freeing was that! So my first concern is always: ""Am I gonna lose money?"" Second concern: ""Can I MAKE money?"" A distant third: ""Is this good TV?"" And no one's in our ear saying, ""Do this, say that."" Doesn't happen.' Cuban: 'It's OUR money! The producers can't tell us what to do!' John: 'I'm always amazed at how they take 15 cameras and an hour-long pitch and turn it into six to eight minutes, and yet it plays out exactly like the pitch happened.' Cuban: 'The hard part on 'Shark Tank' is finding a clever way to say no.' Corcoran: 'A way you haven't used a hundred times before!' Cuban: 'One pitch, I was thinking, ""There's no way I'm interested. Now I've got to come up with a clever way to go out."" And then the guy called me Cubes. He goes, ""Hey, Cubes!"" And that was all I needed: ""Cubes?! I'm out!""' All ears: The entrepreneurs say that they are foremost on the show as a means to make smart investments and help inventors, while also helping themselves make more cash . O'Leary: 'After you go in on a deal on Shark Tank, a due-diligence period begins.' Cuban: 'They'll come on and say, ""My widget costs 50cents to make."" Then you do your due diligence and find it costs $4 to make UNLESS you get to a billion units â€” THEN it gets down to 50 cents!' Corcoran: 'Out of 26 businesses, I have four that are clear winners, two that have paid me back, two that WILL pay me back. The rest? Come to my office: I have every entrepreneur in frames on my wall. The minute I realize I'm not gonna ever make money on THAT one, I flip him over to remind me not to spend more time on it. (Laughing.) It's dead to me!' Cuban: 'The real work isn't shooting the show. It's managing and dealing with the companies afterward.' Greiner: 'Eighty percent of my deals are doing well. My biggest problem is the ones who don't listen when you advise them to do something.' O'Leary: 'The first season, everything we saw was absolute crap. Then in season three, real deals started to show up. That was the first time I thought, ""My goodness, this really IS a platform to launch products and services!""' Cuban: 'There's no better platform anywhere. If I had a choice between putting something on six minutes of Shark Tank (averaging 7.3 million viewers this season, plus CNBC's reruns on Sunday nights) or on the home page of Amazon, I'm taking 'Shark Tank' every time.' Corcoran: 'No contest.' Greiner: 'Of course, being recognized from the show can be a problem. Before, if I just wanted to run to the grocery store, I'd be in my nightgown and throw on a coat, no makeup, and go. That doesn't work anymore.' John: 'People pitch me on the street. But I tell them I'm either Ashy Larry from Chappelle's Show or Cee Lo (Green).' Cuban: 'The show has actually reduced pitches I get from people. Now I say, ""If you want to be on Shark Tank, you can't tell me now. Go to ABC.com and apply."" I just deflect it to the show.' Corcoran: 'I think the celebrity is GREAT. When I started on the show, I fired the shrink I had for years because of my tremendous need for attention. Now I save that money every week!'","Real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran says that her biggest priority is to make money and that how she looks on TV is the least of her worries .

"By . Associated Press . Respecting or learning from one’s elders isn’t exactly a top priority for most teens. They’re too busy texting or mastering the latest social media platform to relate to the idea that their grandparents ever battled teenage issues like acne or fitting in. For Maya Van Wagenen, though, digging up a previous generation’s teen scene actually helped her. She survived the middle-school blues thanks to Betty Cornell’s Teenage Popularity Guide, originally published in 1951. Her experiences following the guide led Maya to write her own book, Popular, which has now been optioned for a movie. Maya, 15, says her father found Cornell’s book in a thrift shop, way before she was born. He held onto it for years because its outdated gems like 'Beautiful hair is about the most important thing a girl has,' made him smile. Mini mogul: Maya Van Wagenen (pictured) followed a 1950s etiquette book for one month in an attempt to draw more friends at school - the results of which she has detailed in a new book, which has recently been optioned for a film . The guide surfaced during a clean-up effort and her parents challenged their eighth grade daughter to an idea: Follow the book’s advice in secret and write about what happens. Maya says she considered herself to be 'one step above substitute teachers' on her school’s popularity scale and worried the project would make things worse. 'It didn’t seem like a good idea at all,' she recalled in a recent interview. 'I was terrified because flipping through the pages you read about all teens must wear a girdle and wear pearls to school and wear pantyhose and red lipstick and stuff that I definitely wasn’t comfortable doing.' Cash cow: Maya's book, titled Popular: A Memoir, Vintage Wisdom for a Modern Geek, was released on April 15 and has already been optioned for a film by Dreamworks . Although she was used to being invisible, as she read the book she had an epiphany. 'I realized I did want friends and I did want to be liked and I did want to be accepted and while I didn’t have a clear cut definition of popularity, I knew that it wasn’t what I was. More than anything, I didn’t have anything to lose, so I said, ""You know what? I’ll try it for a month.""' She began to make changes, wore pearls, dressed up and even tried a girdle. Little things suggested by Cornell began to make sense. Before . the Popularity Guide, Maya says she’d spend five minutes on her hair. Following the book, she began to put time into her appearance, and a . classmate commented that she’d 'finally dropped the stupid ponytail.' Some reaction to her new habits was hurtful, but documenting it seemed to help. 'There . were times people would say mean things and it would make me feel really . bad,' confessed Maya, who was a 13-year-old eighth-grader in . Brownsville, Texas, at the time. But writing about them turned them into . 'hilarious stories' where she was 'able to laugh at these things that . were genuinely hurtful at first.' 'These bullies became characters, and I became a character as well and that was really empowering,” Maya said, adding: “I would say, ""Well, what would I want my character to be doing right now?""' The original: Maya's idea came after reading Betty Cornell's Teenage Popularity Guide, which shares old-fashioned tips and tricks for 1950s adolescents to become popular . Besides changing her appearance, Cornell’s guide also encouraged Maya to reach out to others and be more outgoing. As she . made connections, kids began to gravitate to her. Soon she realized, . 'Everyone around you is like you, and they’re looking for friendship, . and so it’s good to step up and to be that person, that kind person.' As . Maya’s experiment was working, her father went to work to track down . Betty Cornell, now in her 80s and living in Audubon, Pa. The two met and . Maya discovered that Cornell still follows the principles of the book . herself. 'It was wonderful to share that connection. She said it was great to have her work validated,' Maya said. Maya’s . experiment has just been published in a memoir called Popular: Vintage . Wisdom for a Modern Geek (Dutton Juvenile), geared to seventh graders . and up. Betty Cornell’s Teenage Popularity Guide has been re-issued as a . companion book, and Cornell also wrote the forward to Popular. Hollywood also likes Maya’s story: She’s optioned the movie rights to DreamWorks. Maya, . now in 10th grade and living with her family in Statesboro, Georgia, . speaks with a confidence and wisdom that seems beyond her years. She . still breaks out the pearls on special occasions because they’re . 'empowering,' but there’s one thing she’s not keeping: the girdle. 'I definitely left the girdle in the drawer,' she said.","Maya Van Wagenen, now 15, survived middle school with the help of Betty Cornell’s Teenage Popularity Guide, originally published in 1951 .

"By . Candace Sutton . Australian children's health specialists say Prince George is an advanced baby with excellent developmental skills for a child of his age. Sydney paediatricians who observed his responses in photographs and on television footage of his two public appearances say the nine-month-old is progressing well and his parents should be pleased their child is in the top range for his age. 'He looks like a very mobile baby who actively plays with toys and crawls around and he could be almost walking which is very good at nine months,' said Dr Antonia Milner of the Sydney Children's Hospital. Scroll down for video . Between arriving in New Zealand (above, left) for the start of his parents' three week royal tour Down Under, and leaving Australia three weeks later (above, right) Prince George may have undergone a 'developmental growth spurt' in his skills. Certainly the Duke and Duchess said he was carrying an 'extra roll of fat' after being spoilt by his carers while his parents travelled . Prince George was delighted when he was presented with the giant plush toy wombat by Australia's Governor-General Peter Cosgrove at Admiralty House on the family's first day in Australia . 'A mobile baby who will go after the toys he wants, and perhaps pulling himself up to stand, chucking a toy to the ground is all good. ""And if he's standing alone, waving bye bye and clapping or saying more than 'Mum' and ""Dad"" that would be very advanced. 'He looks like he might be about to walk. It's probably a little bit early for a nine-month-old. The fact he's playing with babies or small children, that's more likely than responding to adults who aren't his parents. 'But getting excited with the little animal in the zoo, that's pretty advanced. [The Duke and Duchess] do have a pet dog I know that, so he might have experience with animals through that. 'He's obviously aware of the world and interested in the world. It's lovely to see such an aware baby.' Paediatrician and developmental specialist Dr Lee Sutton said she was impressed with Prince George's focus on the animal named after him at Taronga Zoo, the bilby. Bilby keeper Paul Davies, who was up close to the baby and the bilby during the zoo encounter said he 'had never seen a little boy so excited about meeting a bilby. He had his hands on the glass and he was patting the glass. He did make a grab for the bilby's ears'. 'He does love it honestly,' said William as his son threw the toy bilby on the floor. The toy was presented to him on a visit to the Australian Nightlife enclosure last weekend. The infant Prince was given the soft toy by the zoo director who hoped the royal visit would help highlight efforts to conserve the country's native animals . Prince George is going through his 'oral phase; in which he sticks just about everything in his nouth - including this car sticker, which he proceeded to chew while flinging the toy bilby to the dirt . According to Sydney developmental paediatric specialist Dr Lee Sutton, Prince George's reaction in the bilby enclosure showed 'very good gross motor skills' and the fact he was 'standing up, holding onto the railing and he was pointing at the bilby was really nice because he's only nine months old' Dr Sutton said Prince George's alertness and awareness of his surroundings was obvious and a key sign he had not only reached the normal milestones for a child his age, but may be slightly ahead of other babies. 'His gross motor skills are good,' Dr Sutton said, 'he's standing up, holding onto the railing and he was pointing at the bilby. 'That's really nice because he's only nine months old.' The young prince was also seen to be reaching out to another animal - albeit a stuffed version, the wombat gift from Australian Governor General, Sir Peter Cosgrove, which Prince William later revealed George had taken to chewing 'lovingly'. Dr Milner said it was normal for a nine-month-old to be chewing toys. 'It has nothing to do with development whether a child has several teeth at that age, or no teeth at all,' she said. 'They have teeth underneath and their gums are very firm and babies are going through that oral phase when they are good at chewing food. 'His [Prince George's] parents may have been feeding him mushed up stuff, it could still be very liquid, but he could be eating sandwiches. Prince George displayed 'lovely development' and was 'quite social and engaging' said Sydney paediatrician Dr Lee Sutton, 'and he's crawling and pulling to stand. That's good' 'It depends on the parents, or the nanny. Many parents don't realise they can eat sandwiches and he would be really keen on feeding himself. 'Children that age are keen on holding food up to their mouths. He would be starting to become an independent toddler.' The little prince - who the Palace has revealed has four or five teeth coming through at the moment - reached out chubby arms for the furry toy bilby he received at Taronga Zoo, chewed on it for a few . moments, before throwing it to the floor and attempting to eat another gift, a yellow car sticker that read 'Wild child on board'. At his earlier outing, in New Zealand, his very first official engagement at Government House in Wellington, Prince George managed to divide and rule - and still impress the experts. The Prince was taken among ten babies, all of whom were born within a few weeks of his own birthday, on July 22 last year, and appeared already comparatively solid from head to foot and with chunky little legs. At first the then eight-month-old was held by his mother, as she chatted with other parents. Perhaps bored by this adult interaction, George waved his arms and kicked his legs, getting another baby's attention, after which he touched her face and then grabbed her toy wooden doll. Given a blue plastic block by the Duchess as a substitute, he threw that to the floor and was eventually placed down on the carpet by his mother. George immediately set off at a gallop grabbing toys indiscriminately including a toy tambourine, a drum and a spiral puzzle, with which he became very taken, holding it in the air and giggling as he played on the floor. The Duchess of Cambridge has said this is her favourite photograph from the tour Down Under, of herself with a smiling Prince George on her shoulder in New Zealand. The royal couple can take heart that while they were collecting happy memories, the young prince was also making important developments and impressing local doctors with his skills and engagement . Dr Sutton said the toy throwing was an 'absolutely normal' stage known in child medicine as 'casting' . 'You still often see that stage happening at ten or eleven months old,' she said, 'and he's crawling and pulling to stand. that's good,' she said. 'I thought he showed lovely development and he was quite social and engaging.' Dr Milner said the lively interaction with other young children was a good sign and perhaps the prince had undergone a string of developments while his parents were on tour. 'The funny thing about the way nine month olds develop is they have a little spurt - it's like a growth spourt, but it's developmental - when they have a few days over which they might start doing quite a few new things.' Dr Milner said Prince George's parents were in for an exciting time with their son's development over the coming months. 'There will be more words coming and he'll start putting words together,' she said. 'He'll start showing his mother the particular things he's actually interested in and he'll start putting objects in and out of containers. 'Then he might play with dolls. It depends what his parents give them, but my son was playing with his teddy bear and pushing it round in a pram, just as little girls play with dolls and ""feed' them and ""put them to bed"".'","Prince George an 'advanced baby' with excellent skills say Australian doctors .

"By . Tom Pugh . Prisoners approaching the end of their sentences are being offered HGV lessons to stop them reoffending once freed. Mainstream Training has formed a partnership with Category D HMP Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. Inmates deemed suitable are sent on courses, including for HGVs and forklift trucks, at the company's base in Sittingbourne or at the jail, and are predominantly classroom-based. Prisoners approaching the end of their sentences at HMP Standford Hill open prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, pictured, are being offered HGV lessons to stop them reoffending once freed . Funding for the lessons comes from charitable donations, including from the Royal London Society and the Salvation Army - and has to be paid back once jobs are found. Sheppey residents criticised the scheme, with one describing it as a ‘slap in the face of the ordinary hard-working person’. However, Paul Tolley, senior operations manager at Mainstream, said the aim was to help offenders into jobs on the outside to stop them reoffending. He said once offenders pass their tests and get jobs, they have to pay back the money to help another inmate rehabilitate. Mr Tolley said: 'It's not a freebie. These aren't free driving lessons for personal use. Once their term is up, they are given a small amount of money and told basically to get on with it. 'What we have done is put a programme in place to help get them trained, get a CV together and help them get a job. 'A person is less likely to reoffend if they are in a full-time job. The money used to train them will be paid back to help the next person rehabilitate. 'It's like a conveyor belt system. 'We are trying to help people to stop them re-offending as there are often prisoners who leave jail with a small amount of money, no family and no job and are back in prison in a week.' Funding for the lessons comes from charitable donations, including from the Royal London Society and the Salvation Army - and has to be paid back once jobs are found . Since the scheme started in January, half of around the 30 people who have been trained have found employment, Mr Tolley added. He said helping train suitable prisoners with HGV licences is helping to plug the shortfall of up to 100,000 drivers in the logistics industry. The charity, Victim Support, welcomed steps that help prisoners gain a job and rehabilitate themselves. A spokesman said: 'What victims want more than anything else is not to be a victim in the first place and for the criminal not to do it again. 'Schemes that are proven to genuinely cut the chances of someone reoffending help to achieve that, such as the restorative justice work we do where a criminal has to meet their victim. 'Helping a prisoner to get a job after they've served their time is also a helpful step in their rehabilitation.'","Lessons offered to inmates at open prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent .

"By . Becky Barrow . Around 33 homes are being bought for more than £1million every day in England and Wales.Land Registry statistics reveal that in January this year there were 1,011 houses sold in this  price bracket. This equates to 33 a day and is nearly double the 628 £1million-plus properties sold in the same month in 2013. The number of buyers paying this much for a property – whether a family home or a buy-to-let investment – has risen by 61 per cent over the last year. More than 1,000 houses were sold for in excess of £1,000,000 during 2013 according to new figures released by the Land Registry (file photo) Seventy per cent of the seven-figure properties sold were in London, further evidence of the frenetic state of the capital’s housing market. The average price of a house in London now stands at an incredible £414,490. But in the exclusive Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the Land Registry figures are even higher – there the average property sells for £1.24million. Over the last year, house prices have risen by over 20 per cent in the London boroughs of Islington, Lambeth, Southwark and Waltham Forest. Even properties in areas formerly considered undesirable because of high crime rates and poor schools are now selling for more than £1million. Around 400,000 people in Britain are thought to be ‘property millionaires’, which means their home is worth £1million or more, even if they have a large mortgage. Outside London, the highest proportion of property millionaires is in the affluent Surrey town of Virginia Water, where a third of all houses are worth over £1million. Properties such as Markham Square in Chelsea, pictured, regularly reach in excess of seven-figures . Other property millionaire hotspots include the Buckinghamshire towns of Beaconsfield and Chalfont St Giles, according to the property website Zoopla.co.uk. The property market boom looks like it will be here for the long-term – a separate report has predicted that by 2034 the average price of a home in England will be more than £900,000. The study by accountants KPMG and housing charity Shelter warned that more and more people will be unable to afford a home of their own unless more houses are built. If property prices continue to rise as they have over the last 17 years, the cost of an average home in England will be £446,000 in 2024, ballooning to £903,000 ten years later, the research predicts. At present, the average home in England costs around £225,000. The report also warned that rocketing prices would prevent children flying the nest, as by 2040 half of those aged 20-34 will still be living with their parents. However, the house price boom is not good news for first-time buyers, who are finding it increasingly difficult to get on the housing ladder . Marianne Fallon, UK head of corporate affairs at KPMG, said England’s housing market is ‘a big and messy problem’. She said: ‘For many people, particularly those in their twenties, the aspiration of owning their own “castle” is fast becoming a fairy tale.’ Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, warned: ‘Our chronic shortage of affordable homes means that a generation face a future of living in their childhood bedrooms into their thirties.’ Companies’ ability to ‘attract and retain talent’ is also affected, according to KPMG, as young people are put off living and working in London by the astronomical cost of buying a property. A senior official at the Bank of England last night also voiced concerns about rising property prices. Chief economist Spencer Dale said: ‘We know we should be nervous about what’s going on in the housing market.’","£1m plus property sales have increased by 61 percent since 2012 .

"By . Bianca London . and Annabel Fenwick Elliott . After much Twitter speculation, Kate Upton has been revealed as British Vogue's cover star. Shot by acclaimed fashion photographer Mario Testino in the sun-drenched Caribbean, Kate shows off the curves that sky-rocketed her to fame. The 21-year-old model and star of The Other Woman sports a glowing tan as she poses on the beach for the fashion bible's cover wearing a vintage-inspired Dolce & Gabanna floral swimsuit. Big reveal: After much speculation, it's official - Kate Upton is British Vogue's June cover star and she shows off those famous curves in a floral Dolce & Gabanna swimsuit . Inside the glossy issue, Kate is the ultimate beach babe in sporty swimwear with reflective sunglasses, a pair of flippers and messy hair. The Sport's Illustrated model is interviewed by contributing editor and fellow cover girl, Alexa Chung in the issue and discusses the impact of her famed body on the industry. She tells the magazine: 'It's weird that in the press they'll be like, your biggest fight was with the industry and the designers, and I'm like, no, my biggest fight was with my agents, trying to get them to sign me into the castings. I thought, how I'm going to come out of this will be an example for girls.' Speaking about her style inspirations, she says: 'I always thought Marilyn was so beautiful and iconic, it was amazing to even be mentioned in the same sentence as her. The ultimate beach babe: The Sport's Illustrated model, who looks sporty and athletic in the sunny shoot, is interviewed by contributing editor, and fellow cover girl, Alexa Chung in  and discusses the impact of her famed body on the industry . 'But I feel like nowadays it's easy to be genuine and show your personality, whereas I don't think Marilyn had that opportunity. And clearly she had a dark side, and I don't have that.' Twitter speculation went into overdrive after British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman shared a teasing portion of the upcoming June cover - inviting fans to guess the owner of those unmistakable curves. The photo, which was posted to British Vogue's official Instagram account yesterday morning, reveals the sun-soaked 'mystery' lady. 'Guess who's on the cover of @britishvogue's June 2014 issue?' the caption reads. But for eagle eyes, the small horseshoe . shaped tattoo on the bodacious model's wrist is the dead giveaway - it . undoubtedly belongs to Kate Upton. The second Kate to grace British Vogue's cover in as many months - supermodel Kate Moss sizzled in her latest range of Topshop designs for its May edition - the 21-year-old blonde bombshell has been busy doing the publicity rounds of late, to promote her film debut. The Other Woman, which also stars Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann and Nicki Minaj, burst into movie theaters over the weekend and quickly nabbed the number one spot in box office sales, raking in $25 million by Monday. Cover girl looks: Miss Upton was pictured posing for a photo shoot today in Downtown Manhattan . Nineties revival: The model wore stonewash skinny jeans and a plunging black top for the New York City shoot . This will be Miss Upton's second British Vogue cover, and it would have been hot on the heels of her second American Vogue cover too, if Kim Kardashian and Kanye West hadn't bumped her off the top spot this month, seemingly at the last moment. Last week, it came to light that Jonathan Van Meter, the writer who had penned the accompanying profile on Miss Upton, only found out that it been moved off the cover spot 'when it hit newsstands.' The disgruntled writer then posted a review of the May issue, which declared his piece on Kate Upton 'the jewel' of the edition. On set: Miss Upton couldn't help but get a few stares as she worked her magic for the camera . Kate Upton first rose to fame after starring on the cover of a somewhat less high fashion publication, Sports Illustrated, looking sultry in a barely-there red bikini. She appeared on the cover again for its 2013 swimsuit issue, posing in little more than an unzipped arctic jacket, and has featured several other times since. In her interview for American Vogue last month, she opened up about the fine art of emanating just the right amount of sexy. Starring role: Miss Upton appears in new movie The Other Woman with Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann . I definitely have limits,' she said, adding: 'There's a line between becoming, you know, a little cheap and cheesy versus being sexy. And I try to be very careful of that line.' Clearly her strategy is working and Miss Upton has been fully embraced by the global Vogue clan. She first appeared on the Italian Vogue cover in November 2012, followed by British Vogue in January 2013 and American Vogue's cover in June 2013 - where she was heralded as the 'American Dream Girl. 'I love my body,' Miss Upton declared in the accompanying interview. 'Itâ€™s what God gave me.'

"By . Leon Watson . Fed-up with watching his son's team lose heavily in a teenage rugby cup final, this father decided to put the boot in himself. He was caught on camera sticking a foot out to deliberately trip up an opposition player just as the winning side was about to score yet another try. The trip-up sent the attacking teenage player flying, incensing parents on the sideline. A father watching his team lose heavily in a teenage rugby cup final in Hertfordshire was caught deliberately tripping a opposition player . The referee of the Hertfordshire Shield cup final had to intervene and then sent the spectator off from the side of the pitch and halted the match 10 minutes before the end of the game. Despite the incident the Royston Rugby Club U16 team was awarded a 64-5 victory against neighbouring rivals, Fullerians. Outraged parents and players condemned the father, believed to be a parent of one of the boys playing, who has since been disciplined by the Fullerians club. Jonathan Robson wrote on Twitter: 'Royston U16 won despite this idiot at Fullerians, how can somones (sic) dad do this' Royston Rugby Club president Jamie Johnson said he had next heard of such an 'extraordinary' incident during a youth match. 'There is now an investigation taking place within their club and we will also be putting forward our own statement,' the president said. Fullerians' president Mike Musk described the apparent trip as 'deplorable' and said swift action had been taken. The club is pictured here . Fullerians' president Mike Musk described the apparent trip as 'deplorable' and said swift action had been taken. 'I wasn't there, but I've seen the photo. We have had a committee meeting since and will have further meetings,' he said. 'It was certainly deplorable and the only mitigation I can give is that it would seem that it was out of character for this person. 'We have taken action and as far as I am aware, he has been banned from the touchline at matches until next December or January.' He also hoped the matter would remain between the two clubs and would not need to be investigated at a higher level. The Royston president was disappointed that the incident might detract from such a dominant victory for the young Royston side, who had won the trophy at U-15 level last year before triumphing again on Sunday and also won their Saracens League division this season. The Royston side scored 10 tries and were ahead 26-5 at half time.","Father stuck out a foot during Herfordshire Shied cup final .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A man was chased across a city centre park and stabbed to death by a gang following an argument over a £10 drug debt for meow meow, a court has heard. Neil Bennett, 50, was stabbed once in the back before being fatally knifed again in the chest during the argument over a mephedrone deal - known as MCAT or Meow Meow – in the centre of Gloucester on the evening of July 27 last year. Ricky James, 34, Lucy Dowdall, 20, Christopher Horn, 30, and Tyler Johnson, 26, are all on trial at Bristol Crown Court accused of his murder. Ricky James, 34, Lucy Dowdall, 20, Christopher Horn, 30, and Tyler Johnson, 26, are all on trial at Bristol Crown Court, pictured, accused of Neil Bennett's murder . Prosecutors allege that Horn delivered the fatal blow having been egged on by Dowdall - with all four acting ‘jointly’ to murder Mr Bennett. The victim and a friend had gone to a flat in the city centre where three of the defendants lived to buy drugs from Horn, who is said to be a dealer, the court heard. Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC told the jury: ‘It wasn’t a social or friendly visit. ‘It was clearly about drugs or a small £10 debt and some bad feeling arose from that debt. ‘It may be that you will think that having heard all the evidence that Neil Bennett was trying to obtain more drugs without having paid for them and that’s why he went around.’ Less than an hour later he had been fatally knifed having been chased through Gloucester Park, which is close to the flat where James, Dowdall and Horn lived. Mr Langdon said that CCTV - although not showing the stabbings - showed Mr Bennett brandishing a pair of tweezers or a small knife towards the defendants. ‘At one point Christopher Horn bares his chest and invites Neil Bennett to stab him,’ Mr Langdon said. ‘There were witnesses in a car and they describe two men fighting, clearly Mr Bennett and Christopher Horn. The court heard that Neil Bennett was fatally knifed in the chest having been chased through Gloucester Park, pictured, following an alleged argument over a '£10 drugs deal' ‘The witnesses in the car noticed Lucy Dowdall and their impression was that she was playing a prominent role in egging the men on to have a go. ‘She says to one of the others, referring to Ricky James, “You meant to be his boy. You let this happen. You going to do anything about it now?” ‘It is shortly after that the violence begins and the prosecution say that each of the three men on trial with Lucy Dowdall went on to play a part in the attack on Neil Bennett - ultimately resulting in his death.’ Mr Langdon said that after being stabbed in the back, Mr Bennett was shouting and threatening to return ‘with his boys’. ‘Whether that was a meaningful threat or something said in defiance by a wounded or frightened man is something you will perhaps have to consider,’ he said. Mr Bennett ran away across the park, followed by the four defendants, where he was stabbed for a second time, allegedly by Horn with a knife taken from the kitchen of the flat. ‘It was clearly about drugs or a small £10 debt and some bad feeling arose from that debt.' - Prosecutor Andrew Langdon QC told the jury . People who went to the aid of Mr Bennett thought he had been in a collision with a car as he was lying in the road. ‘Mark Newman, a security guard, noticed that very near to the wound and sticking through a leather jacket was the blade of a knife with no handle,’ Mr Langdon said. ‘It is unclear how and at what point the blade has been pulled out from the wound because it transpired that certain witnesses had seen the blade protruding from the chest of the man as he staggered around and fell.’ The knife wound had pierced Mr Bennett’s heart and he died despite medical treatment. After leaving the scene, the four defendants disposed of clothing and went back to the flat to wash before returning to the vicinity where they were quizzed by police and allowed to move on. ‘They gave no indication that they knew anything about what had happened,’ Mr Langdon said. Johnson then went home and the others went back to the flat. At around 10pm the three went out again and were stopped a second time and arrested by police. Johnson was arrested the next day. ‘Each of these four, in different ways, is jointly responsible for the death of Neil Bennett,’ Mr Langdon said. James, Horn and Dowdall, of Gloucester, and Johnson, of no fixed address, deny murder. The trial at Bristol Crown Court, pictured, has been adjourned until tomorrow . ‘If you conclude it was Christopher Horn that held the knife that stabbed Neil Bennett, causing both wounds, you will need to consider the roles of the other three defendants because the prosecution say this was a joint enterprise, where each shoulders joint roles for the murder of Mr Bennett. ‘Indeed if you are not sure it was Christopher Horn that inflicted the fatal wound, provided you are sure it was one of those defendants that did so and it was the product of joint enterprise, you may convict any defendant you think was part of that.’ James, Horn and Dowdall, of Gloucester, and Johnson, of no fixed address, deny murder. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Neil Bennett, 50, was stabbed in the back and chest in centre of Gloucester .

"By . Candace Sutton . It's 23 years since the bodies of Clinton Speedy, 16 and Evelyn Greenup, four, were discovered in the tiny town of Bowraville, Australia and all that remained of Colleen Walker, her clothes, bagged and weighted down with rocks in the Nambucca River. All the victims were indigenous and the families say if they had been white and living in suburbia instead of being black and from an Aboriginal mission, the murders would have been solved long ago. Now a senior homicide detective is about to give evidence at a parliamentary inquiry that a serial killer operating in the country town where the three children disappeared in the early 1990s escaped justice because police  failed to properly investigate. Submissions to the inquiry will say the families were failed and assumptions were made that when Aboriginal children disappeared they had just  'gone walkabout'. Evelyn Greenup, four, (left) and Colleen Walker, 16 (right) both went missing parties on the Aboriginal mission outside the  Australian town of Bowraville in 1990. Local police suggested the kindergarten pupil was a runaway, but her partially decomposed body was found the following year on a dirt track near the river, in which Ms Walker's clothes were found weighted down with rocks . After Clinton Speedy-Duroux, 16,  disappeared  in 1991 from a local man's caravan where he and his girlfriend had been sleeping, his body was found two weeks later dumped along the same bush track as four-year-old Evelyn Greenup. No attempt was made to conceal either body and both appeared to have suffered significant blows to the head . Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin of the New South Wales Police will tell the NSW Law & Justice Parliamentary Committee in relation to the Bowraville Murders on Thursday that the three child murder cases should be considered together and that there would be a reasonable chance of identifying and convicting the 'serial killer'. One suspect in 1991 was a local tannery worker, Jay Hart, a white man then in his twenties. Hart was charged with the murders of Clinton Speedy and Evelyn Greenup. After a judge, Justice Badgery-Parker of the NSW Supreme Court, ruled that Hart could not be tried for the two murders together, Hart was tried and acquitted of the murder of Clinton Speedy in 1994, and of the murder of Evelyn Greenup in 2006. Nobody was charged with the murder of Colleen Walker. Inspector Jubelin's submission, along with others from Aboriginal language and cultural experts, and the victims' families will point to a lack of forensic evidence being gathered at the time of the murders, of the disappearances not being taken seriously and the two cases which were prosecuted being treated 'apathetically'. A community divided: The white community in the tiny country town of Bowraville did not mix with the local Aboriginals from the mission on the road out of town until a local man started taking alcohol and cannabis to mission parties with indigenous people . Evelyn Greenup's mother did not realise the four-year-old was missing until late the following day after she was apparently kidnapped from a bedroom. The girl's body wasn't found till months later . Leonie Duroux, the sister-in-law of Clinton Speedy-Duroux, organised a protest outside NSW Parliament House last November which led to the inquiry. She said the treatment of the murders was a 24-year-old sham and had been so from the start. 'From the time they disappeared it has been [a sham],' she said. 'I am a white person, and if I went missing the police wouldn't go and ask if I'd just gone walkabout, or like they did of Colleen Walker's mother if she might have gone because she'd just got pregnant. 'They also asked her if she was actually Collen's mother, because Colleen was light-skinned. 'There was no forensic evidence taken from the house from which Evelyn disappeared and she was treated as a runaway. She was four years old, and had left behind a shoe. Former Bowraville man, Jay Thomas Hart (interviewed, above, on the Seven Network's Today Tonight programme) has been tried and acquitted on the murders of Clinton Speedy and Evelyn Greenup . A poster from the protest in November last year staged by members of Bowraville's Aboriginal community outside Parliament House in Sydney, which sparked a state inquiry into the murders of Colleen Walker (left), Clinton Speedy (centre and Evelyn Greenup more than 23 years ago . 'Clinton's disappearance was taken a little but more seriously because his body was found three weeks later. Even so, there was an eye witness  who identified the man standing over Clinton's body on the road at the time he disappeared and that was taken by the police but not used. 'There are families and communities in many places and towns who are still suffering and paying for the mistakes made by police all these years later.' The first victim of the Bowraville killer was Colleen Walker, who in September 1990 arrived from her home 60 km north, to the community of around 150 Aboriginal and 750 white people. Few of the white townsfolk fraternised with the Aborigines on the mission, except Jay Hart. A police officer will tell the inquiry that the murders of Evelyn Greenup (above) and teenagers Clinton Speedy and Colleen Walker should be tried as serial killings in the one court hearing . On her first or second day in Bowraville, the 16-year-old attended a party at the mission, at which there was alcohol and cannabis, known as 'yarni' . Walker got very drunk and failed to meet her friends to take the 3am train out. Her mother did not find out she was missing until days later. The following month, on October 3, after another party at the mission, a drunk Rebecca Stadhams took her three children, including four-year-old Evelyn to their father, Billy Greenup's house,but found he was too inebriated to mind them. Back at her mother's house, Stadhams fell asleep with the children only to wake up the next morning to find Evelyn gone. Assuming the child had walked down in daylight to see her father, Stadhams didn't realise Evelyn was missing until she caught up with Billy Greenup later in the day. In January 1991, Clinton Speedy was visiting from his home in the country town of Tenterfield, five hours north-west of Bowraville. Speedy attended another party at the mission. The teenager disappeared and the discovery of his body dumped on a dirt track seven kilometres out of Bowraville sparked the first suspicions by police of a murder at the mission. The next remains to be discovered were when a fisherman snagged Collen Walker's clothes in the river near that track and, thereafter, Evelyn Greenup's decomposed body. Police charged Jay Thomas Hart with the murders of Clinton Speedy and Evelyn Greenup, having identified similarities in the deaths and identifying a possible sexual motive, in that Hart allegedly wanted to have sex with someone in each victim's company at the time of their disappearance. A Supreme Court judge decided to try the cases separately, making evidence about the Collen Walker and Evelyn Greenup deaths inadmissable at Hart's 1994 trial for Clinton Speedy's murder. Hart was acquitted. More than a decade later, Hart was tried and acquitted for the Greenup murder. Inspector Jubelin, who was not part of the original murder investigations, took up the case in 1997 and has since taken carriage of the families' fight for justice. Leonie Duroux told the MailOnline the families of the murder victims and the wider indigenous community were grateful this latest inquiry might give them another opportunity for the cases to be investigated and tried. 'We hope something comes of it,' she said. 'it was because of these cases that the laws were changed surrounding double jeopardy [in which a person cannot be tried a second time after being acquitted once on the same charge],' Ms Duroux said . 'The law now says a case can be retried if the evidence is fresh and compelling. We hope they will listen and and decide something has to be done. 'It has been a very long time and the murders still affect people's lives.' Jay Thomas Hart's mother. Marlene Hart, told the MailOnline her son was an innocent man who had been unfairly targeted for almost a quarter of a century. 'It's been absolute terror,' said Mrs Hart, who still lives in Bowraville. 'It's affected our whole family and my health, but [the police] stop at him and don't go any further.'","Two teenagers and a young girl were murdered in tiny Australian town .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Nigel Farage today threw away the chance to become an MP within weeks as he ruled himself out of standing in a crunch by-election. Opponents accused the Ukip leader of 'bottling it' and being 'frit' after announcing he would not be the party's candidate in the Tory seat of Newark vacated by shamed MP Patrick Mercer. Last night Mr Farage claimed David Cameron would have to resign as Prime Minister if he won the seat for Ukip, but today he confirmed he would not be on the ballot paper. Ukip leader Nigel Farage, speaking outside a pub in Bath today, ruled himself out of standing in the Newark by-election . Senior Tories will breath a sigh of relief at the decision not to field Mr Farage in Newark. The Conservatives secured a majority of 16,000 in the seat at the last election, but bookmakers said Ukip were just 2/1 to win Newark in a by-election, with the Tories favourites at 4/5. Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves said: 'I'm not surprised that Nigel Farage doesn't want to fight in Newark. 'He bottles it when there's a real contest, and when he has a chance to prove that people want him as a member of parliament he backs away and he's done that again.' Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said on Twitter: 'Niger Farage is not stupid - he knows he'd lose and runs frit from Newark!' But Mr Farage claimed that putting his own name forward for the seat would cause a 'distraction' from the party's bid to win the European Parliament elections on May 22. A by-election has been rumoured since the cash-for-questions scandal broke last summer. But in a statement outside a pub in Bath this morning, Mr Farage claimed he had not had long to consider whether or not to run. 'I have no doubt that UKIP will throw the . kitchen sink at this Newark by-election, but it won’t be me doing it . and we won’t get that huge distraction,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'It was only 12 hours ago that Patrick Mercer stood down so I haven’t had long to think about it, but I have thought about it and we’re just over three weeks away from a European election at which I think UKIP can cause an earthquake in British politics, from which we can go on and not just win one parliamentary seat but win quite a lot of parliamentary seats. 'And for that reason I don’t want to do anything that deflects from the European election campaign so I’m not going to stand in this by-election. 'I want to focus the next three weeks on winning the European elections and also I don’t have any links with the east Midlands; I would just look like an opportunist and I don’t think that would work.' The prospect of Mr Farage standing for Parliament emerged last night as he addressed a meeting of Ukip supporters in Bath . Tory defence minister Anna Soubry accused Mr Farage of being 'frit', an insult used by Margaret Thatcher against Labour . Ukip strategists are examining how the Reform party in Canada used a by-election as a springboard to becoming a dominant political force. Local teacher Deborah Grey won Reform's first seat in Parliament in 1989, and four years later the party overtook the Progressive Conservatives as the main right-wing party. Other names in the frame to fight the seat are communities spokesman Suzanne Evans, viewed as a strong media performer, and Ukip MEP Roger Helmer. Mr Helmer, a former Tory, has been an MEP in the East Midlands since 1999. But he has often sparked controversy, just yesterday making headlines for saying it was acceptable to dislike gay people. Later he appeared to admit part of the reason he did not stand was he did not think he would win. He told Sky News: 'I'm not sure electorally it would have worked anyway.' The seat went to Labour in 1997 during the first Tony Blair landslide but returned to the Tories in 2001. Last night Mr Farage told the BBC that if he stood and won Mr Cameron would 'have to resign' but if he lost Ukip would be finished: 'The bubble is burst.' The Tories were quick to seize on Mr Farage's decision as proof he lacked the will to fight a difficult election. Asked on Sky News 'The question is have you bottled it?' Mr Farage replied: 'Yes.' Conservative Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, who represents the neighbouring Nottinghamshire seat of Rushcliffe, said Mr Farage had backed out because he knew he could not win. 'I am not really surprised. Whatever else Nigel is, he is not an idiot and I don't think he'd have the faintest chance of winning in Newark,' Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'I don't think Ukip will get anywhere in the by-election. 'I don't think the residents of Newark - some of whom I know because I used to represent some of the villages there - they're not going to vote for a card who's larking about trying to get protest votes.' It follows Mr Farage also refusing to stand in the Eastleigh by-election triggered by Lib Dem Chris Huhne's resignation and in the Labour seat of Wythenshawe and Sale. Local . Tories scotched suggestions of Boris Johnson being selected, saying . they had already chosen businessman Robert Jenrick to fight the seat. And Labour was at pains to stress that it last held the seat before boundary changes, and played down any prospect of winning the by-election. Former Tory MP Patrick Mercer speaks outside the House of Commons, London, as he announces his resignation . Mr Mercer, an . outspoken critic of David Cameron, quit the Tory party in July after he was exposed as having accepted £4,000 to ask Parliamentary . questions and lobby on behalf of Fiji. He referred himself to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and . promised to quit the Commons at the next election. But . the standards watchdog is expected to recommend he be suspended from . the Commons for six months in a damning report tomorrow. In . a statement last night, Mr Mercer said he was ‘ashamed’ of his . behaviour. The former Army colonel said that as an ex-soldier he . believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to . it. He added: ‘No . point in shilly- shallying or trying to avoid it. What has happened has . happened, I’m ashamed of it. Therefore, I’m going to do what I can to . put it right . . . I’m going to resign my seat.’ The market town of Newark lies on the River Trent in Nottinghamshire . In 2010 the Tories won 54 per cent of the vote, with Ukip securing just 4 per cent . Newark is a largely rural constituency which, since Patrick Mercer was elected in 2001, has been considered a safe Conservative seat. Centred on the affluent cathedral town of Southwell and the market town of Newark, and dissected by the River Trent, around half of the area's 72,000 voters live in villages and rural areas. It borders Labour-held Bassetlaw in the north and lies to the north east of a number of Labour-voting constituencies in the city of Nottingham. But unlike Nottinghamshire's more urban areas, Newark has a traditionally Conservative-voting population, like that of its two neighbouring Lincolnshire constituencies, Gainsborough and Sleaford and North Hykeham, which border it to the east. Newark's electorate is 93 per cent white British, and 67 per cent describe themselves as Christian, with less than one per cent considering themselves Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Jewish. More than 70 per cent of homes in the constituency either owned outright or mortgaged, less than 10 per cent of households have council or housing association tenants and only 20 per cent of the electorate are younger than 34. Well over half of voters are employed, with nearly one in five retired and only three per cent unemployed. Traditionally Tory, it was held by the party for the first half of the 20th century, but swung to Labour after the war, with Labour MPs George Deer and Edward Stanley Bishop representing it from 1950 to 1979. It swung back to the Conservatives in 1979, with Tory Richard Alexander holding the seat until 1997, when Labour's Fiona Jones won a slim majority as Tony Blair swept to power.Mrs Jones could only hold the seat for one term however and Patrick Mercer won it back for the Tories in 2001. At the last election, the Tories won 54 per cent of the vote, giving them a huge majority over Labour, who polled at only 24 per cent.","Ukip leader Nigel Farage says by-election would 'huge distraction' for party .

"By . Bianca London . Ever caught your boyfriend swiping away on his phone late at night and thought nothing of it? He could well be perusing potential new girlfriends on Tinder, if the latest research is anything to go by. A new survey revealed that a fifth of people aged 18-35 have secretly used dating websites behind their partner’s back while in a relationship. According to a new study, 21 per cent of coupled-up people between the ages of 18 and 35 have used dating apps/websites without their partner’s knowledge. What's he up to? A new survey reveals that a fifth of men have admitted to using dating apps whilst in a relationship . Respondents were initially asked ‘Have you ever used dating websites?’ to which 58 per cent said that ‘yes’ they had, whilst the remaining respondents claimed not to have done so. They were then asked ‘Have you ever used a dating website or app whilst in a relationship?’ to which 21 per cent of all respondents said that ‘yes’, they had in the past. A further 14 per cent, one in seven, admitted that they had used a dating website or app while in their ‘current relationship’. The most commonly used dating websites amongst those in relationships were Plenty of Fish (43 per cent), followed by the dating app Tinder (37 per cent) while 29 per cent even paid to be members of Match.com. The respondents who had admitted to indulging in a spot of online dating were then asked if they had ever actually met somebody whose profile they had seen, which revealed that 44 per cent of these had done so behind their partner’s back. Sneaky: Plenty Of Fish, Tinder and even Match.com, which people are paying for, are cited as the top dating apps and sites that cunning partner's are using . However, the majority (56 per cent) said that they’d only used the dating website or apps to ‘look’ or ‘message people’ and didn’t actually intend to meet anyone. Those who said that they’d actually gone on to meet someone via a dating website or app while in a relationship were asked how far this had gone. Some 39 per cent said that they hadn’t cheated or had sexual contact with the person. However, 27 per cent confessed that they had been intimate and ended up in bed with the person. When broken down between male and female respondents, males were shown to be more likely to use dating websites or apps while in a relationship, making up 61 per cent. The potential cost of dating websites was then looked at, as respondents were asked ‘Have you ever paid for a subscription to a dating website or paid to download a dating app?’ to which 48 per cent said they had. They were then asked if they worried about the payments appearing on their bills; 37 per cent admitted to harbouring concerns , but 41 per cent said that they ‘hadn’t thought about it’. Finally, respondents were asked whether or not they felt guilty about using a dating website behind their partner’s back, with 56 per cent saying that they did. However, the remaining 44 per cent claimed not to feel guilt, with 38 per cent of these saying that it was in their best interest to ‘shop around’. That's worrying! Of those who do use dating apps and sites, 44 per cent go as far as to meet up with the person and 27 per cent have even ended up in bed with the . A spokesperson for vouchercloud.com, who carried out the research, said: 'Dating websites and apps are becoming increasingly mainstream. A few years ago, dating online was seen as the preserve of geeks and the hopeless.'This certainly isn’t the case now, with more and more people investigating relationship options via the internet. 'The anonymity of online dating though seems that it could be of benefit to those with a wandering eye. It’s much easier to connect with someone discreetly online then it is to do so in a public place. 'Those who worry that they’re in a relationship with a potential philanderer though might want to take the odd peek at bills if they’re concerned, as it seems that a good percentage aren’t savvy enough to cover their tracks.'","Plenty Of Fish, Tinder and Match.com most popular methods .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . More than half of voters in some parts of Britain are planning to vote Ukip in next month's crunch European elections, a new poll has revealed. Overall, 38 per cent of Brits certain to vote in the May 22 election say they will back Ukip. This is 11 per cent higher than Labour - who sit in second on 27 per cent. The Tories trail in third, on just 18 per cent, with the Lib Dems even further back with just 8% support. A new ComRes survey for ITV News shows 38 per cent of people are planning to voe for Ukip on May 22 in the European Parliament elections . Nigel Farage on the campaign trail in Swansea. Even in Wales, a traditional Labour heartland, almost a third of voters say they are planning to back Ukip . But Nigel Farage's party is backed by half of voters in some of its English strongholds. In the West Midlands, some 52% of voters say they will back Mr Farage's party. In . the European Parliament's 'Eastern' constituency - taking in all of . East Anglia and counties north of London - support is even higher, at . 53%. Across England, support for Ukip has reached 41%, according to the respected pollsters ComRes. Four . in 10 voters in the South East and London are set to back the party, 44 . per cent in the South West, 37 per cent in the South West and 36 per . cent in the East Midlands. Even . in the traditional Labour heartlands of the North East and Yorkshire, . Mr Farage's party is backed by more than a third of the electorate that . is certain to vote. Mr Farage is, however, struggling to break through outside England. While 29 per cent of Welsh voters say they will back Ukip, this is seven points behind Labour who lead the polls. But in Scotland just 12 per cent support Mr Farage's party, according to the poll. In the Eastern region and West Midlands more than half of people say they plan to vote Ukip . Nigel Farage today threw away the . chance to become an MP within weeks as he ruled himself out of standing . in a crunch by-election. The . Ukip leader said he would not be the party's candidate in the Tory seat . of Newark vacated by shamed MP Patrick Mercer who resigned last night . in a sleaze scandal . Last . night Mr Farage said David Cameron would have to resign as Prime . Minister if he won the seat for Ukip, but today he confirmed he would . not be on the ballot paper. But in a statement outside a pub in Bath this morning, Mr Farage claimed he had not had long to consider whether or not to run. 'I have no doubt that UKIP will throw the . kitchen sink at this Newark by-election, but it won’t be me doing it . and we won’t get that huge distraction,' he told BBC Breakfast. Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said on Twitter: 'Niger Farage is not stupid - he knows he'd lose and runs frit from Newark!' Mr Farage's soaring support ahead of next month's election comes despite a third of Brits thinking his party is racist. The . ComRes poll for ITV News reveals 32 per cent think Ukip is racist - . including 52 per cent of likely Labour voters at next month’s European . Parliament elections. A third of the public say UKIP is more honest than other parties - but four in 10 voters disagree with this. Brits . are also split about whether the party has sensible policies: 38 per . cent think not, but 34 per cent think the party does. But worryingly for the Prime Minister, just under half of 2010 Tory supporters - 48 per cent - think Ukip has sensible policies. Overall, . support for Mr Farage's party is up eight per cent in just a month. Labour are down three per cent and the Tories four per cent. The party's support also falls dramatically for the next General Election. A . quarter of likely Ukip voters at the European Parliamentary elections . say that they are unlikely to vote for the party at the General . Election. Just 55% say that . they are very likely to vote for the party in 2015, compared to 90% of . Labour voters and 88% of Conservative voters. Today's . poll figures will come as welcome relief for Mr Farage, who faced . ridicule throughout the day for refusing to stand for Parliament in an . upcoming by-election. Opponents . accused the Ukip leader of 'bottling it' and being 'frit' after . announcing he would not be the party's candidate in the Tory seat of . Newark vacated by shamed MP Patrick Mercer. Last . night Mr Farage claimed Mr Cameron would have to resign as Prime . Minister if he won the seat for Ukip, but today he confirmed he would . not be on the ballot paper. Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves said: 'I'm not surprised that Nigel Farage doesn't want to fight in Newark. 'He . bottles it when there's a real contest, and when he has a chance to . prove that people want him as a member of parliament he backs away and . he's done that again.' Despite soaring support for Ukip, Nigel Farage is not universally liked. In Wales today protesters disrupted his planned walkabout around Swansea city centre . Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said on Twitter: 'Niger Farage is not stupid - he knows he'd lose and runs frit from Newark!' But . Mr Farage claimed that putting his own name forward for the seat would . cause a 'distraction' from the party's bid to win the European . Parliament elections on May 22. A by-election has been rumoured since the cash-for-questions scandal broke last summer. But in a statement outside a pub in Bath this morning, Mr Farage claimed he had not had long to consider whether or not to run. 'I . have no doubt that UKIP will throw the kitchen sink at this Newark . by-election, but it won’t be me doing it and we won’t get that huge . distraction,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'It . was only 12 hours ago that Patrick Mercer stood down so I haven’t had . long to think about it, but I have thought about it and we’re just over . three weeks away from a European election at which I think UKIP can . cause an earthquake in British politics, from which we can go on and not . just win one parliamentary seat but win quite a lot of parliamentary . seats. Nigel Farage expects to top the polls in next month's European election - pushing the Tories into third behind Labour . 'And for that reason I . don’t want to do anything that deflects from the European election . campaign so I’m not going to stand in this by-election. 'I . want to focus the next three weeks on winning the European elections . and also I don’t have any links with the east Midlands; I would just . look like an opportunist and I don’t think that would work.' Later he appeared to admit part of the reason he did not stand was he did not think he would win. He told Sky News: 'I'm not sure electorally it would have worked anyway.' The seat went to Labour in 1997 during the first Tony Blair landslide but returned to the Tories in 2001. Last . night Mr Farage told the BBC that if he stood and won Mr Cameron would . 'have to resign' but if he lost Ukip would be finished: 'The bubble is . burst.' The Tories were quick to seize on Mr Farage's decision as proof he lacked the will to fight a difficult election. Asked on Sky News 'The question is have you bottled it?' Mr Farage replied: 'Yes.' Almost a third of people (32 per cent) think Ukip is a racist party and 38 per cent think they do not have sensible policies . Conservative . Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, who represents the neighbouring . Nottinghamshire seat of Rushcliffe, said Mr Farage had backed out . because he knew he could not win. 'I . am not really surprised. Whatever else Nigel is, he is not an idiot and . I don't think he'd have the faintest chance of winning in Newark,' Mr . Clarke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'I don't think Ukip will get anywhere in the by-election. 'I . don't think the residents of Newark - some of whom I know because I . used to represent some of the villages there - they're not going to vote . for a card who's larking about trying to get protest votes.'

"By . Mark Duell . Supermarket workers had a huge shock when they spotted a live scorpion inside a pack of bananas. The 3in-long venomous creature travelled more than 5,000 miles from Costa Rica to a village shop in Cornwall by stowing away among the fruit. Angela Parren, a sales assistant at Nisa Phoenix Stores in St Stephen-in-Brannel, spotted something moving as she restocked shelves. As she lent in for a closer look, the scorpion scuttled into view. Venomous: The scorpion which was found in a banana bag at the store in St Stephen-in-Brannel, Cornwall . Alive: Zookeepers soon identified the creature as a juvenile black edged scorpion from South America . The 51-year-old called for help and co-workers moved the pack to a store room before calling police and the RSPCA. They were urged to contact nearby Newquay Zoo who offered to give it a new home. Zookeepers soon identified the arachnid as a juvenile black-edged scorpion, known as centruroides limbatus. They are from South America - native to Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica. The species is not considered a major threat to humans but experts say a sting can still be extremely painful and in rare cases can leave people needing hospital treatment. Les Howell, owner of Nisa Phoenix Stores, said: ‘We didn't know what to do with it. It didn't seem right to kill it, so we phoned our wholesaler for advice. Scary: Assistant Angela Parren and owner Leslie Howell, from Nisa Phoenix Stores, who found the scorpion . Location: The incident happened at the Nisa Phoenix Stores (pictured) in St Stephen-in-Brannel, Cornwall . Centruroides limbatus, also known as black-edged scorpions, are often found in crevices near the ground. They are known to inhabit Honduras and Nicaragua, but are most commonly found in Costa Rica. The scorpions are known to frequent human dwellings with plenty of food and shelter. Experts say that although they are not considered hugely dangerous to humans, they are venomous and a sting would be painful. The species were first recorded by British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock in 1898. ‘They suggested we phone the police, who suggested the RSPCA, who suggested DEFRA (the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), who were closed for the Bank Holiday. ‘So we phoned Newquay Zoo and spoke to Gareth O'Dare, who is the Tropical House keeper. 'He suggested we take it out to the zoo, which we did after putting the whole bag of bananas inside a secure plastic box. ‘He told us that it was a juvenile black-edged scorpion which is native to Costa Rica where the bananas came from. 'Although a sting from its tail won't kill humans, it will still pack a punch.’ St Stephen-in-Brannel is six miles west of St Austell, with a population of more than 5,000. Last month a family was forced to flee their home and have it fumigated after finding hundreds of potentially deadly spiders - in a bunch of bananas. Shocked father Jamie Roberts, 31, of Hednesford, Staffordshire, spotted white patches covering pieces of the fruit from a OneStop shop after he put them in a bowl - but assumed this was mould. However, upon closer inspection, he realised the fruit was infested with a spider nest - and immediately rang pest controllers who advised his family to leave their home immediately. OneStop said that the type of spider had not yet been identified - and a sample of the arachnid had been sent to Natural History Museum experts for tests. It is not clear if these have been completed. A 29-year-old housewife found spiders on her Sainbsury’s bananas - suspected to be Brazilian wandering spiders, one of the world’s most venomous types, whose bite can kill within two hours. Consi Taylor and her husband Richard, 37, of Hampton, south-west London, had to spend three nights in a hotel last autumn with their children while their house was fumigated and deep-cleaned. She had taken the fruit from a £1 bunch of Colombian Fair Trade bananas bought in a Sainsbury’s, and eaten about half when she noticed the 0.1in-long dots that resembled mould or bruising. Sainsbury’s gave Mrs Taylor a £10 voucher when she returned the fruit. The store said it had ‘rigorous controls on imported products at all stages, which is why this is so rare’. Last June, a 42-year-old shopper picked up a bunch of supermarket bananas from his local Lidl and found a large tarantula hanging off. Mark Drinkwater said he was left with his 'heart beating through his chest' after discovering the spider, which he claimed was the size of his hand. The tarantula, thought to have come with the imported bananas from Colombia, was caught by shop staff in a box and put in a freezer at the back of the store in Sydenham, south-east London. And in 2008, a branch of Tesco in Chatham, Kent was forced to close after a terrified worker spotted a highly-venomous Brazilian Wandering Spider on a banana.","3in-long venomous creature travelled 5,000 miles from Costa Rica to UK .

"By . James Rush . Censored material, including drunkenness and sexual innuendo, removed from published stories by F Scott Fitzgerald has been restored in a new edition of the author's work. Passages in the writer's fourth collection of short stores, Taps at Reveille, were altered by editors before they were published during the late 1920s and early 1930s. The work, originally published in the Saturday Evening Post, had references to anti-semitic slurs, made by unpleasant characters, drug use and profanities removed in an effort not to offend readers. Censored material removed from short stories in F Scott Fitzgerald's (left) fourth collection Taps at Reveille (right) has been restored in a new edition of the author's work . Now, Cambridge University Press has restored the text to its original version following a study of drafts which feature revisions by Fitzgerald. According to The Guardian, the original published version of the story Two Wrongs edited out the use of a racial slur by one of the characters, while a scene which describes another character undressing was also altered so they were fully clothed. The latest uncensored versions of the stories were published by Cambridge University Press this week. The publisher's website states: 'Fitzgerald assembled the collection in a time of debt and personal difficulty, working with texts that had, in many cases, been censored by the Saturday Evening Post and other magazines. 'Using evidence from the drafts that bear Fitzgerald's final revisions, this edition presents for the first time restored texts of the stories, with censored material reinstated and sexual innuendo as Fitzgerald originally intended.' Fitzgerald is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century. Fitzgerald is widely regarded to be one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century .

A film version of one of his best-known works, The Great Gatsby, starring Leonardo DiCaprio was released last year, taking in more than $50m in its opening weekend. Although it is now regarded as one of the greatest American novels ever written, the book only sold 20,000 copies on its 1925 release, netting Fitzgerald a meagre $2,000. It only became a hit following Fitzgerald's death in 1940. The Great Gatsby tells the story of mysterious American millionaire Jay Gatsby, played by DiCaprio in the Â£105 million film, in the prosperous Roaring Twenties era. The story is told by Nick Carroway (Tobey Maguire in the movie), a neighbour of Gatsby, and revolves around Gatsby's love for Daisy Buchanan (Carey Mulligan). It is noted for its accurate portrayal of the decadence and social upheaval of 1920s America.","Original published version of Taps at Reveille had been altered by editors .

"By . Sam Webb . The chances of a ewe giving birth to five lambs is a million to one but brothers Robert and Andrew Mackintosh have beaten the odds for the second year in a row. A ewe at their farm in Glengolly in the Highlands gave birth to the rare set of quintuplets last week and both mother and babies are doing well. Andrew, 41, who helped make the special delivery, said he was stunned to see five lambs pop out - especially after another of their ewes gave birth to quintuplets during the lambing season last year. Against the odds: This ewe at a farm in the Scottish Highlands had five normal-sized healthy offspring -  a million-to-one chance . Gimme five: Now fit, strong and healthy, these quintuplets, pictured with their mother, are enjoying life in the Highlands . And despite the unusual pregnancy he said the labour was one of the easiest there has been at the farm this year. 'Despite the ewe giving birth to five lambs, it was a straightforward labour,' he said. 'The lambs came out of the mother one straight after the other without any difficulty. There were also no health problems with any of the lambs and, despite being quintuplets, they are all regular size. 'You rarely see a ewe giving birth to quadruplets, so to have it happen second year running is a complete surprise.' Last year, Andrew and Robert, 46 allowed all five lambs to stay with their mother, a cross Lleyn breed, for two days before the brothers gave two of them to other ewes, to give the lambs a better chance of growing up stronger. Simple: The birth was surprisingly straightforward, according to the farmer. Pictured with the five lambs are (left to right) James, Ally and John Mackintosh . Huddled together in the arms of a farmer, the five brothers and sisters ar pictured before two of them were given to another ewe to improve their chance of growing up stronger . 'They were kept together for a couple of days but it wouldn't be fair on the ewe or the five lambs to be all kept together,' said Andrew. 'It would put too much pressure on the ewe and the lambs would not get the milk they required. 'To relieve stress on the mother, two of the five lambs were given to other ewes and it has worked great for all of them.' The brothers, who began their lambing season on April 13, have so far seen 680 ewes give birth, with just another 40 to go. As well as attending to expectant ewes, Andrew and Robert are also in the process of calving. After spending several days inside the barn, all five lambs have now been put out to graze. Bounding along in the green fields of the Highlands behind their proud mother, the lambs have all now been put out to pasture.","Ewe at farm in Highlands had five healthy, normal sized lambs - a rarity .

"By . Becky Barrow . and Rob Davies . A city firm that was paid £1.5million to advise the Government on the sale of Royal Mail also made a fortune for its clients from selling shares in the postal giant, it emerged yesterday. The controversial stock market float made billions for investors but left taxpayers £750million out of pocket on the first day of trading. Now it has been revealed that while one branch of firm Lazard advised on the sale, another arm of the same company made millions selling the shares. Prime Minister David Cameron repeatedly insisted the sell-off had been a success but Labour leader said the deals with hedge funds mean the privatisation  'stinks' Lazard . Limited is the parent company of Lazard & Co, which was one of the . companies to advise the Government, and Lazard Asset Management, which . bought and sold the shares. LAM . was given a special allocation of six million shares in Royal Mail as a . ‘priority’ investor. By comparison, ordinary investors were typically . given just £750 each, while anybody who applied for more than £10,000 of . shares was given nothing. LAM . bought and sold them all within days and made an instant profit of . £8million for its clients – making a mockery of Business Secretary Vince . Cable’s insistence that Royal Mail shares should only be sold to . long-term, stable investors. During . a heated grilling by MPs, Lazard insisted that the two arms of the . company were ring-fenced. But MPs said its involvement in both aspects . of the sale  was ‘inappropriate’. Senior Liberal Democrat minister Vince Cable has faced calls to resign over his handling of the Royal Mail privatisation - but has insisted he has nothing to apologise for . Speaker John Bercow tried to humiliate David Cameron in the Commons today by cutting him off mid-sentence. During raucous exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was shouted down by Labour MPs. As the PM tried to attack Labour's criticism of the Royal Mail sell-off, Mr Bercow stood to intervene. Mr Cameron remarked: 'I've not finished.' But smiling broadly, Mr Bercow hit back: 'The Prime Minister has finished and he can take it from me he has finished.' The slapdown marks a new low in the relationship between Mr Cameron and Mr Bercow, who was a Tory MP before becoming Speaker. For . the past six months, the Government has refused to reveal the name of . the 16 ‘priority’ investors, insisting the information was confidential. But Mr Cable broke his silence yesterday and published the list, saying . it was in the public interest. Other . top investors include sovereign wealth funds, such as the Abu Dhabi . Investment Authority, and the Soros fund, run by billionaire investor . George Soros. Lansdowne . Partners, the hedge fund whose former chief executive Sir Paul Ruddock . is a large donor to the Conservative Party, was another big winner. Alan . Custis, a managing director at LAM, told MPs on the Public Accounts . Committee that it had set a ‘price target’ for the shares of £3.95. They . were floated at £3.30, a price which Lazard & Co had advised the . Government was the maximum price which City investors were prepared to . pay. Mr Custis said the decision had been made to sell the shares when the price reached £4.70 within the first few days of trading. Mr . Custis told MPs: ‘We had a price target. The share price went beyond . the price target and, yes, we did sell on behalf of the clients of . Lazards. On behalf of the clients we made approximately £8million.’ He added that the profit for LAM itself was only around £40,000. Business Secretary Vince Cable has come under fire from all sides over his handling of the controversial Royal Mail sell-off . William . Rucker, chief executive of Lazard & Co, said: ‘When we became . aware, having been hired, that Lazard Asset Management were on a list of . investors the Royal Mail were talking to, we made it quite clear that . we should have no input whatsoever into any discussions about . allocations for LAM. ‘The Chinese wall is complete and utter. We have had no contact throughout.’ Labour . MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said the situation was . ‘just inappropriate’, and said the finance world was like an . ‘institutional masonic lodge’. Despite . strict ring-fencing systems in place, known as Chinese walls, she said: . ‘It just feels wrong’, adding: ‘It ends up with too cosy a relationship . and what then  happened was this little group of very high asset . management [firms] made a killing at the expense of the ordinary . taxpayer who lost out to the tune on day one  of £750million.’ Yesterday .

"By . Rob Davies, City Correspondent . Over-50s’ group Saga is ready for a mass scramble to buy shares in its stock market float, after one in three of its customers said they want to invest. Saga, which specialises in insurance, holidays and home healthcare, is giving customers and employees priority in the rush to buy stock in a deal set to value the business at £3billion in total. Investors will also receive one free share for every 20 they buy, so those who buy £1,000 of shares will get £50 worth at no extra cost. The over-50s group specialises in insurance and holidsy. Pictued is the company's cruise ship, the Saga Sapphire . The float could prove even more popular than the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail, after more than 700,000 of Saga’s 2.1million customers, or one in three, expressed an interest in buying shares. Customers will have to sign up for a minimum £1,000 of stock to be eligible, while 20,000 employees can apply for a minimum of £500. That suggests Saga could face a clamour for £710million of stock, far out-stripping the £550million that it plans to sell. If demand exceeds supply, customers and staff will get less than they applied for because a portion of shares will be reserved for ordinary investors and financial institutions in the City of London. But sources close to the deal said executive chairman Andrew Goodsell was determined that big City firms would not snap up shares at the expense of private individuals. Sir Andrew Goodsell, executive chairman of Saga executive chairman Andrew Goodsell, who it is said wanted private individuals the chance to snap up shares . The Government’s float of the Royal Mail was heavily criticised over the amount of shares earmarked for City firms, which sold them for a quick profit while thousands of small investors missed out. Saga, which began life as a small hotel in Folkestone, Kent, said ensuring that its customers get shares was part of the company’s ethos. For customers to be eligible for priority status, they have to have bought a product from Saga within a certain timeframe. ‘Our customers are at the heart of our brand and I am delighted that they will have an opportunity to become shareholders in the company and to be part of the next stage of our journey,’ said executive chairman Andrew Goodsell. Anyone who has bought a financial product, a Saga magazine subscription or a private healthcare between January 5, 2013, and yesterday will be eligible. Those who booked a Saga or Titan holiday or cruise, including anyone who travelled with them, will be eligible as long as they booked between January 5, 2011, and yesterday. Saga is being sold by private equity groups CVC, Permira and Charterhouse. The trio bought Saga for £1.3billion in 2004 and later merged it with the AA breakdown firm in a combined group called Acromas. Acromas restructured the two companies last year to ensure their finances were entirely separate.Mr Goodsell owns a 7 per cent stake in the Saga, which is set to be worth £154million based on the company’s intention to sell 25 per cent of itself for £550million. Saga is being sold by private equity groups CVC, Permira and Charterhouse. The trio bought Saga for £1.3billion in 2004 . The Saga float marks the next chapter in the 60-year history of a company that began life as a guesthouse for retired holidaymakers in Folkestone. It has since expanded into areas including insurance, financial services, holidays and home care, all for the over-50s. It said it would use the £550million it raises to bring its debts down to £700million. Once the float is complete, it is expected to focus on building its financial services offering, in the light of government changes to the pension industry. This is expected to lead to a slump in annuity sales, but huge growth in other products that allow pensioners to invest their money in the stock market and elsewhere. Saga hopes to benefit from this, as well as the ageing demographic of the UK.","Saga is giving customers and employees priority in rush for shares .

"By . Jason Groves . Former Tory MP Patrick Mercer said he was 'ashamed' as he announced he was to quit Parliament. David Cameron faces the prospect of a nightmare  by-election showdown with Nigel Farage after shamed Tory MP Patrick Mercer quit last night. The former Tory frontbencher said he would step down immediately after a sleaze inquiry ruled he should be suspended from Parliament for six months over his involvement in a lobbying scandal. His decision will spark a Tory showdown with Ukip this summer in what is normally a safe Conservative seat in Newark, Nottinghamshire. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said last night he would ‘seriously’ consider standing himself, despite facing a Conservative majority of more than 16,000. The seat went to Labour in 1997 during the first Tony Blair landslide but returned to the Tories in 2001. Local Tories scotched suggestions of Boris Johnson being selected, saying they had already chosen businessman Robert Jenrick to fight the seat. It is unlikely that a by-election would be held before next month’s European elections. Senior Conservatives privately urged Mr Mercer to serve out his term as MP rather than sparking a damaging by-election. But the bitter personal enmity between Mr Mercer and Mr Cameron meant their pleas fell on deaf ears. In a statement last night, Mr Mercer said he was ‘ashamed’ of his behaviour. The former Army colonel said that as an ex-soldier he believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to it. He added: ‘No point in shilly- shallying or trying to avoid it. What has happened has happened, I’m ashamed of it. Therefore, I’m going to do what I can to put it right . . . I’m going to resign my seat.’ Former Tory MP Patrick Mercer speaks outside the House of Commons, London, as he announces his resignation . Tory MP Patrick Mercer faces being kicked out of the Commons for six months . Mr Mercer resigned the Conservative . whip last year after he was caught in a lobbying sting. He was filmed . agreeing a £2,000-a-month contract to represent undercover reporters . posing as lobbyists representing businesses seeking to end Fiji’s . suspension from the Commonwealth. Patrick Mercer spent 25 years as an . army officer with the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters, serving in . Northern Ireland, Uganda, Bosnia and Canada. As . the youngest colonel since the Second World War he left the army in . 1999 and soon after joined BBC Radio 4's Today programme as their . defence reporter. He was . elected as Tory MP for Newark in 2001, and served on the frontbench . under Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Howard and David Cameron. But he was sacked by Mr Cameron in 2007 for an interview in which he suggested that being called a . 'black b*****d' was a normal part of army life. He also claimed to have met a lot of 'idle and useless' soldiers from ethnic minorities. Since then, Mr Mercer has been an outspoken critic of the Tory leader. In 2011 he was reported to have called Mr Cameron 'an a***' and 'a despicable creature without any real redeeming features'. A recording obtained by The People . newspaper suggested he also said of the PM: 'I’ve never, ever come . across anyone less suited to the job in my life. I would take a beggar . off the streets and put him in that position rather than have Cameron. I . loathe him.' However, Mr Mercer denied the veracity of the account and accused the newspaper of subterfuge. He is said to have tabled five . parliamentary questions and a Commons motion on behalf of the bogus . lobbyists after they paid him £4,000. He . was caught on film telling them: ‘I do not charge a great deal of money . for these things. I would normally come out at £500 per half day,  so . £1,000 a day.’ A Standards . Committee on Mr Mercer’s case is due to report tomorrow. But its . conclusion that he should face a six-month ban from Parliament leaked to . the media last night. Mr Mercer was once seen as a rising star of the . Conservative Party, but had a catastrophic falling out with Mr Cameron . The . Tory leader fired him as shadow homeland security minister in 2007 . after he was reported saying he had met a lot of ‘idle and useless’ ethnic minority soldiers during his Army career and he claimed that . racism was ‘part and parcel’ of Army life. The . sacking created a lasting enemy on the Tory benches. In 2011 Mr Mercer . reportedly described the Prime Minister as a ‘despicable creature’. His . decision to force a by-election is viewed by some in Tory central office . as a final act of spite. In . recent years, the main parties have called by-elections as quickly as . possible to prevent Ukip having time to gather momentum. But . last night Tory sources confirmed the by-election could not be held on . the same day as the European Parliament elections on May 22. The . earliest it can be held is May 29, but it could well slip into June. The . timing means the Tories will now have to fight the contest in the wake . of the European elections, in which they are widely expected to trail . behind Ukip. Last night, a . Ukip source said: ‘We are watching the situation with very close . attention. If there is a by-election very soon after the European . elections it would be a big deal, particularly if Ukip has given the . Tories a bloody nose.

"By . James Rush . Spanish police have arrested a man for allegedly throwing a banana at Barcelona defender Dani Alves during a football match at the weekend. The arrest comes as it was revealed the anti-racism campaign which followed Alves picking the banana up and eating it had been planned by footballers before the racist abuse even took place. So common is racial abuse for black footballers in Spain, players had agreed one of them would pick up and eat the next banana thrown at them during a match. Brazilian international Alves just happened to be the first victim - and ate the banana during the match at Villarreal on Sunday. His actions were backed by footballers . and celebrities across the world as support flooded in from fellow . professionals posting pictures of themselves with bananas on to the . internet. Scroll down for video . A 26-year-old man has been arrested after a banana was thrown at Barcelona defender Dani Alves . The banana was thrown during a football match at Villarreal on Sunday . The Brazilian international made headlines after he picked up the banana and ate it . Police confirmed 26-year-old David Campayo Lleo was arrested, with Spanish media reporting he had been fired from his role on the coaching staff of one of the club's youth teams. Villarreal would not confirm nor deny the reports about Campayo Lleo's role with the club when questioned about their authenticity by The Associated Press. Villarreal has banned Campayo Lleo from the team's El Madrigal Stadium for life. Campayo Lleo faces up to three years in prison if found guilty of charges related to racist provocation. The news comes as Spanish newspaper AS reported the anti-racism campaign had been planned after Alves and teammate Neymar had been abused at Espanyol in March. According to the report, the pair contacted marketing firm Loducca following the earlier incident. The anti-racism campaign which followed Alves (left) picking the banana up and eating it had been planned by the footballer and his teammate Neymar (right) after they were racially abused in March, according to reports . Guga Ketzer, partner at the marketing company, told AS: 'The idea was for Neymar to eat the banana, but in the end it was Alves, and that works just the same. 'The best way to beat prejudice is to take the sting out of the racist action so it isnâ€™t repeated. 'We created #somostodosmacacos and #weareallmonkeys, with the gesture of eating a banana, and it has been turned into a movement.' Alves meanwhile has hit out at Spain . for being 'very backward' in its approach towards racism and believes . the fan who hurled a banana on the pitch should be publicly shamed. 'If I could, I would put a photo of the fan on the internet so that he would be shamed,' Alves told Brazil's Radio Globo. Sergio Aguero and Marta show their support for Alves by eating bananas . Italian premier Matteo Renzi, left, and Italian national football team coach Cesare Prandelli share a banana in solidarity with Alves . 'There is racism against foreigners. They sell the country as being first world but in certain things they are very backward.' Alves admitted he did not expect his actions to receive so much attention. 'I have been surprised by everyone's support. I did it without thinking. The world has evolved and we must evolve with it.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter was among those who backed the player and tweeted that racism cannot be tolerated. Alves said that the world governing body should be more proactive. 'FIFA must concentrate on things more important than La Masia. They need to give their attention to more serious things,' he said, referring to the recent verdict that Barcelona were guilty of breaching regulations over the transfer of underage players.","Banana was thrown at Barcelona's Dani Alves during match at Villarreal .

"By . Emma Glanfield . A heartbroken grandmother has relived the moment a train ploughed into her car on a level crossing killing her four-year-old granddaughter after she missed warning lights which were ‘invisible’ in the sun. Diane Jarrett, 67, told an inquest that warning lights and a crossing barrier were ‘invisible’ as bright sun reflected off a wet road as she approached the crossing in Doncaster, South Yorkshire. Her granddaughter Emma Lifsey, who was a passenger in the Volvo Estate, died in hospital from her injuries after the train ploughed into the vehicle at the Beech Hill level crossing in Misson Springs, near Finningley, on December 4, 2012. Emma Lifsey, who was a passenger in the Volvo Estate, died in hospital from her injuries after the train ploughed into the vehicle at the Beech Hill level crossing in Misson Springs, Doncaster, on December 4, 2012 . Mrs Jarrett, who had just collected the youngster from pre-school in nearby Haxley, told the inquest in Nottinghamshire that she had been driving for 50 years and had travelled down the road hundreds of times. She said: ‘I didn’t see the lights or the barrier until it was too late. It was like they were invisible to me as I drove along that road.’ An East Midlands train travelling to Doncaster hit the car at 60mph, the inquest jury was told. Although Emma was taken to a specialist unit at Sheffield Children's Hospital by air ambulance, she died from her injuries later that night. Mrs Jarrett suffered severe neck injuries and was treated at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. No one on the train was hurt. Witness Catherine Hart, who was driving behind Mrs Jarrett at the time, told the inquest the horror crash ‘looked like a bomb had exploded’. An East Midlands train travelling to Doncaster hit the car at 60mph, the inquest jury was told. Although Emma, pictured, was taken to Sheffield Children's Hospital by air ambulance, she died from her injuries . She said: ‘It was very wet on the ground and very sunny. ‘The sun was reflecting off the floor which made it even worse, you couldn’t actually see the lights unless you dipped your head down under the visor. ‘I saw the barrier was down and the lights and that’s when the car in front’s brake lights came on. ‘I stopped my car and that’s when the train came and hit the car. From what I saw I didn’t think there’d be anything left. It was like a bomb had exploded.’ The driver of the train, Antony Rushby, also told of his shock at the incident. He said: ‘I became aware of an almighty crashing noise as I went over the crossing, I had no idea what the train had hit and I had no time to apply my brakes.’ The inquest at Nottinghamshire Coroner’s Court was told that the lights on the crossing were working as they should have but the sun would affect how well people could see them. The horror rail crash occurred at the Beech Hill level crossing, pictured, in Misson Springs, near Finningley, Doncaster, on December 4, 2012 . A year-long investigation was launched following the crash and a report of the findings presented to the government ruled the road traffic signals - known as wig-wags - were well below the specified brightness. The report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) stated the weather was sunny at the time of the lunchtime collision but there had been rain showers earlier and the road surface was wet, leading to glare from the low winter sun. The RAIB also said a method should be devised to assess the risk of a bright background and glare obscuring wig-wag signals. A statement from Emma’s parents Mark and Zoe Lifsey, 40 and 38, of Haxey, Lincolnshire, was read out at the inquest by her grandfather Peter Jarrett which described the ‘gaping hole’ the youngster’s death had left in their lives. A year-long investigation was launched following the crash and a report of the findings presented to the government ruled the road traffic signals - known as wig-wags - were well below the specified brightness . Speaking after the accident, they said: 'Emma meant the world to us. She was our much-loved daughter and a baby sister to her 11-year-old brother Jack. 'We are still trying to come to terms with the terrible incident on Tuesday afternoon and there are no words that can properly express how utterly distraught we are. 'We would like to thank everyone for the many messages of sympathy and support we have received. 'As you can appreciate, this tragic incident has left us shocked and devastated.’ The hearing continues.","Emma Lifsey, four, died after a train travelling at 60mph hit the Volvo Estate .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith . CLICK HERE to read the full match report from the Allianz Arena. As Real Madrid stepped to within touching distance of an elusive tenth European Cup following their 4-0 destruction of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena, two former Tottenham stars played their part. Defender Sergio Ramos may have embarrassed Real's expensively assembled array of forwards with two superbly taken headed goals before Cristiano Ronaldo set a Champions League record of 16 goals (and counting) this season - but Bale and Modric's contribution cannot be overlooked. Although the Welshman may be the world's most expensive player and went some way to attaining cult status with his winning goal in the Copa del Rey final, Modric is still regarded with more affection by the Madrid faithful - his is one of the few names chanted at the Bernabeu. Scroll down for video... Spurs connection: Gareth bale (L) and Luka Modric (R) celebrate as Real Madrid beat Bayern Munich 4-0 . Blazed over: Gareth Bale was guilty of missing an open goal after Manuel Neuer found himself out of position . Hot Spurs: Both Bale (L) and Modric moved from White Hart Lane to the Bernabeu in big money deals . Man in the middle: Luka Modric (R) pulled the strings from Real Madrid's central midfield . Will Real Madrid win the Champions League final? And, while Bale had missed a glorious opportunity to score the opener after Bayern goalkeeper found himself horribly out of position on five minutes, it was Modric who made his presence felt for the first goal. The Croatian's perfectly whipped corner was met with a bullet header from Ramos to ease Spanish nerves after only 16minutes and Carlo Ancelotti's side rarely looked back, despite conceding the lion's share of possession to the Germans. Not to be outdone, Bale was instrumental in real's third goal when he turned on the after-burners to speed through the centre of Bayern's midfield before sliding a pass to his teammate and general object of affection Ronaldo to slot home. Luka who's talking: Modric corner led to Real Madrid's first goal - met with a bullet header from Sergio Ramos . Rear guard: Defender Sergio Ramos puts Real's attackers to shame with two superbly taken headed goals . After burners: Bale used his blistering pace to surge through midfield before passing to Cristiano Ronaldo to finish . Portugeezer! Cristiano Ronaldo broke Lionel Messi's record by scoring 16 goals in a Champions League season . While Bale was largely used as a left-sided winger, before his talent took him to a more central position, at White Hart Lane - he was predominantly employed on the right flank against Bayern Munich. This was no doubt to accommodate Ronaldo's preferred method of cutting in from the opposite side, but Bale stuck diligently to his task and controlled the right side of the pitch while also using his energy to track back in defence. All right on the night: Gareth Bale stuck to the right flank diligently and was able to both attack and defend . Heat Map: Luka Modric . Meanwhile, Luka Modric played in a deep lying playmaking position that will be familiar to most Spurs fans. In a similar way that Steven Gerrard has been dictating the play for Liverpool this season, Modric was able to orchestrate events without his relative lack of pace being a hindrance. And, as this heat map shows, he was able to station himself at the heart of Real's midfield while occasionally finding space in important forward areas with his intelligent movement. Pass masters: Pep Guardiola's Bayern dominated possession against Real's counter-attacking side . Hoof it: Bayern hot more than twice as many passes - whereas the Spaniards played more long balls . In terms of general play, the newly crowned Champions League favourites managed to complete a four-goal rout away from home despite having only 30.7 per cent of possession against a Bayern side educated by Pep Guardiola. Bayern made 656 passes, more than twice as many as Ronaldo and Co's 287 - and showed more accuracy than their Spanish counterparts. Madrid did hit more long passes, an obvious reflection of Real's counter attacking tendencies learned under Jose Mourinho, but while Bayern had more total shots (19 compared to 13) and corners (nine compared to three) than their opponents - they still failed to register a single goal on the scoresheet. Real's defence obviously played an important part, but the likes of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery were wasteful too - with a shooting accuracy of only 36.4 per cent. Shooting blanks: Bayern led the way in terms of total shots but Real's four goals are the only attacking statistics that matter .","Real Madrid beat Bayern Munich to reach the Champions League final .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Homes bearing the tag of Crescent in their address have topped a list of the most expensive addresses in the capital, new research revealed today. The historically grand postcodes, home to the likes of Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich, cost on average £2,103 per sq/ft in London. It means a typical Crescent home in London, spread across 2,000sq/ft will cost £4.2million - 25 times the average price of a home sold in England and Wales. And it is 40 per cent higher than the prime London average, which currently stands at £1,503sq/ft. A new study has found that Crescents in London top the list of the capital's most expensive addresses. A house recently sold on Wilton Crescent, in Belgravia (pictured) for £32million . Squares, like Grosvenor Square (pictured) secured second spot costing on average £1,807 per sq/ft . In third place addresses bearing the name Mews - which were originally stables or coach houses for servants - claimed third place, costing around £1,705sq/ft. Pictured is Brooks Mews in Westminster . Of the capital's Crescents, the most expensive are Wilton in Belgravia, Hans in Knightsbridge and Pelham in South Kensington - with one home recently selling in Wilton Crescent for a staggering £32million. Homes located on Squares are the second most expensive, costing £1,807sq/ft, with mews houses - which were originally stables and coach houses for servants - taking third spot at £1,705sq/ft. Row and Place costing £1,696sq/ft and £1,651sq/ft respectively, complete the top five. Residents in Gates, Terraces, Walks and Gardens all find themselves above the average London price of £1,503 sq/ft. But those living on a Road take bottom spot - coming in at £1,236 per sq/ft. The second lowest is Grove, with Court, Street and Avenue making up the bottom five. Homes in Rows, similar to Chester Row, Belgravia (pictured), were found to be the fourth most expensive, in the study by estate agents Wetherell . Addresses like Lancaster Gate in Bayswater (left) are worth on average £1,613 per sq/ft while Lancashire Court (right) costs around £1,420sq/ft . Crescent - £2,103 per sq/ft . Square - £1,807 .

Road - £1,236 . This is according to research by estate . agency Wetherell, which analysed 12 months of sales across prime central . London, one of the world's most expensive place to live. In total, 2,400 properties were sold during that period, with an average sales price of £1,503 per sq/ft. Peter Wetherell, managing director of Wetherell, said: 'London's best addresses consolidate their power and value by having the in-built advantage of being dominated by 'sexy address' names. 'Mayfair, for example, has no Roads but lots of attractive squares, places and mews. 'The centre of the capital is dominated by grand crescents, big terraced houses and lovely leafy squares where the wealthy choose to live. 'A report produced under the auspices of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales recently called for planners, architects and developers to focus on designing and delivering more high quality housing based around human-scale Georgian and Victorian era style crescents, squares and parks. 'This call is totally in tune with the findings of our research which indicate that crescents and squares and homes designed around parks and greenery have an enduring asset value and are where people aspire to live.' Wilton Crescent in London's Belgravia is the most expensive address in the capital, according to new research by Wetherell estate agents . The three most expensive Crescents in London are Wilton in Belgravia, Hans in Knightsbridge and Pelham in South Kensington . One home in Wilton Crescent recently sold for a staggering £32million. Wilton Crescent was created by Thomas Cundy II, the Grosvenor family Estate surveyor, and was drawn up with the original 1821 Wyatt plan for Belgravia. It is named after the 2nd Earl of Wilton, second son of the 1st Marquess of Westminster. The street was built in 1825 by William Howard Seth-Smith. In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was home to many prominent British politicians, ambassadors and civil servants. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma (1900–1979) lived at 2 Wilton Crescent for many years. Today, there is a blue plaque on the house marking it. Like much of Belgravia, Wilton Crescent is characterised by grand terraces with lavish white houses which are built in a crescent shape, many of them with stuccoed balconies, particularly on the southern part of the crescent. The houses to the north of the crescent are stone clad, and five stories high, and were refaced between 1908 and 1912. Most of the houses had originally been built in the stucco style, but such houses became stone clad during this renovation period. Other houses today have black iron balconies. Hans Crescent, nestled behind Harrods in Knightsbridge, is the second most expensive crescent in London . A short walk across Sloane Street and nestled behind Harrods is the second most expensive address in London - Hans Crescent, in Knightsbridge. Further south, Pelham Crescent in South Kensington is the third most expensive of the capital's Crescents. The circa 1825 Georgian crescent was designed by architect George Basevi, and numbers 1 to 14 and 15 to 27 are separately Grade II* listed.","Homes in London's Crescents are worth an average of £2,103 per sq/ft .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It was the incident that helped convince the Americans to enter the First World War. But 70 years after RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-boat, it has been revealed civil servants were worried that rumours she was carrying explosives were true and would ‘blow up on us, literally’. After salvage companies applied to raise the Cunard liner, the Government issued panicked warnings about danger to life, according to National Archives documents. The liner Lusitania moored in the Mersey, Christmas 1911. 70 years after RMS Lusitania was sunk by a German U-boat, civil servants are worried that rumours she was carrying explosives were true and would 'blow up on us, literally' The sinking of the Lusitania on May 7 1915 with the loss of 1,198 lives - 124 of them American - as she neared the end of her run from New York to Liverpool was one of the pivotal events of the war . The sinking of the British passenger ship off Ireland in 1915 – which resulted in the loss of 1,198 lives, 124 of them American – helped swing public opinion in the previously neutral US, which soon entered the war. Germany claimed she contained explosives and Britain eventually admitted that there were 5,000 cases of small ammunition in the cargo. Conspiracy theories abounded that there had been a second explosion on the ship, prompting salvage firms to go in search of the haul. Panicked civil servants wrote that the salvage could prove disastrous if there were explosives in the debris. NH Marshall in the Foreign Office’s North American department wrote in the 1980s: ‘There is a large amount of ammunition in the wreck, some of which is highly dangerous.’ The MoD searched its records but found no reference to any other munitions in the cargo. Britain did eventually did disclose that there had been 5,000 cases of small arms ammunition among the cargo - however rumours continued to circulate that she was also carrying dangerous high explosives which contributed to the final disaster . The sinking of the Lusitania on May 7 1915 with the loss of 1,198 lives - 124 of them American - as she neared the end of her run from New York to Liverpool was one of the pivotal events of the war. It helped swing popular opinion in the hitherto resolutely neutral United States against Germany - paving the way for America's entry into the conflict two years later on the side of Britain and France. But while British propagandists exploited the attack on unarmed civilians, Germany insisted its action was justified on the grounds the ship was known to be carrying 'large quantities of war material'. Britain did eventually did disclose that there had been 5,000 cases of small arms ammunition among the cargo - however rumours continued to circulate that she was also carrying dangerous high explosives which contributed to the final disaster. It was said that the explosives had caused a massive secondary explosion after she was hit by the German torpedo, causing the 790ft Lusitania to sink rapidly before most of those on board had a chance to escape. Those old claims came back to haunt Whitehall when, in 1982, a salvage company announced that it was planning to survey the wreck. Papers released by the National Archives at Kew, west London, show how officials feared it could all 'blow up on us' if there were indeed explosives lurking among the debris.","Civil servants were worried rumours she was carrying .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A 32-year-old has been arrested after leading police on an extraordinary chase which began when he crashed his car then tried to outrun an officer on foot. Dramatic footage of the arrest west of Brisbane, Australia, shows the suspect trying to grab Sgt Tony Harm's gun as he is apprehended. But the policeman managed to reach his pepper spray, squirting it in the fugitive's face, forcing him to the ground and making the arrest. Scroll down for video . While being arrested, a suspect reaches for a policeman's gun, but the officer gets his pepper spray first . Speaking to Channel 9 news, Sergeant Harm said: 'He went for my service firearm there a couple of times. 'I deployed some OC (capsicum) spray and then a Taser thereafter and was luckily able to subdue him. It was a bit of a worry, but you sort of judge the risks and go from there. 'We got him off the streets and he was a bit of a dangerous sort of character to be carrying on like that, racing around at those speeds, so itâ€™s certainly good to get him in custody.' The pursuit began at around 10.10am as the alleged criminal sped along in a silver Commodore car. The car is believed to have been stolen, and was also thought to have be carrying a stolen bike in the back. The . determined driver managed to evade officers for nearly half an hour, . but was eventually brought to a standstill after being hit with stinger . spikes, bursting the vehicle's tyres. The man then crashed the truck into a ditch before climbing out and fleeing on foot. The man then runs across several fields before he is eventually tackled by an officer while trying to get underneath a wire fence. The policeman wrestles with the suspect, who then tries to grab the pistol strapped to his belt. The drama started when the man was spotted speeding along in a truck, which is believed to have been stolen. He evaded cops for half an hour before being hit with police stinger spikes .

"By . Wills Robinson . The fiance of an architect who died trying to rescue him from their burning flat said she had a 'big heart' and always put the 'lives of others before her own'. Sophie Rosser, 23, was coming home from a party in Chelsea when she noticed smoke pouring from the block of apartments. Fearing her partner Oscar Silva, 28, was trapped inside by the flames, she ran into the property in the Isle of Dogs, East London, in a bid to save him. Heartbroken: Oscar Silva, said his fiance Sophie Rosser, 23, 'put the lives of others before her own'. She died running into her burning East London flat, believing he was inside . But Mr Silva had escaped to the safety of the balcony and had to watch as paramedics battled to save his girlfriend, who had collapsed in the smoke. Cardiff-born Miss Rosser died from her burns in the Royal London Hospital later that day. Today Mr Silva broke down in tears as he spoke outside Poplar Coroners Court. Speaking after her inquest and clutching Miss Rosser's tearful mother Michelle for support, he said: 'She was a person with a big heart. 'She put the life of others before her own. Unfortunately that is how people of her kind act.' But he was too overcome with emotion to say anything else. Today, . coroner Mary Hassell criticised a catalogue of fire safety failures at . the apartment block, but ruled the 23-year-old's death was an accident. Tragic: Cardiff-born Miss Rosser died from her burns in the Royal London Hospital later that day after the fire at a property in the Isle of Dogs . She said the young architect was driven by love when she ran into the burning building in a 'understandable and very human' bid to rescue her boyfriend. But she did what nobody but the fire brigade should do, and paid the price with her life, the coroner said. Delivering her conclusions, Ms Hassell said: 'Sophie's partner was trapped on the floor above and, Sophie returning from a night out, saw the fire and realised what it was. 'And in an effort to help him she did what nobody should do except the fire brigade, and entered a burning building. 'She . did so because she was desperate to try to effect a rescue. But her . actions meant that it was she who had to be rescued, and led to the loss . of her life. 'It is very easy for us now to say Sophie should never have gone into that building, and of course she never should have. 'But . that is a much easier thing to say after the event, and not in the . moment when you are in a complete panic about your loved one. Person with a big heart: The fatal blaze was sparked by a damp towel being left on a wall light in a fourth floor apartment at Meridian Place . 'Just because it is something she shouldn't have done doesn't mean to say it is not something very understandable and very human.' The fatal blaze was sparked by a damp towel being left on a wall light in a fourth floor flat at Meridian Place on the Isle of Dogs, east London, in the early hours of August 26, 2012. Ms Hassell said the fire quickly spread because the apartment's self-closing fire door was damaged and got stuck on the floor. In the confusion of the thick black smoke, Miss Rosser went to the fourth floor - the floor below her own flat on the fifth - where the fire was raging and was overcome by the powerful flames. She quickly fell unconscious and died in hospital later that day from her burns. The coroner hit out at a string of failures in the fire safety of the block of flats - which she said was partly to blame for the tragedy. Selfless: Outside Poplar Coroner's Court, Mr Silva said: 'Unfortunately, that is how people of her kind act'. He then was too overcome with emotion to continue speaking about the death of his fiance . And she said Miss Rosser's death could have been avoided if the self-closing fire door was functioning as it should have been. She said she had 'considered very, very carefully the potential contribution to this sad story of the building itself and the procedures in place to deal with fire,' She added: 'If the door to flat 101 had been shut the fire would have been very significantly contained until the fire brigade arrived. 'And I think it would have allowed all the occupants to have made good their escape. 'The fire brigade came quickly. The fire door was a good one and it would have kept the fire back.' Safety: The coroner revealed there had been just one fire risk assessment carried out in 15 years at Meridian Place in Marsh Wall, East London . The inquest heard claims the tenant had complained about the door, but it had not been fixed. And . the smoke detectors were never tested by housing firm Komoto Group, . which own many of the properties in the block, and have only been tested . once since the fire. Just one fire risk assessment had been carried out in the 15 years from when the block was built in 1997 until the 2012 fire. And the inquest heard that a fire ventilation shaft that should have funnelled the smoke out of the building was too small. The coroner said the doors of the ventilation shaft did not open on the fourth floor, and the hallway had no windows and 'was not properly ventilated'. But she said these other safety failures did not contribute to Miss Rosser's death. Couple: The coroner ruled there had been safety failings in the flat, but ruled the death as an accident . She added: 'The one thing that would have made the world of difference, other than the fire not being started in the first place, is if the door to flat 101 (where the fire broke out) had been closed.' The coroner said she had considered making a prevention of future deaths report by writing to the authorities with recommendations for safety improvements. But she ruled this out because she could not think of a concrete recommendation she should make that would 'prevent a tragedy for the future'. Turning to Miss Rosser's tearful loved ones sat in the court's front row, she said she was 'so, so sorry' for their loss.","Sophie Rosser had returned from a party when she ran into her burning flat .

"Published: . 05:46 EST, 30 April 2014 . | . Updated: . 06:49 EST, 30 April 2014 . Clad in black from head to toe and carrying a formidable assortment of gear, Ken Andre, a 35-year-old father of two, is every criminal's worst nightmare. The Weymouth doorman is one of the UK's only ninja warriors and is regularly to be found prowling the streets of his home town, putting himself between the nastier elements of society and everyone else. Mr Andre, a former soldier who goes by the ninja name 'Shadow' has been practising martial arts for more than 25 years. He says he loves being a ninja so much, he'll never give it up - regardless of what critics might say. Crime fighter: Ken Andre (right) patrols the streets of Weymouth dressed in full ninja gear . 'They [critics] are entitled to their own . perceptions and opinions,' he told MailOnline in an exclusive interview. 'This is my destiny and this is who I am. If I . can give people inspiration and a bit of a message about living your life the way that's right for you, then I'm grateful to . carry on. 'At the end of the day, I'm out there doing something unique . and I'm happy and content.' One group who might not be quite so pleased is the Weymouth criminal fraternity who have to keep a weather eye out for Mr Andre as well as for the police. But although he has been known to intervene in fights, Mr Andre says most of his work involves talking to people in need of a sympathetic ear on the Weymouth clifftops and adds that if a situation appears too dangerous, he calls the police. 'A lot of time, I come across people who . are depressed or lost,' he explains. 'Back in . the day, I used to deal with violence or drug dealing. Training: Mr Andre (centre) gives TV presenter Darren McMullen a lesson in the spiritual side of ninja life . Skills: Along with fighting ability, ninjas traditionally had to be physically fit and intelligent . 'It's like second nature . to me now. I give first aid if it's needed, call the police if they're required and if someone is . vulnerable, then I will step in and defend them. 'The last person I met was . going to jump off a cliff so I shared some wisdom and knowledge with him . and gave him my time. 'Sometimes that's all they need. I try and be . loving in that situation and be the best I can be.' Mr Andre's martial arts career began at the age of eight, when a traumatic childhood event inspired him to learn self-defence. 'I've been a ninja for more than 24 years now,' he explains. 'When I was eight, I witnessed my mum being beaten up one night and I vowed from that moment to become a weapon and never a allow myself or my family to be touched again.' Later, he joined the army and spent 11 years in the forces, honing his already formidable fighting skills. 'I learned all about martial arts [in the army],' he says. 'I wanted to be so strong and powerful. I wanted to be a ninja master and learn how to overcome my physical limitations.' Now according to Mr Andre, his ninja skills have become second nature to him whether creeping undetected through the shadows or reading the wind. 'It's a consciousness now,' he adds. 'When I go out in the shadows, I know how to read the wind, the omens - it is a skill and it's inspiring. It's like a patrol, a ninja walk. I go out to meditate and use my skills.' Important: Mr Andre says many of the people who he meets are suicidal and just need a sympathetic shoulder . And, says Mr Andre, his family are happy to get involved too. 'My family are used to me now,' he chuckles. 'My mum even . started trying to develop the skills herself, although I think they are quite surprised that I'm still doing it [being a ninja] after all these years.' Shocked or not, Mr Andre says they can expect his crime-fighting career to continue. 'I can't stop - it's the essence of who I am,' he explains. 'Some people think I might have been a ninja in a past life. Either way, it's who I am and I'll never stop.'
