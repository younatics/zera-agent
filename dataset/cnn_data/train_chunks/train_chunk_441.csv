"(CNN)Measles this year has hit the most disparate places: camps for internally displaced people in northeast Nigeria, who've had to flee from Boko Haram, and Disneyland in California. The differences of the two settings are stark. In one, people are fighting for survival and have difficulty getting health care; the other is a first-world amusement park where people can afford medical choices regarding a vaccine-preventable disease. The United States is grappling with the resurgence of a disease it eliminated 15 years ago. But it's not alone. Data by the World Health Organization indicate that measles immunization rates are declining in several Western countries, like Canada, Belgium, Denmark and Spain, as some parents are opting out due to personal beliefs. The data also show that more than 100 countries, including Zimbabwe, Iran and North Korea, have higher measles immunization rates than the United States, which was at 91%. Dr. Robert Kezaala, senior health adviser of immunization at UNICEF, spent years promoting polio and measles vaccines in Africa. ""Generally, in the developing world, people welcome the vaccines,"" he said. ""The vaccine hesitancy, concern among the elite ... this is not a major issue in immunization against measles, because people have seen devastation from the outbreaks."" Globally, measles deaths hit record lows in 2012, which the WHO attributed to successful immunization campaigns as annual deaths declined to 122,000 from 562,000 in 2002. But the WHO warned that progress was fragile, because outbreaks still occur and measles remains one of the leading killers of children in the world. A joint global plan involving UNICEF, the WHO, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Red Cross and UN Foundation aims to eliminate measles by 2020. ""In the last two to three years, we've seen more stagnation of progress because there is complacency,"" said Kezaala. Countries with the highest measles incidence per 100,000 population . 1. Georgia -- 79.5 . 2. Bosnia and Herzegovina -- 62.9 . 3. Angola -- 59.3 . 4. Philippines -- 58.2 . 5. Namibia -- 41.9 . Countries with the most suspected measles cases . 1. China -- 107,024 . 2. Philippines -- 57,564 . 3. Vietnam -- 17,267 . 4. Ethiopia -- 16,028 . 5. Angola -- 12,300 . Source: WHO, does not include data from all countries . Asia has the most suspected case of measles, with China at top, followed by the Philippines and Vietnam, according to 2014 data from the WHO. But the rate, rather than raw numbers, offers a more accurate measure of the disease. One of the countries worst hit by the measles is the Philippines, which was struck by Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. The spread of the virus has been exacerbated by mass migration, with nearly 4 million people displaced by the devastating storm. But what happens in the Philippines has a direct connection to the United States, because the virus can easily travel -- as was the case of the unvaccinated Amish missionaries who brought back measles from the Philippines to cause an Ohio outbreak that infected 383 people in 2014. The CDC reported that 25 U.S. travelers, most of them unvaccinated, got ill with the measles after returning from the Philippines last year. China, which had the most measles cases in 2014, is also going through multiple outbreaks. Measles has been reported in a university in Shanxi province and a downtown Beijing office, resulting in quarantines and vaccinations for thousands of people, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported three toddler deaths and more than 2,700 measles cases in January -- double the rate seen in the same month two years ago. ""Measles outbreak occurs every four to five years, and now it's on an uprising stage based on its pattern,"" said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the local Beijing disease control agency. Officials from the national health agency told state-run CCTV that many of the cases are occurring in adults who never received their vaccines. Vaccine campaigns were not strong in the 1970s and 1980s, so some missed their shots. As many as two-thirds of the Beijing cases are among people over the age of 20. ""This outbreak reveals to us the fact that some unvaccinated people have become older, and it's like an accumulated debt from the past,"" Zeng Guang, an official with the China CDC, told CCTV. Measles outbreaks have also been reported in Sudan and Nigeria. In mid-January, the News Agency of Nigeria reported a measles outbreak in the state of Adamawa in the country's northeast at camps for internally displaced people. The state is frequently under attack by Boko Haram militants. An official told the media that the outbreak stemmed from a daily mass movement of people. UNICEF has to deal with logistical, infrastructure and transport challenges to get vaccines to some of the most remote and insecure areas in the world, said Kezaala. Regarding the current outbreak in the United States, he said:  ""It perplexes me, to see a country with no logistical challenges, readily available resources, with refuted studies and the anti-vaccine lobbies, you still see transmission continuing. It's not easy for me to grasp."" The United States is not the only developed country going through vaccine skepticism. In Canada last year, a group that doesn't get vaccines carried the infection back after visiting the Netherlands. Local health authorities in British Colombia confirmed 375 cases, which was declared the worst measles outbreak in 30 years in Canada. The Netherlands also saw a major measles outbreak from May 2013 to March 2014, where more than 2,600 people contracted the disease in communities that do not typically vaccinate. Europe reported 4,735 measles cases in 2014, in which 85% of the cases were unvaccinated and 10% had not finished their doses. The continent saw a peak in 2010, with 32,480 measles cases. CNN's Lu Shen and Beijing intern Sherry Ju contributed to this report.","Immunization rates are declining in parts of Western countries .
Many U.S. measles cases in 2014 are linked to travelers to the Philippines .

"(CNN)Call it a false memory. A trick of the mind. Or a ""misremembrance."" Television anchor Brian Williams isn't the first person to be embarrassed by claiming a remembrance that, well, never really happened. Recent history shows how several famous figures suffered what one expert labels a false ""flashbulb"" memory. Astrophysicist and television host Neil deGrasse Tyson, a protege of the late Carl Sagan, claimed he heard President George W. Bush make a remark intended to highlight divisions between Judeo-Christian Americans and fundamentalist Muslims. Tyson's assertion is still published on the webpage of the Hayden Planetarium, which he runs. ""After the 9/11 attacks, when President George W. Bush, in a speech aimed at distinguishing the U.S. from the Muslim fundamentalists, said, 'Our God is the God who named the stars.' The problem is two-thirds of all the stars that have names, have Arabic names. I don't think he knew this. This would confound the point that he was making,"" Tyson said in a 2008 speech. Fact checkers found Tyson's recollection to be wrong, and The New York Times even published an opinion piece in December 2014 by two psychology professors about the Tyson incident and ""Why Our Memory Fails Us."" ""In his post-9/11 speech, Mr. Bush actually said, 'The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends,' and he said nothing about the stars,"" wrote professors Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons. ""Mr. Bush had indeed once said something like what Dr. Tyson remembered; in 2003 Mr. Bush said, in tribute to the astronauts lost in the Columbia space shuttle explosion, that 'the same creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today.' '' Tyson later published an explanation and an apology on his Facebook page. He noted how ""blogosphere headlines"" carried ""accusations of me being a compulsive liar and a fabricator."" ""And I here publicly apologize to the President for casting his quote in the context of contrasting religions rather than as a poetic reference to the lost souls of Columbia. I have no excuse for this, other than both events -- so close to one another -- upset me greatly.  In retrospect, I'm surprised I remembered any details from either of them,"" Tyson wrote in September 2014. There's a twist on the Tyson tale, the two professors noted in The New York Times. Even President Bush suffered a false memory of what he saw on television the day of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Bush recalled more than once how he saw the first plane hit the north of the World Trade Center before he entered a classroom in Florida, where his reaction to the devastating attacks was forever captured on television cameras. ""In reality, he had been told that a plane had hit the building, but had not seen it -- there was no live footage of the plane hitting the tower,"" the two professors wrote. Bush's misremembrance was even the subject of a scholarly essay in 2004 by then graduate student Daniel Greenberg of Duke University, now a human memory expert who's a professor at the College of Charleston in South Carolina. Greenberg analyzed three recollections made by Bush of the event in a paper entitled, ""President Bush's False 'Flashbulb' Memory of 9/11/01."" Greenberg found two of Bush's recollections to be impossible because footage of the first plane strike wasn't available at that moment in time. ""How can we explain these inconsistencies?"" Greenberg wrote. ""Over the past century, numerous studies have shown that people frequently suffer from false memories -- fictitious 'memories' for events that did not really happen."" Noting how the President had access to aides to jog his memory, Greenberg concluded: ""We might expect that he would be better off than the average university undergraduate -- however, like so many others, he appears to be suffering from a near-textbook case of false recall."" When campaigning for president in the automobile mecca of Michigan in 2012, Mitt Romney claimed he witnessed as a child a famous event in Detroit: the golden jubilee of the car on June 1, 1946. In fact, Romney said, his father was the master of ceremonies. ""I think my dad had a job, like, being the grandmaster or whatever of the 50th celebration of the automobile in Detroit,'' Romney told a tea party rally in Milford, according to the Boston Globe. ""They painted Woodward Avenue with gold paint. My memory's a little foggy here, so, uh, but -- yeah I was probably 4 or something like that. But they had the cars go down Woodward Avenue.'' Problem was, Romney wasn't even born yet. The event occurred nine months before his birth. The Toronto Star exposed the misremembrance. ""The timelines suggest Romney could well have been conceived that day. But it is inconceivable he was actually there,"" the paper reported. A Romney aide told the Boston Globe that the Republican candidate was merely telling a story about a family member. ""Mitt doesn't say he was there. In fact, he says his memory was foggy,'' the aide said. ""He was simply telling the story about his dad.'' In her own campaign for the U.S. presidency in 2008, Hillary Clinton stated she evaded sniper fire when visiting Bosnia as first lady in 1996. While seeking votes, she provided a dramatic recollection of the event, which occurred on March 25, 1996. ""I remember landing under sniper fire. There was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport, but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base,"" said Clinton, a Democrat. But her account was eventually challenged, first by the comedian Sinbad who traveled with her, and then by media outlets, The New York Times reported. The Philadelphia Daily News' editorial board confronted her with video footage showing Clinton's arrival at Tuzla, calmly walking from the rear ramp of a U.S. Air Force plane with her daughter, Chelsea, then 16, at her side. Both Clintons held their heads up and did not appear rushed. The video also showed Clinton spending several minutes talking with the group, including an 8-year-old Bosnian girl who presented her with a poem, and later greeting U.S. troops. Clinton told the editorial board that she ""misspoke"" and the falsehood was a ""minor blip."" ""I say a lot of things -- millions of words a day -- so if I misspoke, that was just a misstatement,"" she said. In a subsequent radio interview, Clinton wasn't worried about the incident hurting her credibility. ""I have been in the public eye for many, many years, and this is something that I think happens to anybody,"" she told radio station KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His memoir seemed as good as gold. It was, after all, endorsed by Oprah Winfrey for her influential book club. James Frey's ""A Million Little Pieces"" touched the nation and its endless compassion when he recounted a purported dramatic experience with substance abuse and recovery. The book sold millions of copies and became a best-seller. But the investigative website The Smoking Gun found Frey's life wasn't as exciting as he portrayed it. Frey eventually admitted he embellished events about himself and other characters in the book. ""I made a mistake,"" he later confessed to Oprah Winfrey in 2006. ""I made a lot of mistakes in writing the book and promoting the book."" Pressed if he lied or made a mistake, Frey elaborated on what happened. ""I think probably both,"" he said. He admitted to embellishing several facts: he was jailed for only a few hours, not 87 days; and each character in the book wasn't wholly represented. But he asserted his book remained a memoir. He told CNN's Larry King that no one objected to about 200 pages of re-created conversations in the book, because it's understood that those are subjective memories. ""In every case, I did the best I could to recreate my life according to my memory of it,"" Frey told King. ""When I had supporting documents, I used them."" Winfrey retracted her support of the author, saying she felt ""conned"" by him.","TV host Neil deGrasse Tyson apologized for a false memory of a President Bush comment .

"(CNN)The pilots of TransAsia Airways Flight GE235 grappled with problems with both engines before the plane clipped a bridge and crashed into a river, killing dozens of people, Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council said Friday. The two engines on the ATR 72 turboprop aircraft stopped producing power one after the other, leaving the plane flying without thrust for more than a minute, according to the agency. During the crisis in the cockpit, the pilots received a series of alerts, starting with an alarm related to one of the engines and followed by five stall warnings as the plane lost thrust.. The pilots issued a mayday alert to air traffic control, announcing an engine flameout, or power failure. They eventually managed to restart the engine, but it was too late to prevent a crash. The Aviation Safety Council said Friday it was still collecting information on the disaster, with a full analysis of Flight GE235's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder still months away, and wasn't yet able to say why the engines shut down. Thomas Wang, the council's managing director, said investigators will look into the crew's role, including the possibility they shut off the left engine in response to a warning about the right engine. He said the left engine could have stopped working for multiple reasons. ""Either someone reduced it or something else happened, a mechanical failure,"" Wang said. ""We don't know."" Flight GE235 crashed into the Keelung River in Taiwan's capital, Taipei, shortly after taking off Wednesday with 58 people on board. Authorities say that so far, 35 people have been confirmed dead, 15 survived and 8 are still missing, according to Taiwan's official news agency CNA. Two people on the ground were also hurt. Father's hunch helped save toddler, wife . The reported engine problems dovetail with the account of Huang Chin-shun, a 72-year-old survivor of the crash. ""I thought something's wrong with the engine because I always take this flight,"" Huang told CNN affiliate ETTV from his hospital bed Thursday. Stephen Fredrick, a pilot who once flew ATRs for American Airlines, told CNN this week that it looked like Flight GE235 was gliding when dashboard cameras on the ground captured the moments before it crashed into the river. Fredrick pointed to the position of the nose, slightly down, and the wings, level. He said he thought the plane may have lost power in one or both of the engines. TransAsia was involved in another deadly disaster in July. Forty-eight people died after an ATR 72 aircraft operated by the airline crashed as it was attempting to land in the Taiwanese Penghu Islands during bad weather. After Wednesday's crash, Taiwan's aviation authorities ordered special checks on all ATR 72s in the fleets of local carriers. And on Friday, TransAsia ordered its 71 pilots who helm ATR aircraft to take and pass written and oral exams within the next four days in order to fly again, said an airline representative, who was not named per custom. Those pilots will have to undergo flight simulator tests sometime in the future as well. CNN's David Molko, Mitra Mobasherat and Greg Botelho, plus journalists Annie Liao and Gladys Tse contributed to this report.","A TransAsia representative: Pilots who fly ATR planes must pass tests .

"(CNN)Does terrorism ever work? 9/11 was an enormous tactical success for al Qaeda, partly because it involved attacks that took place in the media capital of the world and the actual capital of the United States, thereby ensuring the widest possible coverage of the event. If terrorism is a form of theater where you want a lot of people watching, no event in human history was likely ever seen by a larger global audience than the 9/11 attacks. At the time, there was much discussion about how 9/11 was like the attack on Pearl Harbor. They were indeed similar since they were both surprise attacks that drew America into significant wars. But they were also similar in another sense. Pearl Harbor was a great tactical success for Imperial Japan, but it led to great strategic failure: Within four years of Pearl Harbor the Japanese empire lay in ruins, utterly defeated. Similarly, 9/11 was a great tactical success for al Qaeda, but it also turned out be a great strategic failure for Osama bin Laden. On 9/11 bin Laden's main strategic goal was to overthrow regimes across the Middle East and to replace them with Taliban-style rule. He believed that the best way to accomplish this was to attack the ""far enemy"" (the United States) and then watch as the U.S.-backed Arab regimes he termed the ""near enemy"" toppled. This might have worked if the United States really was the paper tiger that bin Laden believed it to be, but not only did bin Laden not achieve his war aims, the 9/11 attacks resulted in the direct opposite of his goal of forcing a U.S. withdrawal from Muslim lands. After 9/11, American soldiers occupied both Afghanistan and Iraq, and al Qaeda -- ""the base"" in Arabic -- lost the best base it ever had: Afghanistan as it had existed before the overthrow of the Taliban by U.S. forces in late 2001. In short, bin Laden's violent tactics did not serve his strategic goals, and al Qaeda's violence became only an end in itself. That is where ISIS is today. Its strategy is incoherent because only a tiny minority of Muslims want to live in the Taliban-style utopia that ISIS wants to bring to the Muslim world, while at the same time ISIS' principal victims are fellow Muslims who don't share their views to the letter. This is a decidedly mixed message for a group that presents itself as the defender of Muslims. Indeed, the burning to death of the Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh is an indelible image that will long serve to undercut any ISIS claim to be the defender of Islam. That said, could ISIS' campaign of brutal terrorism work to bring its goal of a Taliban-style caliphate across the Middle East? If one examines other significant campaigns of terrorism in the modern era, the historical record suggests that this is quite unlikely. Anarchists in the early 20th century carried out a number of high-profile assassinations and bombings. In 1901, for instance, an anarchist killed U.S. President William McKinley. And in 1920 an anarchist blew up a bomb-laden wagon on Wall Street, killing more than 30, which was the deadliest act of terrorism in New York until 9/11. Anarchists termed these kinds of high-profile attacks ""the propaganda of the deed."" Yet they achieved nothing with these attacks, and their ideology has withered and largely died out. The Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany was a group of Marxist-inspired terrorists who during the 1970s and 1980s killed more than 30 people, a number of whom were prominent German government officials and businessmen as well as U.S. military personnel, yet this campaign also achieved absolutely nothing. One could also make the same observation for other Western leftist terrorist groups of the same era, such as the Weather Underground. Indeed, there are few campaigns of terrorism that have succeeded in bringing about their political objectives, but in some cases terrorism can actually work. This is the big, uncomfortable takeaway of an important new book, ""Anonymous Soldiers: The Struggle for Israel 1917-1947,"" about the era that led up to the creation of Israel, written by the leading American terrorism expert, Bruce Hoffman. Hoffman demonstrates that Jewish terrorism helped to push the British occupiers out of Palestine after World War II. Indeed, Menachem Begin, the leader of the Irgun group that played an instrumental role in the Jewish terrorist campaign against British and Arab targets, went on to become the Prime Minister of Israel and shared in a Nobel Peace Prize. Some 300 miles from where the Jordanian pilot was believed to have been burned alive by ISIS, almost seven decades ago two soldiers were hanged from a tree in the land that is now called Israel. The soldiers were British and the executioners were Jewish militants whose overall commander was Begin. The burning to death of the Jordanian pilot was, of course, particularly abhorrent, but the hanging deaths of the two British soldiers in 1947 were greeted with as much outrage in the United Kingdom as the pilot's death has had in Jordan. But after the killings of the British soldiers an unexpected thing happened. The British, who had endured a campaign of terrorist attacks in Palestine, including the attack on Jerusalem's iconic King David Hotel that killed 91 soldiers and civilians, didn't double down on their occupation of Palestine. Instead, they washed their hands of it and packed up their bags and left, leading to the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. The emerging scholarly consensus is that campaigns of terrorism can sometimes work to achieve the goal of forcing the withdrawal of a colonial power as happened with the British in Palestine, but more often than not terrorism doesn't succeed as a tactic to achieve the strategic goals of terrorist groups, whether they are Marxist in orientation, or ultra-fundamentalist jihadists. Instead, all too often violence becomes an end in itself for the terrorist organization, which then loses any legitimacy that it might have once had and is eventually wiped out by military or police action. That is the position that ISIS now finds itself in with its killing of the Jordanian pilot. ​ .","Peter Bergen: Most of the time, terrorism becomes self-defeating .

"(CNN)The Hubble space telescope peers hundreds, thousands, millions of light-years into the universe to study novas, quasars and nebulas. But weeks ago, it pulled its focus way in close -- to just light-minutes away -- to view a rare and beautiful spectacle at the planet Jupiter. Three big moons crossed past it at the same time, casting their shadows onto Jupiter's swirling surface. From the perspective of people theoretically standing on Jupiter, it would be like three solar eclipses happening at once, astronomers said. In the last 15 years, this has happened only twice, the Space Telescope Science Institute said. ""The next one will be 2032,"" said astronomer Carol Christian. So, Hubble shot photos rapid fire to capture the rare conjunction in late January.  And STScI published them Thursday, along with a short fast-motion video animation. There was no great scientific gain in Hubble taking the snaps. The moons and their crossings have been examined plenty and are well-known. ""We felt that there are images which have aesthetic value above and beyond their scientific value,"" said astronomer Zolt Levy. It was a gift of beauty to the public. Jupiter is a sort of mini-solar system inside our solar system. It's the largest body after the sun. And like the sun, it comprises a lot of helium and hydrogen gas, but it doesn't have enough mass to burst into the intense nuclear fusion that makes the sun a fireball, NASA says. It has many satellites, including 62 moons, and they swarm around the planet with many of them crossing the surface facing Earth constantly. But only four of them are highly visible standouts. They are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. The four moons are called the Galilean satellites, because Renaissance astronomer Galileo Galilei discovered them in 1610, when he pointed his telescope skyward, forever changing human perception of our place in the cosmos. Many of today's hobby telescopes are much stronger than his, so anyone can easily follow in his footsteps and cast the same gaze. And many did, when the three moons passed, posting their recordings of the triple moon transit on YouTube. The moons spin around Jupiter at different speeds; their orbits vary in duration from two to 17 days, so having them line up together to zip across the side of Jupiter pointed our way is special. Io, Europa, and Callisto put on the show without Ganymede, which was too far off to the side to make it into the group photo. Europa is in the spotlight of space explorers, because they think there may be life in the fluid water underneath its surface of solid ice. If it is found there, this would be the first discovery of life in our solar system aside from that on Earth.","Three of Jupiter's four great moons crossed its sunny side in January .
That's rare; it has happened only twice in the last 15 years .
Hubble's images are primarily for aesthetic purposes, a gift to the public ."
"(CNN)Just the other day, en route to school, my husband and daughters ended up walking behind a smoker on the street. The three of them immediately talked about how ""gross"" they think smoking is. My younger daughter, who's 7, asked why someone would start to smoke in the first place, according to my husband. Then, my nearly-9-year-old said she read a book in which a guy wouldn't kiss a girl because she smoked. It's exactly that sentiment -- that smokers may be considered less attractive, appealing or desirable -- that a provocative new music video hopes to capitalize on to persuade teens never to start smoking in the first place. The video plays off the term ""left swipe,"" which with the popularity of dating apps like Tinder and OKCupid has come to define someone as unattractive. If you like someone on a dating app, you swipe them right. If you don't like them, you give them a ""left swipe."" (Full disclosure: I had no idea what these terms meant until I reported this story!) And so, in the video, featuring musical performers Becky G, Fifth Harmony and a host of Internet stars including Grace Helbig, Harley Morenstein and King Bach, each time a profile picture appears with someone smoking, there is a call to #LeftSwipeDat. Smoking, drinking, prescription drug abuse by teens is down, survey says . ""Yeah, you work out, you are in shape, OK. I like the six-pack abs, not the six packs a day,"" sings Becky G. The video is part of the ""truth"" campaign, one of the largest national youth smoking-prevention initiatives in the country, and is directed and funded by the national public foundation Legacy. ""We wanted to debunk a few things here,"" said Robin Koval, chief executive officer and president of Legacy. ""One, (smoking) doesn't make you more attractive, and we know the thing that young people care about most is connecting with other people, especially for romantic opportunities, and that social smoking, whatever you call it, light smoking, intermittent smoking, is smoking. ""From our perspective, if you light it, you should left-swipe it. It's just a bad idea."" Some research shows how dating profiles featuring smoking get less traction than those that do not. The anti-smoking group Action on Smoking & Health conducted an experiment. It created two identical profiles -- ""Heather"" and ""Sara"" -- on the dating app Tinder, each featuring the same attractive woman. Heather was smoking; Sara was not. Heather and Sara then both swiped right on 1,000 men over a week, again meaning they liked them. Fifty-four percent of the men chose Sara, the nonsmoking profile, while 29% selected Heather, the profile with a cigarette, according to the group's findings. The campaign comes as cigarette smoking has reached historic lows among teens, according to the latest Monitoring the Future survey by the University of Michigan, released in December. FDA launches teen anti-smoking campaign . Among eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders who were polled in 1997, 28% said they smoked in the prior month. That number dropped to 8% in 2014, according to the report, which is amazing. But there are reasons to be concerned, including how teens seem to have dramatically different perceptions about the impact of social smoking versus being a regular smoker. ""One of the things we see is a belief among young people that if you only smoke occasionally, light smoking or intermittent smoking, that somehow that's not as dangerous,"" Koval said. In a recent study, though most teens said they believe that heavy smoking is harmful, only 64% said light smoking, consuming a few cigarettes a day, was very harmful. Nearly 25% believed that intermittent smoking caused little or no harm, according to the survey of nearly 25,000 teens in the United States and showcased in the Journal of Pediatrics. Would you tell your kids you got high? E-cigarette use among teens is also on the rise: Seventeen percent of 12th-graders, 16% of 10th-graders and 8% of eighth-graders said they had used them in the past month, according to the recent Monitoring the Future survey. And 23% of 12th-graders said they smoked tobacco using a hookah in the past year in 2014, up from 17% in 2010. In addition, 19% said they smoked small or little cigars, often called cigarillos, in 2014, down from 23% in 2010. ""Young people just don't understand that a little cigar is just as dangerous as a regular cigarette,"" Koval said. ""It's very concerning and really, really dangerous. ... We know for sure that combustible tobacco will kill you."" The video marks a departure from other ad campaigns, including some by the FDA last year, that try to graphically show teens the health risks associated with smoking. Koval says those ads are effective too, but this approach may have more impact when it comes to changing perceptions. Why it's still a big deal if your teen smokes pot? Young people think they are ""never going to get old. They are never going to get sick. They don't even really think their social smoking, if you will, behavior is really real smoking or that dangerous,"" she said. ""Doing it when they're out with others, believing that it makes them more attractive, that it helps them connect with others is an increasing trend."" Koval would not reveal the cost of airing the 60-second version during the Grammys but said the move clearly represents a ""significant"" investment. ""It's very hard to aggregate live audiences of young people, the moments when you can do that are far and few between, so we want to take advantage of them,"" she said. ""We know that youth will be watching."" And the hope is that they won't just watch but will share the video on social media along with the hashtag #LeftSwipeDat.

"(CNN)Gospel Kazako knows that sometimes it's best to follow the light. The eldest of eight children, the Malawian entrepreneur had a typical upbringing in the southern town of Zomba. One night, sitting out on his parents' veranda, he spotted a mysterious light flashing atop nearby Mount Mpigi. He asked someone about it, who told him it was a radio transmitter. ""I got very fascinated,"" Kazako recalls. A lifetime obsession was instantly born, setting the young boy on a path that would see him transmitting to millions of people every day and eventually becoming a major media mogul. High school and a diploma in journalism later and Kazako found employment at Malawian state radio MBC. There, he produced a variety of shows but after seven years he left to set up his own company, which created adverts, features and documentaries for other radio stations. Kazako's ambition would take him further; first he was at the helm of his own station, Zodiak Radio (Malawi's leading privately-owned station), and later on he successfully expanded into television. The process was arduous and required no small measure of perseverance. Here, Kazako tells CNN how he fought his way to the top, why it's important to look back, and how ethics are at the core of his business. Perseverance is key. Whilst running his production company, support from clients bolstered Kazako's belief that he could go it alone and set up his own station. Things didn't start well. ""In 2002 I applied for a license and it was rejected twice. In 2003 I applied again [but] it was also rejected,"" Gospel says. In 2004, and at the fourth attempt, he was granted a national broadcasting license. He was ready to go as soon as it arrived -- ""By that time I had bought around three transmitters,"" he cheekily admits. Start small but always think big. ""We started very, very simple, with very, very simple gadgets,"" Kazako explains. ""When people [came to] the studios they were fascinated. 'Are you broadcasting to the whole country using these simple gadgets?' I said yes. ""We continued, struggling, expanding. We started with five transmitting sites... now we have I think over 34-35 transmitting sites across the country."" Being the largest private radio station in Malawi was not enough for Kazako. After nine years in radio he wanted a new challenge and decided to expand into television. ""Realizing the dream of running or owning a television station [was] a very, very difficult journey,"" he says. ""The day we switched on the television... expecting that every moment, any second, we're going to see a Zodiak signal... I don't know how to describe it... it was a very, very emotional moment."" Businesses should be ethical. Gospel says Kodiak's mission was always clear. ""From the onset we told ourselves that we are going to be a radio station that should be fair, balanced, ethical, professional and non-partisan. A station that was going to be one that everyone must trust. ""I feel I have a personal responsibility as a broadcaster, as a journalist, to ensure that people are well informed. So they can make decisions about their future; decisions about their lives."" Everybody should have a voice in society. ""[Radio] is a very powerful tool that can change people's lives,"" Kazako says. ""It's a voice, loaded with information. It's a voice with content that can be used effectively to change how people think, to change [the] attitudes of the people, to change so many things."" Gospel is now using his station to help others. In 2007 he introduced the Zodiak Girl Awards, recognizing the best female students in high schools. ""I have always been a very strong believer that for us to move forward everybody must be included. And when I say everybody, this includes women. You cannot talk about human rights without women rights."" ""For us to develop as a country we need to make sure that we are not leaving our women behind,"" Gospel argues. The awards, which are now paired with international university scholarships are   ""empowering our women,"" he says, ""empowering our girls through education."" Humble beginnings should not restrict you. ""I didn't grow up with a lot of resources around me,"" Kazako explains. ""I know the pains of sleeping with an empty stomach... I know the pains of sleeping on a railway line without a blanket... I know the pains of almost having nothing."" Speaking of the media empire he has built, Kazako is self-deprecating. ""Anybody can do this. I'm like you... Wherever you are in [your] corner of the world, you can become someone. In the very small corner that you are, take off fear and believe in your idea. Believe in your idea, work very hard, and make sure [it] is going to happen... Sometimes it can be very frustrating, sometimes you feel you are bashing a dry hard wall, sometimes people look at you like a crazy fellow, but just believe and keep on walking.""

"Moore, Oklahoma (CNN)Christopher Legg, a 9-year-old who loved football and was known to tackle people with a bear hug and a smile, huddled on top of a classmate as a tornado barreled through their elementary school here in central Oklahoma one year ago this week. A wall crushed and killed Christopher, his mother told me; but he shielded the other student from the rubble and saved her life. In the year since that tornado, Danni Legg, 41, has been working tirelessly to convince Oklahoma lawmakers that the best way to honor her son's legacy is to try to equip every school in the state with a tornado shelter or safe room. She's given dozens of interviews and granted more than 100 speaking requests. She's gathered signatures for a petition and walked the halls of the state Capitol. Her argument seems to fit the definition of reasonable: Students are required to attend school; therefore, schools should be required to ensure they are safe from violent storms. It also comes with an emotional gut-punch: Her son's elementary school, Plaza Towers, in Moore, Oklahoma, did not have a storm shelter. Christopher's life, and those of six other students who died in that EF5 storm, might have been spared if the state or school had protected them. ""Something good's gotta come out of this,"" Danni Legg told me. It should, but there's little sign the state is listening. Related: Walking the 17-mile path of the tornado . Efforts to fund or require shelters statewide so far have been snarled in the political process, with Republicans and Democrats disagreeing about how to fund upgrades. Republicans, in a plan endorsed by Gov. Mary Fallin, want to let school districts hold local elections to decide if they should issue extra bonds to pay for construction. To Legg and others, including a prominent Democrat, that plan does nothing to actually create shelters. It only asks districts if they want to take out extra bonds to pay for improvements. They want a franchise tax on corporations to be used to fund improvements statewide. The bickering has done little to improve policy. Frustrated, Legg figures if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. She's running for a seat in the state Legislature on a pro-shelter platform. Moore, the city hardest hit, updated its building codes to require new homes to be built with safer garage doors and with roofs that are fastened to the walls. That's been heralded as a big improvement. Better, however, would be requiring storm shelters with all new construction -- for both schools and residences. Currently, far too many students in Oklahoma remain unprotected. A survey commissioned by the office of Oklahoma Rep. Joe Dorman, a Democrat who favors statewide shelter funding, found more than 60% of the 1,804 public schools surveyed in Oklahoma say they do not have a shelter or safe room. That leaves more than 500,000 students and staff in the state without shelter. Efforts to improve school safety often have been criticized as overly expensive. The SAFE Design Group, an architectural firm that analyzed the survey, estimated it would cost up to $880 million to put safe rooms in the 1,109 unprotected schools. Related: One block, two storms . As Legg and others see it, however, that money would save lives. And she's not demanding all the improvements be made at once. When we met on Sunday afternoon, Legg arrived on crutches and was wearing the same leopard-print blouse she wore the day the tornado tore through central Oklahoma, taking her son's life and those of 23 others. We spent much of our time talking about her Christopher -- about how he was larger than life, both in terms of his cheery disposition and because of a disorder that caused him to grow at an unnatural rate. As an infant, he was ""all arms and legs,"" impossible to contain. By third grade, Christopher was 5-foot-6 and already dreaming big. He wanted to play football at Oklahoma State -- wanted eventually to work as a fireman. ""He was so loving and vibrant and full of life."" And he was too tall to fit into a child's casket, she told me. When the tornado warnings came on May 20, 2013, Legg didn't think much of it. She'd lived through another killer tornado that hit central Oklahoma in 1999. She lost her house in that storm, which was located in a neighboring suburb of Oklahoma City. She decided to rebuild in Moore, she told me, because it had been at the epicenter of that 1999 storm. She figured storms that big wouldn't hit twice. Related: Remembering the victims . She would never be so shortsighted again. The year since the tornado has been a ""living hell."" She's lost 40 pounds from stress and says her husband has gained that many. She doesn't sleep through the night. Her 12-year-old son gets panicky any time the sky is cloudy, as it was on Sunday, or the wind blows hard, as it does almost every day in the Great Plains. The depths of her sorrow are almost impossible to explain. ""When a mother has a child, that is a little bit of her running around outside"" in the world, she said. ""Outside of her body is this little piece of your heart. ... ""That was a part of me. That was my son."" Her coping mechanism has been to push for change. Fed up with how little was happening to put shelters in schools, the mother and former school worker decided she's going to run for the state House of Representatives as a Republican. The campaign actually is the reason she's on crutches. She broke her foot stumbling on a tree root, she said, while she was putting up campaign signs in the zone hit by the tornado. The Republican primary will be held in June. Legg never planned to be a politician, and doesn't like the attention of speaking so often in public about these issues, she told me. But maybe what the state Legislature needs is a mom. ""We have misguided ourselves into thinking it's not going to happen to us,"" she said. But the state needs to wake up and realize is that it can and will happen again. After the storm, Legg considered leaving Moore, avoiding it all. But she thought about her kids -- and others across the state. ""I wanted to prove to my children -- just like my daddy taught me -- if a horse kicks you off, you get back on,"" said Legg, who grew up on a farm. ""I wanted them to understand this town did not kill their brother."" This mom, who describes herself as ""competitive as snot,"" doesn't plan to quit pushing for greater access to tornado shelters, whether she wins the race or not. She has the legacy of a hero to protect. And the state would be wise to listen.","It's been one year since a tornado killed 24 people in central Oklahoma .

"(CNN)News that a jury has ordered Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams to fork out $7.4 million in damages and profits for allegedly drawing on Marvin Gaye's 1977 hit ""Got to Give It Up"" in their song ""Blurred Lines"" has thrust the issue of music copyright into the headlines. But it's by no means the first time. Recently, it was reported that Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne would be given songwriting credits for Sam Smith's hit song ""Stay With Me."" But the really interesting part was that this only happened after Petty's team noticed a likeness between Smith's song and Petty's 1989 hit ""I Won't Back Down."" Astonishingly, this means Smith, and somehow every single person at every stage of the production process of ""Stay With Me,"" were all -- to a person -- apparently not familiar with the 1989 Petty/Lynne tune. It makes this old-timer think: Wait, how did anyone release that song and not think it sounded like Petty's ""Won't Back Down""? I assumed it was a collaboration! The only plausible explanation is that every executive, every studio employee and every human involved in that decision was under 30 and had never heard of Tom Petty. Or MTV. Or iTunes. Or the music industry. ""Won't Back Down"" doesn't get a lot of play time now, but in 1989, you could not have avoided this song. MTV played videos pretty much nonstop back then, and this one accounted for about 20% of the content on MTV -- or at least it felt that way. To this author, and amateur music infringement sleuth, the songs are almost identical. But, it turns out music -- and music similarity -- is almost entirely in the eye of the beholder (or ""be-hearer""). Other songs that have 'Blurred Lines' In a music plagiarism case, one musician claims that another composer has ""stolen"" his pre-existing song. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the challenged composition (1) is substantially similar, and, further, (2) that this similarity is due to copying. The challenge is that even if the plaintiff can prove song similarity, the plaintiff usually has no evidence that the accused composer actually heard the song in advance. So, music infringement presents a tricky question: Should a court find that the defendant infringed the plaintiff's song just upon a showing that the songs are similar or identical -- despite the plaintiff's inability to show that the defendant ever actually heard the song? Instead, plaintiffs generally prove this element by showing that the person who composed the defendant's work had ""access."" Examples of ""access"" are where a plaintiff's song has been widely disseminated, either by public broadcasts, widespread distribution and even the publication of sheet music. If a composer and his work are not famous, naturally it's harder to prove access to a musical composition that has largely been distributed no further than a dog-eared notebook in mom's basement. It's hard to hold a defendant liable for infringement solely because the piece is similar, and courts are reluctant to do so. At the same time, ""access"" today is much easier to prove than it was before the Internet. If someone has five fans on his aspiring-rapper Facebook page, and he posts songs recorded right onto his MacBook, can it be said that a Sam Smith had ""access"" to that music when he records a nearly identical tune? After all, technically, it was only a click away on the Internet, just not a click that anyone was likely to make. The advent of the Internet means artists now have ""access"" to everything, at any time. Surprisingly, courts have held that in cases of the unknown, un-famous plaintiff, the ""access"" may be inferred where the plaintiff proves the similarity between the songs is both substantial and striking, and also that the similarities could only have come from copying, and not coincidence. So, in an era where every song ever composed is online, at our fingertips, it all boils down to a collective smell test. And if you have ever seen Vanilla Ice defend his accused theft in ""Ice Ice Baby"" of David Bowie and Queen's classic sound in ""Pressure,"" you know that there really is not much difference between ""Da-Da-Da Da-Da Da-Da"" and ""Da-DA Da-Da Da-Da-Da Da."" (Here's the link to that piece of tape, for no other reason than it's a fantastic example of self-delusion.) The fascinating thing is that the music business is full of these alleged song robberies. Since music is so personal, whether the listener hears the old song in the new depends heavily on the individual's music preferences and knowledge. If you are proficient in the art of blues or rock chord progression, for example, you may recognize that the famous Baroque canon by Pachelbel, is almost identical chord-wise to Blues Traveler's '90s hit ""Hook."" This, even though no one would confuse the feel or genre of ""Hook"" with Pachelbel's wedding classic. On the other hand, if (like my Grandpa Vito) you think all rap music sounds like ""pots and pans clanging together,"" then you may not have the palate for differentiating between rap, hip-hop, house or trance. The point is, music theory may be a hard science, but music appreciation is anything but. As a result, music comparison is all over the map. For example, in 1971, former Beatle George Harrison was sued for supposedly pilfering the Chiffons song ""He's So Fine"" for his hit song ""My Sweet Lord."" YouTube ""He's So Fine"" right now and listen. Now YouTube ""My Sweet Lord."" Identical or different? The chords are substantially similar in both verse and chorus. The fact that the songs are from different ""eras"" is either a minor distinction to you, or dispositive of any claims. The reality is that once you start playing these songs for different people, you find that because we all perceive music differently, there may be no objective way ultimately to determine if any song ever infringes another. After all, isn't all music inspired by something that came before it? Sure, each side can call experts in music theory at trial to testify about the circle of fifths, and tonal harmony this and arpeggio that. But those experts would still be explaining it to a lay judge, jury and even lawyers. These laypeople are all individuals, all experiencing music differently. And in the case of the Chiffons' song and Harrison's ""My Sweet Lord""? The court ultimately determined that Harrison's use of parts of the Chiffons' song, in the same order, sequence and harmonies, meant Harrison subconsciously misappropriated ""He's So Fine."" Is that how you would have called it? Play it for your spouse or kids and see what they say. You may find they disagree with you. This kind of dispute appears whimsical, but it actually has serious economic implications. Music is protected by copyright, which, along with trademarks and patents comprise an area of law known as intellectual property. A copyright is just an expression of an idea in a fixed, tangible medium, which means a song, a painting and even software code is entitled to copyright protection. The most paradoxical thing about intellectual property law is that it incentivizes creativity and invention by rewarding creators with a limited monopoly ... and nothing destroys ingenuity more than monopoly. The line must be carefully drawn, because the loser in a copyright case may be out some major damages in the form of royalties. In the case of Sam Smith's use of the Tom Petty work, to Smith's credit, his team reportedly listened to the two songs and acknowledged the similarity. And in a rare moment in music infringement history the parties actually settled the matter amicably. Of course, for me, the key lesson in all this is that knowing Petty's music now seems to mean that I am officially old. Which means it's time to retire my acid-wash jean jacket with the Whitesnake patch. Even worse, though -- if potential litigants such as Smith and Petty are going to start resolving disputes without hiring us lawyers, then I might have to retire my law license along with the denim jackets.","Jury has found that 'Blurred Lines' drew on Marvin Gaye's 'Got to Give It Up'

"Three teenage girls who set out from a Denver suburb apparently bound for Syria to join extremists fighting there are back home after their parents alerted authorities and the trio was stopped in Germany,  U.S. officials said. The teens -- two sisters of Somali descent and a friend whose family is Sudanese, according to a Denver community leader -- were detained when their flight landed in Frankfurt on Friday after the FBI flagged their passports. They were flown back to Denver on Sunday, officials said. Parents of the girls called the FBI after becoming concerned the girls may have been traveling to Turkey. The FBI, which is investigating why the girls left, is ""aware of the situation and assisted with bringing the individuals back to Denver. That is all the information we can provide at this time,"" said agency spokeswoman Sue Payne in Denver. Colorado teen pleads guilty in plan to join ISIS . The girls -- all U.S. citizens -- are 15, 15 and 17 years old, according to officials. The oldest one appears to have been the organizer of the trip. The FBI is combing through the girls' online communications to determine who, if anyone, was helping them. They are believed to have stolen money from their parents. According to Glenn Thompson, bureau chief of the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, $2,000 was missing from the father of the two sisters. The girls' parents had no indication their children planned to travel. None of the girls had ever run away before. It's not exactly clear how the girls planned their trip or how they were going to make their way to Syria, but authorities say their ultimate plan was to try to join extremists fighting there. The FBI has spoken to the teens and interviewed their families, and the agency said at this point they are not facing any charges.

"London (CNN)A UK tribunal censured a UK intelligence agency Friday for not making enough information public about how it shares Internet surveillance data with its U.S. counterpart, the National Security Agency. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal said that the intelligence agency known as GCHQ, or Government Communications Headquarters, had not been open enough about the way the process worked until December. The tribunal's ruling was in response to a complaint brought by civil liberties groups Liberty, Privacy International and Amnesty International in the wake of claims by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about mass U.S. surveillance programs such as Prism. Snowden's revelations led to questions over GCHQ's sharing of surveillance data with the United States. ""Today's landmark ruling is the first time the Tribunal -- which considers complaints brought against GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 -- has found against the intelligence agencies in its 15-year history,"" Liberty said in a statement, referring also to Britain's other two intelligence agencies. ""Liberty disagrees that the limited safeguards revealed are sufficient to make GCHQ's mass surveillance and intelligence-sharing activities lawful, and will challenge the Tribunal's December decision at the European Court of Human Rights."" Privacy International also hailed what it said was a ""major victory"" in the battle to rein in the intelligence agencies' activities. Friday's judgment ""represents a monumental leap forward in efforts to make intelligence agencies such as GCHQ and NSA accountable to the millions of individuals whose privacy they have violated,"" it said. The tribunal ruled on December 5 that the sharing of electronic surveillance data between the two countries was lawful. But it said Friday that only after that date was enough information about the program in the public domain -- thanks to the disclosures made in the case -- for the UK government not to contravene its European human rights obligations. At issue are articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or ECHR, regarding the rights to privacy and to freedom of expression. Before December 5, ""the regime governing the soliciting, receiving, storing and transmitting by UK authorities of private communications of individuals located in the UK, which have been obtained by US authorities ..., contravened Articles 8 or 10 ECHR, but now complies,"" the tribunal's ruling stated. The UK Home Office said the ruling vindicated the intelligence agencies' actions. ""Today's judgment reaffirms the (tribunal)'s earlier ruling, which found that the current regime governing both the intelligence agencies' external interception and intelligence sharing regimes are lawful and ECHR compliant,"" a government spokesman said. ""Those activities have always been subject to strict safeguards. This judgment is about the amount of detail about those safeguards that needed to be in the public domain. The (tribunal) has made clear that no further action is required."" The government is ""committed to transparency"" and has now made public the detail of the safeguards governing requests made to foreign governments for intercepted communications, he added. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal is an independent body set up to investigate complaints about the alleged conduct of public bodies with regard to members of the public. It deals with complaints about the use of intrusive powers such as wiretapping by intelligence services, law enforcement agencies and public authorities. Eric King, deputy director of Privacy International, said that despite Friday's ruling, more needed to be done to protect the UK public's rights. ""We must not allow agencies to continue justifying mass surveillance programs using secret interpretations of secret laws. The world owes Edward Snowden a great debt for blowing the whistle, and today's decision is a vindication of his actions. ""But more work needs to be done. The only reason why the NSA-GCHQ sharing relationship is still legal today is because of a last-minute clean-up effort by government to release previously secret 'arrangements.' That is plainly not enough to fix what remains a massive loophole in the law.""","Tribunal says that until December, GCHQ was too secretive about how it shared data .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN)It's on. And it even has its own twitter hashtag, #itson. After a week of torrid speculation about the future of the Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, a member of his ruling Liberal Party says he will seek a motion on Tuesday to declare the country's top job vacant. Western Australian lawmaker Luke Simpkins says Australians have stopped listening to Abbott and if no one's listening, Abbott can't lead the party. If Tuesday's vote is successful, then a call will be made for nominations for the position of prime minister and deputy leader of the Liberal Party. The prime minister however is defiant. In a bombshell announcement, Abbott declared he and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the deputy leader of Abbott's party,  stand united and will urge the party not to declare their positions vacant. Bishop has been widely tipped to be a possible aspirant for the top job. ""We are not the Labor Party,"" Abbott told a hastily convened media conference, in a reference to the turmoil between 2010 and 2013 when the then ruling Labor Party ousted two leaders amid unseemly leaks and constant threat of leadership change. ""We are not going to repeat the chaos and the instability of the Labor years, so I have spoken to deputy leader Julie Bishop and we will stand together in urging the partyroom [party] to defeat this particular motion and in so doing, and in defeating this motion, to vote in favor of the stability and the team that the people voted for at the election."" Abbott's insistence that the people elected him has angered some in his party. Under the Westminster system to which Australia adheres, Abbott holds the prime ministership by the vote of his colleagues. And a growing chorus of them has been rattled by what they see as a series of poor decisions, back flipping on policies, broken promises and the government's failure to sell an austerity budget widely seen as hitting the poorest harder than the wealthy. The bizarre honoring of the Queen's husband, Prince Philip as a Knight of Australia on Australia Day, the country's national celebration of its independent identity, was the tipping point. But cabinet ministers have been lining up to publicly support the prime minister over the past week. Those who've spoken since the leadership challenge was announced, say they will be voting against declaring the top leadership posts vacant. Untested and critical will be the views of the government's backbench where the parliamentary revolt started. The position of deputy party leader and foreign minister Bishop remains murky. Throughout the week, she has declared her support for Abbott. However, she hasn't declared whether she would be a contender for his job if the position were to be declared open. Indeed, even when declaring she would vote against the leadership challenge, she did so on technical grounds. ""I agree with the PM that due to cabinet solidarity and my position as deputy...There should be support for the current leadership in a spill motion,"" she said in a statement. There was speculation during the week that Bishop would stand on a unity ticket with Communications Minister and former opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull. A man with enormous ambition, Turnbull was ousted from the party's leadership in 2009. A climate change believer and supporter of same sex marriage, Turnbull is a hugely popular figure in the so-called ""latte sipping"" strata of Australian society and in particular amongst voters who traditionally vote for the opposition Australian Labor Party. Whilst Turnbull has said he supports Abbott, he has not ruled out standing for the position in the event of a leadership challenge. Undoubtedly, the phones will be furiously worked over the weekend. Both Turnbull and Bishop will be testing the waters. In the meantime, government members will be weighing whether the effort is worth the risk. Ringing in their ears might be the words of the Trade Minister Andrew Robb. ""I think it's totally unnecessary and it will make us look like a bit of a circus frankly,"" he said. Since federation, Australia has experienced six party room coups that have toppled the prime minister. If Abbott's head rolls, he will have been in power for the shortest period of them all.","Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott faces a leadership challenge .

"(CNN)ISIS has stepped up the use of children in its bloody campaign of terror, the United Nations says -- subjecting them to horrors that include putting price tags on them to sell as slaves. A report released this week focused on children in Iraq, as well as the responsibility of that nation's government for ensuring the safety and security of young civilians in the conflict. But it certainly doesn't preclude similar things happening in Syria, where ISIS is also entrenched and also has been blamed for various atrocities. In reference to Iraq, at least, the U.N. report found that the terrorist group is resorting more and more to brutal acts such as enslaving, raping, beheading, crucifying and burying people alive. Some of those affected are children. ""We have had reports of children, especially children that are mentally challenged, who have been used as suicide bombers, most probably without them even understanding what has happened or what they have to expect,"" said Renate Winter, an expert with the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child. Some as young as age 8 are getting training to become soldiers, she said. ""Children of minorities have been captured in places where the so-called ISIL has its strength, have been sold in market with tags, price tags on them, have been sold as slaves,"" Winter said. People of the Yazidi faith -- which draws from Christianity, Judaism and the ancient monotheistic religion of Zoroastrianism, and which some Muslims consider devil worship -- have long faced persecution, though by comparison ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. Kurdistan Regional Government adviser Nazand Begikhani, for instance, has said Yazidi ""women have been treated like cattle, ... subjected to physical and sexual violence, including systematic rape and sex slavery."" Yazidi children haven't fared much better at the hands of ISIS. An earlier U.N. report described how militants rounded up all Yazidi males ""older than 10 years of age at the local school, took them outside the village by pickup trucks, and shot them."" The U.N. report, while alarming, isn't surprising considering all the accounts of ISIS' brutality in recent years. The self-proclaimed Islamic State has made a name for itself -- in its quest to form a vast caliphate governed under a strict version of Sharia law -- both through its conquests and its savagery. The savagery was on display again this week with the release of video showing Jordanian pilot Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh being burned to death, the latest example of ISIS not just executing its captives but broadcasting such violence as propaganda. While there was no response specifically to the U.N. report, ISIS has in the past attempted to justify atrocities -- including the enslaving, raping and selling of captives -- as being done in God's name. The terror group printed a pamphlet last fall, then distributed it in Mosul in December, entitled ""Questions and Answers on Female Slaves and their Freedom."" It spells out rationales for having sex with prepubescent girls and generally capturing those who are ""nonbelievers,"" i.e. they don't subscribe to ISIS' extreme take on Islam. ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK . As such, the ISIS document claims, ""It is permissible to buy, sell or give as a gift female captives and slaves, for they are merely property."" The U.N. report wasn't just critical of ISIS. It also urged the Iraqi government -- which, along with neighboring Syria, is fighting the Islamist extremist group -- to do more to protect children, saying the Iraqi forces are contributing to the problem. A ""very large number of children"" have been killed and severely injured by airstrikes, shelling and military operations by Iraqi forces, the report said. Still, it's ISIS that is beneath all others involved in the fray when it comes to barbarity. Not only has the group not apologized for its actions, but it's reveled in them. And it's used to children to drive home this point. An ISIS propaganda video released last month -- one that CNN could not independently verify -- shows a boy with a pistol apparently shooting two men in the back of the head. The boy then stands over one of the bodies, fires two more times, and later raises his pistol high. And last August, a photo posted to Twitter from an ISIS stronghold showed a 7-year-old boy holding a man's severed head and his father's words, ""That's my boy."" ISIS has featured children as fighters before, calling them the ""cubs of the caliphate"" (the adult jihadis call each other ""lions"") and has encouraged foreign fighters to bring their families. It has taken over schools to indoctrinate children. Human Rights Watch claims ISIS and other extremist groups ""have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions."" That children celebrate such violence is horrifying enough, as evidenced by an ISIS video showing a young boy watching al-Kasasbeh's killing. Since the propaganda video is carefully orchestrated, CNN has no way of knowing whether the boy was coerced. In it, the child looks up as if in awe and says he would ""burn the pilot"" himself if he had a chance. He adds, ""All Arab tyrants should also be burned.""

"(CNN)North Korea on Tuesday served up its latest round of threats against the United States, saying it plans to place military units tasked with targeting U.S. bases under combat ready status. The Supreme Command of the North Korean military said it ""will put on the highest alert all the field artillery units including strategic rocket units and long-range artillery units, which are assigned to strike bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops in the U.S. mainland and on Hawaii and Guam and other operational zone in the Pacific, as well as all the enemy targets in South Korea and its vicinity."" Angered by tougher U.N. sanctions and joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea, Pyongyang has issued a range of bombastic threats in recent weeks. North Korea's threats: 5 things to know . The announcement this month by the United States that its B-52 bombers were making flights over South Korea as part of the military exercises particularly enraged the North, which warned of reprisals if the sorties continued. The North Korean military statement Tuesday, carried by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, referred to the B-52 flights again, saying they had taken place over South Korea on Monday. The U.S. Department of Defense responded to the North's latest saber-rattling by reiterating its confidence that it can fend off whatever the regime of Kim Jong Un can come up with. ""The U.S. is fully capable of defending ourselves and our allies against an attack"" by North Korea, said Lt. Jack Miller, a Pentagon spokesman. ""We are firmly committed to defending the Republic of Korea and Japan,"" he added, using the official name for South Korea. Island faces North Korean threat up close . U.S. and South Korean generals on Friday signed a new contingency plan ""designed to counter future North Korean provocations."" Military officials from the two allies developed the plan after North Korea shelled South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island in 2010, killing four people. Weeks of saber-rattling . The slew of fiery rhetoric from Pyongyang in the past few weeks has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea, as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is no longer valid. Most observers say North Korea is still years away from having the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead on a missile, but it does have plenty of conventional military firepower, including medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry high explosives for hundreds of miles. Behind the veil: A rare look at life in North Korea . The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula came after the North carried out a long-range rocket launch in December and an underground nuclear test last month, prompting the U.N. Security Council to step up sanctions on the secretive regime. The North Korean statement Tuesday also referred to the sinking of a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, which took place three years ago to the day, killing 46 sailors. South Korea blamed the North for the attack, accusations that Pyongyang has repeatedly denied. ""The present South Korean puppet authorities tried to link the Cheonan sinking case with the DPRK and shift the blame for the Yeonpyeong Island shelling on to the DPRK,"" the statement said, using the shortened version of the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

"Dr. John W.V. Cordice, the surgeon who operated on Dr. Martin Luther King after he was stabbed in Harlem in 1958, died Sunday in Iowa, according to Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the agency that oversees Harlem Hospital, where King was operated on.  Cordice was 95. Cordice, along with Aubre C. Maynard, led the team of surgeons that operated on King after he was stabbed with a letter opener at a book signing in Harlem, according to the statement released Tuesday. King's critical condition mandated that he be transferred to the nearest hospital, where Cordice and his team extracted the letter opener, according to a statement from New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation. King was discharged from the hospital 14 days later. In a statement, HHC President Alan Aviles called Cordice ""a brilliant clinical practitioner, a wise and thoughtful teacher, and a man of deep and abiding kindness and quiet modesty."" Cordice practiced medicine in Harlem for more than 40 years, according to the HHC statement. In a statement, Cordice's family members said they are going through a difficult time.

"(CNN)Maybe you got the email, too? It landed in my inbox at 1:58 a.m. on Thursday. ""To Our Members: . Safeguarding your personal, financial and medical information is one of our top priorities, and because of that, we have state-of-the-art information security systems to protect your data."" Oh, good. Nice to know. <starts to click ""delete""> . ""However, despite our efforts ... Umm ... ""...Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield was the target of a very sophisticated external cyber attack."" Wait, what the ... ""These attackers gained unauthorized access to Anthem's IT system and have obtained personal information from our current and former members such as their names, birthdays, medical IDs/social security numbers, street addresses, e-mail addresses and employment information, including income data."" Social Security! Income data! &#^@! It's not the first email you want to open in the morning. The only consolation, I suppose, is that I'm far from alone. Anthem, which is the second largest health insurer in the United States, said on Thursday that as many as 80 million customer records were stolen. The breach ""ranks among the largest in corporate history,"" writes CNNMoney. I don't know about the other 79,999,999 of you, but it's a strange feeling (right?) to all of a sudden be part of a news story like this. We read about these data breaches all the time -- from Home Depot, Target, Sony. Unless you're connected to them personally, though, they tend to zip by, too numerous and massive to process. But when it's your inbox, your data, something about it feels different. Yeah, that's selfish. But it was enough of a motivator for me to call up a couple data security experts to dig into this a little bit. My goal, like any vindictive jerk: Figure out who to blame. The first, logical inclination, I figured, was to blame Anthem, itself. Shouldn't this company, with its Orwellian emails, have done more with its ""state-of-the-art information security system"" to try to prevent an attack? Couldn't it have implemented a super state-of-the-art system or something? I found that view echoed by Paul Henry, a senior instructor at the SANS Institute, an information security training company. Henry told me he gets really annoyed when companies like Anthem claim that they were the victims of a ""very sophisticated"" hack. Most of the time, he said, they're not sophisticated at all. The hackers ""don't need to be bigger-better-faster because we're not doing the basics"" to protect customer data, he said. ""That's the saddest part of all of this. The vast majority of these incidents could have been completely prevented if (the companies who store data) had been doing the basics."" Aha! Villain identified! Column filed! But, of course, it's not quite so simple. Even if you wanted to blame Anthem, proving the company acted negligently in protecting data could be tricky. Henry told me the U.S. Federal Trade Commission could find that Anthem failed to institute industry ""best practices"" -- as defined by the industry, he said -- and force them to pay a fine. (If medical records were stolen, and there's no indication they were, then HIPAA laws governing medical records could be used to levy fines, too, he said.) Another school of thought, however, holds that hackers always will be able to break into secure systems. I called someone with that point of view and Avivah Litan, a cyber security analyst at Gartner, said she doesn't think it's fair to blame Anthem for the stolen data. ""They did the best they could,"" she told me. ""It's amazing they caught (the hack) on their own."" Anthem also did the right thing by alerting me and other customers, she said. That will make it harder for the hackers to sell and then exploit the data, at least right now, while people are watching. Plus, she said, and this is the argument that worked best on me, blaming Anthem doesn't accomplish much for me the consumer. (Remember: we care about me here. I'm the one who got the email ...) If your credit card data is stolen, she said, there are easy ways to rectify the situation. You call the bank and they refund the money, passing on costs to retailers. In the case of personal data breaches like this one, however, there's essentially no one to blame. Or no one -- no entity -- who can help you. ""The government should really have some sort of agency where you just call up and you say, 'I had this bad thing happen' -- and they'll just fix it for you. And they'll give you the money back,"" she said. ""It ain't never gonna work like that, but that's the way it should be."" Meanwhile, she said, this is a very serious hack. If she were an Anthem customer, the hackers have ""my name, social, date of birth, address,"" she explained. ""To me, and I'm a security expert, that's worth more than a credit card. There's all kind of damage that can happen ... Someone could take over my Amazon account. They could call the call center and take money out of my 401(k). They could file a tax refund in my name. And all those things are really hard to recover from."" There's more. ""They could go out and create a fake driver's license and commit a crime. They could take all that information and fake a birth certificate and go to the DMV ..."" OK, we've got it. So, back to the main question here: Who to blame? Both security experts did share one answer: the Social Security number itself. ""We should simply publish everyone's Social Security number (online) so it can't be used, effectively,"" by hackers, said Henry. If that number loses its value, no one would want to steal it. Litan more or less agrees. ""You need to make this data useless when it's stolen,"" she said. ""That's the answer."" I like this line of thinking. And Litan explained to me that there may be a way for health care companies, and other industries, to use a hard-to-crack proxy for a Social Security number in place of the real thing. If these companies never store our most-sensitive data in their records, then it's of no use. She cited Apple's mobile payment system as a potential technological model. Regulators should look to such technologies as they continue to figure out how to make consumer data safer. We're helpless in this situation -- unable to understand exactly how and where our data is being stored. And unlike email and social media accounts, where stronger passwords and two-step verification systems help, there's no way consumers can rework the IT infrastructure of a major company like Anthem. We're basically at their mercy. More needs to be done to protect us. Whether that's holding companies more accountable, as Henry suggests. Or making this data worthless to criminals. Otherwise, we're left to end conversations with security experts like this. ""Good luck with your stolen identity!"" Litan told me. And then we hung up.","John Sutter tries to figure out who to blame for the Anthem data breach .

"(CNN)Pope Francis has stirred up a hornet's nest with remarks in which he said it's OK for parents to spank children, so long as they do it with dignity. The comments came in his general audience Wednesday in St. Peter's Square, when Francis was talking about the importance of a good father within a family. ""I once heard at a wedding a father say, 'I sometimes have to hit my children a little but never in the face, so as to not demean them.' How nice, I thought, he has a sense of dignity,"" the Pope said. ""When he punishes, he does it right and moves on."" CNN Parents: OK to discipline another parent's child? The principle of not humiliating the child while doling out the punishment appears to be central to the Pope's justification of spanking, as is that of forgiveness. ""A good father knows how to wait and knows how to forgive from the bottom of his heart. Of course he can also discipline with a firm hand: he's not weak, submissive, sentimental,"" he said. ""This father knows how to discipline without demeaning; he knows how to protect without restraint."" The issue of corporal punishment for children is divisive in many countries, and the Pope's remarks prompted an outpouring of both support and criticism on social media. Father Thomas Rosica, a Vatican spokesman, told CNN that it was important not to take the Pope's words out of context -- and that there was an important distinction to be made between discipline and punishment. ""It's about time that we stop and allow the Pope to speak the language of most ordinary people, especially parents, who understand the Pope far better than those who parse every single word and statement that comes out of his mouth!"" he said. Opinion: Spanking isn't child abuse; it's common sense . ""Let us not read into the Pope's words anything other than what is there. He speaks constantly of mercy and tenderness. He speaks as a pastor and loving father figure who loves children and wants the best for them."" Francis showed this affection in a Google Hangout with disabled children from around the world Thursday, Rosica added, and ""speaks about disciplining children and never punishing them."" The pontiff also met with street children on a visit to a shelter in the Philippines last month. According to the website of the Global Alliance to End Corporal Punishment of Children, children in at least 43 states are protected by law from all corporal punishment. CNN Parents: The cultural, generational and religious roots to spanking . They include more than 20 European nations, as well as countries in Africa and Latin America. The United States is not one of the nations where corporal punishment is banned, but an anti-spanking movement has gained momentum there. The case of NFL star Adrian Peterson, given probation, a fine and community service in November after he admitted whipping his 4-year-old son, stirred up the debate. The NFL also suspended the Minnesota Vikings star running back for the rest of the season.

"(CNN)Last week, I had the privilege to greet a group of about 100 Ebola survivors who were meeting at the ELWA Hospital chapel: the very structure that, seven months ago, was Monrovia's first Ebola treatment unit. The group was diverse — elderly, young people, even little children.  Some educated, some not.  Roughly equal numbers of men and women; some dressed up in nice clothes, some in T-shirts, shorts and flip-flops.  Some were clearly feeling happy just to have survived Ebola, with smiles on their faces, while others looked like they were still experiencing some of the trauma and stigma of Ebola: faces downcast, not making eye contact. As I met them, tears welled up in my eyes. These people had gotten through Ebola just like I had, but here in Liberia, where the resources, staff and treatment available were so much more limited. The gathering was initiated by the Christian Health Association of Liberia, a local nongovernmental organization that has received funding to help Ebola survivors. They were meeting with some of the survivors from the ELWA 2 Ebola Treatment Unit in order to share a modest cash benefit, intended to help survivors rebuild their lives: replacing mattresses, clothes, furniture and phones, finding new employment, and trying to fit back into their communities. They also met with Dr. John Fankhauser, another missionary doctor at ELWA. He let them know about a free survivors' clinic at ELWA Hospital to address complications of Ebola, such as nerve damage or vision problems. On the national level, the Ebola Survivors Association of Liberia is well-organized, considering the brief time frame. It has a president, who presented me with his business card at the meeting. There are estimated to be about 1,500 Ebola survivors in Liberia. In partnership with several international organizations, the association advocates for survivors' mental and physical needs, and educates the public about Ebola survivors to help reduce stigma. A few days earlier, I had met with another group of survivors: the ELWA Hospital Support Group for People Living with HIV/AIDS. This was quite a different meeting. There were about 15 people there, many of whom I know well from having worked with them and treated them over the years since the program began in 2001. Now that the Ebola crisis is subsiding, they want to revitalize the group, which at times has had 80 to 100 people involved. In the past, ELWA Hospital staff ran the support group and decided how to facilitate its activities, using funds from SIM.   But now these long-term clients — they are all on anti-retroviral therapy,  some for years — want to become more independent, to be given more discretion to strategize and make decisions about how to use funding that is available. This was such an interesting and eye-opening discussion for me. Early on, when we were just starting ELWA's treatment program for HIV, many of these clients were quite ill, and needed nutritional support, medication and health care, and help with transportation to appointments and support group meetings. Now the group has matured: Many are very stable on their medication and really thriving. At this stage, they feel the need to be treated as equal partners rather than only recipients of charity. They want more input as to how the group might benefit from funds that come in. When a donation was made by SIM to the group about six weeks ago, they chose to make soap for laundry and dishes from locally sourced lye and palm oil, to sell it as a fundraising activity. The balls of soap sell for about 12 cents each.  The group has sold most of the first batch, and they are projecting a profit of about 25% over the cost of raw materials. They want to continue soap production, using the profits to help members of the group start businesses or attend college or other training programs. When I see the spark of initiative and determination in these people who were once so sick and discouraged with their condition, I get a new sense of what might be possible for them. What were the key ingredients in developing that spark?  Our relationship started with unconditional love, and a real personal connection, as well as provision for some key practical needs, including sound medical care. And now it requires a readiness, and a means, to shift from charity to partnership. During the West African Ebola crisis, we have seen that Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, some of the least developed nations on the continent, did not have the capacity to fight the epidemic on their own. While the initial response to Ebola required massive direct aid and assistance, let's hope that we can also move on to real partnership in helping develop a locally led and driven health system that can do better at protecting its people from the next outbreak.","Dr. Richard Sacra got to meet with fellow Ebola survivors who are trying to put their lives back together .

"(CNN)Turns out, talking to strangers is not so bad after all. At least for a North Carolina teen, who went to Target to look for a clip-on tie for a job interview. Instead, he became the subject of a touching moment and a viral photo. Audrey Mark told CNN affiliate WTVD she was shopping at a store in Raleigh on Wednesday when she noticed something unusual. ""I see this young teen being hovered over by this Target employee,"" Mark said. Curious, she got closer to see what was going on. The employee was not just tying the teen's tie, he was imparting some wisdom as well. ""I hear him peppering him with all this advice on interview skills and handshakes,"" she told the affiliate. Employee Cathy Scott said the teen walked into the store looking for a tie. ""I asked him if he needed help, and he told me he needed clip-on ties,"" Scott told the affiliate. ""We didn't have any."" She turned to her co-worker, Dennis Roberts, and asked him if he knew how to tie a regular tie. He said yes, so the teen bought one and handed it to Roberts. But Scott and Roberts went a step further and prepared the teen for his interview. ""We said, 'Make sure you look him in the eye.' I'm saying, 'Make sure you give him a firm handshake,' and she showed him ... he tucked his shirt in,"" Roberts said. Mark snapped away. ""It was a very quiet, simple moment, but it was very profound,"" she told the affiliate. ""He leaves and all these Target employees are screaming 'Bye! Good luck! Tell us how it went.' I got so emotional. I got teary."" But it didn't just end there. A day later, a Target team went to a nearby Chick-fil-A, where the teen interviewed, according to the affiliate. Though they didn't know his identity, they shared their experience with the restaurant's manager. The teen appears to have had a good initial interview at the restaurant. He's 15 and ""definitely left a memorable impression,"" said David Langston, operator of the Chick-fil-A. ""We have a three-part interview process, and we are inviting him back to have his second interview,"" Langston said. ""He's a really nice kid.

"London (CNN)British former pop star Gary Glitter has been found guilty of child sex abuse for crimes he committed more than three decades ago. The 70-year-old Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was convicted Thursday of one count of attempted rape of a girl under the age of 13, one count of having sex with a girl under the age of 13, and four counts of indecent assault against girls, two aged under 13 and two aged under 16. The six offenses were committed against three victims between 1975 and 1980. Glitter is due to be sentenced on February 27. Glitter was known as a ""glam rocker"" in the 1970s for his flamboyant clothes and performing style. He sold  18 million records with hits like ""I'm the Leader of the Gang,"" ""I Love You Love Me Love"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll."" Detective Chief Inspector Michael Orchard of London's Metropolitan Police praised the courage of the victims in coming forward to police, years after the crimes were committed, in a statement after the verdict. ""Paul Gadd has shown himself to be a habitual sexual predator, who took advantage of the star status afforded to him by targeting young girls who trusted him and were in awe of his fame,"" Orchard said. ""His lack of remorse and defense that the victims were lying make his crimes all the more indefensible. I am pleased the jury was able to see through this."" Glitter has been prosecuted previously on sex charges. In 1999, he admitted possessing child pornography and was jailed for four months. While living in Vietnam, he was convicted of sex offenses against young girls and jailed for nearly three years before being deported to England. Glitter is the latest celebrity to be accused or convicted of historic sex offenses. Radio and television star Jimmy Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, was revealed after his death to have been one of Britain's most prolific sex offenders. British police say more than 200 victims -- aged between five and 75 -- have been identified. Last year celebrity publicist Max Clifford was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for assaults on girls, while Australian entertainer Rolf Harris was jailed for five years for indecent assaults against four girls.

"It's official: According to the Honduran elections authority, Juan Orlando Hernandez won the Central American country's presidential vote. With 80% of votes counted, officials said, Hernandez had secured more than 35% of the vote, placing him 6 percentage points ahead of his closest competitor. ""These figures that we are releasing today clearly indicate that the winner of the general elections is Juan Orlando Hernandez, candidate from the (ruling) National Party of Honduras,"" said David Matamoros Batson, president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.

"(CNN)On the glass entrance to the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you'll find all the usual museum particulars: Closed Monday, here's our website, find us on Twitter, etc. And then this: ""No Weapons Allowed Except Guitars."" It's tribute to the fact that Guthrie -- who wrote ""This Land is Your Land"" and who basically was Bob Dylan before Bob Dylan was Bob Dylan -- used folk music to battle indifference to social inequities in the 1930s and '40s. His stories were those of Dust Bowl refugees fleeing the Great Plains for California; of underpaid workers; of people who believed in the promise and spirit of America but who the country sold short. ""I'm too sober to foreclose on a widow."" That's from one of his notebooks at the Center. We need more Woody Guthrie today. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama is expected, once again, to make a plea for the country to address its blemish that's bigger than the one in Bieber's mug shot: income inequality. As was the case in Guthrie's time, we're living in two Americas, not one. In the rich America, the one inhabited by members of Congress, a majority of whom are now millionaires, finding work and living comfortably is easy as ever. In poorer America, jobs are scarce and pay nothing close to a living wage. The middle has hollowed out. Our economy has been Grand Canyoning since the late 1970s. Measured by the wonky gini coefficient, the United States is now more economically split than countries like Venezuela, Russia and the United Kingdom. We're among the worst in the developed world. You probably don't need me to tell you that. There are hundreds of articles on this subject, on every major website. And the president, to his credit, has brought this up again and again. In his 2012 State of the Union, he called income inequality ""the defining issue of our time."" The problem: No one's listening. Not really. His job approval rating is at 40%, according to Gallup, for a variety of reasons. And, let's face it, the State of the Union can be a snoozefest. Viewership, according to Nielsen, is steadily down over Obama's presidency, from 52.4 million viewers in 2009 to 33.5 million in 2013, a decline of 36%. And half the fun of the State of the Union in the GIF era is watching to see if ""Grumpy Cat"" John Boehner is capable of emotion and what the Supreme Court justices might be muttering to themselves. People understand income inequality is a thing, now. And maybe that's a start. But I'd argue few understand why, beyond the numbers, it really matters. That's where defiant songwriters like Guthrie should come in. As Facebook was quick to tell me, contenders for the title of modern Woody Guthrie do exist. Suggestions you posted there ranged from Kanye West to The Knife, a Swedish electronic group, and John Fullbright, a singer-songwriter from Oklahoma. And it was easy enough to see music still has a social edge if you watched the Grammy Awards on Sunday. I was moved by Macklemore's performance of ""Same Love,"" during which several couples, gay and straight, were married. Meanwhile, New Zealand's Lorde won song of the year for ""Royals,"" which touches on the class divide and wealth. Chorus: ""We will never be Royals. It don't run in our blood."" We need more brave artists like those in our culture. When I visited the Woody Guthrie Center in December, I saw a copy of the original manuscript to his most famous song, ""This Land Is Your Land."" It's the kind of thing you almost don't stop to look at, because you figure you know the words. ""This land was made for you and me."" But a friend pointed out two original verses that, I've since read, were written in 1940 but were omitted from the popular recording in 1944. They're also the verses with real staying power. Here they are, as archived by woodyguthrie.org: . As I went walking I saw a sign there And on the sign it said ""No Trespassing."" But on the other side it didn't say nothing, That side was made for you and me. In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people, By the relief office I seen my people; As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking Is this land made for you and me? No wonder the Occupiers adopted Guthrie as a folk hero. If only they had his wit and vision, maybe the rest of us would have paid more attention. The ""I seen my people"" verse, the song's sixth, is the most haunting and relevant in 2014. The problem today, as I see it, is that most of us haven't seen our people. This is the real threat of income inequality: Not that some people are rich and the everyone else is jealous of them, as the Romney camp postulated, but that the gap between the haves and have-nots has grown so wide that we don't see each other. I witnessed this last year on a trip to the ""most unequal place in America,"" East Carroll Parish, Louisiana. The rich are on one side of a lake in that parish; the poor the other. There are people who know almost nothing of how the other side lives. Along with gaps in income come gaps in empathy and trust. Violence, mental illness and all sorts of social ills, can follow, as researchers argue in a powerful book called ""The Spirit Level: Why Greater Equality Makes Societies Stronger."" Just look to Scandinavia to see relative equality is more harmonious. These gaps emerge in communities across America. Rich and poor live side by side in large cities, but we still remain invisible -- intentionally so, painfully so. Atlanta, where I live, reportedly bulldozed a tent camp under a major interstate this month. Officials cited safety reasons. That it was unsightly and commonly seen could well have had something to do with it, too. Those of us who are lucky to be comfortably employed are too quick to forget about what it's like to really struggle. And we don't like to see the people who are struggling. As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking Is this land made for you and me? America is comfortable saying this is a land made ... for me. Our challenge: Realizing that this country only remains the land of opportunity if it works for all of us. Not just the pop stars, most of whom are so obsessed with their own fame and gratification that they barely give a nod to reality; not just for Wall Street; and not just for those of us lucky to have an education, health care and housing. For all of us. ""I am out to sing songs that will prove to you that this is your world,"" Guthrie once said. Take that as a challenge.

"New Delhi (CNN)""Hail Modi. Hail Modi"" Dozens surround one man, chanting pro-Modi slogans. But the man at the center of attention is Abhinandan Pathak, also known as Nandan Modi -- the Indian PM, Narendra Modi's lookalike. ""I am sure I must have done a lot of good deeds in my previous lives (so) that God has made me look like Mr. Modi. I literally worship him every day and I believe Mr. Modi is an avatar of God,"" says Pathak. As Pathak makes his way into an election rally where Narendra Modi is expected to arrive, more crowds besiege him. His aides struggle to keep them away. People take selfies, children cheer after him. Some even tug his clothes. The scene becomes so chaotic, police are forced to step in. ""A lot of people love Mr. Modi and when they see me they think I am him and respect me in the same way,"" Pathak says. ""I'm a poor man but look around me, look how many people are trying to take photos."" Donning an orange turban and saffron stole, and with a white lotus badge, Modi's party's emblem, neatly pinned to his traditional Indian waistcoat, he really does look like the Indian premier. And when he pulls a similar voice and gesticulates, it is hard to believe Abhinandan Pathak is not the real deal. ""He is a fake one. Don't get fooled,"" people whisper to each other. Pathak traveled the 170km to New Delhi on his bicycle from Saharanpur, a remote town in Northern India, to campaign for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Delhi Assembly elections. A school teacher by profession, Pathak left his career one year ago to fully devote himself to spread Modi's message of development and Hinduism around India. ""When I used to have dinner at home and Modi used to be giving a speech, my daughters would say, 'Look dad, you're on TV giving a speech,' and even my wife started saying 'Look, you give such good speeches.' ""Then I realized that God has asked me to provide service to Modi with full belief,"" Pathak says. As Modi makes his entry to the rally, Pathak bows down and starts waving. Tears roll down his cheeks. Pathak has never met Modi in person. ""Even if I don't ever get to meet him,  I'll be totally fine,"" Pathak says. "" Whenever I want to meet him, I just close my eyes and he comes into my imagination. I have pledged myself that I'll fight for Mr. Modi's dream all my life even if I am never recognized by him."" All the physical similarities can be problematic thing. Pathak recalls an incident last year where a group pulled a sword on him. ""There are few people who still blame Mr. Modi for Muslim deaths in Hindu-Muslim riots when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat, and some of them vent their anger at me instead."" Pathak has written a letter to the Prime Minister asking for security.  Last month he sent yet another letter. ""People grab me all the time, and have torn some five dozen of my outfits in the process. So, I have written a letter to Mr Modi saying -- sir, I can't afford to buy new clothes every day, I request you to send me your old clothes. "" Pathak has not received a response yet. As Modi finishes his speech and leaves the rally, so does Pathak. Again the crowds follow him. ""Hail Mother India."" ""Hail Modi.""","The bearded man in the orange waistcoat and white lotus badge is used to getting mobbed -- but he isn't the Indian PM, Narendra Modi.

"(CNN) -- Southwest Airlines is taking its rewards program from what one industry expert calls ""anemic"" to competitive with the unveiling of an improved Rapid Rewards program. ""This is very big,"" Tim Winship, editor-at-large for SmarterTravel.com said of the changes, which are aimed at making it easier for members to earn and redeem points. ""This move by Southwest is going to prompt a lot of internal discussion at the major airlines about what it means to them, what their competitive response should be and then so on,"" Winship said. One of the key changes in Rapid Rewards is that members can now redeem points on every seat, every day and on every flight with no blackout dates or seat restrictions. As long as members fly or use a partner once every two years, their points will never expire. The changes, which will officially launch on March 1, will improve on Southwest's current rewards program, according to a press release on Southwest's website. ""We took our award-winning program and made it even better by giving our members more flexibility and control over how and when they earn and redeem their points,"" Gary Kelly, Southwest's chairman, president and CEO, said in the press release. ""We know our Customers are going to appreciate the fact that their points don't expire and every seat on every flight is a reward seat."" Work began on improving Southwest's frequent-flier program several years ago, and Ryan Green, senior director of customer loyalty and partnerships for Southwest, called it the ""single biggest new product launch in our company's history,"" in a blog post he wrote on the airline's website. ""We conducted months of customer surveys, focus groups, and research to find out what travelers like about our current program, what they don't like, and what they'd like to see changed,"" Green wrote. Rapid Rewards members earn points based on the price of the flight and the type of fare purchased. For example, a one-way Anytime flight from San Francisco, California, to Denver, Colorado, would cost $257 and leave the passenger with 2,570 points, according to the point simulator on Southwest's website. Flying Business Select on that same flight would give the member 3,324 points and flying Wanna Get Away would garner 948 points. Buying a roundtrip ticket doubles those points. To figure out when you'll be able to redeem a free flight, take your total amount of points and divide by 120, 100 or 60, depending on which fare type you plan to purchase. Earn or use points at least once every 24 months, and you'll keep your points forever; a perk that Winship said is a huge improvement from Southwest's current system, which erases any points not used within two years. ""You had to earn 16 credits in 24 months, or else there was really no point of participating in the program at all,"" he said. ""The credits would be falling off the back end as you're earning them on the front end."" By changing the way rewards are calculated --  by revenue rather than miles -- Southwest is going in a direction that other airlines will be hard-pressed to follow. Airlines' frequent-flier programs are enormous, and tie in with other processes and services that the airlines offer, Winship said. They'd have to redo reservations software and websites and retrain employees to go to a different system. ""It's an enormous top-to-bottom undertaking,"" Winship said. ""I just don't think that's in the cards for other airlines right now.""","Southwest has unveiled an improved Rapid Rewards program .

"The Texas teen facing a felony terrorism charge over an alleged threat on Facebook has been released on bail after an anonymous donor posted a $500,000 bond. Justin Carter, 19, had spent five months in prison for posting, during an argument about a video game, what he said was a sarcastic comment about how he was going to ""shoot up a kindergarten."" ""I just think it got taken out of context, and it's been blown out of proportion,"" Carter told Kate Bolduan on ""New Day,"" CNN's morning show. The brief interview marked Carter's first public comments since he was jailed in February. Carter's case has received widespread media attention and alarmed free-speech activists. His arrest came amid heightened concerns over school violence since December's mass shootings at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. In February, Carter and a friend were arguing on Facebook with someone else over the online video game ""League of Legends."" His father told CNN that other gamer called Justin crazy and his son responded with sarcasm. According to court documents, Justin wrote, ""I'm f***ed in the head alright. I think I'ma (sic) shoot up a kindergarten and watch the blood of the innocent rain down and eat the beating heart of one of them."" Jack Carter said his son followed the claim with ""LOL"" and ""J/K"" -- indicating that the comment wasn't serious. ""Any clear reading and full reading of the context of that statement would make it obvious that this was just a sarcastic joke,"" Chad Van Brunt, one of Carter's attorneys, told CNN on Friday. ""If we get to trial ... it's just going to be abundantly clear, if it's not already."" Authorities said someone reported the comment -- which came about two months after the mass killings at Sandy Hook Elementary School -- leading to Carter's arrest February 21 on a felony charge of making terroristic threats. In Texas, that carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison. The teen had remained in jail because Jack Carter and his wife, Jennifer, said they couldn't afford to post the bond required to free their son. The family's attorney, Don Flanary, told CNN that Justin Carter had suffered abuse while behind bars, and his parents had expressed concerns about his safety. Carter was released Thursday to his home near New Braunfels, Texas, after an unnamed donor came forward and posted the bond, Flanary said. He said the donor wishes to remain anonymous. ""For now I'm over-the-moon happy. I just want to spend all my time talking to him and looking at him,"" mother Jennifer Carter told CNN on Friday. ""There's been a lot of hugs going around and crying. We don't have to worry anymore about him being hurt (in jail) ... and for any parent that's just such a relief."" An online petition seeking Justin Carter's release from jail had received more than 126,000 signatures. A pretrial hearing for Carter is scheduled August 12. Flanary told CNN he will be filing a motion to dismiss the charges because they violate Carter's First Amendment rights. The Comal County district attorney's office, which is prosecuting the case, has not responded to CNN's requests for comment. The case is viewed by some as a cautionary tale about the repercussions of controversial statements posted online. Asked by CNN's Bolduan what he might have done differently, Carter said, ""I certainly would have thought a lot more about what I said and how permanent my writing -- and everyone's writing -- is (on the Internet). People should be very, very careful of what they say. It's being recorded all the time, if you say it on any website, anywhere. ""And you can get in trouble for something that's not something you should get in trouble for. I just want people to be warned.""","Texas teen facing a terrorism charge over an alleged threat on Facebook is free on bail .

"(CNN)Hiccups. 3 facts: We all get them. They are annoying. They will go away. Well, Week one of the CNN Fit Nation Challenge has presented me with some hiccups. My hiccups started just before Christmas; my right knee started aching. Disclaimer:  I am 67.  Stuff happens! The ache seemed to be no big deal.  A little ibuprofen and I felt pretty good. I was still going to the gym, doing a little (very little) on my treadmill, and started swimming this January 7. I went to a sports medicine doctor on January 15 and was given naproxen, which worked very well. I was scheduled to return to the doctor February 5. Kick-off Weekend started on January 21. With my new painkiller friend, I was able to keep up with everything and loved every minute of it. I was a bit achy, but darn it, I was not going to let it affect this amazing time. Plus, I didn't want it to show -- no big deal, the pain will go away. What a weekend -- it was amazing, awesome, really. Like I tell people, it was like Christmas, only with better workouts! And I had fantastic teammates. We bonded. We laughed. We cried. January 25, our last day together, we swam and then we hiked up Stone Mountain. But as the old saying goes, ""What goes up must come down."" There was no denying that my knee hurt. I figured it would go away, as all hiccups do (see hiccup facts above). There is no time for babying it. We had lunch and then a lovely ride to the airport with CNN's medical team. While on the flight on Sunday, I started feeling an itchy area on the back of my leg. ""It's a bug bite,"" I'm thinking. Next morning, it is large and red. Tuesday morning, I awoke to snow. I checked the area on my leg and it was blistered. My mind went to ""brown recluse spider bite.""  Everything was closed (snow in South Jersey closes everything) so I called a dear friend whose husband is a physician. He took one look at it and pronounced. ""You have shingles."" I was on meds by noon. But there was no swimming until the blistering was gone.  OK, so I can't run and now I can't swim. Hiccups on hiccups. Doctors did an MRI on it January 28. Since I am a nurse (uh, with a few control issues), I always like to see the test results. They came in the mail January 30. I'd had a gym/swim (blisters gone) morning and felt great, thanks to my buddy naproxen, and had been feeling happy. But the results that came in the mail, well: . I have a large medial meniscus tear, Baker's cyst, enchondroma (a benign cartilage tumor). Oh yeah, the hiccups just got real. I emailed the Fit Nation team managers. ""Stay calm,"" they told me, ""we'll get through this."" We will. The good news in all this:  It's Week 1 and, like all hiccups, this will go away. I foresee doctor visits in my future and maybe a ""procedure,"" but these hiccups will go away. Stay tuned.","At 67, Linda Garrett is the oldest person to have ever joined the Fit Nation team .

"Summer could not have come soon enough for Lloret de Mar, a tourist resort north of Barcelona that is brimming with young travelers from Britain, Germany, France and Russia. By day, they flock to the main beach with its steep descent into the Mediterranean, and by night they crowd the streets lined with clubs called Londoner, Hot Spot or Zoo. Read more: The human cost of Spain's financial crisis . It is a scene repeated up and down Spain's extensive coastline along the Mediterranean, the Atlantic and its famous archipelagos, the Balearic and Canary Islands. Spain's economic crisis is in its sixth straight year yet tourism, worth 11% of GDP, is holding its own, one of the few bright spots on a bleak horizon. Summer, of course, is high season for tourism in Spain. The country is the world's fourth-largest tourist destination, behind France, the U.S., and China, according to the UN's World Tourism Organization, based in Madrid. Spain's tourism sector has recovered from a 9% drop -- a loss of five million tourists -- at the height of the crisis in 2009. Last year, it was back to pre-crisis levels of 57.7 million international visitors. Interactive: Is your nation fair? In part, due to an aggressive search for new markets, since the crisis not only forced Spaniards to cut back on vacations, but also slowed growth among British and German tourists, two of the traditional groups of visitors. Climent Guitart can tell you about that. He owns eight hotels in Lloret de Mar, and said, ""The last three years, we have tripled, multiplied by three, the number of Russians that come to this area."" Like Katerina Kharina and her friend, both choreographers from western Russia, whom we met on the beach. ""Here it's very different,"" Kharina said. ""There's no crisis in Russia. Here it's cheap. Russians like Spain."" And Spaniards like Lidia Gonzalez may thank the Russians for her new career as a maid at one of Guitart's hotels. A mother of two, the crisis forced Gonzalez out of her own hair salon business. Spain's next threat: Losing 20% of its economy . For months, she was among the 27% of Spanairds who are unemployed, until the hotel hired her for the summer. ""At last this job came up and there was relief for the whole family, to be able to pay some of our bills,"" said Gonzalez, taking a break from cleaning a room. She and many others have contracts just for the summer high season, and many worry what comes next. Some experts worry, too, about the tourism industry's future. They say that Spain's tourism formula has been the same for decades -- sun and sand. But with the economic crisis, there are growing calls for that to change. Read more: Cyprus for Easter? Just pack extra cash . A recent study by the Barcelona-based business school ESADE warns the country's beach towns lack ""strategic improvement plans,"" and ""follow a stagnated tourism model."" The report said 57% of the country's coastal towns offer less than five square meters of beach per tourist and remain highly seasonal, with 85% occupancy in August but barely 35% outside of the summer months. It called for new tourism products. Guitart's company is already pushing innovation, trying to go upscale with a five-star hotel and casino in Lloret de Mar, while also maintaining some of its more typical mass tourism hotels. A generation on the scrap heap: Can Europe be saved? ""We think that the clientele is diversifying a lot and in this area, I think we need a hotel with better standards, better quality,"" Guitart said. Breaking away from the popular tourism hotel model may be the future for Spain's industry, but it won't be easy. Lloret de Mar, like many others in Spain, still caters to mass tourism. Just ask the young foreigners on the beach by day and in the clubs by night.","Spain's economic crisis is in its sixth straight year yet tourism, worth 11% of GDP, is holding its own .

"(CNN)A 6-year-old boy in Missouri endured an emotional four-hour staged kidnapping because his family thought he was being too nice to people he didn't know, police said Thursday. The four people involved in the alleged plot -- the boy's mother, grandmother, aunt and a co-worker of the aunt -- have been charged with kidnapping and other felonies, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office said. ""Family members told investigators their primary intent was to educate the victim and felt they did nothing wrong,"" the press release said. During his reported ordeal the boy was lured Monday into a pickup after getting off his school bus, tied up, threatened with a gun, taken to a basement where his pants were removed, and told he could be sold into sex slavery, police said. The boy was told in the truck by Nathan Wynn Firoved, the aunt's co-worker, that he would never ""see his mommy again,"" and he would be ""nailed to the wall of a shed,"" the sheriff's statement said. The boy started to cry, police said, and Firoved, 23, showed the child a gun and said he would be harmed if he didn't stop bawling. Firoved used plastic bags to tie the child's hands and feet, police said. He took his jacket and covered the boy's head so he couldn't see. He guided the boy, still unable to see, into the basement of the mother's home, where his 38-year-old aunt took off the boy's pants, according to the sheriff's statement. ""The victim remained in the basement for some time before he was unbound and told to go upstairs, where the victim's family lectured him about stranger danger,"" the statement said. The suspects kept each other updated throughout the incident on cell phones, police said. The boy's 25-year-old mother, Elizabeth Hupp of Troy, is charged with felony kidnapping and felony abuse and neglect of a child. The 58-year-old grandmother, Rose Brewer; the aunt, Denise Kroutil; and Firoved are also charged with felonious restraint. The sheriff said Kroutil approached Firoved to kidnap her nephew to ""scare"" him because he was ""too nice"" to people. The statement alleges the mother and grandmother both agreed the boy should be kidnapped to teach him a lesson. The boy was placed into protective custody after he told school officials Wednesday what had happened to him. CNN has been trying to track down lawyers for the accused, but has been unable to locate information on the attorneys.

"A Florida woman who'd been sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in a ""stand your ground"" case accepted a plea bargain Monday that greatly reduces her sentence. The 20-year sentence came in a case in which the woman, a mother of three, said she was attempting to flee her husband on August 1, 2010, when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall. Nobody was struck by the bullet. After having the initial conviction overturned, Marissa Alexander was sentenced Monday to 65 days in jail on two counts of aggravated assault, with credit for time already served since her 2012 conviction. She will also serve two years under house arrest, and she agreed to wear a monitoring device. She will be sentenced later on a third aggravated assault count. ""She was sitting in prison with a 20-year sentence,"" one of her lawyers, Bruce Zimit, told CNN affiliate WJXT. ""Bottom line, she's going to be finishing the case with a three-year sentence plus whatever else the judge does at sentencing"" on the third count. Alexander said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her. Authorities said Alexander needed to be prosecuted because she fired in the direction of a room where children were standing. One of the prosecutors said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence, but Alexander chose to take her chances at trial, where a conviction would bring an enhanced sentence for the use of a firearm. A jury convicted her in Duval County and she was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Later an appeals court ordered a new trial because the trial judge mishandled instructions to the jury. The case focused the spotlight on Florida's ""stand your ground"" law after she unsuccessfully argued before her 2012 trial that she was immune to prosecution because of the law. Zimit said Alexander took the plea deal because ""She wanted to get the case over with and get back to her family.""","Marissa Alexander unsuccessfully invoked Florida's 'stand your ground' law .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN)Was an American hostage held in Syria killed by a Jordanian airstrike? That's what ISIS said in an online posting Friday, claiming that she died in the group's de facto capital, Raqqa. The posting Friday included a picture of a collapsed building and a claim that the woman -- confirmed by her family to be Kayla Mueller -- was being held there. But it did not show a body or provide any proof of death. Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said his country is looking into the claim. But, he said, ""we are highly skeptical"" because of ISIS's proven lack of credibility, and he questioned whether they could identify Jordanian warplanes so high in the sky or would hold a hostage in a ""weapon warehouse."" Later, he told CNN that ISIS uses ""these events to manipulate facts and to manipulate public opinion."" ""What we know about this terrorist organization is that they are liars when it comes to these things,"" al-Momani told ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" Interior Minister Hussein Majali also knocked down the report, calling it another ""PR stunt"" by ISIS. ""They tried to cause problems internally in Jordan and haven't succeeded,"" Majali said. ""They are now trying to drive a wedge between the coalition with this latest low PR stunt."" ISIS has held a number of hostages from the United States, Britain and Japan. As of now, at least two Westerners are thought to be in its custody: British journalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in a number of ISIS-produced videos, and the American woman, who is a 26-year-old aid worker. CNN has not previously named Mueller because of a request from the family. Friday night, her parents, Carl and Marsha Mueller of Prescott, Arizona, issued a statement asking the people holding their daughter to contact them. ""After going to extraordinary efforts to keep Kayla's name out of the media for so long, by securing the cooperation of journalists throughout the world, her name was released today. This news leaves us concerned, yet, we are still hopeful that Kayla is alive. We have sent you a private message and ask that you respond to us privately."" Asked about ISIS's claim of the woman's death in Raqqa, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that she could not ""confirm those reports in any way."" ""Obviously (we are) deeply concerned...,"" she added. ""We have not, at this point, seen anything that corroborates (ISIS's) claims."" The Prescott, Arizona, native was taken captive in August 2013 in Aleppo, Syria, after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital, her family said. Before that, Mueller graduated from Northern Arizona University and spent years traversing the world -- including India, Israel and her native Arizona, where she worked in an HIV/AIDS clinic and volunteered at a women's shelter. Her going to Syria in late 2012 with the Danish Refugee Council and Support to Life humanitarian agency aligned with that same mission to help others. What drove her? According to her family, Mueller would say, ""I find God in the suffering eyes reflected in mine. If this is how you are revealed to me, this is how you are revealed to me, this is how I will forever seek you."" According to a source close to the family, ISIS had set a deadline of August 13, 2014, for a 5 million Euro ransom to be paid or the group would kill her. When it comes to ISIS, there's plenty of reason for skepticism. Most of its hostages have been executed by the terror group, which then touted the grisly deaths online. That was the case with Jordanian pilot Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, who was captured by the Islamist extremist group after his F-16 fighter jet crashed while on an anti-ISIS mission near Raqqa. Video emerged Tuesday of ISIS burning him alive while he was locked in a cage. After the video came out, Jordanian officials said they have reason to believe al-Kasasbeh was actually killed in early January. That suggested that during the month between, while signaling its openness to a prisoner exchange with Jordan, ISIS had known all along that the pilot was dead. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank is among those very dubious that ISIS is telling the truth this time around, including its claim that the U.S. hostage was alone in the building and that no militants died in the strike. ""It seems very, very convenient for propaganda purposes, from the ISIS point of view,"" Cruickshank said. CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes also cast doubt. The buildings in the photo are damaged but there is no smoke. If the pictures were taken just after an airstrike, there would be smoke from smoldering debris, he said. Retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. James Reese, a CNN global affairs analyst, says it's plausible a hostage may have been inadvertently killed in Syria. ""We all know that (the U.S.-led military coalition's) intelligence ... in Syria is not as good as we have in Iraq now,"" Reese said. ""So it is plausible (Mueller was killed), and it could be unfortunate. But sometimes ... that happens in these wars."" Though there is no evidence Mueller was killed, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are working on a theory that she may have died weeks or months ago, sources said. Intelligence and law enforcement sources said the theory comes from prior intelligence on her captivity and ISIS' past behavior with hostages. The claim of the Jordanian airstrike killing her likely is a convenient way for ISIS to explain why it killed a woman, which could be problematic for its message, the sources said. This all comes in the wake of al-Kasasbeh's horrific killing, which spurred outrage in Jordan and beyond. His father, Safi al-Kasasbeh, afterward called on Jordan and its allies to ""annihilate"" ISIS. Government officials appear, at least in their rhetoric, determined to do just that. ""(Jordan will extract) revenge that equals the tragedy that has befallen the Jordanians,"" government spokesman Mohammad al-Momani said. On Thursday -- a day after executing two jihadists in retaliation -- the Middle Eastern nation launched its first strikes since the news emerged about al-Kasasbeh. A squadron of warplanes from the Royal Jordanian Air Force on Friday carried out a number of strikes against ISIS targets, the military said in statement. The Jordanian armed forces did not immediately provide details on the number of aircraft nor what targets were hit. Activists told CNN that one strike killed 47 ISIS fighters. Until now, ISIS hasn't shown any inclination to back down. Just the opposite, in fact: The terror group has been relentless and brutal in its quest to establish a vast caliphate under its strict, twisted version of Sharia law. The organization's savagery seemingly knows no bounds, not only in its use of captives' killings as grisly propaganda tools but in its campaign of mass killings, rapes, kidnappings and other atrocities while taking over swaths of Iraq and Syria. Just this week, a U.N. report claimed ISIS has stepped up its use of children in its bloody campaign, even putting price tags on some and selling them as slaves. Al-Kasasbeh's killing was an attempt by ISIS ""to instill terror and fear in the hearts of its enemies,"" making them less willing to provoke or put up a fight, says a prominent Sunni Muslim cleric who has been exiled from Syria. ""What's happening is the opposite,"" Shaykh Muhammad al-Yaqoubi told CNN's Christiane Amanpour this week. ""The martyrdom of Moath has united Muslims ... against ISIS, leaving no slight room of doubt that these people do not represent Islam. They represent savagery, terrorism and extremism."" That seems to be the sentiment in Jordan, at least, where citizens rallied again Friday in Amman to honor al-Kasasbeh and condemn his killers. Thousands filled the King Hussein Mosque there, listening to a sermon decrying ISIS as antithetical to Islam and insisting that Muslims cannot stand idly by. After prayers, crowds spilled out onto the streets to march calmly and defiantly toward Palm Square. Many held up banners and signs -- including Queen Rania, with a poster that read, ""Moath, the martyr of justice"" -- and chanted, ""Long live the King."" Jordan for months has been one of a handful of nations in the region taking part in the U.S.-led coalition, a fight it continued with airstrikes Thursday and Friday at different sites around Iraq and Syria. For all the efforts of the United States and its allies, Majali, the interior minister, told CNN that the fight is personal for his fellow Jordanians. And King Abdullah II has given ""carte blanche ... to the armed forces"" to carry it out, Majali said. ""This is definitely not the U.S.'s war. This is definitely our war,"" said Majali. ""... I don't want to equate ourselves with this evil force (ISIS), but we will (take) revenge for our pilot.""

"(CNN)India made the perfect start to its defense of cricket's World Cup with an emphatic 76-run victory over arch-rival Pakistan in a Pool B opener in Adelaide Sunday. Inspired by a century from man-of-the-match Virat Kohli, India piled up 300 for seven wickets in its 50 overs, with Pakistan dismissed for 224 in 47 overs. The match was played before a sell-out crowd of over 40,000 at the Adelaide Oval, the vast majority supporters of the two powerhouses of Asian cricket. Pakistan's pursuit of a formidable total on a slow wicket was hampered by indifferent batting against a persistent Indian bowling attack, led by paceman Mohammed Shami, who took four wickets for 35 runs. Misbah-ul-Haq top-scored for Pakistan with 76 before giving Shami his fourth wicket, but he could find little support from its middle and lower order batsman and the result had an air of inevitably about it as wickets tumbled. Earlier, Kohli, given two chances when dropped on three and 76, became the first Indian player to score a century against Pakistan in a World Cup match. He shared century stands with opener Shikhar Dhawan (73) and Suresh Raina, who smashed 74 off 56 balls against a wilting Pakistan bowling attack, with 83 runs coming off the final 10 overs. Sohail Khan led the Pakistan attack with five wickets for 55 runs, but was expensive in his closing overs. ""It's one of the biggest wins of my career. It's amazing to start like this,"" said Kohli, who was scoring his 22nd one-day international century. ""Expectations of me will rise but I just look to stand up to it. ""I hate losing. I love to win and play for my country. My role is to play a long innings so that the power hitters can play with freedom,"" he added. Watch: Can India win back-to-back World Cups? Pakistan captain Misbah acknowledged his team had lost to the better side on the day. ""They played well, posted a good total and bowled well. When we lost wickets in the middle it made it hard,"" he said. The opening weekend of the six-week long tournament has seen victories for joint hosts Australia and New Zealand against England and Sri Lanka respectively, while earlier Sunday South Africa beat Zimbabwe by 62 runs. The 14 teams in the World Cup, which is held over four years, are divided into two pools of seven teams each with the top four from each group qualifying for the quarterfinal knockout stage.","India beats Pakistan in World Cup cricket opener for both sides .

"(CNN)Picture a colossal empire of little houses stacked on top of each other. Visualize them connected by staircases snaking under dangling wires, through corridors so dark even police were rumored to be afraid of them. Now picture 33,000 people living there, within the space of one city block. That was Kowloon Walled City, once considered the densest settlement on earth. ""A huge monstrosity of buildings"" Before it was demolished twenty years ago, photographer Greg Girard spent years with collaborator Ian Lambot documenting this unique Hong Kong phenomenon, and remembers being amazed when he first saw it. ""It was a huge monstrosity of buildings,"" recalls Girard. ""It didn't look like anything else."" After all, the Walled City was a kind of historical accident. A former Qing dynasty fortress, it never fully came under the regulation of the British colonial government in Hong Kong. As a result, its residents were free to build their dwellings as they wished, ignoring safety codes. ""Quite often houses were built by building onto the next building, punching out walls to use their staircases,"" said Girard. ""A lot of them didn't have access to air or open space, because they were enclosed in the center of the structure."" Deep within the building's darkness, a variety of small businesses flourished. ""The places that stuck out were the meat factories,"" says Girard. ""There were pig carcasses laying splayed out on the floor; they'd burn the hair off with a blowtorch, it was all pretty open and of course there were no health laws governing the place."" But despite the City's wild appearance, the photographer found that the people inside lived just like people anywhere else. ""People were doing very ordinary things,"" he says. ""It's just that all these ordinary things were happening in an extraordinary place."" An ingenious community . The complexity of the Walled City also fascinated local architect Aaron Tan, now the director of Hong Kong firm Research Architecture Design. A graduate student then, he wrote his thesis on the Walled City as it was being torn down. ""I was fascinated -- it was like a piece of machinery that worked very well. The demolition was like taking the machine apart -- the first time you could see what was inside. ""It was a really humbling process for me as a designer -- when we met this Walled City, we started to see that people could be more intelligent than us, the designers -- that they could think of ways to solve problems that are outside the traditional academic world."" Tan was especially impressed by Kowloon Walled City's water system. To support its dense population, residents dug extra wells and built thousands of pipes that twisted through the building. But since pumping water to the City's roof tanks required plenty of power, the people would take turns conserving electricity so that water could be shared successfully. ""It revealed the community inside -- that no matter the challenges, they would find some intelligent way to solve it,"" says Tan. Despite the ingenuity of the Walled City, by 1994 it was completely torn down by the city government, which was eager to replace the chaotic and unregulated community with a public park. ""Seeing the Walled City fall into disuse was sort of melancholic,"" says Girard. ""Every city realizes too late to start caring about their architectural heritage -- it's a mistake that gets repeated everywhere. By the time you start caring about it, it's too late to save it."" Today, visitors to the site of the old Walled City will find a placid garden with swaying trees and cloudy ponds. In the park there is a small museum in honor of Kowloon Walled City. But when you look to the sky and imagine the colossus of Hong Kong life that once stood, it's easy to see that something significant has been lost. CNN Travel: Why we love the Kowloon City neighborhood . The City is not dead . Even today, the City's legacy lives on. A walled neighborhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film ""Batman Begins"" was based on Kowloon Walled City. The City is even a level in the video game ""Call of Duty: Black Ops."" Because of the continued interest, Greg Girard is working with his fellow Kowloon Walled City photographer Ian Lambot to finish a new book of their stunning photographs, entitled ""City of Darkness: Revisited."" ""You don't want to romanticize a slum, you know. Because it was that. But it was much more than that. The Walled City was a kind of architectural touchstone in terms of what a city can be -- unplanned, self-generated, unregulated. It was vital and vibrant and every part of it was being used."" Tan believes the spirit of the Walled City continues to pulse through the heart of Hong Kong itself. ""Go to The Peak and look down upon this amazing collection of buildings coming together -- it's almost like a blown up version of the Walled City, right? Each building is related to the next building. New programs evolve because of the connections."" This organic chaos, he says, has been an inspiration for his own work. ""Many architects and urban planners like control,"" he says. ""But people like to get lost in the city. In my design process, I always consciously try to allow accidents, to allow others to participate, to surprise me.""","Kowloon Walled City was once considered the densest settlement on earth .

"South Korea's prime minster toured the scene of the latest deadly tragedy to befall the Asian nation Friday in Seongnam, south of Seoul. Video of the scene showed Chung Hong-won, along with rescue officials, inspecting the gaping, cement hole that swallowed up concertgoers as they were standing on a ventilation grate that suddenly gave way. More than two dozen people plunged some 20 meters (about 66 feet), or four stories, into an underground parking structure below. Sixteen of them died, according to a government accident response task force. Eleven other people were injured, three seriously, the task force said. The Yonhap News Agency reported 12 people were killed at the scene, two others died en route to the hospital, and ""others may have passed away while receiving medical treatment."" The injured were taken to four hospitals, Yonhap reported, near the Pangyo Techno Valley, the multipurpose venue where the incident occurred. Some media reports indicate the victims were standing on the grate in order to get a better view of the stage. A witness told CNN affiliate YTN, ""There was a sudden, loud screaming and when I turned, it looked as if people were being sucked down into a hole."" About 700 people were attending the concert, which featured South Korean artists, including the popular all-female group 4Minute, Yonhap reported. A ferry sinking last April killed more than 300 people, many of them schoolchildren, and caused nationwide outrage. Critics contend safety measures and regulation are not keeping pace with the fast-paced economic development in the country.","Prime minister inspects scene of deadly tragedy .

"(CNN)Egypt's Constitution states that ""freedom of belief is absolute,"" yet it says nothing about those who don't believe. Watchdog groups are asking the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation to reconsider its stance toward atheists after authorities arrested a student and sentenced him to three years in prison for Facebook posts that insulted Islam. Karim Ashraf Mohamed al-Banna was arrested with a group of people at a cafe in November, according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression. An Egyptian minor offenses court sentenced him on blasphemy charges Saturday in what Human Rights Watch called ""part of a wider government push to combat atheism and other forms of dissent."" ""Atheists are one of Egypt's least-protected minorities, although the constitution ostensibly guarantees freedom of belief and expression,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW's Middle East and North Africa director. ""Egyptian authorities need to be guided by the constitution and stop persecuting people for atheism."" While Article 64 of Egypt's Constitution says freedom of belief is absolute, it also says freedom to practice religious rituals or establish houses of worship is exclusive to Judaism, Christianity, Islam, the Baha'i faith and other Abrahamic religions. According to French Press Agency reports cited by HRW, a researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights said a local newspaper identified al-Banna as an atheist, and al-Banna's lawyer reported that the student's own father testified that he was fostering extremist ideas. Among al-Banna's posts are a split image of a severely scarred woman and a Quran with the caption, ""It's OK to burn a woman ... but it's NOT OK to burn a book. Something is wrong with your priorities."" Another post carries the caption, ""A big reward to whoever represents Islam"" and shows several caricatures of bearded men in similar dress pointing at each other, saying, ""This person does not represent Islam."" A judge will hear al-Banna's appeal on March 9, and his bail has been set at 1,000 Egyptian pounds ($140), his lawyer told the French Press Agency. HRW says that blasphemy cases generally stem from ""personal or unrelated disputes,"" and since the country's 2011 uprising, authorities have increasingly investigated complaints. While most of the cases involve alleged insults to Islam, HRW says that at least two men have been imprisoned for insulting Christianity. Christians make up roughly 10% of Egypt's population. Authorities have also been targeting atheists of late, according to HRW. Police in December shut down a Cairo cafe popular with suspected atheists, and District Administrative Chief Gamal Mohie told a news outlet that the shop was unlicensed and ""popularly known as a place for Satan worship, rituals and dances,"" HRW reported. Also last month, the Dar al-Ifta, which issues religious edicts in Egypt, released a survey claiming Egypt had 866 atheists, more than any other Middle Eastern country. Two aides to the grand mufti, who heads Dar al-Ifta and is the country's top official on religious laws, told a newspaper that the increase in atheism ""should ring alarm bells."" This follows a March promise from a top Alexandria security official to arrest atheists and a June announcement by ""Egypt's youth and religious endowments ministries"" that they would confront atheism. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Karim al-Banna was sentenced to three years in prison for Facebook posts insulting Islam .

"The Republican candidate for Senate in North Carolina brought in a foreign policy and national security heavyweight, a week after his opponent Sen. Kay Hagan's Armed Services Committee attendance record became a lightning rod in the contentious race. Sen. John McCain joined state House Speaker Thom Tillis on the campaign trail Thursday in an effort to boost the Republican nominee's national security credo in a race where the fight against ISIS has become a top campaign issue. As both candidates criticized President Barack Obama's strategy in Iraq, McCain praised Tillis an ""experienced, talented, proven leader,"" the Raleigh-based News & Observer reported. And McCain, who is also a member of the Armed Services Committee, gave weight to attacks against Hagan for missing more than half of all the committee's public hearings in the last two years, as well as one classified briefing on ISIS and other national security threats with the Director of National Intelligence, which she missed for a fundraiser in New York. ""We hold hearings so that we can be better informed and when she doesn't show up, obviously, it indicates that she's not well-informed"" McCain said according to the Associated Press. ""These are very, very serious times, and Sen. Hagan wasn't there."" Hagan's campaign has pushed back since Tillis and outside allies slammed Hagan in ads for missing the crucial briefing, asserting the Senator attended 98% of the committee's votes. Hagan's camp has also fought back with an ad of its own, knocking Tillis for his own uninspiring attendance record in the state legislature, where he played hooky several times to fundraise for his campaign. Tillis beat back those accusations on a call with reporters last week saying, ""Quite honestly, if I had anything approaching the seriousness of the threat of ISIS, I would have canceled anything I was doing."" McCain's presence next to Tillis, this time at an event with a veterans' group, also served to deflect criticism that the North Carolina Republican has offered few specifics for how he would confront the ISIS threat. McCain has been one of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration's strategy for confronting ISIS, particularly the White House's public claim that the U.S. will not put American boots on the ground -- and that it can still defeat ISIS.","McCain joined Tillis in slamming Hagan's Armed Services committee attendance record.

"""I have made a lot of mistakes falling in love, and regretted most of them, but never the potatoes that went with them,"" wrote Nora Ephron in Heartburn. If only most of us were so philosophical about the way we eat when we're in the throes of a powerful emotion. Unfortunately, after we celebrate our promotion with champagne and cupcakes or drown our romantic woes in a bowl of spaghetti, we tend to feel remorseful. ""I indulged myself,"" we might confess, in a hushed tone, to a friend the next day. (Even our choice of word—indulge—is loaded, as it implies we are engaging in a vaguely illicit behavior.) But is this self-flagellation really necessary? Some experts say no. ""It's healthy to emotionally eat once in a while—to eat for comfort, to celebrate, or just because,"" says Jean Fain, a psychotherapist affiliated with Harvard Medical School and the author of ""The Self-Compassion Diet."" ""Sure, you could go for a walk or head to the gym, but sometimes an ice cream sundae is just the thing."" Of course, no one is suggesting that it's a good idea to routinely pull a Liz Lemon on a gallon of rocky road. Frequent, heavy emotional eating can be a serious issue. However, doing it occasionally might not be all bad. Both your body and psyche are hardwired to make connections between how you feel and what's on your plate. It's the way you handle—and regulate—your eating that makes the difference between a pleasurable endeavor and a real health concern. Real Simple: Debunking health myths . Your physical cravings, demystifiedYour body is no dummy. There's a reason it yearns for a bowl of crunchy-top macaroni and cheese or a sliver of warm apple pie. ""Foods that are laden with carbohydrates, sugar, or fat simply taste delicious,"" says Heather Hausenblas, Ph.D., an associate professor of exercise psychology at the University of Florida, in Gainesville. But surprise! Flavor is only part of the reason you crave these foods. Your brain chemistry actually changes when you bite into a bagel or a Twizzler. ""Carbohydrates set off a series of chemical reactions that ultimately lead to a boost in brain serotonin,"" says Judith Wurtman, Ph.D., the former director of the Research Program in Women's Health at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Clinical Research Center. The higher the levels of serotonin, the more content you feel (at least temporarily). No wonder cutting out carbs can make you grumpy: A 2009 study from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, in Adelaide, Australia, found that low-carbohydrate dieters registered the lowest moods. The same goes for fatty foods. In a 2011 study published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, subjects were fed through a stomach tube with either a solution of fatty acids or saline. Both groups then listened to music proven to evoke a negative or neutral emotion. Those given the fat were less sad, and brain scans showed dampened activity in areas associated with sadness. The researchers believe this shows that fatty acids can induce a signal from your gut to your brain, which may influence emotions. There are times when we are more physically vulnerable to these triggers—for example, during periods of stress. ""Chronic stress creates elevated levels of the hormone cortisol,"" says Jeffrey Morrison, M.D., a family practitioner in New York City and the author of Cleanse Your Body, Clear Your Mind ($26, amazon.com). Your body thinks you're going through a famine, he explains, which can increase your cravings. Exhaustion is a contributing factor, too. In a 2012 study, Columbia University and St. Luke's--Roosevelt Hospital Center researchers found that when subjects were sleep-deprived, seeing pictures of unhealthy foods activated reward centers in their brains. Those centers were less active when the participants were fully rested. Increased reward-center activity may make a person more likely to eat. (See, that's why you scarfed those doughnut holes while pulling an all-nighter for work.) Real Simple: 24 Nutritious (and tasty) snacks . The quest for comfortBiology isn't the only reason we eat emotionally. Think back: Since day one, when we were fed in a mother's or father's arms, we have associated food with comfort, says Michelle May, M.D., the founder of the Am I Hungry? Mindful Eating Program, in Phoenix, and the author of Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat ($20, amazon.com). As a child, you probably got the food-as-soother message in countless other ways, too: Remember the lollipop the doctor always handed out after a visit? The teacher who rewarded A students with ice cream? By adulthood that association becomes ingrained in our minds, says Craig Johnson, Ph.D., a psychologist specializing in eating disorders and the chief clinical officer of the Eating Recovery Center, in Denver: ""Children's brains sometimes aren't developed enough to use words to deal with complex feelings, so they may use food to self-regulate emotions."" That's even more likely if your parents modeled that behavior. In a 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers brought together mother-preschooler pairs. They asked the moms to rate their own emotional-eating habits. Then they devised an activity during which snacks would be offered to the children. The preschoolers whose moms reported regulating their feelings with food ate more snacks than did the other children. We're also more likely to indulge (there's that word again) when we're trying to bond with others. A 2001 study from Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, showed that people consume more in a group than they do alone, regardless of hunger levels. Eating socially ""may help you feel like you're strengthening relationships,"" says Jennifer Taitz, a clinical psychologist in New York City and the author of End Emotional Eating ($18, amazon.com). Why? In that moment, united by a mutual desire to, say, conquer a piece of peanut butter pie, ""everyone feels connected to one another."" Real Simple: 25 easy instant energy boosters . When it's a problemIf you're unsure whether your emotional eating has gone too far, ask yourself these questions. • Do you frequently eat when you feel emotional but not particularly hungry?""When a desire or a craving comes from something other than hunger, eating can't satisfy it,"" says May. ""If you are eating but don't physically need the food, you'll never feel satisfied."" In fact, research published in the journal Obesity in 2007 found that dieters who ate according to internal emotional cues, such as loneliness, instead of physical or external cues lost less weight over time and were more likely to gain it back. • Instead of confronting a problem, do you hit the refrigerator?Psychologists say that numbing yourself with food rather than dealing with your feelings can increase stress, which in turn can raise your blood pressure and weaken your immune system. • Do you punish yourself after having a treat?Guilt can lead to uncontrolled eating, says Georgia Kostas, a Dallas-based registered dietitian and the author of The Cooper Clinic Solution to the Diet Revolution ($35, amazon.com): ""If you feel bad about eating a scoop of ice cream, excess guilt may lead you to eat the whole carton. Now you've destroyed any pleasure you had hoped to derive from the ice cream."" • Finally, do you regularly overeat those carby, fatty foods?(You know—the ones you crave the most.) Here's how to know: ""Make good food choices about 90 percent of the time,"" says Kostas, ""and reserve the other 10 percent for 'fun calories.' "" If your comfort-food intake often exceeds that percentage, consider cutting back. Real Simple: Low-calorie snacks for every craving . Need more incentive? Recent research indicates that eating a lot of fatty foods can end up negatively affecting your mood over time. In a 2012 study from the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre, researchers fed mice diets with different amounts of fat. After 12 weeks, the mice that were fed a higher-fat diet showed more signs of depression and anxiety. The takeaway: Although you initially may feel euphoric from eating fatty foods, the more you do it, the worse you feel. The recipe for true happiness just might be healthy, balanced meals, followed now and then by dessert—and as the ever wise Nora Ephron advised, no regrets. Food for thoughtWant to avoid excessive emotional eating? Try one of these exercises. Record your emotions. ""For a few days, before you eat, force yourself to write down what you're feeling and thinking at that exact moment,"" says exercise psychologist Heather Hausenblas. ""Seeing your emotions on paper helps you understand what's happening inside and recognize times when you're more likely to eat out of something other than hunger."" It really works: A 2008 study from the University of Kentucky, in Lexington, found that people choose lower-calorie foods when they are aware of their feelings. Real Simple: Understanding unfamiliar nutritional terms . Show a little self-compassion. The next time you eat in response to a strong emotion, don't lament your lack of willpower. Research shows that treating yourself gently may help you stave off future bouts of emotional eating. In 2007 researchers at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, asked female subjects to taste-test doughnuts. Half weren't given any special instruction. The other half were given a lesson in self-compassion beforehand. The tester said, ""I hope you won't be too hard on yourself. Everyone in the study eats this stuff."" The result: Those who received the ""Be kind to yourself"" mandate ultimately ate fewer sweets. Get an assistant. Or, at the very least, ask your spouse or kids to help around the house a bit more. According to a 2012 study from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, in Oulu, Finland, feeling burned-out can easily lead to emotional eating. Researchers found that women who were overwhelmed on the job were significantly more likely to use food as a source of comfort and relief than were those who were not. Antidote: Delegate some of your to-do list. Or, hey, ditch a few of the items on it altogether.","Celebratory or comforting meals can often make people feel remorse for indulging themselves .

"(CNN) -- The latest nude celebrity photo leak is yet another case of how the Internet often lets people do whatever they want to whomever they want. On Sunday, a user of anonymous Internet message board 4chan posted hundreds of nude photos of some of Hollywood's biggest celebrities, including actress Jennifer Lawrence and model Kate Upton. The poster claimed photos of Victoria Justice and Ariana Grande were included, but the singer/actresses deny that the photos are real. Representatives and the women themselves have begun issuing their denials (in the case of Justice and Grande) and confirmations (in the case of Lawrence and Upton). A representative for Lawrence confirmed in an email to Buzzfeed that the images were stolen from the actress' iCloud account. ""This is a flagrant violation of privacy,"" the representative said. ""The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence."" Of course, what happened here is more than a violation of privacy; it's flat-out criminal invasion. Prosecution, however, may be something of a long shot. Although a Florida man responsible for breaking into the private email accounts of more than 50 celebs and posting many explicit photos online is serving 10 years in prison, the law is only just beginning to catch up to the problem of what is broadly referred to as ""revenge porn,"" or the unauthorized posting of explicit content without the consent of the individual. Most websites that host these photos are protected by a federal law that absolves them of responsibility for material posted by third parties. It's legal in most of the United States, and only a few states -- about 12 -- have laws that make posting on such sites a crime ... if you can even find out who the poster is. Prosecuting depends on first determining who uploaded the photo and where the photo originated. A California law, for example, did not, until just last week, protect victims who took the photos themselves. These unclear, largely ineffectual laws have in turn encouraged a culture of victim-blaming, which we're seeing here in full force. Consider that the biggest headlines haven't been along the lines of ""How can someone can do this and get away with it?"" but a debate over who bears greater blame: Apple's iCloud or the women themselves. Certainly, the surest way to avoid ever having your most private photos shared publicly is to not take them in the first place. This is the philosophy behind the most common advice given to teens, among whom the rates of ""sexting"" continue to rise. Trust no one. Share nothing. Even better: Take nothing. While we're at it: Don't leave the house. After all, you could get mugged, or raped. You'd better not fly on a jet, either, what with all the terrorism and overworked pilots. Swim in the ocean? No way: sharks! It's ridiculous logic. How celebrity nude photos get leaked . And yet much of the reaction to the celebrity leak has fallen prey to such logic, questioning why these celebrities would take such risqué—and risky—photos in the first place. For this reason, taking nude photos is most definitely a right to fight for, if only because ceasing to do so is a form of victim blaming, and far more harmful than protective. The blame for a crime lies not with the victim but with the criminal. Jennifer Lawrence was not naïve, or tacky, or any number of criticisms that have been and surely will be lobbed at her, for posing for provocative photos. She was a normal young woman. And I suspect that we're more shocked by the fact that Lawrence had a glass of wine and posed naked for a boyfriend than the fact the image is now ours to see. We've become accustomed to knowing everything about everyone. Actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead, one of the victims, received responses to her tweet, ""To those of you looking at photos I took with my husband years ago in the privacy of our home, hope you feel great about yourselves,"" that echoed this sentiment: ""‪@M_E_Winstead Stop posing nude on camera, dummy. Your husband not know what you look like nude? ‪#LessonLearned."" She has since gone silent on Twitter. The message, of course, isn't that it's heinous to so publicly and maliciously invade someone's privacy but that these women brought their misfortune on themselves. After all, it wouldn't have happened to them if they didn't take the photos. But the first step to protecting our privacy both online and off isn't to demand that Apple make a stronger iCloud or to start stripping our storage spaces of anything private. Nor is it to insist that women stop taking nude photos of themselves or, for that matter, stop engaging in any activity they wouldn't want to be made public. Instead, it's to take these crimes seriously and hold their executors accountable. The problem isn't the picture. It's the perpetrator.","An anonymous poster put hundreds of nude photos of big celebs on message board .
Peggy Drexler: This is not just a violation of privacy; it's criminal invasion but hard to prosecute .

"(CNN)Kayla Mueller made helping people her life's work. After graduating from college in 2009, she traveled to northern India, the Palestinian territories and Israel to assist humanitarian groups, her family said through a spokeswoman. She then went to Syria to help people whose lives had been torn apart by war, especially children. ""Syrians are dying by the thousands and they're fighting just to talk about the rights we have,"" the humanitarian worker told The Daily Courier, her hometown paper in Prescott, Arizona, in 2013. ""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal."" ISIS said in an online posting this month that a female American it was holding had died in a Jordanian airstrike on Raqqa, Syria. The Mueller family confirmed her death on Tuesday and said ISIS took her captive in August 2013. Mueller, 26, grew up in Prescott, a town of about 40,000 people 100 miles north of Phoenix. She showed an early inclination for travel and humanitarian work, according to a September 2007 profile in The Daily Courier. ""I love cultures and language and learning about people's cultures,"" Mueller, then 19, said in the article. Before going to Northern Arizona University, she worked for the Save Darfur Coalition, wrote letters to members of Congress, took part in environmental causes and was honored with a local award for activism, the article said. ""I always feel that no matter how much I give I always get back more though these projects,"" she said. Mueller continued her activism at Northern Arizona University. Carol Thompson, a politics and international affairs professor there, called Mueller a ""brilliant"" student who asked tough questions and cared deeply about issues of peace, inequality and justice. The two also worked together on Save Darfur and as anti-war activists to make sure that returning veterans were welcomed back to the community. ""Well beyond the classroom, she was a peacemaker,"" said Thompson, who last saw Mueller in 2012 and who is currently on a sabbatical in Zimbabwe. After graduating, Mueller became a globetrotter. Read a letter written by Kayla Mueller last year . She spent two years living and working with humanitarian  groups in northern India, Israel and the Palestinian territories, according to a family spokeswoman. In Israel, she volunteered at the African Refugee Development Center. Upon returning to Arizona in 2011, Mueller volunteered in a women's shelter and worked at Northland Cares, an HIV/AIDS clinic, helping to facilitate events and providing local coordination for World AIDS Day, the family spokeswoman said. ""She was truly a remarkable young woman,"" said Northland Cares Director Tricia Goffena-Beyer. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the family."" She traveled to France in December 2011 to work as an au pair so she could learn French to work in Africa, her family's spokeswoman said. After a year in France, she traveled to the Turkish/Syrian border to work with the Danish Refugee Council and the humanitarian organization Support to Life, which assisted families forced to flee their homes, the spokeswoman said. On a trip home in 2013, she told the Kiwanis Club in Prescott about her work in the Mideast, saying she often drew, painted and played with Syrian children in refugee camps, according to The Daily Courier. Her father is a club member, the paper said. She described helping reunite a man with a 6-year-old relative after the bombing of their refugee camp. ""This story is not rare in Syria,"" the newspaper quoted her as saying. ""This is the reality for Syrians two and a half years on. ""When Syrians hear I'm an American, they ask, 'Where is the world?' All I can do is cry with them, because I don't know."" In a YouTube video produced in October 2011, before the rise of ISIS, Mueller said she supported a sit-in that protested the Syrian regime. ""I am in solidarity with the Syrian people,"" she said. ""I reject the brutality and killing that the Syrian authorities are committing against the Syrian people."" ISIS took Mueller captive in the summer of 2013 after she visited a Spanish MSF (Doctors Without Borders) hospital, according to the family spokeswoman. However, she did not work for Doctors Without Borders, the organization said in a statement Friday. ""On August 3, 2013, a technician sent by a company contracted by MSF arrived at one of the organization's structures in Aleppo, Syria, to perform repairs,"" the medical aid organization said. ""Unbeknownst to the MSF team, Kayla, a friend of the technician's, was accompanying him. Because additional time was required to carry out the repair work, the technician and Kayla were harbored overnight at the MSF hospital in Aleppo, due to safety concerns. ""Upon completion of the repair work on August 4, the MSF team organized transportation for Kayla and the technician to the Aleppo bus station, from where they were to depart for Turkey.  Kayla's detention occurred during the drive to the bus station."" In May, the Mueller family received confirmation their daughter had been taken hostage, the family spokeswoman said. The information provided ""proof of life."" The family hasn't said whether they know how she was treated. U.S. troops may have come close to rescuing Mueller in July when they staged a daring raid at a location inside Syria in an attempt to find  journalist James Foley, whom ISIS executed in August, and other hostages. One U.S. official said they found specific evidence the hostages had been there, including writings on the cell walls. A law enforcement official said hair strands found at the site are believed to have belonged to Mueller. In a note to Mueller's family last summer, ISIS said it had grown tired of waiting and demanded 5 million Euros by August 13, according to a source close to the family. It's unknown whether that execution date was kept by ISIS. Thompson said that, while she is the professor, it was Kayla who taught her that ""peace with justice involves constant struggle and sacrifice. "" ""We can honor Kayla most by asking all the parties involved to seek understanding of difference, of those with whom we most disagree,"" Thompson said. ""Thank you Kayla, for teaching your professors and many others.  We stand very humbled in your light.""

"(CNN) -- About 11 trillion gallons of rain, or nearly 17 million Olympic swimming pools full. That's how much water California needs to recover from its extreme drought despite downpours that caused flooding and mudslides this month, NASA said. This week, the space agency released a satellite data analysis of how much water the state's reserves lack. It's a lot -- more than 14,000 times the amount of water it would take to fill the Dallas Cowboys stadium, according to CNN calculations. It's the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in about 170 days' time. ""It takes years to get into a drought of this severity, and it will likely take many more big storms, and years, to crawl out of it,"" said NASA scientist Jay Famiglietti, who led the study. NASA climate satellites measured fluctuations in Earth's gravitational field and the changing shape of the planet's surface to determine the drop in water reserves. It's the first calculation of its kind to determine the amount of water needed to break a drought, the space agency said. Virtually all of California is drought stricken, according to the University of Nebraska Lincoln drought monitor, most of it under the worst level -- ""exceptional drought."" Deluges boosted state reservoirs . December's deluges doused parts of California in just a few days with double the rain or more that they usually get in a year. An atmospheric river -- a moisture-laden stream of air from the tropics dozens of miles wide -- hosed the coast, and behind it, storm fronts battered the state. Nearly a foot of rain fell in some places in a single day. Creeks and rivers previously flowing at a trickle swelled over their banks and flooded nearby streets. The abundant rainfall gave the state's reservoirs an upward bounce, according to measurements by the Department of Water Resources. One of the largest, Lake Shasta, went from a water level before the rains of 41% of its historic average to 53% on Tuesday. Another very large one, Lake Oroville, stepped up from a level of 44% of its average volume to 54%. Some of the state's other 10 -- mostly much smaller -- main reservoirs felt a boost, too. Others, not so much. More rain is in the forecast this week, but it will be gentle, not torrential. Despite the new rain, California's mighty reservoirs still resemble ponds surrounded by parched, elongated banks. Depleting groundwater . The drought has dug so deep in the past three years that it has tapped into groundwater. It has done this throughout the Southwest, where groundwater levels are at their absolute lowest levels in the last 65 years, said NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. The state's two largest river basins, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, have lost 4 trillion gallons of water per year since 2011, according to the analysis by NASA JPL. ""That's more water than California's 38 million residents use each year for domestic and municipal purposes. About two-thirds of the loss is due to depletion of groundwater beneath California's Central Valley,"" NASA said. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed ""historic legislation"" that created ""a framework for sustainable, local groundwater management for the first time in California history,"" the governor's office said at the time. Before the new legislation, California was the only Western state that didn't manage its groundwater, officials said. Brown declared a drought emergency, saying this was ""perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago."" He held up a chart of fluctuating rainfall levels over many years, with the graph plummeting off the bottom of the chart in recent years. Diminished snow caps . The atmospheric river and cold fronts loaded up the Sierra Nevada mountains with a couple of feet of snow at the highest altitudes, adding to the snowpack. It acts as a major water reservoir, storing up moisture in the winter months and then releasing it during melts. The storm's extra padding doubled the level to 48% of the historic average, a nice improvement. But there's bad news here, too, based on studies done from airplanes this year, NASA said. ""The 2014 snowpack was one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977, when California's population was half what it is now,"" said NASA JPL scientist Tom Painter. That not only means less water from snow but also less reflection of sunlight, which means the Earth absorbs it and gets that much warmer, Painter said. The ground then also gets more parched, so when water does flow onto it, it soaks it up, leaving less of it to flow into reservoirs. ---- . CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","Deluges during the atmospheric river give reservoirs a pleasant boost .
But much more is needed after years of drought, NASA says in a new analysis .

"In July, KDNuggets.com, an online newsite focused on data mining and analytics software, ran an unusual listing in its jobs section. ""We are looking for Predictive Modeling/Data Mining Scientists and Analysts, at both the senior and junior level, to join our department through November 2012 at our Chicago Headquarters,"" read the ad. ""We are a multi-disciplinary team of statisticians, predictive modelers, data mining experts, mathematicians, software developers, general analysts and organizers - all striving for a single goal: re-electing President Obama."" The job listing caught the attention of Alex Lundry, a Republican data-mining expert at TargetPoint Consulting. He tweeted a link to the ad, commenting, ""The Obama campaign is taking #bigdata seriously; what about the GOP candidates?"" The question almost answers itself. So far in the presidential election of 2012, there is only one campaign that is doing cutting-edge work with data. Obama may be struggling in the polls and even losing support among his core boosters, but when it comes to the modern mechanics of identifying, connecting with and mobilizing voters, as well as the challenge of integrating voter information with the complex internal workings of a national campaign, his team is way ahead of the Republican pack. Facebook apps and other tools . Alone among the major candidates running for president, the Obama campaign not only has a Facebook page with 23 million ""likes"" (roughly 10 times the total of all the Republicans running), it has a Facebook app that is scooping up all kinds of juicy facts about his supporters. Users of the Obama 2012 - Are You In? app are not only giving the campaign personal data like their name, gender, birthday, current city, religion and political views, they are sharing their list of friends and information those friends share, like their birthday, current city, religion and political views. As Facebook is now offering the geo-targeting of ads down to ZIP code, this kind of fine-grained information is invaluable. Inside the Obama operation, his staff members are using a powerful social networking tool called NationalField, which enables everyone to share what they are working on. Modeled on Facebook, the tool connects all levels of staff to the information they are gathering as they work on tasks like signing up volunteers, knocking on doors, identifying likely voters and dealing with problems. Managers can set goals for field organizers -- number of calls made, number of doors knocked -- and see, in real time, how people are doing against all kinds of metrics. In additional to all the hard data, users can share qualitative information: what points or themes worked for them in a one-on-one conversation with voters, for example. ""Ups,"" ""Downs"" and ""Solutions"" are color-coded, so people can see where successes are happening or challenges brewing. And unlike an open social network, where everyone is equal, NationalField runs on a hierarchical social graph: Higher-level staff get a broader view of the state and local work below them. For a campaign that tapped the volunteer energies of millions of people in 2008 and appears to need all the help it can get in 2012, these kinds of fine-grained technologies could make a key difference. While the Republican field (and bloggers and the press) has been focused on how their candidates are doing with social networking, Obama's campaign operatives are devising a new kind of social intelligence that will help drive campaign resources where they are most needed. 'Data harmonization' It all sounds like common sense, but actually, connecting and synchronizing the data a campaign collects from its field operation, fundraising operation and Web operation isn't a trivial task. ""The holy grail of data analysis is data harmonization, or master data management,"" Lundry said. ""To have political talking to finance and finance talking to field, and data is flowing back and forth and informing the actions of each other -- it sounds easy, but it's incredibly hard to implement."" Most political campaigns tend to rely on consultants to carry out part or all of these functions, resulting in even greater obstacles to sharing information. Like Lundry, Republican technology consultant Martin Avila is worried. His firm, Terra Eclipse, built Ron Paul's 2008 Web operation and works closely with the tea party movement. This year, it did some work on Tim Pawlenty's website until that campaign folded. Avila's flagship project is a conservative social-networking hub called Freedom Connector, which has grown to 150,000 members in a matter of months by giving right-wing activists tools to organize local meetings and discussions. Avila doesn't think any of the Republican presidential campaigns fully understand the power of data today. ""They have to stop seeing a website as a piece of direct mail that people will receive,"" he said. ""They have to see a website as the equivalent of a campaign office in Iowa, one that is open 24/7."" And campaigns need to know how to take quick and well-targeted action to respond to every expression of interest they may get online, he argues, because voter interest in politicians is fickle. Simply sending a generic e-mail reply isn't enough. ""If you can make that initial response a phone call from someone in their town or a neighbor, asking them to come to a county fair tomorrow, that's much more powerful."" Power of personal connections . Without good data management, the different legs of a national campaign can trip over each other. ""One hand doesn't know what the other hand is doing quite often in campaigns,"" Lundry said. ""With master data management across a campaign, you can see how often you're talking to a person"" and thus not bombard them with untimely or poorly targeted requests. But, according to Avila, ""Not many on the Republican side know how to technically accomplish that."" Their approach to the Web, he adds, is still too much shaped by pre-Internet politicking using broadcast advertising. ""The ability to connect to people on a one-to-one basis, and encourage them to connect with one another, is way more powerful than that."" How powerful? The 2008 Obama campaign offered an early glimpse of the potential of data-driven politics. By the end of the election, it had amassed 13 million supporter e-mail addresses, collected nearly 4 million individual donations and tallied about 2 million registered users on my.BarackObama.com, the campaign's social networking platform. Seventy thousand myBO members had used the site to conduct their own personalized fundraising campaigns. Since 2008, enthusiasm for Obama has waned, but his online presence hasn't. His base on Facebook has soared nearly six times from the 4 million he had on Election Day, and his following on Twitter now stands at 10 million, dwarfing the Republican field. So even if Obama isn't drawing millions of people off their sofas to rally to his side on their own in 2012, his team has a huge amount of raw data to work with as they build his re-election machine. If the 2012 election comes down to a battle of inches, where a few percentage points change in turnout in a few key states making all the difference, we may come to see Obama's investment in predictive modelers and data scientists as the key to victory.","In the mechanics of identifying voters, President Obama's team is ahead of GOP rivals .

"New York (CNN)Friends remember Ellen Brody, a mother of three, as someone who wasn't careless or put others at risk. But the Mercedes-Benz SUV she was driving Tuesday evening suddenly moved into the path of Metro-North train, triggering the deadliest crash in the history of the New York commuter railroad, a safety official said. The engineer saw the SUV and applied the emergency brake as the train traveled at 58 mph, just under the speed limit of 60, National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said Thursday. It was 6:26 p.m. The train sounded its horn appropriately. The flashing lights and gates at the crossing functioned properly, officials said. The eight-car train stopped 950 feet after the brake was applied, Sumwalt said. That's about the distance that the SUV was dragged. Brody and five train passengers were killed. A witness who was driving a car behind the SUV told the NTSB that the vehicle stopped at the crossing Tuesday night. The SUV driver came out of her vehicle after her rear window was struck by a gate. The warning lights activated 39 seconds before the collision, the NTSB said. The gates came down a few seconds later -- leaving the SUV in the train's path about half a minute. The witness told investigators that he saw flashing lights that signaled the approaching train. He said he backed up slightly and gestured at Brody to back up away from the gate. She returned to the vehicle and, in what seemed like ""enough time to put on a seat belt,"" suddenly moved the SUV forward into the train's path, Sumwalt said. ""What we have here is ... a mosaic,"" Sumwalt said. ""We're going to take different pieces of information ... assemble it and see what that picture looks like."" The goal, he said, is to construct ""a timeline so we know exactly what happened and when."" Steven Harrod, a railroad expert and former professor at University of Dayton in Ohio, said oncoming trains rarely can stop in time for vehicles on tracks. ""It is a physical reality,"" he said. ""The train's 'failure to stop' is not a surprise or a cause of the accident... This accident was unfortunate bad luck ... It is a constant battle against vehicles on road crossings."" The SUV driver and other motorists had been diverted to the area of the rail crossing after another unrelated accident on a nearby parkway, according to the NTSB. More than a dozen other people were injured in the crash. It's not known why the SUV stopped on the tracks in Valhalla, about 30 miles north of New York City, the NTSB said. Sumwalt said he believed Brody had owned the SUV a short period of time. 'She had just a beautiful soul' ""This was a tragic accident and you wonder why it happened, but certainly this it was not her,"" said Paul Feiner, Brody's longtime friend.  ""She was not a careless person. She would not ever do anything that would put anybody at risk."" A mother of three girls, Brody, 49, worked at a jewelry store for 10 years, according to friends. She had just left the store when she was killed. ""Her girls really adore her,"" said Benjy Silverman, Rabbi at Chabad of the Rivertowns. ""Her husband and her were very close. It's really just a beautiful family unit."" Virginia Shasha, a co-worker at the store, said: ""In one word...she just had a beautiful soul. She looked for the good in others. She was, she looked for the good."" Brody's actions behind the wheel moments before the crash are a focus of the investigation, officials said. ""There are two big questions here: Why was the car on the train tracks?"" Sumwalt asked. ""And what caused this accident to be fatal for occupants of the train?"" Sumwalt said the NTSB is also examining the train's exits, the ""crashworthiness"" of the rail cars, and the intensity of the fire -- which may have been fueled  by the SUV's gas tank. Some 400 feet of the electrified third rail perforated the first rail car and part of the second in 80-foot sections ""breaking apart section by section, just basically piling up"" in the cars, according to the NTSB. Brody was killed in the collision along with train passengers Walter Liedtke, European paintings curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Eric Vandercar, a senior managing director for Mesirow Financial; Robert Dirks, a scientist with D. E. Shaw Research; and Joseph Nadol and Aditya Tomar of J.P. Morgan. Brody's husband, Alan, on Facebook expressed his gratitude to those who have reached out. ""Thank you to those who shared their condolences for the terrible tragedy that took my beloved wife, Ellen, whom so many of you knew. We will be saying goodbye to her on Friday Feb. 6th, 10 am at 303 Broadway, Dobbs Ferry, NY.""

"A Chinese court has sentenced a man to three and a half years in prison for running over a 2-year-old girl and leaving her bleeding in the street, state media reported, a case that stirred debate in China about the level of compassion of its citizens. The Nanhai District People's Court in the city of Foshan, Guangdong Province, convicted Hu Jun of manslaughter on Wednesday for the death of the girl, Wang Yue, who was hit and crushed by Hu's minibus and another vehicle in October, the state-run news agency Xinhua reported. The girl, nicknamed Yueyue, had wandered into the alley outside her father's hardware store in Foshan when she was run over. She subsequently died of her injuries after both vehicles drove away from the scene and more than a dozen people passed by without stopping to help. Yueyue laid motionless in the street in a busy market area for 10 minutes until Chen Xianmei, a 58-year-old woman who collects trash for a living, passed by. She moved Yueyue to safety and called for help. A video of the events from a security camera was posted online, provoking sympathy, outrage and debate both inside and outside China. Many wondered aloud how so many people could pass by the critically injured child and do nothing. The case prompted widespread soul-searching in China about the state of the nation's morals and civic-mindedness, as some people questioned whether years of strong economic growth had made people more interested in personal gain than the welfare of others. Other people blamed a lack of laws and regulations or a failure of China's education system to inculcate respect for human life and dignity. At the trial in Foshan, Hu confessed to running Yueyue over, Xinhua reported, but argued that he should be convicted of traffic offenses rather than manslaughter. The court said it had given him a lenient sentence because he had given himself up to the police and paid some of Yueyue's medical fees, according to Xinhua. But most Chinese people reacting to the court's decision on social media appeared to believe Hu had not been punished severely enough. ""Just 3 years and 6 months to compensate for a life?"" the user ShuiQiangLeWoDeChenTuFeiYang posted on a microblog. ""He ended Xiao Yueyue's life before she even had time to start living,"" wrote another user, Feifeng1998, using a longer form of Yueyue's nickname. The Xinhua report didn't mention what had happened to the driver of the other vehicle that ran Yueyue over.","The girl was run over by two vehicles in October and left in the street .

"A Kansas sperm donor caught in the middle of a child support case says he wanted to help a lesbian couple when he made the donation nearly five years ago. Instead, he may end up paying for his action. A judge ruled that William Marotta must pay child support, even though he says he signed documents waiving his parental rights. Shawnee County District Court Judge Mary Mattivi said on Wednesday that Marotta failed to conform to Kansas law, which says a licensed physician must be involved in an artificial insemination process, court documents show. The documents show that the lesbian couple whom Marotta helped conceive a child say they performed the artificial insemination procedure at home. 'I donated genetic material, and that was it' This story begins on Craigslist in March 2009. That was when Marotta noticed an advertisement from the Topeka couple, seeking donated sperm. ""Intrigued"" by the ad, he says, he delivered three cupfuls of his sperm -- gratis -- to the women. One of the women gave birth to a daughter in December 2009, according to court documents. ""I donated genetic material, and that was it for me,"" he told CNN affiliate WIBW. Or so he thought. That changed when the parents separated and one of the women stopped working because of illness and applied to the state for help, he said. The state contacted Marotta for child support. Kansas officials were not persuaded by what Marotta says were agreements he signed, before making his donations, that he would assume no financial responsibility for the child, who is now 4 years old. The Kansas Department for Children and Families said any agreement would not apply because a physician did not perform the insemination. Marotta said that was news to him. ""I didn't know that there was no doctor involved,"" he said. Lawyer blames political motivations . His lawyer, Ben Swinnen, accused the state, where same-sex marriage is not legal, of being politically motivated in its pursuit of his client. ""The cost to the state to bring this case far outweighs any benefit the state would get,"" said Swinnen, adding his client has no other children. Swinnen said the state is asking for $4,000 to recoup the money it has spent. It is also asking Marotta to pay child support, which could run into tens of thousands of dollars, he said. Swinnen said the Kansas court has failed to address many of the challenges brought forward by Marotta, under the guise of statutory interpretation of the law requiring the donor sperm to be provided to a licensed physician. ""From a very narrowly crafted statute, the court has made a very broad rule -- that is the issue,"" Swinnen said. Swinnen said he planned to appeal the decision. Marotta: ""I'm not her parent"" Marotta said he met the child once -- a few months ago -- when he and his wife by chance crossed paths with one of the girl's parents at an area carnival. He said he had no intention of assuming a paternal role. ""I'm not her parent,"" he said. But under Kansas law, he is her father. Had a physician carried out the insemination, that would not be the case, because Marotta would be able to document that he was a sperm donor and not the lover of the girl's mother, CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said. ""For all they know, they were lovers,"" she said. ""They need that documentation. He's the dad; he ought to be paying up."" Though a physician would have tested the sperm for sexually transmitted diseases and certain genetic disorders, there are disincentives associated with going through a physician. A single attempt at artificial insemination costs about $3,000, and sometimes several tries are needed. ""It's a lot cheaper to get someone to come on over with their donation, and then do it yourself at home,"" Cohen said. Meanwhile, Marotta owes legal fees and has taken his story to the news media. ""If enough noise gets made about it, at this point, maybe things will change for the better,"" he said. Asked whether, knowing what he now knows, he would answer the advertisement again, Marotta said, ""Probably not.""

"Claudia Lacy says she can accept anything: even that her youngest son committed suicide -- if it's proven and explained to her. However, she says, local and state investigators have done neither to support their theory that Lennon Lacy hanged himself one summer night. ""That's all I've ever asked for: what is due, owed rightfully to me and my family -- justice.  Prove to me what happened to my child,"" Lacy says. She says she's long lost confidence in the Bladenboro Police Department and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. Now, the FBI is looking into Lacy's death and the local and state investigations that followed. Without clear answers, the past few months without him have not been easy. ""I look for him and I don't see him.  I listen for him and I don't hear him,"" Lacy says. The last time Lacy saw and heard her son was August 28.  Lennon, 17, played the lineman position for the West Bladen High School Knights, and was focused on football. His family says that night, he packed a gym bag, washed his ankle brace and hung it on the clothesline to dry before heading out for an evening walk. The teen had asthma, his mother says, and a doctor had recommended he exercise outdoors at night when the temperature and humidity dropped.   Around 10:30, Lennon left his family's small apartment and headed down a dirt road. His family never saw him alive again. Just before 7:30 the next morning, he was found hanging from the frame of a swing set in the center of a mobile home community.  According to medical documents, his body was covered in fire ants. Lennon's mother was called to the scene several hours later, after he'd been placed into a body bag. ""It was unreal.  It was like a dream.  It was like I was not seeing what I was seeing,"" Lacy says. Immediately, Lacy believed her son's death was the result of some foul play. ""He didn't do this to himself,"" Lacy says. She believes Lennon was lynched. ""He may have either been strangled somewhere else or been placed there or he was hung there while people were around watching him die,"" Lennon's older brother, Pierre Lacey says. However, North Carolina's Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Deborah Radisch declared his death a suicide. When a state investigator asked Lacy if her son had been depressed recently, she told them he had -- because a relative had died recently.  The state medical examiner cited that exchange in the autopsy report.  Lacy says she did not mean that her son had been suffering from depression. ""When you just lose someone close to you, you're going to be depressed, upset, in mourning,"" Lacy says. The family says Lennon had not changed his routine and was focused on college and football -- and distracted by his girlfriend. The teen had been dating a 31-year-old white neighbor.  The age of consent in North Carolina is 16.  Some people in their small, southern town did not like that the two were together.  Lacy did not like their drastic age difference. ""I was shocked, disappointed.  I also, initially told him how I felt - that I did not approve of it,"" Lacy says. In the wake of his death, some wondered whether Lennon had been killed because he was in an interracial relationship. A week after Lennon was buried, a local teenager was arrested for defacing his grave. ""There are too many questions and it very well could be a lynching or a staged lynching.  We don't know -- but what we do know is there has to be a serious and full investigation of these matters,"" says Rev. William Barber, a national board member for the NAACP. The NAACP hired Florida-based forensic pathologist Christena Roberts to analyze the case and Dr. Radisch's autopsy, completed for the state. Roberts' first concern: basic physics.  Lennon was 5-foot-9.  The crossbar of the swing set frame he was found hanging from was 7-foot-6, according to the NAACP review.  With no swings or anything at the scene on which he could have climbed, according to the review, it's unclear how Lennon reached the top. ""His size, his stature does not add up to him being capable of constructing all of this alone - in the dark,"" Lennon's brother says. According to the 911 recording and the initial police report, a 52-year-old woman got the 207-pound teen down, while she was on the phone with an emergency dispatcher. ""Dr. Radisch also noted that she was not provided with photographs or dimensions of the swing set.  Without this information, she would be unable to evaluate the ability to create this scenario,"" according to the NAACP review. Lacy says she told investigators that the belts used to fashion the noose did not belong to Lennon. ""I know every piece and every stitch of clothes this child has -- I buy them, I know.  Those were not his belts,"" Lacy says. The Bladen County Coroner and Medical Examiner Hubert Kinlaw believed the belts might have been dog leashes. Radisch thought that ""some portion must be missing because there was no secondary cut in either belt.  The cut would have been necessary to bring down Lennon's body,"" according to the review. Also, the shoes Lennon was wearing when his body was found were not his, according to his family. Lennon's brother says he left home that night wearing size 12 Air Jordan's.  However, he was found wearing size 10.5 Nike Air Force shoes.  Those shoes were not with Lennon's body when he arrived at the state medical examiner's office, according to the NAACP review. ""He's going to walk a quarter mile from his house in a pair of shoes that's two sizes too small after he takes off his new pair of shoes - and this is a 17-year-old black kid with a brand new pair of Jordan's on.  He's going to take those Jordan's off and just get rid of them and put on some shoes that's not his -- we don't know where he got them from, no laces in them -- and continue to walk down this dirt road late at night to a swing set in the middle of the trailer park and hang himself,"" Lacey says. ""How can I believe that?"" Lacey added. There are also questions about who first declared Lennon's death a suicide. ""Dr. Radisch noted that her determination of (manner of death) in this case as suicide was based on the information she was provided by law enforcement and the local medical examiner.  She would have likely called the (manner of death) 'pending' while awaiting toxicology and investigation but the (local medical examiner) had already signed the (manner of death) as suicide,"" according to the NAACP review. However, in the summary of the case, written the day Lennon was found, the local medical examiner asked ""did he hang self?  Will autopsy tell us?""  Kinlaw also left the conclusion on the manner of death ""pending."" Local police and state investigators declined to speak with CNN.  CNN asked to interview Radisch about the statements attributed to her in the NAACP review.  Instead, a department spokesperson confirmed the exchanges through a written statement: . ""The comments that were released by the NAACP were a synopsis of a professional exchange between the NAACP's independently-retained forensic pathologist and Dr. Radisch,"" according to a spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Lennon's family believes there was a rush to judgment. And until someone clearly explains and proves how her son died, Lacy says she'll keep fighting until she gets answers. ""I take it one day at a time.  That's all I can say,"" Lacy says.","FBI is looking into the death of Lennon Lacy, 17, and the investigations that followed .

"UK police and emergency services were heavily criticized Wednesday for their handling of a tragedy at a soccer ground in 1989 in which 96 people died, after an independent panel for the first time reviewed thousands of documents previously kept out of public sight. The crush at Sheffield's Hillsborough Stadium on April 15, 1989, has cast a lasting shadow over Liverpool and the surrounding Merseyside area. The families of those killed and injured have for two decades battled to get to the truth about what happened on that awful day -- and to overturn what the independent panel found were ""strenuous attempts"" by police to deflect responsibility for the disaster to Liverpool fans by falsely claiming they were drunk and aggressive. The report released Wednesday reveals serious failings by police and emergency services and casts doubt on the original inquest's finding of accidental death. The panel also says the evidence indicated as many as 41 of those crushed could potentially have survived. ""A swifter, more appropriate, better focused and properly equipped response had the potential to save more lives,"" the report said. Prime Minister David Cameron said he is ""profoundly sorry"" about what happened and apologized for the long delay in giving answers to all those affected by ""one of the greatest peacetime tragedies of the last century."" ""The new evidence that we are presented with today makes clear that these families have suffered a double injustice,"" he told lawmakers in the House of Commons. ""The injustice of the appalling events -- the failure of the state to protect their loved ones and the indefensible wait to get to the truth. ""And the injustice of the denigration of the deceased -- that they were somehow at fault for their own deaths."" Cameron's apology on behalf of the government was the first offered to those whose lives were devastated by the Hillsborough disaster. The tragedy occurred when thousands of fans were let in through a gate into an already crowded standing area, leading many to be crushed against metal fences and concrete walls. Horrifying images from the scene showed panicked men, women and children pushed and trampled with nowhere to go as police lost control of the crowd. Of some 25,000 Liverpool fans who had traveled to Sheffield to watch their team play, 96 never came home. The victims' families, whose long campaign for justice led to the establishment last year of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, were the first to see its report Wednesday morning. Speaking at a vigil held in Liverpool Wednesday evening, Margaret Aspinall of the Hillsborough Family Support Group said the families' journey was nearly over but one more step remained: for a new inquest to be held. Anne Williams of the group Hope for Hillsborough said her teenage son Kevin was one of those who might have lived with appropriate medical help. She also insisted on the need for a new inquest. ""My son and 95 Liverpool fans did not die in an accident. They were unlawfully killed at the least,"" she said. In its study of about 450,000 pages of documents, the panel found evidence that South Yorkshire Police sought to deflect responsibility for the disaster to Liverpool fans, presenting a case that emphasized exceptional levels of drunkenness and aggression among them. There is no evidence to support this view, the report said. ""A narrative about hooliganism on that day was created which led many in the country to accept that it was somehow a gray area,"" Cameron said. ""Today's report is black and white. The Liverpool fans 'were not the cause of the disaster.'"" The panel's analysis of the evidence found that substantive amendments were made by South Yorkshire Police to remove and alter comments unfavorable to their organization. Of 164 police statements that were ""significantly amended,"" 116 were doctored to remove negative comments about the force's response and leadership, the report said. The insult was compounded by a story published at the time in The Sun newspaper, headlined ""The Truth,"" in which it was falsely reported that Liverpool fans had been drunk, violent and had stolen from the dead. Those false claims have for the first time been traced back to South Yorkshire Police sources, Cameron said. The current editor of The Sun, Dominic Mohan, said in a statement released Thursday that the newspaper is ""deeply ashamed and profoundly sorry"" for having reported that untrue version of events. ""Twenty-three years ago The Sun newspaper made a terrible mistake. We published an inaccurate and offensive story about the events at Hillsborough. We said it was the truth -- it wasn't,"" he wrote. The report also shows for the first time that South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service documents were subject to the same kind of alterations as those of police, and that the ambulance service failed to implement its major incident plan properly. Relatives have long believed that some of those caught up in the crush could have lived if they had received timely medical treatment. An investigation by safety officers found that the grounds were structurally unsafe and that the stadium, which is home to the Sheffield Wednesday football club, should not have been used for the match, in which Liverpool played Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup semifinal. Severely restricted turnstiles, poor conditions on the terraces and inadequate safety barriers with virtually no means of escape all contributed to the deadly crush, the panel found. The panel's report also raised profound concerns about the conduct of the original inquest into the deaths, held in 1991, which operated on the assumption that all the deaths occurred within 15 minutes of the crush. Cameron said the attorney general would study the newly revealed evidence immediately, and could choose to request a new inquest. He said that while the panel found the language used in government papers at the time was ""insensitive,"" it found no evidence that the government, then headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, tried to conceal the truth of what had happened. Cameron said the report would make ""harrowing"" and uncomfortable reading for many people, but it was right that the truth had finally been revealed. The Right Rev. James Jones, bishop of Liverpool, who chaired the panel, said it had produced the report ""in the profound hope that greater transparency will bring to the families and the wider public a greater understanding of the tragedy and its aftermath."" ""For it is only with this transparency,"" he added, ""that the families and survivors, who have behaved with such dignity, can with some sense of truth and justice cherish the memory of their 96 loved ones."" A two-minute silence will be held in Liverpool on Wednesday afternoon in memory of those killed. The current chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, David Crompton, said he is ""profoundly sorry"" for what had happened on April 15, 1989, and for what had followed. ""On that day South Yorkshire Police failed the victims and families. The police lost control,"" he said. ""In the immediate aftermath senior officers sought to change the record of events.  Disgraceful lies were told which blamed the Liverpool fans for the disaster. ""Statements were altered which sought to minimize police blame. These actions have caused untold pain and distress for over 23 years."" However, the force is ""a very different place in 2012 from what it was 23 years ago,"" he added, and it is committed to being open and transparent as the panel seeks answers. An online archive of the documents is to be made available to the public beginning Wednesday. Sheffield Wednesday, which still plays at Hillsborough, also offered its ""sincere condolences and an apology to all the families who have suffered"" as a result of the tragedy, in an online statement. The impact of English football's darkest day lives on in the tributes still paid by Liverpool to its lost sons and daughters, husbands and fathers. But the tragedy also forced the sport to change on a national basis, and in a way still felt today, with stadiums modernized and made more family friendly, leading in turn to greater investment from sponsors and TV broadcasters.","The mother of a victim vows to continue the fight for a new inquest verdict .

"If you doubt there's an unwritten code of honor among criminals -- governing certain behavior that's just not permitted -- consider this: . Police say a burglar in southern Spain who stole an old Super 8 camera and tapes from a home discovered to his horror the graphic video content of a man sexually abusing boys. The burglar put three tapes in a brown envelope, hid them under a parked car, and then called police from a public phone, directing them to go find it. Inside the envelope, police found a note with the home address of the suspected pedophile and a message from the burglar: . ""I've had the misfortune that these tapes have fallen into my hands and I feel obligated to turn them in so that you can do your job and put that (expletive) in prison for life."" Spanish national police confirmed Thursday they arrested a 64-year-old suspected child molester this week at his home -- the one that had been burglarized -- in the southern provincial capital of Jaen. The suspect is a local football (soccer) coach who lived alone. He lured some of his young players into watching pornographic videos together, and then sexually abused them, police said. Police have identified four minor boys who were victims of the alleged abuse, including a 16-year-old who may have been abused for six years. The suspected pedophile had reported the burglary at his home to police, listing various electrical appliances that were stolen. But he didn't mention the camera or the tapes, police said. At his home, police said they found other tapes with graphic content of sexual abuse of boys. And yes, they're still looking for the burglar, the one ""with a conscience,"" said a police officer in Jaen.","A burglar in steals an old Super 8 camera and tapes from a home in southern Spain .

"An Australian crocodile named Elvis took matters into his own hands -- or rather, jaws -- Wednesday when he became annoyed by the sound of a lawnmower. The five-meter (16-foot) beast, who lives at the Australian Reptile Park in Somersby, near Sydney, apparently became enraged when two noisy mowers were taken into his enclosure at the same time, a keeper told CNN affiliate 7 News. Video footage shows Elvis sinking his teeth into the mower and dragging it into his pool, where he then guards it until the machine ""drowns,"" as prey would when pulled underwater. Keeper Tim Falkner can be heard shouting ""let it go, let it go"" to his co-worker as the saltwater crocodile takes hold. A post on the park's website recounts how ""cranky croc Elvis"" made his move. ""Out of nowhere, he lunged at one of the mowers, dragging it down into the lagoon. He then guarded his new prize until a couple of brave keepers jumped into the enclosure to retrieve the mower and two teeth that he lost in the process! We're happy to report that no one was hurt and Elvis is none the worse for his adventure."" Video shows the crocodile being lured away from his trophy by one of the keepers with a piece of meat on a stick, while the other ventures into the water as a crowd of visitors watch from a safe distance. As the largest crocodile in New South Wales, Elvis has exceptionally big teeth, keepers say, with the largest measuring 9 centimeters in length (3.5 inches). The 50-year-old reptile was given a home in the park in 2008, after causing trouble in Darwin harbor by climbing onto fishing boats, according to the Australian Associated Press. Visitors can watch him being fed on weekends and holidays -- but may not get to see him munching on a mower again any time soon.","Saltwater crocodile Elvis is the largest in New South Wales, the reptile park says .

"A central California man has been arrested for possession of child pornography, thanks to a tip from burglars who robbed the man's property, authorities said. Last month, a juvenile and a 19-year-old illegally accessed the property of Kraig Stockard, 54, of Delhi, California, according to a statement from Deputy Tom MacKenzie of the Merced County Sheriff's Department.  They broke into Stockard's barn and stole about 50 CDs they believed were blank. Stockard filed a police report on the incident on September 12, according to MacKenzie. But the young people who stole the CDs were in for a surprise. When they began putting the discs into their computer, they discovered that some of them contained pornographic images of children, the statement said. Despite having obtained the CDs under decidedly shady circumstances, the pair decided to report Stockard to the police. A search warrant was served and three more computers and three laptops were taken from Stockard's home, along with several external hard drives. Police said there were thousands of pictures and movies on the CDs -- more than 30 of the 50 discs had child pornography on them. Investigators said Stockard has been downloading indecent images of children since 2004.  He has admitted possessing the pornography on the CDs but has refused to say whether there is pornography on the computers, they said. Stockard was booked for possession of child pornography and posted $25,000 bail. The two burglar suspects who reported Stockard have not been arrested. Their case has been sent to the Merced County District Attorney's Office for review.  When reached for comment, a press officer told CNN the office could not comment on the case because one of the  informants in question is a juvenile.","Police arrest a man on child pornography charges after a tip from two burglary suspects .

"The extraordinary revelation this week that the Internal Revenue Service targeted tea party groups for more aggressive enforcement highlights exactly why caution is needed in any response to the much-vilified Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC. It also shows how all Americans, from the most liberal to the most conservative, should closely guard their First Amendment rights, and why giving the government too much power to limit political speech will inevitably result in selective enforcement against unpopular groups. To the agency's credit, Lois Lerner, a senior official at the IRS, apologized on Friday for these unconstitutional practices, which are as unseemly as the Bush administration's targeting of the NAACP and the House of Representatives' defunding of Planned Parenthood on purely political grounds. Lerner said that career IRS staff who were reviewing applicants for tax-exempt status took a harder look at applications with ""tea party"" or ""patriot"" in their names. She stressed that the added scrutiny was done as a ""shortcut,"" not out of ""political bias.""  But her admission calls into question earlier claims by the agency that IRS scrutiny wasn't politically motivated, and it comes in the face of repeated complaints by right-wing groups that they have been treated unfairly. Collins says IRS revelations will fuel distrust in government . Before addressing the obvious constitutional concerns with the selective use of the tax code against political opponents, here's some background. Certain public interest groups, like charities and nonprofit athletic organizations, do not have to pay federal income tax on their donations or dues. These tax-exempt groups include 501(c)(4) organizations (named for the relevant section of the code). To qualify, a group must be ""operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare."" The definition of ""social welfare"" is broad, and applies to all points of view. The ACLU's lobbying arm, for which we work, is a 501(c)(4). So is the National Right to Life Committee. These social welfare groups are forbidden from engaging in too much partisan political activity. How much is too much, however, is controversial and remains uncertain. An organization that crosses over the fuzzy line will be denied tax-exempt status. Crucially, 501(c)(4) organizations, in most cases, need not publicly disclose their donors. That policy is driven by the same concerns that prompted the Supreme Court in a civil rights-era case, NAACP v. Alabama, to prohibit that state from forcing the NAACP to out its members as a condition of operating. The court reasoned, rightly, that such disclosure could lead to violence against existing members and would dissuade potential members from joining at all. Now, during the past couple of elections there has been a surge in applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status. Some argue that these new groups are being created specifically to help elect or defeat candidates, which would otherwise prompt full donor disclosure to the Federal Election Commission. Opponents claim these groups are abusively claiming tax-exempt status to keep their donor lists secret. Some further claim that these groups then allow wealthy individuals, corporations, and unions to anonymously funnel large amounts of money into ads supporting or attacking political candidates. As a consequence, the IRS has been under enormous pressure to speed up and aggressively investigate applications for tax-exempt status -- both reasonable demands, if carried out impartially. But much of this outside pressure has come from the left and has been directed at conservative groups, who have an advantage in this ""dark"" political money. It sounds as though the events surrounding the IRS announcement can be partly attributed to this growth in applications and the pressure to uncover ""sham"" 501(c)(4) groups. Although the IRS claims this was an honest mistake, these revelations are troubling on many levels. For instance, there are several proposals circulating in Washington right now that would make it much easier for the IRS and other regulators to force political groups to disclose their donors. These disclosure requirements would apply even when the group is advocating purely on an issue of public interest, from clean air to abortion, and would apply to groups of all political persuasions and not just to groups supporting or opposing candidates for office. The ACLU has expressed concern with these disclosure requirements precisely because they open the door to selective enforcement. Such concerns are often dismissed as speculative and overly pessimistic, but the IRS apology shows that concerns over selective enforcement are prescient. Those in power will always be tempted to use political speech restrictions against opposing candidates or causes. The IRS announcement demonstrates that we should carefully consider any new policy that allows the government to restrict or chill political speech, including broader donor disclosure requirements. Congress and the administration should also act immediately to create ironclad checks on the IRS to prevent this from ever happening again. It shouldn't need to be said: Even the tea party deserves First Amendment protection.","IRS targeted tea party groups for more aggressive tax law enforcement .

"(CNN)The Seattle Seahawks not only lost the Super Bowl this week, but they also lost a longtime fan. Michael Vedvik, 53, a Seahawks fan since the 1970s, died early Monday of a heart attack. His wife, Stephanie Vedvik, remembers him as a ""vibrant"" football fan with a ""large personality."" During the football season, she says, he wore something with a Seahawks logo on it every day, even to work. An obituary that appeared in The (Spokane) Spokesman-Review describes him as a small business owner in Kent, Washington, who loved his family, his work and the Seahawks. The obit also blames the Seahawks' ""lousy play call for Mike's untimely demise,"" which Stephanie Vedvik says was a joke meant to cheer up her husband's loved ones. ""He was his own person, and he would have loved it,"" Vedvik said. ""We have gotten a little criticism, but it was an obituary just meant for our family and our friends, and it was meant to lighten it up for us."" His death, Vedvik said, ""just devastated our whole family."" She said she was too upset to write the obituary, so his sister did it. ""She sent me the copy and it was just standard and I said, 'OK, that's fine,' and then she said, 'Well, Dan (her husband) wanted to add this line. I think it's funny. What do you think?' and I said, 'I think it's great, I think Michael would have just loved it.' If I had read this to him about somebody else, he would have had a laugh and thought it was hysterical,"" Vedvik said. ""It was like my last joke, this was a man who married me in Las Vegas in front of Elvis 11 years ago because he didn't want a traditional wedding -- he wanted it to be fun. He wouldn't have us all sitting around crying like we had been doing."" Vedvik said that they were happy to see the Seahawks win the Super Bowl last year, but that sadly her husband never even learned the score of this year's big game. The Seahawks lost Super Bowl XLIX to the New England Patriots 28-24. With seconds to play on the 1-yard-line, Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll called for a pass, and Malcolm Butler made a game-saving interception for the Patriots. A questionable decision to pass, a brawl and other key Super Bowl moments . ""He was really looking forward to the Super Bowl all week, but he hadn't been feeling well so he thought he could watch it later,"" Vedvik said. ""He went up to bed, this had been something going on for a while, and I had been trying to get him to go to the doctor, and I went up to check on him periodically, he had been sleeping. He thought he had indigestion, he thought maybe it was a little bit of stress. ... He didn't think it was serious."" Vedvik said she thinks her husband may have had a hand in making this story go viral. ""He would have loved being famous for 15 minutes. He loved the Seahawks, and he had a great sense of humor,"" she said. CNN reached out to the Seahawks for comment but was unsuccessful. Michael Vedvik's funeral is set for Saturday at a church in Mead, Washington.","Longtime Seattle Seahawks fan Michael Vedvik, 53, died of heart attack .

"After killing a man at an Ohio Walmart, police interrogated his girlfriend, accusing her of lying, threatening her with jail time and suggesting she could be on drugs, according to a video obtained by CNN. The man, John Crawford III, was holding an air rifle he had picked up off a store shelf when police shot him. A prosecutor called the case a ""perfect storm"" with ""no bad guys,"" but the family has said police used excessive force. A grand jury decided not to indict the officer who pulled the trigger in the August 5 shooting at a Walmart store in Beavercreek, Ohio. While the Justice Department investigates the case, Crawford's name -- along with Michael Brown and Eric Garner -- is being chanted by some demonstrators across the country protesting what they say is systemic racism that fuels police violence. Now, the family's lawyer says the recently released interrogation video shows police were trying to force Crawford's girlfriend to say something to justify what they'd done. ""This was just an effort to cover up this bad shooting,"" attorney Michael Wright said. Family of man killed sues police, Walmart . Tense interrogation . In the interrogation video, which was first posted on The Guardian's website on Sunday, a police detective repeatedly presses Crawford's tearful girlfriend, asking her where Crawford got the gun he had in the store. ""You understand that we're investigating a serious incident,"" Detective Rodney Curd says. ""You lie to me and you might be on your way to jail."" ""I swear to God, on my job, my family, on everything I love,"" Tasha Thomas replies, telling the detective repeatedly that she never saw Crawford with a weapon and that she'll take a polygraph test to prove it. As she cries, the detective appears unconvinced. ""Why would he have a gun in the store?"" he asks. ""I don't know,"" she replies. ""Did he carry a gun?"" the detective continues. ""Not that I. ... I've never known him to have a gun,"" she says. Her response appears to upset the detective. ""Don't tell me, 'not that you know,' because that's the first thing that I realize that somebody's not telling me the truth, when they say that kind of stuff,"" Curd says. At one point in the video, Thomas sobs as she buries her head in her hands. The detective says he'll write down her testimony but then asks whether she's under the influence of drugs or alcohol. ""Your eyes are kind of messed up looking and you seem a little lethargic at times,"" he says, ""and I don't know if it's because you're upset or not. I just want to make sure what's going on."" It's not until the end of the 90-minute interrogation that Thomas learns her boyfriend has died. ""Well, to let you know, John has passed away as a result of this,"" the detective says. Thomas sinks back in her chair and puts her hands on her head. ""I don't know any other way to tell you,"" Curd says. ""What happened there wasn't a good thing and as a result of his actions, he is gone."" Detective: 'I was very direct in my questions' Police have not responded to several requests from CNN for comment on the video. In a statement officials released in September, Curd describes his questioning of Thomas at the police department. ""The initial information I had was that (Crawford) may have brought a gun into the store with him. So I was very direct in my questions that I was having problems believing she would have not seen him bring a gun into the store,"" he wrote. ""She became emotional during the interview and started crying, saying that she is not lying, she will take a lie detector test and do whatever she needs to do."" In his report, Curd wrote that it was only later when he was at the Walmart that he learned where the gun came from. ""I also learned while on scene that the rifle involved was a pellet gun that was taken from a box while he was inside the store,"" he wrote. ""This would also agree with the statement that she made that he did not take any type of firearm out of her car into the store with him."" Attorney: Interrogation shows police 'tried to cover it up' Wright on Tuesday said his legal team filed a federal civil lawsuit against two police officers; Beavercreek's police chief; the city of Beavercreek and its police department; and Walmart. The Crawford family is seeking at least $75,000 in compensatory damages and an unstated amount for punitive damages, the suit said. The family alleges, among other things, that the police officers did not do due diligence to determine that Wright wasn't a threat; that the officers didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon; and that Walmart was negligent because the air rifle had been resting on a shelf, unpackaged, for at least two days, the family's lawyers said Tuesday. Wright said police knew Crawford didn't have a firearm when he walked into the Walmart. ""He was not an imminent threat to anyone. He was just shopping,"" he said. After the grand jury decided in September not to indict the police officers who were involved in the shooting, prosecutor Mark Piepmeier said a ""perfect storm of circumstances"" led to Crawford's death and noted that the air gun bore a strong resemblance to an actual automatic weapon. ""It is very hard to tell the difference,"" Piepmeier said. Police responded to the scene after a witness called 911 and told dispatchers that Crawford was walking around with a rifle and ""waving it back and forth."" According to police, when officers arrived, Crawford did not comply with their commands to drop his weapon. And the Crawford family's lawyers say police didn't give him enough time to put down the weapon. But Wright said that because Crawford was black, police made assumptions. ""The officers ran into an aisle, saw a black man with what they perceived to be a gun, and shot him on sight,"" he said. The interrogation video, he said, shows how police handled the case from day one. ""They, in their mind, had it made up that Mr. Crawford was a criminal, and they proceeded based on that without doing anything to independently corroborate what was actually happening in the store,"" he said. ""And they tried to cover it up by interrogating Miss Thomas in such a manner to try to get her to make a statement that would justify them shooting and killing Mr. Crawford that evening.""

"(CNN) -- There's no ""authentic"" way to be black, President Barack Obama told a group. For once, I agree with the President. Speaking at a town hall event this week about his ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative, the President gave blacks permission to be individuals, rejecting the idiotic notion that speaking proper English and being successful in life is ""acting white."" As if any person of any race with two grains of sense would think this is logical. During the event, Obama was asked by a young Native American man, ""How is the United States government helping American Indian people revitalize their language and culture?"" Obama responded: ""What's great about America is the way that we all take these different cultures and we make one culture out of it."" Obama said that it is important for Americans to know their roots and where they come from, but not be held hostage by our cultures from advancing in life. Then, Obama got real. He talked about how black Americans use this ""group think"" psychology to bully other blacks, keep them from expressing themselves as individuals and stop them from assimilating into the broader culture of America. ""Sometimes African-Americans, in communities where I've worked, there's been the notion of 'acting white' -- which sometimes is overstated,"" he told the group. ""But there's an element of truth to it, where, OK, if boys are reading too much, then, well, why are you doing that? Or why are you speaking so properly? And the notion that there's some authentic way of being black, that if you're going to be black you have to act a certain way and wear a certain kind of clothes, that has to go. There are many different ways for African-American men to be authentic."" He went on to use his wife, first lady Michelle Obama, as an example. ""If you look at Michelle, she grew up South Side. And her mom still lives in a neighborhood where gunshots go off, and it can be rough where Michelle grew up. But she'll talk proper when she needs to. Now, you also don't want to get on her wrong side, because she can translate that into a different vernacular. But my point is, is that you don't have to act a certain way to be authentic."" I rolled my eyes in disgust, remembering all the times in my life that phrase has been hurled at me from other blacks. Growing up, I wasn't raised in a home where we ""talked or acted black"" -- speaking broken English, neck jerking and behaving like the black stereotypes we see in some of the Tyler Perry movies. So, I was shocked to encounter such nonsense when I attended Georgetown University as an undergraduate. Most of the black students -- who generally all hung out in the same pack, eating, studying and socializing exclusively together -- informed me I was an ""Uncle Tom,"" not really black because I chose to have an integrated experience at Georgetown. One of the biggest sins I committed was refusing to eat at the all-black cafeteria tables in the various dorms. I would wonder, if you only want to socialize with black students, then why not just attend a predominantly black college? My freshman year, I went to a dance with a white guy from my class. When he came by my dorm room to pick me up, two black girls from across the hall stared and snickered, uttering something along the lines that I wanted to be white so bad. Really? The next day the same girls heckled me again about my date. Tired of dealing with their stupidity, I walked over and told them I would continue to do whatever I wanted.

"The possibility of closure for relatives of the passengers and crew of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may have emerged from the depths of the southern Indian Ocean on Saturday in the form of an unconfirmed pulse signal. After an agonizing month of waiting, however, the 37.5 kHz signal detected by a Chinese patrol ship could be another siren song in the mysterious disappearance of and search for the Boeing 777 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members. The signal reported ""is the standard beacon frequency"" for the plane's cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder, said Anish Patel, president of pinger manufacturer Dukane Seacom. Other experts cautioned that no confirmation had been made that the signal was linked to the missing plane. ""I don't believe it,"" Jack Song, whose sister was on the flight, told CNN. ""There's no piece of debris, so how can you find the black box? So you can just wait for more news tomorrow. Maybe it'll be another mistake."" His elder sister was returning from a holiday. Her connecting flight was through Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. After news of the missing flight, Song took leave from his job and went to Beijing in search of answers. Song and eight other passengers' relatives had been gathering in a Beijing hotel room and designating themselves a media committee. They protested in front of the Malaysian Embassy in China and shared with the media a video of meetings with Malaysian officials. They have expressed their dissatisfaction with the Malaysian government's explanation that satellite data indicated the plane most likely crashed in the Indian Ocean. Tom Wood, a brother of American passenger Philip Wood, said his family would have no comment until authorities provide concrete evidence. ""We don't want to give any reaction right now,"" he told CNN on Saturday. ""We want something solid before commenting on anything. When they know something for sure, then I myself, my brother, my parents will be happy to talk."" The Wood family will not say goodbye without seeing something that shows that Philip Wood died. The IBM executive, who was headed back to Beijing before taking a new assignment in Malaysia, was one of three Americans on Flight 370. In a text message in Kuala Lumpur, Jiang Hui, a Chinese relative of a passenger, responded with caution: ""THERE IS NO CONFIRMATION, AND WE ARE ALL WAITING PATIENTLY."" The majority of the passengers were from China. Relatives of the 154 Chinese passengers who were aboard Flight 370 have been oscillating between grief and visceral anger as the search for the plane carrying their loved ones continues. Is it or isn't it? New questions . The possible breakthrough in the search was reported by the state news agency Xinhua, which said the Chinese patrol ship Saturday detected the pulse signal used by so-called black boxes. But the pulse signal has not been confirmed, China's Maritime Search and Rescue Center reported, according to China Communications News, which is the Ministry of Transport's official newspaper. Also found Saturday -- spotted by a Chinese air force search plane -- were white objects floating near the search area, about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) from Perth, Australia, Xinhua said. Flight 370 vanished on March 8 while flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Authorities from around the world have been searching the Indian Ocean for the missing plane but have so far found nothing, leaving families of the passengers with unanswered questions. Some have criticized the response and accused Malaysian officials of giving them confusing, conflicting information. On Monday, dozens of Chinese relatives visited a Kuala Lumpur temple. They chanted, lit candles and meditated. ""Chinese are kindhearted people,"" said Hui, the families' designated representative. ""But we can clearly distinguish between the good and evil. We will never forgive for covering the truth from us and the criminal who delayed the rescue mission."" Hui asked Malaysia to apologize for announcing on March 24 that the plane had crashed, despite the lack of any ""direct evidence."" On March 24, Malaysia Airlines and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that the plane had gone down in the southern Indian Ocean and that there were no survivors. But nothing related to the flight has been found, and that has deepened the pain for some.","A Chinese ship hears a pulse signal in the southern Indian Ocean .

"With her distinctive sleek braid and fiery oratory, Yulia Tymoshenko is back in the center stage of Ukraine politics. And it's almost like she never left. Tymoshenko, 53, was freed from prison Saturday after two-and-a-half years, most of them spent in a detention hospital. Dressed in black, she later emerged at Kiev's Independence Square in a wheel chair. Cheers erupted. Tearfully, she hailed the sea of protesters, who listened and occasionally waved. ""Today, Ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator,"" she said, referring to ousted President Viktor Yanukovych. She then passed on a not-so-subtle message. ""There'll be no Ukraine but the Ukraine you want,"" she said. ""And I'm the guarantor of that Ukraine."" The polarizing former Prime Minister has a complicated relationship with Yanukovych, who fled the capital Saturday after days of bloody protests that killed dozens. Both have dominated the nation's politics for years. Both have a rivalry that dates years. READ MORE: Who's in charge of Ukraine? Rise and fall . Tymoshenko was born in 1960 in Dnipropetrovsk. Before she joined politics, she worked in the gas industry, including a stint as president of an energy company in the 1990s. Her international popularity soared a decade ago as a result of her ardent speeches that helped overturn Yanukovych's presidential win in 2004. She's considered a hero of the country's 2004 Orange Revolution, a wave of peaceful protests that swept her and Viktor Yushchenko into power as Prime Minister and President, respectively. Track how the crisis unfolded in Ukraine . The same revolution successfully overturned what many believed was a largely false presidential win by Yanukovych. But the promise of the revolution soon turned sour. The two feuded publicly, prompting  Yushchenko to fire her a few months into her term. In 2007,  Tymoshenko was back as Prime Minister. But she was dogged by accusations of irregularities and overlooking the nation's economic problems. Her tense working relation with Yushchenko did not help their case. Analysts say it was one of the reasons she lost to Yanukovych in the  2010 presidential elections. Who's who in Ukraine unrest . Forced out . After Yanukovych won that election, Tymoshenko, was forced out of office and into the courtroom.  In 2011, she was on trial  over a costly natural gas agreement that she signed with Russia while she was Prime Minister. In October of that year, a Ukrainian court found her guilty of abuse of authority for signing overpriced gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her to  seven years in prison. The prosecutor said the gas deals inflicted damage to the country amounting to more than 1.5 billion hryvnias (almost $190 million at the exchange rate at the time). In addition to the sentence, the court ruled she must repay the money. Amnesty International slammed the verdict as ""politically motivated"" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was Prime Minister from January to September 2005, and December 2007 to March 2010. The case against her was widely considered politically motivated, and the United States and other Western nations called her ""a political prisoner."" Hunger strike . Her activism work continued while she was behind bars. Two years ago, she went on a hunger strike to draw attention to ""violence and lack of rights""after she  was allegedly beaten unconscious by guards. She ended her hunger strike after  three weeks and agreed to receive medical treatment. Tymoshenko was freed Saturday after parliament ordered charges against her dropped. She went from her hospital bed, and into the twists and turns of Ukrainian politics. 20 questions: What's behind Ukraine's political crisis?","""I'm the guarantor of that Ukraine,"" she tells a crowd .

"After a 10-year chase taking it billions of miles across the solar system, the Rosetta spacecraft made history Wednesday as it became the first probe to rendezvous with a comet on its journey around the sun. ""Thruster burn complete. Rosetta has arrived at comet 67P. We're in orbit!"" announced the European Space Agency, which is leading the ambitious project, on Twitter. Rosetta fired its thrusters on its final approach to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, known as ""Chury"" for short, on Wednesday morning. Half an hour after the burn, scientists announced that the craft had entered into the orbit of the streaking comet. ""After 10 years, five months and four days travelling towards our destination, looping around the sun five times, we are delighted to announce finally 'we are here',"" said Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA's Director General, in a statement. ""Europe's Rosetta is now the first spacecraft in history to rendezvous with a comet, a major highlight in exploring our origins. Discoveries can start."" ESA tweeted a photo of the comet after Rosetta's maneuver. Chury and the space probe now lie some 250 million miles from Earth, about half way between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars, according to ESA. The first spectacular and detailed images taken from just 80 miles away shows boulders, craters and steep cliffs and are already causing excitement. ""Churyumov-Gerasimenko looks like it's been through the wars!"" said Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society in the UK. ""With that odd looking 'neck', either we're looking at two objects that merged together or so much material has been lost in its many passes around the sun that the comet is a shadow of what it started out as. ""The pictures coming back so far look intriguing -- and imagine the kind of scenes we can expect when Philae lands this coming November,"" he said. To get to its destination the spacecraft has covered more than three billion miles and as the comet hurtles towards the sun it will reach a speed of about 62,000 miles per hour. The mission has now achieved the first of what it hopes will be a series of historic accomplishments. In November mission controllers aim to place the robotic lander Philae on the surface -- something that has never been done before. Previous missions have performed comet fly-bys but Rosetta is different. This probe will follow the comet for more than a year, mapping and measuring how it changes as it is blasted by the sun's energy. Mission controllers had to use the gravity of Earth and Mars to give the probe a slingshot acceleration to meet its target on the right trajectory. Rosetta also had to be put into hibernation for more than two years to conserve power before being woken up successfully in January this year. Wednesday's thruster burn was the tenth rendezvous maneuver Rosetta has performed since May to get the probe's speed and trajectory to align with the comet's -- and if any of those operations had failed, the mission would have been lost, according to ESA. Interactive: See how Rosetta chases the comet across the solar system . For the next few weeks, ESA says the spacecraft will be in a triangular orbit until it gets to about 18 miles of the surface when it starts its close observations. Scientists hope to learn more about the composition of comets and perhaps whether they brought water to the Earth or even the chemicals that make up the building blocks of life. ""It really is such a step forward to anything that has come before,"" project scientist Matt Taylor told CNN. Rosetta will soon begin mapping the surface of and finding out more about its gravitational pull. This will help to find a suitable landing site for Philae and allow engineers to keep Rosetta in the right orbit. As comets approach the sun, any ice melts and is turned into an ionized gas tail. The dust produces a separate, curving tail. It's these processes that Rosetta scientists hope to be able to study from close proximity. Taylor explained that the survey will show the team what the comet nucleus looks like now and when it gets closer to the sun. ""We'll be able to make a comparison to now, when its relatively inert, to when it's highly active ... making this measurement over a year when we're riding alongside at walking pace and observing how a comet works and interacts with the sun,"" he said. ""We are there for over a year to see this complete development to the extent that you may even be able to measure the decrease in the volume of the nucleus ... see how much material has left the comet."" Chury is known as a short-period comet. It reappears every six years as its orbit brings it close to the sun. Halley's comet has a period of about 76 years and is not due to return close enough to Earth to be visible until 2061. Others only return after thousands of years. Matt Taylor says it is unlikely that you will be able to see comet 67P with the naked eye but you can follow the progress of the mission on Rosetta's blog and find out more with CNN's interactive coverage.","Rosetta is attempting to become first spacecraft to orbit and land on a comet .

"A Wesleyan University student who says she was raped in front of onlookers at a ""wildly out of control"" campus fraternity party has filed a lawsuit against Xi Chapter of Psi Upsilon, 11 of its members and the alleged assailant, according to court documents. Cabri Chamberlin, then a freshman, said she was raped by another student last May at the Xi Chapter of Psi Upsilon fraternity house in Middletown, Connecticut, at a pledge ""strip show,"" says the suit, which was filed Tuesday in a Connecticut federal court. CNN does not usually identify victims of sexual assault but has done so in this case because the woman wanted to make her name public. ""I'm proceeding in this case with my real name instead of 'Jane Doe' because as the victim of a heinous violent crime I've done nothing wrong and have nothing to be ashamed of,"" Chamberlin said in a statement provided by her lawyer. ""I can't even describe the pain of being raped, or how much it alters a life, and no other person should ever be forced to have that experience. I hope my experience and lawsuit will create changes that protect others."" At the party, the lawsuit says, many ""underage and extremely intoxicated"" young people danced with naked pledges and ""spilled alcohol throughout the area."" Chamberlin, who has taken a leave from her studies, said she became extremely uncomfortable, put on her jacket and attempted to leave when a male student picked her up from behind and raped her in the presence of ""numerous others,"" according to the lawsuit. Wesleyan public safety officers then took her to a nearby hospital, where a diagnosis of sexual assault was documented, the lawsuit says. ""Psi Upsilon Fraternity takes all reports of risk management violations, especially those with regard to sexual assault, very seriously,"" Tom Fox, executive director of Psi Upsilon Fraternity, said on the fraternity's website. ""We are currently investigating the incident and gathering further information."" After an internal investigation, the university expelled the alleged perpetrator and imposed ""sanctions against the fraternity and members,"" according to a statement by Wesleyan President Michael S. Roth. The student named in the lawsuit, who has not been charged criminally, did not return calls seeking comment. Middletown police confirmed that they responded to a sexual assault complaint from the Psi Upsilon Fraternity house on May 4, 2013, spokeswoman Lt. Heather Desmond said. The investigation is ongoing, and no charges have been filed, she said. Desmond said police were having difficulty finding witnesses and urged anyone who attended the party from May 3 into May 4 and may have witnessed anything to call police. The lawsuit says the fraternity contractually demands self-governance from Wesleyan, relinquishing the public safety and housing services the university generally provides to students. The fraternity allegedly failed to adequately provide its own security, and the defendants failed to train themselves in safety and risk management issues, including sexual abuse prevention, hazing and the misuse of alcohol, according to the lawsuit. Chamberlin's lawyer, Douglas Fierberg, said that because the fraternity sets itself apart from the university, officers from the university's Department of Public Safety can enter the fraternity only in ""exigent circumstances"" or when specifically asked to come in. ""This lawsuit seeks to hold this fraternity responsible for its gross mismanagement which it does under the guise of self-management,"" Fierberg told CNN. ""Fraternity self-management has historically proven itself to be flawed and dangerous. Women have been raped because of this mismanagement. People have died because of this mismanagement. And this victim will hold the fraternity responsible for its tradition of dangerous mismanagement."" Wesleyan University would not comment on the fraternity's arrangement with the Department of Public Safety, but Roth's statement acknowledged that the university's fraternities have ""some autonomy."" ""All have seen increased scrutiny over the past few years,"" Roth said of fraternities. ""We intend to focus our attention on improving the safety of these spaces."" Wesleyan University was not named in the lawsuit. ""On behalf of the university community, I want to express our horror at this shameful assault,"" Roth said in the statement. ""Sexual violence will never be tolerated on our campus. Sexual violence on college campuses is a national problem, and it's important to raise awareness about this issue. At Wesleyan we are committed to caring for survivors, vigorously pursuing perpetrators, and creating a positive campus climate in which sexual violence and misconduct have no place."" Chamberlin has taken a leave of absence from the university since the attack and is receiving ""intensive counseling, trying to pull her life together,"" her lawyer said. Chamberlin is seeking $10 million in damages, the lawsuit says. In 2012, a Wesleyan student sued the university and another fraternity, which Wesleyan no longer recognizes as a student organization, after she said she was raped in its frat house two years before. The fraternity had garnered the on-campus reputation as the ""Rape Factory,"" according to the lawsuit. Her assailant pleaded guilty to assault and unlawful restraint, court papers said. The case was settled in court-ordered mediation in August 2013.

"(CNN) -- After an improbable 10-year, 310-million-mile journey to become the first ever space vehicle to make a soft landing on a comet, the Philae probe may have ended its mission prematurely. Its batteries have run down, said the European Space Agency. ""Philae has fallen into 'idle mode' for a potentially long silence. In this mode, all instruments and most systems on board are shut down,"" ESA said. This might not change. Philae was supposed to transmit data from Comet 67/P for nine months as it passed the sun, running on solar power, but it did not get its place in the sunlight that scientists had hoped for. Bounce landing . The probe's landing didn't go as planned this week, after Philae detached from the Rosetta orbiter. It took two bounces away from its designated landing spot, and never fired its anchoring harpoon. ""The lander remains unanchored to the surface at an as yet undetermined orientation,"" ESA said. It ended up in a shady spot of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, ESA said, likely without enough sunlight to keep functioning. Originally, it was supposed to have seven hours of light per comet day -- which lasts just 12.4 hours. Now it is exposed only 1.5 hours a day. That's likely not enough to juice up Philae's rechargeable secondary battery, ESA said. There is one last hope. ""Mission controllers sent commands to rotate the lander's main body, to which the solar panels are fixed,"" ESA says in on its blog. ""This may have exposed more panel area to sunlight."" Despite its walleyed positioning, Philae transmitted data and black-and-white photos back to Earth and ESA scientists. The pictures appear to indicate it landed in some sort of shadow, possibly the shadow of a cliff. Opinion: The big lesson from comet landing . Race to transmit data . Philae turned on its instruments, drilling for samples, and while there was still time, transferred data. Now, the lander has fallen silent. Its operators on Earth lost contact with it early Saturday. Built by a European consortium, led by the German Aerospace Research Institute, the landing probe has 10 instruments. ""The lander (was) racing against the clock to meet as many of the core science goals as possible before the primary battery (was) exhausted,"" ESA said. Its operators are satisfied with the results, and praised Philae for completing its mission slated for the comet's surface, before it went into hibernation. Opinion: How comet mission helps in search for alien life . The German space agency, which operates Philae for ESA, has taken a light-hearted approach to the battery's impending doom, putting out witty messages on a confirmed Twitter account in Philae's name. ""I'm feeling a bit tired, did you get all my data? I might take a nap,"" a post read. ""So much hard work.. getting tired... my battery voltage is approaching the limit soon now,"" another read. It's possible that the conditions may change as the comet moves closer to the sun, making it possible to charge the secondary battery. Then Philae could awaken from its deep slumber and send data and photo surprises back to Earth, ESA said. Even with the lander out of commission, the Rosetta orbiter that carried the Philae lander will continue to transmit observations of the comet. Elated scientists show off latest pics from historic comet mission . Ten year voyage . Rosetta took off from Earth 10 years ago, aboard an Ariane 5 rocket, and traveled 6.4 billion miles before rendezvousing with the comet in August. The Philae lander separated from the orbiting Rosetta about 3:30 a.m. ET Wednesday and first landed on the comet seven hours later. The lander weighs about 220 pounds and is the size of a domestic washing machine. The target comet is only 4 kilometers, or 2.5 miles, in diameter. The spaceship is named after the Rosetta Stone, an inscribed piece of volcanic rock found in Egypt in 1799 that allowed scientists to decipher hieroglyphics and thus understand the ancient Egyptian culture, ESA said. The lander is named after an island in the Nile River where an obelisk was found that helped decipher the Rosetta Stone, ESA said. Led by ESA with a consortium of partners including NASA, scientists on the Rosetta comet-chasing mission hoped to learn more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the solar wind: high energy particles blasted into space by the sun. Opinion: Philae's comet landing is amazing .

"""URGENT,"" read the Iraqi News headline of its September 3 posting. ""First Chinese ISIS fighter captured in Iraq says Ministry of Defense."" The Iraqi Army has captured an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria fighter from China, the Baghdad-datelined report said. Two pictures accompanied the report: one showed the captured militant in fatigue pants and a bloodied shirt, lying on the ground; another showed him escorted by an Iraqi soldier, his face seemingly swollen. If true, he would be the first Chinese national to have been caught fighting with ISIS militants. ""We are not able to verify whether or not the information is true,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang, responding to a foreign reporter's question. ""I cannot confirm the information for you."" It's not clear how many Chinese nationals may be fighting with the ISIS. Wu Sike, until recently China's special envoy to the Middle East, earlier stated that there could be about 100 of them, but Qin Gang said he had no specific numbers or estimates. Chinese netizens' reaction was typically visceral. ""Kill them!"" commented ""Hellen"" on the Iraqi News website. ""we chinese are glad to see these muslims' death!"" If such reports are true, said Chinese commentator Victor Gao, ""this will be an additional evidence that terrorism in China has a strong international connection. Terrorism does not care about national borders."" It remains unclear if the captured Chinese national is actually Uighur, a Muslim minority group in Xinjiang, but Gao seems to assume so. ""In China terrorism is raising its ugly head and is spreading from Xinjiang to other parts of China. The underlying drivers for terrorism are mainly the congruence of domestic and international forces at play among some extreme elements of the Uighur minority in Xinjiang,"" he added. Xinjiang, a resource-rich and strategically located region in northwest China, for years has been beset by ethnic violence, which the government blames on ""fenliefenzi"" (""separatists""). Uighur exiles and rights activists, however, blame the unrest on Beijing's allegedly repressive and discriminatory policies. A spate of violent incidents have been blamed on the Uighurs. In March, more than 10 masked people, dressed in identical black outfits and wielding machetes, stabbed passengers in Kunming Railway Station in Yunnan province, thousands of miles away from Beijing, killing 29 people and injured 143 others. Police killed four of the attackers and arrested one woman. In May, terrorists used car bombs to attack an open-air market in Urumqi, the region's capital, leaving 39 dead and 94 injured. The police later blamed the knife and bomb attacks on members of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), an Islamist group founded in 1993 by Uighur militants seeking an independent state in Xinjiang called East Turkistan. The ETIM has been accused by the China and the U.S. of having ties with al Qaeda, but security analysts disagree on whether such ties actually exist. Uighur exile groups claim that Beijing uses the ETIM as a red herring to rationalize its repressive policies against the Uighurs. If the Iraqi News report is true, said M. Taylor Fravel, an international relations professor at MIT, it shows that ""radicalization transcends boundaries and regions, threatening not only countries in the Middle East but also China and the West. That said, Uighurs have a long history of fighting overseas.  I believe that Uighurs fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, for example.  So the phenomenon is not a new one."" In 2006, the U.S. captured 22 Uighur militants fighting in Afghanistan with suspected links to al Qaeda. They were imprisoned in Guantanamo for five to seven years and later released after they were reclassified as no longer enemy combatants. Instead of repatriating them to China, however, they were sent to Palau and Bermuda. ""China will surely use this to underscore the challenges it faces in maintaining stability in Xinjiang, but I don't think that this will alter the policies being pursued, which seem to be increasing instability and not decreasing it,"" MIT's Fravel said. Beijing has stepped up its carrot-and-stick efforts to appease local dissatisfaction and curb violence. Speaking in a two-day conference on Xinjiang in May, President Xi Jinping promised to enhance ""ethnic unity"" in Xinjiang while creating more jobs, providing accessible education and improving people's livelihoods. Xi also pledged to respect the local residents' legitimate religious rights and local customs ""in accordance with laws and regulations."" But Xi also called for a massive ""nets spread from the earth to the sky"" to combat terrorists, stating that the stability of Xinjiang is ""strategically vital to the country's reform and development as well as national security."" In response to the spate of violent attacks, China has launched a one-year campaign against terrorism. Chinese police in various cities have held anti-terrorism drills using sophisticated equipment such as satellite vans, armored cars and modern weapons. Bulk purchasers of gasoline are now required to provide identification, secure permits from local police stations and use only approved containers. In some places, sales of large knives are controlled or banned. Local courts in Xinjiang have been given instructions to deal with terror cases in a ""harsh and quick"" manner. In June, China executed 13 people convicted of organizing and leading terrorist groups. China's critics fear the campaign could lead to more repressive policies toward Uighurs, widening ethnic divide. For years tensions have been simmering between the Han Chinese and the Uighur minority nationality. I saw tensions boil over in the streets of Urumqi in July 2009, when thousands of angry Uighur residents, some wielding knives and sticks, rioted in the streets and attacked Han Chinese, prompting the authorities to call in truckloads of Chinese soldiers. Nearly 200 people died in the ethnic clashes. Authorities blame separatists for fomenting violence, but critics of China's policies say the root of the problem is widespread alienation among the region's Muslim Uighur population who resent strict controls on religion and local culture. Uighurs also resent the influx into the region of Han Chinese migrants, who tend to dominate the local industry and commerce. They complain they are being left behind by rapid economic development, and are unable to partake of the benefits from the region's rich resources. All these, critics say, have made Xinjiang a breeding ground for malcontents.","Iraqi Army has captured Islamic State in Iraq and Syria fighter from China, report said .

"An accidental dance floor bump and a spilled drink agitated then-New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez before he allegedly shot and killed two men in Boston, an assistant district attorney said Wednesday during Hernandez's arraignment. The arraignment, in which Hernandez pleaded not guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and other charges, had prosecutors revealing the most details to date about a possible motive in the July 2012 killings of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. Hernandez, 24, has been jailed since his arrest last year in connection with the June 2013 slaying of Odin Lloyd in southern Massachusetts. Authorities began investigating him in the 2012 slayings after his arrest in the Lloyd case. He wasn't indicted in the double homicide until this month. Hernandez attorney Charles Rankin objected to the court letting Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney Patrick Haggan give ""a speech"" about the prosecution's case, arguing that the prosecutor was trying to poison the jury pool. Authorities say Hernandez and a friend -- driving from Connecticut to Boston -- arrived at Boston's Cure Lounge in the early morning of July 16, 2012. Hernandez didn't know the victims before that night, and had no interaction with them until a dancing de Abreu accidentally bumped into Hernandez -- spilling some of Hernandez's drink -- as the Patriots tight end stood at the edge of a dance floor, said Haggan. ""(Hernandez) became angered and increasingly agitated, particularly after Mr. de Abreu smiled and did not apologize,"" Haggan said. No argument was seen, and the eventual victims weren't ""even aware that the defendant had become angered or agitated,"" Haggan said. Hernandez told a friend at the lounge ""that Mr. de Abreu had deliberately bumped him and was, quote, 'trying him,' "" Haggan said. Investigators believe that Hernandez, in prior months, ""had become increasingly sensitive and angered by what he believed to be people testing, trying or otherwise disrespecting him when he frequented nightclubs in the area,"" according to Haggan. The friend, attempting to calm Hernandez, walked him outside, and they eventually entered a club across the street, the prosecutor said. At the second club, Hernandez pointed out a small group of men and told his friend he believed that the man who bumped into him at the Cure had followed him, Haggan said. ""Witness testimony and video surveillance reveal, however, that the defendant's belief was mistaken, as the victims never left Cure lounge until after 2 a.m.,"" Haggan said. Hernandez and his friend left the second club and returned to the SUV in which they'd arrived, Haggan said. They drove around, and at some point they pulled over on a nearby street, Haggan said. Hernandez retrieved a revolver from the engine block of the SUV, where he had hidden the gun shortly before he and his friend left Connecticut, Haggan said. The 2012 shootings . Authorities previously said that the victims and three of their friends left the Cure Lounge and drove away, unaware that Hernandez was driving behind them. When the victims' car stopped at a red light, Hernandez's SUV pulled up beside it. ""Aaron Hernandez then fired a .38-caliber revolver multiple times from the driver's side of his vehicle into the passenger's side of the victims' vehicle,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said earlier this month. De Abreu, the driver, was shot several times and fatally hit in the chest. Furtado, who was in the front passenger seat, was struck multiple times and gravely wounded with a shot to the head, the district attorney said. Two backseat passengers escaped injury and ran from the car. A third man remained in the car and suffered a wound to his arm, Conley said. Defense attorney: Prosecution trying to poison jury pool . In addition to the two counts of first-degree murder, Hernandez also pleaded not guilty to three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, the district attorney said. After the July 2012 incident, Hernandez continued to play football. During the next season, he had 51 receptions for 483 yards and five touchdowns. The Patriots finished the regular season with 12 wins and four losses and won the AFC East Division. They lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC championship game. Authorities say they began investigating Hernandez in the 2012 killings after they found the SUV -- at a Connecticut home of Hernandez's relatives -- while investigating him in the 2013 Odin Lloyd case. Hernandez, already held without bail in the Lloyd case, also was ordered held without a bail opportunity in the 2012 case. Rankin, the attorney for Hernandez, objected to Haggan's extended remarks. ""There is no reason at all to have a speech by the district attorney's office about what they say the facts are, and the court has just played along with that,"" Rankin said. ""This is not supposed to be a spectacle. This is not supposed to be a sporting contest."" ""I object to the court giving the district attorney's office an opportunity to present its one-sided view of the case after a one-sided grand jury proceeding,"" Rankin said. The judge noted that Rankin also had an opportunity to speak, and that to prevent the prosecution to speak about the case would violate ""custom and procedure that dates back quite a few years."" The next court date was set for June 24. The 2013 Odin Lloyd killing . Law enforcement has focused on Hernandez since he was arrested in June. He was charged with first-degree murder and weapons charges in connection with the shooting death of Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player, in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, about a mile from Hernandez's home. On June 17, a jogger found Lloyd's body riddled with gunshot wounds at an industrial park. Prosecutors have said that on that day, Lloyd was seen was seen around 2:30 a.m. with Hernandez and Hernandez's friends, Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace, in a rented silver Nissan Altima. On June 18 and 22, police searched Hernandez's home. Days later, the football player was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in Lloyd's death. Hernandez also was hit with five weapons-related charges. Hernandez pleaded not guilty. The NFL's Patriots then dropped the tight end from the team roster. Last month, Hernandez's associates, Ortiz and Wallace, were indicted on murder charges in connection with Lloyd's killing. Both have pleaded not guilty.

"The campaign of airstrikes against ISIS in Syria has pitted several Arab countries into action alongside the United States. Analysts say the involvement of leading Sunni Muslim nations in a fight against the Sunni extremism of ISIS is crucial. ""I think that's very important going forward as it does show that we've got some regional buy-in, it shows that there are Arab countries willing to put their reputations on the line,"" said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, an Air Force veteran intelligence officer and CNN military analyst. But there are also some U.S. allies and regional powers that are conspicuous by their absence from the new phase of the conflict with ISIS. Here's the lowdown on who's taking part and why -- and who's staying on the sidelines. Who's in . Saudi Arabia: The largest and most influential Gulf nation has fought with U.S. forces in previous conflicts, including Operation Desert Storm in the 1990s. ISIS' rapid gains in Syria and Iraq have raised alarm in the oil-rich kingdom. The Saudi government has already agreed to train moderate rebel fighters on its soil, according to U.S. officials. Jordan: The Arab kingdom has experienced a lot of spillover from the unrest in Syria and Iraq. It has received large numbers of refugees across its borders with both countries. Jordan's involvement in the airstrikes is part of its ""position on combating terrorism and protecting its security and borders,"" Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed Al Momani told CNN Arabic. The country also claims to have strong intelligence resources on ISIS. United Arab Emirates: The country was previously reported to have offered to support the U.S. attacks against ISIS. It is also hosting Australian combat jets on its soil. The UAE contributed aircraft to the international coalition that intervened in Libya in 2011. Bahrain: A key U.S. ally in the region, the island nation of Bahrain houses the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. As a regularly participant in U.S.-led coalitions, its involvement in the airstrikes isn't surprising. Qatar:  The Gulf nation had already flown a number of humanitarian flights to help anti-ISIS efforts in Iraq. But its involvement in the military strikes in Syria significantly raises its commitment. Qatar has strained relations with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over its willingness to provide refuge for members of the Muslim Brotherhood, which espouses a political Islam feared by several other governments in the region. Who's not . Turkey: A NATO member and one of the hardest-hit countries by shock waves from the Syrian civil war, Turkey's absence from the first wave of airstrikes will raise some eyebrows. The country is absorbing vast numbers of refugees from the conflict and is seen as a major transit point for foreign fighters joining ISIS and other armed groups. Until recently, the country had one strong reason to stay out of military action against ISIS: 49 of its citizens, including senior diplomats and their families, were being held hostage by the militants. Those captives were released over the weekend. How Turkey's role in the fight against ISIS evolves from here will be closely watched. Egypt: Another large, influential Middle Eastern nation that receives substantial U.S. military aid. Egypt is considered to have the air power to conduct strikes where it wants in the region. Cairo has denied recent assertions that it and the UAE had carried out secret airstrikes against Islamists in Libya. Iran: The Islamic Republic is a hugely influential player in both Syria and Iraq, where it supports the Shiite-led governments. ISIS' Sunni extremism is a fierce challenge to Iran's sway in the region, but Tehran's long-standing tensions with Washington make any link to the coalition extremely tricky. Earlier this month, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei rejected the idea of cooperation,  accusing the United States of planning to use military action against ISIS to ""dominate the region."" United Kingdom: A close ally to the U.S. in recent conflicts in the Middle East, the U.K. says it isn't involved in the airstrikes on ISIS in Syria. ISIS has already killed one British hostage this month and has threatened the life of another. Reports in the British media suggest Prime Minister David Cameron may seek parliamentary approval to participate in airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. Cameron has previously pledged to help arm Kurdish forces fighting ISIS and continue supplying humanitarian help. France: The French military began airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq last week, using Rafale fighter jets to attack a logistics warehouse. But Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Monday that France doesn't plan to expand the attacks into Syria. ""The French President has said we do not have intention to do the same in Syria, I mean by air,"" he said at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York. But Paris will help ""the moderate opposition in Syria,"" he said. Netherlands: The Dutch military will contribute six F-16 fighter jets and 250 troops to carry out airstrikes and train Iraqi and Kurdish forces in the fight against ISIS in Iraq, the Dutch Foreign Ministry said. The Dutch F-16s, which will be based outside of Iraq, will be used in Iraq for a period up to 12 months, the ministry said. Of the troops being deployed, 130 will be focused on training Iraqi forces, it said. Belgium: A long-standing ally of the United States and the UK, Belgium is seeking the approval of Parliament to send six fighter jets to participate in the bombing campaign against ISIS in Iraq, Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said. There is no plan to send ground troops. Maps: Arab nations join U.S., expand fight against terror to Syria .","Belgium and Netherlands will participate in strikes in Iraq, but not Syria .

CNN: How did your website move from being a portal for industry tech news to helping match investors with tech start-ups? Liu Chengcheng: We noticed that many investors would come to our platform and look for founders of start-up projects, and vice versa, when start-ups approached us for media exposure. So we wanted to develop a highly efficient platform for investors and projects to connect and collaborate. CNN: How do you guide investors to the projects that are most suited to them? LC: Personally, I recommend new investors to focus on projects with sustained demands, such as those providing tools for businesses or developers, rather than lifestyle-related ones, which can grow fast but might vanish fast too.

We have a better grip on the internet.  It is the first thing we think about, when it comes to problem solving.  Rather than seeking connections or favors offline.  We believe in the internet for solutions. CNN: What makes a strong business leader? LC: I always admire people who can make firm decisions despite different voices.

"To the families of the victims, Ethan Couch was a killer on the road, a drunken teenage driver who caused a crash that left four people dead. To the defense, the youth is himself a victim -- of ""affluenza,"" according to one psychologist -- the product of wealthy, privileged parents who never set limits for the boy. To a judge, who sentenced Couch to 10 years' probation but no jail time, he's a defendant in need of treatment. The decision disappointed prosecutors and stunned victims' family members, who say they feel that Couch got off too easy. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum of 20 years behind bars. ""Let's face it. ... There needs to be some justice here,"" Eric Boyles, who lost his wife and daughter, told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Wednesday night. ""For 25 weeks, I've been going through a healing process. And so when the verdict came out, I mean, my immediate reaction is -- I'm back to week 1. We have accomplished nothing here. My healing process is out the window,"" he said. Lawyers for Couch, 16, had argued that the teen's parents should share part of the blame for the crash because they never set limits for the boy and gave him everything he wanted. According to CNN affiliate WFAA, a psychologist called by the defense described Couch as a product of ""affluenza."" He reportedly testified that the teen's family felt wealth bought privilege, and that Couch's life could be turned around with one to two years of treatment and no contact with his parents. Couch was sentenced by a juvenile court judge Tuesday. If he violates the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years of incarceration, according to a statement from the Tarrant County Criminal District Attorney's Office. Judge Jean Boyd told the court she would not release Couch to his parents, but would work to find the teen a long-term treatment facility. ""There are absolutely no consequences for what occurred that day,"" said Boyles. ""The primary message has to absolutely be that money and privilege can't buy justice in this country."" His wife, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down. Brian Jennings, a youth pastor, was driving past and also stopped to help. All four were killed when the teen's pickup plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth. Couch's vehicle also struck a parked car, which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction. Two people riding in the bed of the teen's pickup were tossed in the crash and severely injured. One is no longer able to move or talk because of a brain injury, while the other suffered internal injuries and broken bones. ""There is nothing the judge could have done to lessen the suffering for any of those families,"" said defense attorney Scott Brown, CNN affiliate KTVT reported. ""(The judge) fashioned a sentence that is going to keep Ethan under the thumb of the justice system for the next 10 years,"" he said. ""And if Ethan doesn't do what he's supposed to do, if he has one misstep at all, then this judge, or an adult judge when he's transferred, can then incarcerate him."" Earlier on the night of the accident, June 15, Couch and some friends had stolen beer from a local Walmart. Three hours after the crash, tests showed he had a blood alcohol content of 0.24, three times the legal limit, according to the district attorney's office. ""We are disappointed by the punishment assessed but have no power under the law to change or overturn it,"" said Assistant District Attorney Richard Alpert. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and we regret that this outcome has added to the pain and suffering they have endured."" It is very rare, but not impossible, for prosecutors to challenge the sentence on the ground that it was too lenient, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said. ""To give him a pass this time given the egregious nature of his conduct -- four deaths -- is just incomprehensible,"" she said. It is unfair that other young defendants without the same wealth could end up in jail for a lot less, said Hostin, of CNN's ""New Day"" morning show. ""I think in terms of policy, this really flies in the face of our criminal justice system,"" she said. ""There have to be consequences to actions, and that is what our system is about, even for juveniles.""","Prosecutors had asked for a 20-year sentence for Ethan Couch .

"On a road jammed with traffic in Kabul is a hospital behind very high walls. There's a security checkpoint at the gate and once inside, the guards search all belongings -- checking every bag, opening every zipper and looking through the lens of our TV camera to make sure it's not a bomb. Inside the compound are single storey buildings clad in white paint. Cement pathways connect the low-rise structures that pave their way through a mini oasis. Trees and garden beds surround the complex. Brightly colored flowers sprout from the earth -- a stark contrast from the dry, dusty, arid landscape outside these four high walls. Vines grow up a patio awning where patients sit taking respite -- recovering from their injuries, all sustained through war. This is the Emergency Hospital -- an Italian-run facility funded by private donors. It treats only victims of the war in Afghanistan -- civilians and the Taliban alike. The hospital had its busiest month in August 2012 with casualties reaching the highest levels since this war began almost 12 years ago. Read more: NATO releases details of brazen attack on base . Recovering in one of the wards is 17-year-old Naweed Tanha. He was badly injured on September 8 when a teenage suicide bomber blew himself up outside ISAF Headquarters in Kabul. It was the 55th suicide bombing in Afghanistan this year. ""We were all selling bracelets in that place,"" explains Naweed, quietly sitting on a bench outside, happy to get out of the crammed hospital ward. His right hand is thickly bandaged after the explosion tore a chunk off his palm. His legs and back were also badly injured after being flung ten meters  by the force of the blast. ""I was with my friends -- we're all poor, innocent people. I was a few meters away getting some water from the nearby water hand pump and as I was returning the bang happened,"" Naweed says. ""By the time I opened my eyes I saw myself injured and saw bodies of my other friends laying on the ground. I started crying and running towards them when police stopped me. They put me in a car and brought me here to the hospital. "" Four were killed in the blast, including 14-year-old Khorshid Hawa and her 10-year-old sister Parwana. ""I am so upset for losing my friends,"" says Naweed, his eyes dark, his pupils bloodshot from crying. But he has no more tears to shed -- just hurt and anger oozes from his body. ""What kind of people would do this? Why are they continuing to do this? It is ruining our country and our future."" Most of the kids were members of Skateistan -- a charity that teaches street kids how to skateboard while providing them with an education. They'd sell their wares in the morning, hustling bracelets, chewing gum and water to foreigners entering the heavily fortified ISAF compound. They'd then go off to school in the afternoon in an attempt to break this cycle of poverty. Read more: Karzai's choice for Afghan intelligence chief suspected of torture, trafficking . James Herzog, an American music teacher at the Afghanistan National Institute of Music, used to hang out with Khorshid and her gang of skateboarding friends on the weekend. ""She was strong and witty and full of edgy comebacks,"" he says with a sad smile on his face. ""She could stand up to any of the other street kid bullies and was always protecting the younger girls on the street. I loved spending my weekend afternoons with her and despite seeing her position in this life, I always left feeling extremely positive about this world."" James lived just around the corner from the blast -- he arrived on the scene shortly after witnessing the carnage. The bodies of his young friends had been taken away but pools of blood covered the footpath next to one of Khorshid's chalk drawings on the pavement. ""She never ever asked me for money and rarely tried to sell me any trinkets. She usually wanted to practice English, and I often quizzed her little sister with multiplication questions. I loved the moments when I could convince Khorshid to sing a folk song for me as an unofficial audition for the music school. At the end of every 'hang,' we would share an apple or Pepsi while she would draw little designs on the street or walls."" Paying tribute to his young Afghani friend, Herzog says she's left a huge imprint on his life. ""Khorshid was one of those kids who sent life lessons back to the rest of the world through the foreigners who were lucky enough to know her. Her setting may have been a dusty street corner with occasional packs of aggressive dogs, nervous foreign soldiers, unforgiving barbed wire and concrete walls, but her beauty and positivity transcended all of it."" Back at the hospital, 15-year-old Mohammad Ilyas sits in a wheel chair -- both of legs are bandaged up. His mother has tied a piece of brightly colored material around his wrist as a good luck charm. ""We were close to the blast. I was very close to it -- almost two meters away. I didn't see the suicide bomber myself, but other people were saying that he was around 13 years old and he had a school bag too. After the explosion took place, I thought somebody had shot me in the leg but after I opened my eyes and saw my friends on the ground, I realized that it was an explosion. ""I saw their bodies. I saw the body flesh of the suicide bomber, which was spread every where -- only his legs were left lying on the ground."" Mohammad is about to undergo surgery on his legs. Doctors are telling him that he may never get full movement back, but the news doesn't seem to register. ""I am very upset about losing my friends. I only remember them and I only think about them -- I don't care about my wounds."" ""I was going to school for half a day and was spending half a day with them everyday. Whoever carried out the attack was a stupid person. They killed five of my friends who were the future of Afghanistan.""

"Congress is on pace to have its least productive year in modern history, earning a ""do-nothing"" label and adding another unwanted statistic to a body already facing chronically low approval ratings. Cue the blame game. ""To date, the House has passed nearly 150 bills this Congress that the United States Senate has failed to act on,"" Republican Speaker John Boehner argued Wednesday.  ""The Senate (and) the President continue to stand in the way of the people's priorities."" Democrats are tossing responsibility right back in the GOP's lap, arguing that hardline House conservatives are blocking legislative progress. Meanwhile, America's national legislature is growing increasingly dysfunctional. No deal, but sides said to be closer on budget deal . So far, 56 bills have been signed into law in the first session of the 113th Congress. Assuming legislators don't pick up the pace next year -- and the smart money says they won't as the midterms draw near -- this will become the least productive Congress in at least the last 40 years, according to a CNN analysis of congressional records. Is the fact that fewer bills have become law necessarily a bad thing?  That depends on your point of view. But representatives and senators on both sides of the aisle readily acknowledge that some major issues have not been addressed. GOP obstruction of Obamacare is closing hospitals . Congress hasn't passed a budget, among other things. None of the 12 annual spending bills has made it to the President's desk. We don't have a new farm bill. Immigration reform is stalled. Tax and entitlement reform are dead in the water. Adding insult to injury, in October the federal government had its first partial shutdown in nearly two decades. The  most important issue in Washington political circles, naturally, is who's responsible. Democrats point out that roughly one-third of the 148 bills passed by the GOP-controlled House so far this year were attempts to repeal, delay or defund Obamacare that had zero chance of passing the Senate or surviving a certain presidential veto. Washington could still screw up your holidays . More than a dozen of those measures were also partisan, piecemeal spending bills passed during the government shutdown that had no chance of being signed into law. Some of them had nothing to do with major issues at all, such as the bills renaming courthouses in Sherman, Texas, and Fergus Falls, Minnesota. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has called the House GOP a bunch of ""modern-day anarchists."" But Republicans argue that Democrats are standing in the way of priorities such as entitlement reform. Democrats are standing in the way of a major overhaul of the tax code, they insist. While both the House and the Senate passed farm bills, Democrats are blocking much-needed changes to the country's agriculture laws, Republicans say. As is usually the case in Washington, your opinion of which party is to blame is probably determined by which party you belong to. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans are growing more ideologically distant by the day. And that is a recipe for gridlock. Opinion: Here's something Congress could actually do .","Congress is on track to have its least productive year in recent history .
Boehner blames the Democratic Senate, White House, cites 148 House-passed bills .
Many targeted Obamacare, dealt with shutdown with no chance of passage .

"New York (CNN)The United Nations is looking into claims that ISIS -- already considered the wealthiest terrorist group on record -- may be harvesting organs from slain civilians and gaining financial benefits by trafficking the body parts, officials said Wednesday. But Britain's ambassador to the U.N., Mark Lyall Grant, said the issue has not been officially discussed. Grant said there was no proof or evidence of the claim made by Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations. The Iraqi ambassador, Mohamed Alhakim, on Tuesday urged the Security Council to investigate the deaths of 12 doctors in Mosul, Iraq. He said they were killed after refusing to remove organs from bodies. ""Some of the bodies we found are mutilated ... that means some parts are missing,"" he told reporters, adding that there were openings in the back of the bodies where the kidneys would be located. ""This is clearly something bigger than we think,"" Alhakim said. The plunder of bodies for usable organs and tissues is widespread, according to Nancy Scheper-Hughes, director of Organs Watch, a University of California, Berkeley-based documentation and research project. ""Organ theft during wars, civil wars, dirty wars, wars involving undisciplined armies is not uncommon,"" Scheper-Hughes, chair of Berkeley's doctoral program in medical anthropology, said in an email. The U.N.'s Iraqi mission on Wednesday said Alhakim was not granting interviews. ""At this point we're not in a position to corroborate what he says, but obviously any source of illegal financing of groups such as ISIS or other extremist groups is extremely worrisome,""  U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told CNN. Nickolay Mladenov, the U.N. special envoy handling Iraq, said the organ theft claim would be investigated. ""We have seen these reports as well,"" he said. ""However, I do not want to hasten to confirm anything before we study them in greater detail."" Mladenov said reports that the group ""is using a human trafficking as part of its sources of income"" have circulated for months. ""I cannot speak to the extent of that issue until we finalize our analysis of the problem but if one looks at the broader picture, it is very clear that the brutality and the tactics that (ISIS) is using expand by the day."" The U.S. State Department said it was aware of the ""deeply disturbing comments"" about the alleged organ trafficking but wasn't able to confirm them. ""We also have no reason to doubt them given other similar atrocities that have been documented and other heinous crimes for which ISIL has proudly taken credit,"" the State Department said, using another acronym for the militant group. Alhakim said there is a market in Europe for the stolen organs. The terror group has taken over airports where the body parts could be flown out in deals arranged between middlemen and buyers, he said. The mutilated bodies have been found in shallow graves over the last several weeks, he said. Speaking to the Security Council at a regular meeting on Iraq on Tuesday, Alhakim cited what he said were crimes of genocide by ISIS -- ""without even mentioning the traffic of human organs and the theft and trafficking of archaeological items and oil."" ""These terrorist groups have desecrated all human values,"" he said. ""They have committed the most heinous criminal terrorist acts against the Iraqi people -- whether Shia, Sunni, Christian, Turkmen."" Last month, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency and other outlets reported that ISIS had announced the opening of a medical school in its main stronghold in northern Syria. ""Dead bodies, once they are disarticulated, pulverized, processed, freeze-dried, etc., are so far removed from the 'human' person that they are simply commodities,"" Scheper-Hughes said. ""The demand for fresh organs and tissues ... is insatiable."" Scheper-Hughes said fresh kidneys from ""the brain dead or from those executed with the assistance of trained organ harvesters are the blood diamonds of illicit and criminal trafficking."" How ISIS is run . ISIS has been defined as the wealthiest terrorist group on record, using a combination of black-market oil sales, extortion and sophisticated social media to raise money to fund its expansion into Iraq and Syria, according to the U.S. Treasury. The terrorist group pulls in about $1 million a day, according to the Treasury. Extortion, such as demanding money from truck drivers and threatening to blow up businesses, is another revenue stream for the group, in addition to robbing banks and gold shops. The income helps finance a growing stream of suicide attacks and assassinations, officials said. It also aids the recruitment of Sunni tribal fighters and finances spectacular prison raids that liberate hundreds of fighters, as well as attacks on police patrols. ISIS controls vast areas of northern and western Iraq, as well as much of northeastern Syria -- and exercises draconian authority in areas as far apart as Anbar in western Iraq and Aleppo province in northern Syria. The group also continues to pick up endorsements and pledges of allegiance from other jihadist groups, most notably in Libya and Egypt. Everything to know about the rise of ISIS .

"Moscow (CNN)German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande met Friday with their Russian counterpart and began to draw up a new proposal to end the bitter conflict in eastern Ukraine. The peace talks with President Vladimir Putin ended early Saturday, the Kremlin told CNN. Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said a joint document based on a prior peace plan agreed to in Minsk, Belarus, in September, is not yet complete. The parties will engage in further talks by phone on Sunday, Peskov said. The new diplomatic push comes as a worsening conflict in eastern Ukraine is taking an increasingly heavy toll on civilians. Speaking in Berlin before her departure for Moscow, Merkel said she hoped to secure a ceasefire, but the prospects were not certain. She said she was ""sure that there is no military solution to the conflict"" and that she and Hollande would ""work against this escalation with all our powers to stop this horror"" as they meet with Putin. Merkel made clear that she would not do a deal with Russia that bypasses Ukraine's leadership, saying she ""will not decide anything over the heads of anyone."" The solution must be in line with the Minsk agreement, she said. Russia, Ukraine and separatist leaders signed that pact, but continued fighting left it in shreds. It's not yet clear how the new proposal differs from the Minsk agreement. Hollande said Thursday that the joint proposal for new negotiations would be ""based upon the territorial integrity of Ukraine."" The pair hope the proposal will be acceptable to all parties in the conflict, he said. But he said that ""the option of negotiation, of diplomacy, cannot be extended indefinitely."" Western leaders and Kiev accuse Russia of fostering the conflict by providing weapons and training to the pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as sending regular Russian troops over the border to fight. Moscow denies the allegations. Amid the diplomatic maneuverings, there were reports from Ukraine suggesting that more civilians could be evacuated from current conflict zones. Both sides in the conflict have been blamed for shelling civilian areas. The self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic said on its website that it had offered Kiev the chance for civilians to leave Debaltseve, northeast of the city of Donetsk, where shells have been falling for days. Debaltseve is under government control, and police efforts to evacuate civilians have been underway for days, hindered by the shelling of the main road out of the city. According to the Ukrainian counterterrorist operation media office, the shelling in the area has decreased since Thursday. But it's unclear how many civilians still remain in Debaltseve. The latest government statement said that arrangements for the evacuation of people from dangerous areas in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions were ""ongoing."" The media office of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic said the evacuation of civilians had started in the town of Chernukhino, in Luhansk, and would continue until the afternoon. Civilians increasingly are falling victim to the violence, with at least 224 killed and more than 540 injured in the final three weeks of January, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said this week. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking on a visit to Kiev on Thursday, insisted that the ball was in Moscow's court to resolve the crisis in its neighboring country. He called on Moscow to take three steps he said would enable a diplomatic solution ""that is staring everyone in the face."" Those include pulling back heavy weapons beyond the range of civilian populations, removing foreign troops and heavy equipment from Ukraine, and closing the Russia-Ukraine border. Kerry said no one wanted conflict with Russia, but ""we cannot close our eyes"" to tanks, heavy weapons and soldiers crossing the border from Russia into Ukraine. Russian leaders must be blind if they keep denying that forces from their country have crossed the border, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk added. ""If they need, I can give them my glasses,"" Yatsenyuk said. ""It is crystal clear that (the) Russian military is on the ground. We are not fighting so-called rebels or guerrillas. We are fighting with the Russian regular army."" Peskov, the Putin spokesman, told CNN that Kerry's remarks in Ukraine ""just shows the unwillingness and inability of the United States to participate in settlement of the Ukrainian crisis."" He said, ""As for Russian tanks, allegedly crossing Russian-Ukrainian border, we've commented on this before -- there are no Russian tanks or army in Ukraine, such accusations are not true."" The annual Munich Security Conference was to start Friday in Germany, when the crisis in Ukraine is likely again to top the agenda. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he would hold bilateral meetings in Munich this weekend with Kerry, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden,  Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Biden was holding meetings with European leaders Friday in Brussels, Belgium. The European Union and United States have already imposed a series of financial sanctions targeting Russian interests and separatist leaders in Ukraine. U.S. officials this week said the United States is considering sending so-called defensive lethal aid to the Ukrainian government, which could include anti-tank, anti-air and anti-mortar systems. NATO defense ministers decided Thursday to establish new NATO command and control units in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria and Poland, close to Russia's western borders. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from Moscow and Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote from London. Nick Paton Walsh, Radina Gigova, Laura Akhoun, Alla Eshchenko, Anna Maja Rappard, Steve Almasy and Erin McLaughlin contributed to this report, as did journalist Victoria Butenko in Kiev.","Talks among German, French, Russian leaders on Ukraine will continue via phone on Sunday .

"Hundreds gathered in Kiev's Independence Square on Sunday to honor the victims of violence that has ravaged Ukraine for months, including 49 people killed when a military plane was shot down. Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko had declared Sunday a day of mourning. The crowd in Kiev observed a moment of silence at noon local time (5 a.m. ET). ""We bow our heads to the heroes who lost their lives for the sake of their country, to prevent the war from coming into the house of each of us,"" Prime-Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said. ""They lost their lives because they defended men and women, children and the elderly who found themselves in a situation facing a threat to be killed by invaders and sponsored by subhumans,"" he said. ""First, we will commemorate the heroes by wiping out those who killed them and then by cleaning our land from the evil."" The Ilyushin-76 military transport plane went down early Saturday while approaching an airport in the eastern Ukrainian city of Luhansk, said military spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov.  Ukrinform said the plane was carrying paratroopers, equipment and food. ""All those involved in the cynical act of large-scale terrorism must necessarily be punished,""  Poroshenko told Ukrinform, the state news agency. ""Ukraine needs peace. Terrorists, however, will receive an adequate response."" Ukraine's defense ministry said the plane, which was transporting military personnel, was shot down by insurgents using anti-aircraft machine guns. Ukrinform also said three soldiers were killed Saturday morning near Mariupol. The attack on the plane, which represents one of the bloodiest single events in that nation's current period of turmoil, spurred a diplomatic flurry to limit further escalation of the crisis. Telephone diplomacy . French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel held a telephone discussion Saturday with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the crisis in Ukraine. Hollande and Merkel expressed their deep concern about the ongoing fighting in eastern Ukraine, particularly Saturday's attack, the Elysee Palace said. The French and German leaders stressed the importance of reaching a cease-fire in Ukraine and avoiding the transfer of fighters and weapons across the Ukrainian-Russian border, according to Hollande's office. The Kremlin said the three leaders also talked about the drafting of a United Nations Security Council resolution aimed at promoting a settlement. The European leaders stressed the need for an agreement on continuing Russian natural gas deliveries to Ukraine, according to the Elysee. In a phone conversation with Hollande, Poroshenko urged the European Union to immediately consider sanctions against Russia, including the termination of ""military-technical cooperation,"" Poroshenko's office said. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk spoke by phone with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who expressed condolences for the loss of life and ""strong concern"" about the flow of heavy weapons and militants across the border from Russia, a senior State Department official said. Kerry also talked with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, voicing his concern over the downing of the Ukrainian transport plane and pressing Lavrov to ""make clear"" Russia's commitment to peace, a cease-fire and political dialogue, the state department official said. Video shows plane shot down . In a statement, Poroshenko said the army and state border service had closed 248 kilometers of Ukraine's border. ""The goal is for us to take back control of Ukraine over the state border and provide adequate response to terrorists,"" he said. Video posted to YouTube claimed to show the plane being shot down. Small flashes can be seen climbing skyward, followed by large flashes on the ground on the distant horizon. The plane was also carrying military machinery and supplies, the ministry said.  Officials originally had said the incident occurred late Friday but later updated the time. In an indication of the continued opposition from some quarters to the Kiev government, the state security office said in a statement Saturday that a homemade bomb was found overnight outside a gate to Poroshenko's office. The device was made of grenades and a kilogram of other material, such as metal screws, and had a threatening note attached that demanded that the President stop military action against the separatists, the statement said. The person who left it was spotted but fled without detonating it. The Kiev-based government is carrying out what it calls an anti-terrorist operation, centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, to try to regain control from pro-Russia separatists. Russia and Ukraine have been engaged in a tense standoff since March, when Russia annexed Crimea and massed troops along its border with Ukraine. Moscow has since begun to withdraw those forces.","Hundreds observe moment of silence in Kiev's Independence Square .

"In a wild twist in the story of a kidnapped teenager saved when her alleged abductor was killed over the weekend, a report shows a disturbing similarity between the suspect and his father. James L. DiMaggio's father had a violent past, and he once held a teenage girl at gunpoint after professing feelings for her, CNN affiliate KFMB reports. A report from the San Diego Union-Tribune at the time contains similar allegations. James L. DiMaggio was shot dead Saturday, 18 years to the day after his father committed suicide, the station reports. DiMaggio's killing by an FBI agent in the Idaho wilderness ended the captivity of 16-year-old Hannah Anderson. DiMaggio is also accused of killing Hannah's mother and brother in California before fleeing with her. A friend says DiMaggio, 40, told Hannah a few months ago that he had a crush on her. DiMaggio and Anderson 'just didn't fit,' Idaho trail riders say . KFMB reports that DiMaggio's father, James E. DiMaggio, did something similar in 1988. He told a 16-year-old girl that he was ""in love"" with her, according to the girl, now a woman who is keeping her name confidential. After having dated her mother, ""He had told me that he only stuck around because he was in love with me, he wanted to take me away to a better life,"" she said. After she refused, he broke into her house, holding handcuffs and a shotgun, and threatened to kill the girl, her boyfriend and her brother, the station reported. ""I asked him not to kill us, and he said, 'Don't worry, you won't feel a thing.' "" She managed to escape after saying she needed to use the bathroom, and DiMaggio ran off. CNN reached out to the woman through KFMB but has not heard from her. Public records show that James E. DiMaggio was the defendant in a criminal case filed in 1989.  No specifics were immediately available. DiMaggio's fascination with Hannah Anderson . The case is mentioned in a San Diego Union-Tribune article from December 1989. Police wanted to question DiMaggio in a case involving a burglary and a beating at a motel, the article said. He had previously been arrested in July of that year ""after breaking into an ex-girlfriend's home in El Cajon, wearing a stocking mask and carrying a sawed-off shotgun,"" the article said. ""His ex-girlfriend was not at home, but DiMaggio held the woman's teenage daughter and her boyfriend at gunpoint,"" the article said, citing prosecutors. ""The boyfriend was handcuffed to a bedpost, but the girl escaped after asking to use the bathroom. ... Neither victim was harmed."" Andrew Spanswick, a friend of the younger DiMaggio, told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live"" that DiMaggio's mother died of cancer and, several years later, in 1998, his father committed suicide. But public records show the date of death as August 10, 1995. DiMaggio's father had already ""disappeared"" by that point, Spanswick said. It was on the anniversary of that disappearance, earlier this month, that the younger DiMaggio's house was set on fire, burning the bodies of his former friend and her son -- Hannah's mother and brother, Spanswick said.

"(CNN)It's like UNO, except there are goats, magical enchiladas and kittens that can kill you. And that's apparently enough for people to pledge a gajillion dollars. Matthew Inman, the cartoonist and grammar enthusiast behind the popular comic website The Oatmeal, launched a fund-raising campaign on Kickstarter Tuesday for a new card game that got more than $700,000 in pledges in just the first few hours. By Wednesday, Exploding Kittens raised over $2 million. The game is a cross between Inman's signature absurdist comic drawings and the popular card game UNO. It was dreamed up by Inman and game creators Elan Lee and Shane Small, according to the Exploding Kittens Kickstarter page. The initial goal was $10,000. Although there are a lot of reasons why the Internet loves kittens, one hint to Exploding Kittens' fiery success is the Oatmeal's cult following. Its Facebook page alone has more than 3 million followers. The game rules are explained in a short animated video on the Kickstarter page. Each player draws a card from the deck until someone draws an exploding kitten card. Once an exploding kitten card is drawn the player is booted from the game. The more cards that are drawn from the deck, the higher a player's chances of pulling an exploding kitten card. The game also adds a bit of humorous complexity, featuring cards that enable players powers such as weaponizing back hair and laser pointers to defuse a kitten's explosiveness. Exploding Kittens might seem too magically absurd to be true, but with the success of other Kickstarter campaigns such as party game favorite Cards Against Humanity, this project might be another crowd-funded home run. CNN reached out to Inman and his creative team for a comment, but no one was available to talk. ""Sorry all inboxes are so flooded right now,"" Lee wrote. The game creators did note on their fund-raising page that they are staunchly against the harming of actual kittens. On The Oatmeal's Facebook page, Inman wrote that the Kickstarter goal was reached in eight minutes. ""I love you, my precious Oatlets. Who wants a sandwich?""","A card game featuring exploding kittens goes viral on Kickstarter .

"(CNN)Seventy-five years after its premiere at Atlanta's Loews Grand Theater on December 15, 1939, ""Gone With the Wind"" retains its hold on the popular imagination. Tourists to Atlanta long to see Tara. (Sorry, it doesn't exist, though there is a Road to Tara Museum south of town, not to mention the Margaret Mitchell House, which showcases the apartment where Mitchell wrote the book.) Its lines -- ""Fiddle-dee-dee,"" ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn,"" ""Tomorrow is another day"" -- are still widely repeated and parodied. And, in its monumental Hollywood-ness, it's often held up as the pinnacle of one of the finest years in film history, 1939. But the film is also incredibly divisive, partly because of the era it represents -- the South in the Civil War -- and partly because of its sheer, over-the-top bulk. Its racism is particularly unnerving in 2014, a year in which American society has grappled with racial unrest over police treatment of African-Americans and other issues. Frankly, we still give a damn . Here are some reasons to love and hate ""GWTW"": . Love: It's incredibly faithful to the book . This is not a small point. The 1936 book -- all 1,037 pages of it -- was a phenomenon of Harry Potter proportions and audiences damn well wanted to see every last detail on screen. ""It is the picture for which Mr. Gallup's American Institute of Public Opinion has reported a palpitantly waiting audience of 56,500,000 persons, a few of whom may find encouragement in our opinion that they won't be disappointed in Vivien Leigh's Scarlett, Clark Gable's Rhett Butler or, for that matter, in Mr. Selznick's Miss Mitchell,"" wrote The New York Times in a contemporary review. CNNMoney: How 'Gone With the Wind' became America's biggest blockbuster . Hate: It's incredibly faithful to the book . The book may have been a huge best-seller, but it was not universally loved. Other writers disparaged it; in a 1937 meeting of the American Writers Congress, the rank and file voted overwhelmingly for John Dos Passos' ""The Big Money"" as the best book of 1936. ""GWTW"" got one vote. Why? It is sprawling and messy, traffics in clichés and is ""unforgivingly racist,"" Time noted in 2011. Hate: It's, well, racist . The black characters in ""GWTW"" are walking stereotypes of slaves and maids. Black dramatist Carlton Moss compared it with ""The Birth of a Nation,"" noting that ""GWTW"" was just a quieter vilification of African-Americans: a ""rear attack"" compared with ""Birth's"" direct approach.  A ""weapon of terror against black America,"" added the Chicago Defender. There were demonstrations against the film in some cities, and Hattie McDaniel, who won an Oscar for her performance, couldn't even attend the Atlanta premiere with other celebrities because of segregation laws. The film's portrayal of African-Americans still troubles -- partly, says Esquire's Stephen Marche, because they're still evident today. ""There are good blacks and insolent blacks. There are house blacks and there are field blacks. Whenever African-American characters are articulate, it is always meant as a comic surprise,"" he writes. ""These are still the prejudices that bedevil representations of African-Americans on screen."" Love: It showcases a modern woman . Scarlett O'Hara may live in the 1860s, but as many critics have observed, in her determination and independent spirit, she's still relatable today -- and she was exceptional in 1939. After all, this was a passionate woman who married three times, had her own business and -- despite being left alone at the end of the film -- refuses to wallow in her abandonment. ""Tomorrow is another day,"" indeed. Watch rare footage from the premiere . Love: It's the peak of Hollywood filmmaking . With its gorgeous photography, scene-grabbing acting, swelling Max Steiner score and overall operatic pitch, few films are as Technicolor brilliant as ""GWTW,"" and perhaps nothing has matched it since. One scene that continues to be talked about decades later is the famous burning of Atlanta. Not only was it one of the most expensive scenes ever shot -- $25,000, an enormous sum at the time -- but it also destroyed the sets for some previous movies, notably ""King Kong,"" and prompted some area residents to call the fire department. But what emerges is a sense of the grand, tragic scale of the war. You can thank inventive production designer William Cameron Menzies for much of its success; he had the idea to burn old sets for the Atlanta fire scene, he used color filters to highlight mood and he storyboarded the entire film in advance. Moreover, there's the passionate but turbulent love story between Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) that drives the movie forward. ""As few American films have, 'Gone With the Wind' succeeds both as historical epic and as intimate drama,"" wrote the Los Angeles Times' Kevin Thomas in 1989. Hate: It wasn't even the best film of 1939 . The year of ""Gone With the Wind"" is often touted as the greatest year in Hollywood history, when no fewer than 10 films were nominated for best picture, including ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" ""Stagecoach,"" ""Wuthering Heights"" and ""Dark Victory."" Of those, ""GWTW"" took home the Oscar, but many critics would put the influential ""Stagecoach,"" Jean Renoir's ""The Rules of the Game"" or even ""The Wizard of Oz"" ahead of it. Moreover, though ""GWTW"" has topped polls of Americans' popular films in the past, including a 1977 American Film Institute survey, its popularity may be slipping. The epic is currently ranked No. 157 on the Internet Movie Database's top 250 list, surpassed by ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" ""The Godfather"" and ""Schindler's List"" -- and even ""Fight Club,"" ""Forrest Gump"" and, uh, ""Snatch."" (Yes, the Guy Ritchie film.) ""No one I know of has yet solved the secret of this 1939 film's apparently timeless appeal, though I'd guess it has something to do with the elaborate mechanisms of fate, history and sex brought to bear on Scarlett, whose overweening libido must be punished as magnificently as it has been celebrated,"" wrote film critic Dave Kehr. Love: Length . ""Gone With the Wind"" lasts 222 minutes -- that's three hours and 42 minutes -- and many fans wish it were longer. When it had its premiere on commercial TV in 1976, NBC ran it over two nights -- and received blockbuster ratings for both broadcasts, with almost two-thirds of the viewing public watching. Hate: Length . 222 minutes? And that doesn't include the intermission. Hate: Its effect on history . Thanks to its enormous popularity, ""GWTW"" has been hard to escape -- especially in Atlanta, where Mitchell lived and died. And yet its glorification of the antebellum South is troubling to many critics, who believe it has hampered views of race. ""We like to think 1939 was a different world, a world divided from our own by a supposedly vast span of progressive enlightenment. Unfortunately, while 75 years in American life is enough to constitute several distinct epochs, it's not long enough to kill off the country's enduring prejudices,"" wrote Esquire's Marche. ""The movie is, in many ways, a repository of the originals that have shaped American culture's tortured descriptions of race since."" Love: It's still a powerful movie . If you depend on movies for a clean, uncluttered and accurate view of history, you'll be disappointed every time. Leave the history to the historians; movies are storytelling, and few stories are as well told as ""Gone With the Wind."" As Roger Ebert noted in 1998, ""It is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well.""","""Gone With the Wind"" opened 75 years ago Monday .
The movie is criticized for racism, celebrated for its filmmaking bravado .
""GWTW"" remains representative of golden era of Hollywood filmmaking ."
"Chen Guangbiao wants rich people in China to give more to charity and he'll do anything to get their attention. That includes stacking piles of cash to form a wall for a photo op or dancing on the rooftops of brand new cars that he bought for a donation. Chen's latest stunt involved buying lunch for underprivileged people in New York City and giving each person a cash gift. The free lunch took place on June 25 at Loeb Boathouse in Central Park. ""I have visited the U.S. every month since last November, I see many homeless people, poor people on the streets, searching for food in the garbage bins,"" Chen said when asked why he was going all the way to the U.S. to carry out his philanthropy. Calling from his Shanghai office earlier this week, Chen spoke in an even, calm tone, without a hint of the goofball persona that he displays during his media events. Chen publicized the mass lunch with full-page ads in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, asking interested homeless people to sign up for the meal by email. When we spoke to the millionaire, he said more than 5,000 people had signed up for the June 25 lunch. He was working with several U.S. charities to decide on the final guest list. One of them, the New York City Rescue Mission, told CNN last week that the $300 cash gift is a prize for completing one of their training or substance abuse programs. Publicity with a purpose . Mission spokeswoman Michelle Tolson dismissed the idea that the event is a publicity stunt for Chen, saying they had vetted him. ""It's not something we wanted to get into lightly,"" she said, citing her organization's 142-year history. But for Chen, publicity is crucial. Handing out cash and buying lunches is not the long-term goal. The eccentric millionaire says he hopes to influence the rest of the world's rich and powerful to give more through his flashy charity antics, even though it makes him a target for ridicule. ""My wealth is very limited. I need to influence other people to give,"" says Chen, adding that those full-page ads in U.S. newspapers were written in both English and Chinese so that other well-heeled Chinese would get the message. The tycoon founded Jiangsu Huangpu Recycling Resources, an unlisted company that recycles construction material and domestic waste, but says that he ""could not even make it onto China's top 10,000 rich list."" Hurun has him at number 372 on their 2013 rich list, while Forbes reports Chen's fortune is worth the equivalent of $720 million (RMB4.5 billion ). 'Talk is cheap' Chen likes to tell the story of how his mother's selflessness inspired him. Growing up in a poor rural household, two of Chen's siblings starved to death. Despite their poverty, his mother found ways to give to others. ""She would carry my little brother at her side, he would be crying, but she would share her milk with other people's babies,"" says Chen. The self-made man said he did many odd jobs as a school kid, hauling trash, selling water and snacks, whatever he could to bring in extra cash. A graduate in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Chen says he invented an electronic device that detects illnesses in the body using TCM theories. The contraption made him his first fortune in the 1990s before he turned to the recycling industry. He made his mark nationally as a philanthropist when he appeared on the scene of the Sichuan earthquake in 2008. Changing his suit and tie for army fatigues, the bespectacled businessman pulled bodies out from the rubble and donated more than RMB 100 million (US$16 million). ""I like to get my hands dirty. Talk is cheap,"" he says. Chen has since traveled to the epicenter of other major natural disasters in China to do relief work -- and provide the media with great photo ops. In the spotlight . Despite his record, a lot of people can't take Chen seriously as a philanthropist. His critics include Jeremy Goldkorn, director of Chinese media research firm Danwei, who calls the millionaire ""a clown whose so-called philanthropy appears to consist entirely of self-promotional stunts."" Netizens ridicule Chen for his love of the media spotlight; some accuse him of being a fraud and say that his TCM diagnostic machine invented in the 1990s is a scam. Chen doesn't do himself any favors when he includes on his English namecard an absurdly long string of self-aggrandizing titles, including ""Most Charismatic Philanthropist of China,"" or when he widely publicizes his interest in buying the New York Times, only to have the Times deny any such possibility. The millionaire also seems to actively court political controversy. In 2011, he traveled to Taiwan -- considered a rogue state by Beijing -- to hand out more than $200,000 in cash to the disadvantaged, only to have local politicians hesitate to receive him, suspecting the trip may be a soft political move orchestrated by Chinese government. Chinese American media such as the Epoch Times and New Tang Dynasty TV have investigated Chen's ties to the Communist Party, suspecting him of unknowingly becoming a political pawn for certain factions of the party. Chinese-language media have also accused Chen of not fulfilling his million-dollar pledges -- allegations Chen has denied. Chen is a staunch patriot -- he is known for punctuating press conferences with solo renditions of patriotic songs, some using self-penned lyrics. He also took out an ad in the New York Times in 2012 proclaiming the disputed Diaoyu Islands are Chinese territory, not Japanese. But the recycling tycoon denies any connection with Chinese authorities and insists his record is clean. ""Starting my business has been very hard work. I have received no help from any officials at all. I still find it very difficult to get my business deals because I refuse to take or give bribes, I refuse to become corrupt,"" he says. Perhaps Chen's most controversial philanthropic venture was his pledge in early 2014 to fund plastic surgery for a mother and her daughter who reportedly survived self-immolation. The pair were allegedly part of a group of Falun Gong practitioners who are believed to have set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square in 2001. They survived the incident but were badly disfigured. Chen's move to bankroll their surgery was met with outrage from Falun Gong supporters who say that the incident was staged by the Chinese government and that the organization would never preach self harm or suicide. When he dies, Chen plans to donate his entire fortune not to his family, but to charity -- a pledge he says he was inspired to make after meeting Bill Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010. Although his critics accuse Chen of never giving money to his relatives anyway. ""My younger brother runs a guesthouse and my sister is a janitor. I have not given them money because they earn their own money. I pay for their children's school fees,"" says Chen. Despite the criticism, Chen has not been discouraged. ""I regret nothing,"" he says. ""I am not afraid of what people say about me. I have not done anything that harms anyone. I think society needs diverse innovation. I will keep on giving positive energy through my creative solutions for problems.""","""I regret nothing. I am not afraid of what people say about me,"" says controversial philanthropist Chen Guangbiao .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Dozens of people were injured in Bangladesh as riot police clashed with thousands of Islamists protesting women's rights, authorities and witnesses said. The protesters damaged buses and cars Monday, setting several on fire, while police used clubs and tear gas to disperse the Islamists, who were wearing skullcaps and burial cloths. ""We'll die for the cause of Islam, but (will) not allow the government to disrespect (the) Quran,"" one protester shouted during the demonstration near the national mosque in downtown Dhaka. The government recently announced its National Women Development Policy 2011, which ensures women expanded rights in property and education. The protesters said the policy is against the Quran. Fazlul Huq Amini, leader of a coalition of Islamic groups called the Islami Oikya Jote, asked his followers to take to the streets to protest the policy. Amini said the Quran defines how much property a woman should inherit, and the government should not allow women more than that. ""It's against the principle of the Quran, and we'll resist it at any cost,"" Amini said. Thousands of students in madrassas, or Islamic schools, carried sticks and logs as they marched the streets. Protests also took place in the southern port city of Chittagong and several other areas. Business activities ceased, and schools remained closed because of fears of violence. ""We had sufficient security measures to avert any violent incidents,"" said Benazir Ahmed, Dhaka's police chief. The government said it had done nothing against the Quran. ""Amini is misleading the people,"" said government spokesman Mohammad Shahjahan Miah. Earlier on Monday, a madrassa student was shot to death in western Jessore district when police opened fire on the protesters. Amini, a former lawmaker, said the protests will continue until the policy is scrapped. The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party lent support to the protests.","Dozens of people are injured as riot police clash with protesters .

"New Delhi, India (CNN)There's no shortage of politicians in India. But the capital of the world's largest democracy appears set to hand over the reins of power to an activist. New Delhi votes this weekend to elect a new state administration. In the race for the city state's top job are two anti-corruption protesters — Kiran Bedi and Arvind Kejriwal. Both were comrades-in-arms some four years ago when a massive anti-graft movement swept the country. They also share a common background as civil servants. Now, the two stand as rivals to rule the state of New Delhi, the center of India's politics. Prime minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has handpicked Bedi, a former policewoman, as its candidate for the city's chief minister. In this, it sidestepped old, political loyalists. The move, analysts say, was calculated. In New Delhi, the BJP is faced with stiff competition not from career politicians but from Kejriwal's two-year-old Aam Aadmi (Common Man's) Party or AAP. The upstart group of activists stunned the country's politics when it surged to a close second place in city elections in 2013. Kejriwal, a former tax official, became the capital's chief minister after he struck a coalition deal with the Congress party that his AAP had pushed to the third spot in the legislature. With that, the BJP lost the opportunity to govern New Delhi despite winning the largest number of seats. ""This time, it has taken the pulse of voters. It has fielded Bedi, an activist without a political record, as its face in the capital. This completes the setting by pitting an activist against an activist. One of them is going to make it,"" said K.G. Suresh, a New Delhi-based political commentator. Kejriwal's stint as New Delhi's chief minister lasted 49 days, when he resigned after New Delhi lawmakers from other parties rejected an anti-corruption bill his government proposed last year. His short term was marked by his trademark activist-type sit-ins and run-ins with electricity and water utilities over tariffs. Critics labeled him a quitter for resigning prematurely. And his party flopped in last year's national elections. Still, Kejriwal remains a darling of a large section of New Delhi voters divided along layers of economic classes facing day-to-day problems in the congested city, observers say. Known for his populism, the 46-year-old maverick is seen to be successfully tapping into his constituency of lower-income groups. His AAP has promised 500 new schools, 20 new colleges, greater investment in public transport and tens of thousands of new public toilets in the city of more than 17 million people. ""His support base among the middle-class and the elite may have eroded for quitting office abruptly last time, but he appears to have the backing of economically-weaker communities because of his promises,"" says Suresh. Kejriwal and Bedi were two of the main strategists of the 2011 anti-corruption agitation that rattled the then federal government of India's oldest Congress party. During those demonstrations, Bedi rose to prominence after her scathing attacks on politicians and flag-waving made her a central figure. Then, hundreds of thousands of Indians hit the streets to protest endemic graft and called for cleansing the nation's political system. A winner of Asia's premier Magsaysay award, Bedi has a history of courting public attention, which has made her a household name in India. As a young traffic officer, she was nicknamed ""Crane Bedi"" for her clampdown on wrongly-parked cars. She also received international acclaim for reforming Tihar jail, India's largest prison complex, after taking over as its inspector-general in 1993. As the candidate for BJP, Bedi faces a close contest against Kejriwal. But the Congress party appears out of the picture and headed for its worst-ever defeat in New Delhi, according to opinion polls released this week. As front-runners for chief minister, both Kejriwal and Bedi have vowed to make the city safer. The fatal attack and rape of a student in a moving bus in 2012 brought international spotlight on New Delhi and its public safety. In its election manifesto, AAP has promised a million CCTV cameras across New Delhi and free wifi. The upcoming election in India's capital megacity is also billed as a popularity test for prime minister Modi. His grand rise to national power last May is often called the Modi wave. The prime minister has received praise for his reform-minded initiatives and impressive oratory. At the same time, his BJP and affiliate Hindu groups have come under fire for sporadic Hindu-Muslim clashes over the past few months in parts of the country. Also, Modi's party is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian parliament. That limits his efforts to push his economic agenda. Winning states in the coming years is therefore crucial for Modi's government as regional lawmakers play a key role in electing the upper parliament members.","Two activists vie for New Delhi's top job .

"(CNN)On Wednesday night, Jimmy Fallon opened ""The Tonight Show"" with a big reveal: a first look at the cover of this year's Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, featuring model Hannah Davis, and quite a lot of her at that. The ultra-revealing cover shows Davis pulling down her already-minuscule bikini bottoms to within a millimeter of an area typically reserved for intimate partners and gynecologists. She's been waxed, it is evident, to bald perfection. One wrong breath, and she'd expose actual labia (how's that for newsstand-appropriate?) Of course, Sports Illustrated's annual swimsuit spectacular has never been without controversy. It's almost intended for controversy. Last year's cover featured three topless models, although they faced away from the camera. Supermodel Kate Upton's 2012 cover featured her in similarly barely there bikini bottoms. Putting aside the fact that a woman is more likely to end up on the cover of Sports Illustrated for her ability to look amazing in a bikini than for her accomplishments as an athlete -- and indeed few press mentions of Davis' cover have noted that she is a former tennis champion, while few have omitted the fact that she is Derek Jeter's girlfriend -- it's possible to consider the notion that the issue's purpose is to celebrate the female form, with a side of swimwear. I'm not opposed to celebrating beauty, especially when a woman works hard to achieve and maintain it. The idea of ""if you have it, use it"" is OK by me, even if the beauty the swimsuit issue tends to show off is a very specific sort of beauty. (Indeed, perhaps the biggest disappointment is that Davis' headline-generating cover overshadows what truly is a positive step for female empowerment: the issue's first-ever inclusion of a plus-size model, Robyn Lawley, and in a bikini of her own design, no less. But you're hearing far less about that.) This year, though, Sports Illustrated has gone too far. In the photo, Davis eager pulls down her bikini bottom and thrusts forward her pelvis in a way that's clearly meant to draw the eye to that very spot between her legs -- far more so than her eyes, or even her breasts. It's an invitation to picture her naked, and more. And in case there was any ambiguity of what the image is supposed to evoke, there's the clever cover line that begins: ""Hannah Davis Goes Down South. ... "" It is explicitly explicit, and as such impossible not to view it as intending to reduce women to billboards and sex objects. Claiming to portray Davis this way in the name of ""celebrating the female form"" is a lie balder than her nether region. Plus-size models give SI's swimsuit edition more curves . After all, if the point isn't to objectify women for the pleasure of the male gaze, why has no one created a counterpart magazine featuring a scantily dressed man? Why are men so rarely offered up as objects to behold? Men aren't the only ones who like to ""appreciate the beauty"" of the opposite sex. If the point isn't to objectify women, and subvert them in some way, then why isn't there a similar model for men? Instead, most examples of men gracing magazine covers with their bodies on display are for men's magazines, with a male readership. Why is it normal to ""celebrate the female form"" but not the male one? Maybe that's next. But it's highly doubtful. The only thing remaining that could be more shocking than this year's cover image would be if the magazine decided next year to run a cover of a supermodel in a (gasp!) one-piece swimsuit. Risqué indeed!","Peggy Drexler: SI swimsuit edition cover baldly about reducing women to sex objects .
Drexler asks why is there no heralded magazine cover showing a man .

"(CNN)Like many Catholics, I applauded the news this week that Pope Francis had formally declared Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero a martyr, paving the way for his beatification, the final step before sainthood. Romero was assassinated in 1980 by a right-wing death squad after preaching against the government's oppression and human rights violations -- what Catholics call ""the preferential option for the poor."" To me, Romero is already a saint, and I am lucky enough to have made a pilgrimage to San Salvador to see the chapel where he was slain while celebrating Mass and to his nearby living quarters, where his blood-stained clothes remain. Just outside the capital, along a dirt road, is another place of pilgrimage, one for four other martyrs. It is where four North American churchwomen -- Maryknoll Sisters Ita Ford and Maura Clarke, Ursuline Sister Dorothy Kazel and lay missioner Jean Donovan -- were raped, killed and buried just months after the assassination of Romero. While much has been made about the slow pace of Romero's sainthood cause, especially after the fast-tracking of now-blessed John Paul II, there has been little outcry about the need to open sainthood causes for these women. A Maryknoll spokeswoman told me the order is not aware of anyone officially pursuing canonization of any of the four churchwomen. And the Ursuline Sisters of Cleveland have not opened a cause for Kazel, said Sister Susan Durkin, president of the order. ""That doesn't mean we won't consider doing that moving forward, especially in light of the announcement about Archbishop Romero, which we are all certainly happy about and has been a long time coming,"" she said. I believe Ford, Clarke, Kazel and Donovan's commitment to the poor in the face of grave danger that ultimately led to their death qualifies them for consideration to sainthood. Who were the four North American churchwomen? Ford, a native New Yorker, had joined the Maryknoll order in her 30s and had worked in Chile in the 1970s in the wake of the U.S.-backed military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government there. Responding to pleas for help from Romero, Ford left for El Salvador, only to learn about the archbishop's death while en route. Ford was later joined by Clarke, also a native New Yorker, who had entered the Maryknollers at 19. By the time she went to El Salvador, Clarke was an experienced missionary, having served the poor in Nicaragua for 20 years. Both women were returning from a regional meeting of their religious order in Managua on December 2, 1980. They were met at the airport by Kazel and Donovan. Kazel had been engaged to be married before joining the Urusline Sisters in Cleveland. She worked first as a teacher, then joined a mission team in El Salvador in the early 1970s. Donovan, a laywoman, grew up in Connecticut and was working for an accounting firm in Cleveland when a spiritual search led her to the diocesan mission project in El Salvador. All four women served the poor at a time when the Salvadoran government had become increasingly suspicious of the church's work among the people. After leaving the airport on that fateful night, the women's car was stopped by National Guardsmen, who beat, raped and shot them. Although several lower-level guardsmen were convicted, a U.N. truth commission concluded the men responsible had carried out the killings on orders from above. Donovan was 27. Kazel was 41. Ford was 40. Clarke was 49. Are they not martyrs also? As with Romero, some Catholics question whether these women were killed in odium fidei, literally ""in hatred for the faith."" Traditionally this has meant death for refusing to renounce one's Christian beliefs. In August, Pope Francis told reporters that one of the questions the Vatican congregation faced with Romero's case was whether such hatred could also be because of the good works the person did because of his or her belief. This week's announcement about Romero seems to have answered that question. The Catholic Church's process for declaring someone is a saint can be costly and requires support from an organized group, most often a religious order -- which explains why so many founders and foundresses have been canonized over the centuries. It also explains why the church has so few lay saints. But the lack of an official stamp of sainthood has not stopped Catholics from honoring the four churchwomen of El Salvador. Books have been written about them, those involved in justice work pray for their intercession, and young Catholics already choose their names as their confirmation names. While Romero's heroic transformation from quiet priest to outspoken archbishop is inspiring, he's not the only Catholic killed for speaking out against injustice, oppression and human rights violations during the 12-year civil war in El Salvador. Among the more than 75,000 Salvadorans who lost their lives were six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her daughter, who were killed by government forces at the University of Central America. And these four brave North American women. After Clarke's death, a fellow Maryknoll sister is said to have found a poster among her belongings with the words: ""Follow me, and if you follow me and lose your life, others will follow you."" If that isn't the definition of a martyr, I don't know what is. It's time to make the martyrdoms of these women official, too.","Heidi Schlumpf: Oscar Romero, assassinated in 1980 in El Salvador, on just path to sainthood .

"Saying that climate change ranks among the world's most serious problems -- such as disease outbreaks, poverty, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on all nations to respond to ""the greatest challenge of our generation."" Kerry, speaking before college students in Jakarta, Indonesia, also criticized climate-change deniers, saying ""a few loud interest groups"" shouldn't be given the chance to misdirect the conversation. Kerry reiterated U.S. President Barack Obama's assertion in the State of the Union address that climate change is an undeniable fact. ""We should not allow a tiny minority of shoddy scientists and science and extreme ideologues to compete with scientific fact,"" Kerry said at the U.S. Embassy's @america function in Jakarta. Too many ecosystems such as Indonesia's are in peril because of climate change, he said. He said Indonesia's important fishing trade would be adversely affected, citing a study that said catches in the island nation will decline by 40 percent. Kerry recalled a meeting in Brazil where many experts described the growing problem caused by climate change. The session was in 1992. Very little has been done sine then, he said. Opinion: Why global health security is a national priority . ""It is time for the world to approach this problem with the cooperation, the urgency, and the commitment that a challenge of this scale warrants,"" he said. The secretary acknowledged the role the United States plays in greenhouse gas emissions and referred to the President's Climate Action Plan, which calls for cutting emissions by 17 percent from 2005 levels. ""That's because we're going straight to the largest sources of pollution,"" he said. Kerry said he and Obama had no time for what he called the ""Flat Earth Society."" It will soon be too late for action to prevent the immense costs of doing nothing. People who refuse to look at the evidence and agree on change are ""burying their heads"" in the sand, he said. On Friday, Obama toured a California farm hit by serious and prolonged drought. He warned that some damage to the climate had already been done and will continue unless countries ""do more to combat the carbon pollution that causes climate change."" Kerry was fresh off a Saturday meeting in China, the No. 1 producer of greenhouse gas emissions. He said the two nations have agreed to a partnership that will share ""information and policies so that we can help develop plans to deal with the U.N. climate change negotiation that takes place in Paris next year."" But, Kerry added, while industrialized countries produce a majority of emissions, other nations shouldn't get a free pass. He called on Indonesians to push their government to change policies. The United States will help, too, he said. He announced $332 million in funding through the Green Prosperity program to help Indonesia tackle unsustainable deforestation and support clean-energy projects. The United States has also forgiven some of Indonesia's debt in a debt-for-nature swap in exchange for forest conservation. The World Wildlife Federation estimates that half of Sumatra's forest cover disappeared from 1985 to 2008. The government has halted the cutting of virgin forest, also known as primary forest. ""With Indonesia and the rest of the world pulling in the same direction, we can meet this challenge, the greatest challenge of our generation, and we can create the future that everybody dreams of,"" he said.

"A woman was beheaded in Saudi Arabia for practicing witchcraft and sorcery, the kingdom's Interior Ministry said, prompting Amnesty International to call for a halt in executions there. Amina bint Abdel Halim Nassar was executed Monday for having ""committed the practice of witchcraft and sorcery,"" according to an Interior Ministry statement.  Nassar was investigated before her arrest and was ""convicted of what she was accused of based on the law,"" the statement said.  Her beheading took place in the Qariyat province of the region of Al-Jawf, the ministry said. In a statement issued late Monday, the human rights group called the execution ""deeply shocking"" and said it ""highlights the urgent need for a halt in executions in Saudi Arabia."" ""While we don't know the details of the acts which the authorities accused Amina of committing, the charge of sorcery has often been used in Saudi Arabia to punish people, generally after unfair trials, for exercising their right to freedom of speech or religion,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's interim director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme. Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy, practices a puritanical version of Islam and is governed by Shariah, or Islamic law.  In the deeply conservative kingdom, sorcery, witchcraft and blasphemy are all offenses that can be punishable by death. The London-based Saudi newspaper Al-Hayat quoted a source in the country's religious police who said authorities searched Nassar's home and found books on sorcery, a number of talismans and glass bottles filled with liquids supposedly used for the purposes of magic.  The source told the paper Nassar was selling spells and bottles of the liquid potions for about $400 dollars each. CNN could not reach Saudi Arabia's religious police or Justice Ministry for comment. Amnesty says Nassar's execution is ""the second of its kind in recent months. In September, a Sudanese national was beheaded in the Saudi Arabian city of Medina after being convicted on 'sorcery' charges."" The human rights group said the number of executions in Saudi Arabia has almost tripled in 2011. ""So far at least 79 people -- including five women -- have been executed there, compared to at least 27 in 2010,"" the Amnesty statement said. This is not the first sorcery case in Saudi Arabia to spark outrage from human rights groups. In 2008, Lebanese TV host Ali Hussain Sibat was arrested on charges of sorcery while in Saudi Arabia on a religious pilgrimage.  In 2009, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. While Sibat has not been executed, he remains in prison. Saudi Arabia's judicial system also made headlines this month for the sentence imposed on Australian national Mansor Almaribe, who was convicted of blasphemy while performing the Hajj in the kingdom, and sentenced to 500 lashes and a year in prison.  The Australian government is pleading Almaribe's case.","Newspaper says authorities found sorcery books and potions in her home .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Hezbollah's chief on Monday announced the group's new ""manifesto,"" which calls on all countries to ""liberate Jerusalem"" and declares the United States a threat to the world. ""American terrorism is the source of every terrorism in the world,"" Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech from an undisclosed location. It was his first address since a unity government formed in Lebanon this month, ending a crisis that had left the country with no government since June's parliamentary elections. Hezbollah, a political party in Lebanon, is listed as a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel. Nasrallah does not appear in public amid concerns for his safety. ""We invite and call on all Arabs and Muslims and all countries keen on peace and stability in the world to intensify efforts and resources to liberate Jerusalem from Zionist occupation and to maintain its true identity and its Islamic and Christian sanctities,"" Nasrallah said. Hezbollah has claimed responsibility for numerous terrorist attacks. It has been linked to attacks against against American, Israeli and other Western targets. In his remarks, which included about 80 minutes of reading the manifesto followed by answering questions from reporters, Nasrallah sought to reject the ""terrorist"" label, repeatedly saying Hezbollah is a ""resistance"" force. ""The U.S. administration under President George W. Bush equated the concepts of terrorism and resistance to deny the right of resistance for the people,"" he argued. He praised Iran and Syria, which are Hezbollah's chief backers. ""Iran plays a central role in the Muslim world"" and ""stood with courage and determination with Arab and Islamic issues, especially the Palestinian issue,"" Nasrallah said. ""Damascus stood with and supported the resistance's movements in the conflict. We emphasize the need to adhere to the distinguished relations between Lebanon and Syria,"" he added. A battle to end Syria's occupation of Lebanon led to protests and confrontations in the streets in 2005, which was labeled the Cedar Revolution. Syria eventually withdrew its troops from the country. In his ""manifesto"" Monday, Nasrallah also touched on domestic issues. ""We want a government that works for its citizens and provides the appropriate services in their education and medical care and housing to secure a decent life and to address the problem of poverty and provide employment opportunities,"" Nasrallah said. ""We want a government that works to strengthen the role of women in society and enhance their participation in all fields,"" he added. Nasrallah also called for Palestinians in Lebanon to ""be given basic human rights which at the same time protect their identity and their cause."" Under Lebanese law, Palestinian refugees have no social and civil rights, limited access to public health or educational facilities, and no access to public social services, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. ""The majority rely entirely on UNRWA as the sole provider of education, health and relief and social services,"" the agency says on its Web site. ""Considered as foreigners, Palestine refugees are prohibited by law from working in more than 70 trades and professions. This has led to a very high rate of unemployment amongst the refugee population."" More than 422,000 Palestinian refugees are registered with the agency in Lebanon, the group says.","""American terrorism is the source of every terrorism,"" Hezbollah chief says .

"Karak, Jordan (CNN)Since ISIS announced it burned a captured Jordanian pilot to death, his country has mourned him as a martyr, but his family has mourned him as a son, a cousin. Moath al-Kasasbeh's mother, just out of the hospital, was too frail to speak Thursday, as she sat with other women in mourning. But his cousin Layla al-Kasasbeh shared fond memories of him between crying spells. ""He always wanted to be a pilot,"" she said. He was a really smart guy, and everyone loved him. And he was well-known, and he was that guy who was so popular."" Al-Kasasbeh left behind a widow. They had wed just six months before. On the spot of their ceremony, the family's men gathered in a tent. Men from all over the nation lined up to file through, and express condolences and outrage, and they were joined by their King, Abdullah II. As the monarch approached, the crowd vowed to give their lives to his cause of destroying ISIS. ""Our blood, our souls, we sacrifice for you,"" they chanted in loud, rhythmic unison. To Jordanians, al-Kasasbeh is a national hero, their new rallying point. King Abdullah embraced the slain pilot's father and sat down with him to talk. Safi al-Kasasbeh has pleaded for a long campaign of vengeance for his son's death, and after Abdullah left, he said the King had heard him. ""He promised us a good promise that he will bombard ISIS' strongholds until he avenges Moath's death and destroys them,"" he said. The King said he'd bombard ISIS' de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria, al-Kasasbeh said. Abdullah told him the military sent 30 Jordanian fighter jets into the battle. Abdullah also visited Jordan's armed forces headquarters Thursday, state media reported. The King confirmed his promise to al-Kasasbeh's family with the thunder of fighter jets over their heads. The planes overflew the slain 27-year-old lieutenant's home in the village of Ay in Karak governorate, saluting him, as they returned from the fresh bombing operation named after him -- ""Moath the Martyr.""

"Washington (CNN)They're carrying out sporadic terror attacks on police, have threatened attacks on government buildings and reject government authority. A new intelligence assessment, circulated by the Department of Homeland Security this month and reviewed by CNN, focuses on the domestic terror threat from right-wing sovereign citizen extremists and comes as the Obama administration holds a White House conference to focus efforts to fight violent extremism. Some federal and local law enforcement groups view the domestic terror threat from sovereign citizen groups as equal to -- and in some cases greater than -- the threat from foreign Islamic terror groups, such as ISIS, that garner more public attention.â€‹ . The Homeland Security report, produced in coordination with the FBI, counts 24 violent sovereign citizen-related attacks across the U.S. since 2010. ISIS burned up to 40 people alive in Iraq, official says . The government says these are extremists who believe that they can ignore laws and that their individual rights are under attack in routine daily instances such as a traffic stop or being required to obey a court order. They've lashed out against authority in incidents such as one in 2012, in which a father and son were accused of engaging in a shootout with police in Louisiana, in a confrontation that began with an officer pulling them over for a traffic violation. Two officers were killed and several others wounded in the confrontation. The men were sovereign citizen extremists who claimed police had no authority over them. Among the findings from the Homeland Security intelligence assessment: ""(Sovereign citizen) violence during 2015 will occur most frequently during routine law enforcement encounters at a suspect's home, during enforcement stops and at government offices."" The report adds that ""law enforcement officers will remain the primary target of (sovereign citizen) violence over the next year due to their role in physically enforcing laws and regulations."" The White House has fended off criticism in recent days for its reluctance to say the words ""Islamist extremism,"" even as the conference this week almost entirely focused on helping imams and community groups to counteract the lure of groups like ISIS. Absent from the White House conference is any focus on the domestic terror threat posed by sovereign citizens, militias and other anti-government terrorists that have carried out multiple attacks in recent years. An administration official says the White House is focused on the threat from all terrorists, including from sovereign citizen and other domestic groups. ""I don't think it's fair to say the (White House) conference didn't address this at all,"" the official said, adding that President Barack Obama addressed the need to combat ""violent ideologies"" of all types. An official at the Justice Department, which is leading the administration's counter-radicalization effort, says many of the tactics aimed at thwarting radical Islamic recruitment of young people can also be used to fight anti-government extremist groups. While groups like ISIS and al Qaeda garner the most attention, for many local cops, the danger is closer to home. A survey last year of state and local law enforcement officers listed sovereign citizen terrorists, ahead of foreign Islamists, and domestic militia groups as the top domestic terror threat. The survey was part of a study produced by the University of Maryland's National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism. In 2013, a man who held anti-government views carried out a shooting attack on three Transportation Security Administration employees at Los Angeles International Airport, killing one TSA officer. Last year, a couple killed two police officers and a bystander at a Las Vegas Walmart store. Mark Potok, senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said that by some estimates, there are as many as 300,000 people involved in some way with sovereign citizen extremism. Perhaps 100,000 people form a core of the movement, he said. The federal government's focus on the domestic groups waxes and wanes, Potok said, in part because the threat from foreign groups like al Qaeda and its affiliates. Potok says sovereign citizen groups have attracted support because of poor economic conditions. Some groups travel the country pitching their ideology as a way to help homeowners escape foreclosure or get out of debt, by simply ignoring the courts and bankruptcy law. The Homeland Security report's focus on right-wing terrorists is a subject that garnered political controversy for the Obama administration in the past. In 2009, a Homeland Security report on possible recruitment of military veterans by right-wing militia groups prompted an outcry from veterans groups. The report was produced by staff members during the Bush administration but wasn't published until then Homeland Security Janet Napolitano had taken office. Napolitano criticized her own agency for the report.","Intelligence assessment focuses on domestic terror threat from right-wing sovereign citizen extremists .

"An Indian court sentenced four men to death Friday for the rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi, an attack that appalled the South Asian nation. Announcing the sentence, Judge Yogesh Khanna said the crime ""shocked the collective conscience"" of India and fell into the ""rarest of rare category"" that deserves capital punishment. ""In these times when crimes against women are on the rise, the court cannot turn a blind eye to this gruesome act,"" he said. One of the convicted men, Vinay Sharma, broke down in tears and cried loudly as the judge spoke. Prosecutors had asked for the death penalty for the men, citing the ""extreme brutality"" of the attack, which took place on a moving bus in December. They had also argued the court needed to send a message to Indian society with its judgment. Opinion: Where have India's females gone? Anger about the deadly assault has had a widespread impact in India. It set off demonstrations, started a debate about women's treatment in Indian society and prompted the introduction of tougher punishments for sexual abuse. ""We are very happy. Justice has been delivered,"" said the father of the victim, whose name was withheld under Indian law. Calls for the men to be executed had come from the victim's family members, high-profile politicians and many other Indians. The announcement of the sentence was met with cheering from hundreds of protesters outside the court. Posters and banners held by those in the crowd read ""hang the rapists"" and ""a woman's life is the foundation, do not defile it."" Indian Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said his initial reaction was that ""justice was given to that girl and family."" Defense attorneys had urged the judge to show leniency and sentence the men to life in prison, saying the death penalty should be the exception, not the rule. As the judge announced the death sentence, defense lawyer A.P. Singh shouted, ""This is not the victory of truth. But it is the defeat of justice."" A shocking attack . The brutality of the New Delhi attack, as described by police and prosecutors, helped stir the strong emotions surrounding the case. On the evening of December 16, the victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, had gone to see the movie ""The Life of Pi"" with a male friend at a New Delhi mall. During their journey home, they boarded a bus at a major intersection in upmarket South Delhi. The driver and at least five other men on the bus were drunk and looking for a ""joy ride,"" police said. The men, from a poverty-ridden slum on the outskirts of Delhi, dragged the woman to the back of the bus and beat up her male friend. Police said the men took turns raping the woman, using an iron rod to violate her as the bus drove around the city for almost an hour. When they had finished, they dumped the two victims by the side of the road. The woman's injuries were so severe that some internal organs had to be removed. She died two weeks later at a hospital in Singapore. Four found guilty . After a trial that lasted about seven months, the Delhi court Tuesday convicted four of the men -- ages 19 to 28 -- of murder, rape and kidnapping. The victim's parents had tears in their eyes as the judge read the verdict in which he said the men had been found guilty of ""committing the murder of a helpless victim."" Her brother wiped a tear from his cheek. The four men -- Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh Singh -- will appeal the verdict, their attorneys said. Opinion: Victims blamed in India's rape culture . Human rights groups criticized the decision to impose capital punishment. ""The rape and murder of the young woman in Delhi last year was a horrific crime, and our deepest sympathy goes out to the victim's family. Those responsible must be punished, but the death penalty is never the answer,"" said Tara Rao, director of Amnesty International India. ""Sending these four men to the gallows will accomplish nothing except short-term revenge."" Rao said there is ""no evidence that the death penalty is a particular deterrent to crime, and its use will not eradicate violence against women in India."" Death sentences issued by Indian courts have rarely been carried out in the past decade. No state executions took place between 2004 and late 2012, when the last surviving gunman from the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai was hanged. But human rights advocates have said they fear India's stance on executions has changed. ""In the past year, India has made a full-scale retreat from its previous principled rejection of the death penalty,"" Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said last month. Two others accused . The fate of two others accused in the case had been determined before this week. One man, Ram Singh, 35, was found dead in his jail cell in March. Authorities said he had hanged himself, but his family said he had been murdered. A juvenile court convicted a teenage boy on August 31 for his part in the gang rape, sentencing him to three years in a special juvenile correctional facility. His trial was in juvenile court because he was 17 at the time of the crime, and the sentence is the maximum allowed under the court's rules. Many Indians, including the victim's family, expressed dissatisfaction with the sentence. The same crowd outside the courthouse that cheered Friday's death sentence for the four adults turned their ire on the juvenile. The crowd chanted, ""Hang the juvenile."" A lawyer for the victim's family said they would go to India's top court to contest the youth's sentence. A rape every 22 minutes . As in many countries, rape is a grimly frequent occurrence in India. According to Indian government statistics, a woman is raped every 22 minutes on average. But the New Delhi attack seized the country's attention. Advocates criticized the world's largest democracy for failing to protect half of its population. Protesters demanded better treatment of women and decried the apathy of police and the judicial system. Men respond to rape crisis . The government passed tougher anti-rape laws, introducing the death penalty for repeat offenders, and imprisonment for acid attacks, human trafficking and stalking. But some Indians said that while the laws on crimes against women have changed, mindsets and enforcement have been slower to adjust. 'Take it to the source' Government figures show the number of women reporting rapes has risen significantly since the New Delhi attack and the heavy scrutiny that followed it. Observers said it indicates women who are victims of sexual attacks feel more emboldened to come forward than they did before. Meet India's Red Brigade: Teens fighting back against rape . Prosecution of such crimes has improved, said Kiran Bedi, a human rights activist and former Indian police officer. But it will take a heavy emphasis on the family and school environments to resolve the problem in the long run, Bedi said.

"(CNN)Why do Muslims ""speak out"" and ""condemn"" violent acts with which they have no connection, and why do others, across the political spectrum, expect it? People should demand public statements like, ""I condemn this act,"" from those who have some kind of accountability in connection with the act. There is always a crucial line between feeling revulsion at a crime and feeling it necessary to dissociate oneself from that crime. Did you benefit from a crime? Could you have stopped the crime? Did you contribute, even unwittingly, to the crime? If so, you may have to stand up and denounce it. In connection with the recent Paris killings, some mainstream commentators such as New York Times columnist Roger Cohen ask why ""moderate"" Muslims cannot simply ""come out and say"" that ""I do not support this."" Former congressman Barney Frank writes that he wishes that Muslims would ""speak out more strongly."" Such liberal commentary is not substantially different from Rupert Murdoch's tweet that Muslims like myself ""must be held responsible."" They should know that groups like ISIS and al Qaeda believe fanatically that most Muslims are misguided and hell-bound, and that only a small group (themselves) are members of an exclusive ""saved sect,"" a belief that makes them immune to critique. Any condemnations they receive from the wayward Muslim majority only entrenches them in this belief. Moreover, it is Muslims themselves who stand to lose the most when crimes are committed by these vigilantes. The vast majority of victims of jihadist groups are other Muslims, and when an attack takes place in the West it is the Muslim community that suffers the backlash from the societies in which they live. Worst of all, Muslims offer the much sought-after condemnations all the time. Just type ""Muslims condemn"" into a search engine. If the goal of our detractors were really to get Muslims to do more ""speaking out,"" then what Muslims have already done would have been enough years ago. This is really about political statements and maintaining a certain social hierarchy. Demanding that innocent Muslims always make new statements about crimes they could not have stopped, from which they do not benefit, and have always condemned anyway, is an act by the powerful assigning collective guilt against the powerless. The critics who want Muslims to ""speak out"" only grow more demanding when Muslims actually do speak out, because by doing so Muslims have publicly affirmed the right of others to blame them collectively, regardless of whether they are accountable or not. Such political manuevers -- and that is what they really are -- increase the leverage that can be exerted over Muslims in public life. Muslim voices are thus uniquely kept out of view unless they are apologizing for some atrocity they had nothing to do with. In the case of the Charlie Hebdo massacre, Muslims were asked not only to condemn murder (which they did) but also to champion a ""free speech"" that took the form of denigrating their sacred beliefs (which they deplored). For Barney Frank, this refusal to follow the script was to ""condone their terrible acts with qualified condemnation""  while Roger Cohen laments our use of, ""Yes, but."" Muslims are thus tarred as being sympathetic with murder if they point out that the very publication that portrayed the Prophet Mohammed so grotesquely had fired an editor, who was later taken to court, for quipping that Nicolas Sarkozy's son converted to Judaism because of social ambition. Muslims have no duty to celebrate a general hypocrisy that singles them out for ill treatment. Not approving of the murder is quite enough. It is possible to consider the cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo to be vile people who did not deserve to die. It is worth remembering that the perpetrators of crimes such as the Charlie Hebdo massacre are always screaming ""Revenge!"" but Western commentators choose to dwell on what innocent Muslims are going to do about it, or whether Islam is to blame. Why do they not instead ask, as New Yorker writer George Packer chose not to do, ""Revenge for what?"" Do they fear they might bring to light crimes, much greater crimes, that they themselves should have ""spoken out"" about long ago? Perhaps it is more comfortable to keep the conversation focused on Muslims and their religion than it is to investigate whether one's own country or one's own group has anything it might have to ""condemn.""","Some mainstream commentators have urged moderate Muslims to condemn terrorism, in particular the recent Paris killings .
Caner Dagli says though that groups like ISIS and al Qaeda believe fanatically that most Muslims are misguided and hell-bound .
For many, it's more comfortable to focus on Muslims than to ask if one's own country may have anything to ""condemn,"" Dagli adds ."
"(CNN)After two weeks of failed negotiations, Houthi rebels announced Friday that they will chart Yemen's political future, setting up groups to replace the volatile Arab nation's parliament and form a presidential council. This all follows last month's resignations of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi and other officials after Houthis moved into the Yemeni capital, Sanaa. The chaos in Yemen has far-reaching implications for the United States and its allies, which had considered Yemen's previous government a key ally in its fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The United Nations-sponsored talks aimed to find a resolution to the satisfaction of all parties, including the Houthis, who are Shiite Muslims who have long felt marginalized in the majority Sunni country. But Friday's news suggests no such accord. Instead, the Houthis -- politically recognized as Ansarullah -- announced that the country's top supervising authority will become the Houthi Revolutionary Committee. That committee will be charged with setting up a 551-member National Transition Council in place of Yemen's parliament. That body, according to the announcement, will then choose members of a five-person Presidential Council, which will lead the country during a two-year transition. There was no immediate response to the announcement from other Yemeni factions or from officials outside the country. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Yemen's President, Prime Minister resigned as Houthi rebels advanced .

"All other arguments aside, the West should not militarily intervene in Iraq. Regardless of what might be said by politicians, Iraqi or not, Western intervention to aid Baghdad in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) does not constitute a solution to the current crisis, nor does it work towards one. Far from it: direct military intervention by a Western state -- even if Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is requesting it -- would dramatically worsen the situation, and ISIS, contrary to what pro-interventionists might say, would inevitably come out on top. While all options might, as John Kerry said this week, remain on the table at this point, some are more ""on it"" than others. Indeed, it seems there is an international consensus that there is no appetite for Western ""boots on the ground"" (besides a very limited presence to secure national assets). If there were to be any intervention,  therefore, it seems likely it would take the form of ""targeted strikes"" from the air -- be they via drones, jets or missiles. And we are told that in that case, the focus would be exclusively on ""ISIS strongholds"" in order to ""minimize civilian casualties."" Removed from the rhetoric of politicos, though, Western intervention would bolster the propaganda efforts of ISIS, for any attack would inevitably kill or injure Muslim civilians, regardless of how well it had been planned or how good the intelligence behind it was. This would be good news for ISIS. Indeed, the group actually relies on its ability to attribute civilian casualties to its enemies. By doing so, it bolsters the skewed jihadist narrative of international politics and presents an opportunity to exaggerate the non-existent ""Crusader threat"" and defend the group's false legitimacy. In short, the more civilians that die, the more events in Iraq can be internationalized, and the wider the appeal of ISIS can become. This effect would be grossly amplified if there were deaths at the hands of the U.S. or the UK. After all, one of the central tenets of the jihadist narrative is the so-called ""War on Islam."" Through this much abused paradigm, any international involvement in a conflict involving Muslims is used by jihadists to fortify their ever-tenuous relevance in the modern world. And even were we to set aside all of the above, we still could not in any way justify intervening against ISIS in Iraq but not against Assad in Syria. Rightly or wrongly, this would be read by the region's most vulnerable as incontrovertible evidence that the West will only intervene when its own economic prosperity is at stake. Why else would it defend the rights of civilians here and not against Assad after his apparent use of chemical weapons? The West must ignore Baghdad's plea for military assistance. We must not play into the jihadists' hands. Instead, we must focus on humanitarian assistance for refugees and diplomatic pressure on al-Maliki to force him into profound and far-reaching reforms. In the long term, the only solution there can be is a political one: Iraq's economically and politically marginalized Sunnis need to be brought back into Iraq's decision-making process. But even if it is not our place to carry out military action, this is not to say that military intervention is categorically inappropriate. Indeed, if the Iraqi national army cannot pull itself together, I would argue it is absolutely necessary. However, it must be at the hands of a Sunni Muslim-majority country, in order to diffuse the narrative of Western armed forces once again attacking Muslims. If a country like Turkey or Jordan acts against it, ISIS's ""War on Islam"" rhetoric would not have anywhere near the same impact. Leaving its operational and strategic capacity to regional players, the West's focus needs to be on ISIS's ideological heart. We need to undermine its greatest rhetorical asset: that Muslims, worldwide, are under attack by the ""Crusading"" West. This can only be achieved with a policy of restraint.","Cooper says Western military intervention would play into ISIS hands .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong's embattled chief executive has said the city's pro-democracy movement is ""out of hand"" and being influenced by ""external forces"" from outside the city. In a television interview with a local station that aired Sunday, C.Y. Leung said the protests, which have lasted more than three weeks, have ""gone out of control even for the people who started it, for people who planned it, for people (who) scripted it."" Without identifying any particular group or individuals, Leung said this was not ""entirely a domestic movement"" and that there was ""obviously participation by people, organizations from outside of Hong Kong, in politics in Hong Kong, over a long time. This is not the only time when they do it, and this is not an exception either."" Reacting to the suggestion of foreign interference, teen protest leader Joshua Wong tweeted: . ""My personal connection with foreign countries would be: South Korean cellphone, U.S. computer, Japanese Gundam action figures. All of which were of course, made in China."" Violence erupts . Leung was speaking in the wake of further clashes over the weekend between protesters and police in the city's Mong Kok district after the authorities attempted to reopen roads in the area to traffic. Protesters crossed police lines, authorities said, clashing with officers as the situation turned violent. At least 240 people were injured, according to the Hong Kong Hospital Authority, which manages all public hospitals in the city. Eighteen police officers were injured, Hong Kong police said. Violence erupted after police conducted a dawn raid Friday on a student protest camp in the commercial and residential area of Kowloon. Authorities then moved to clear a major intersection occupied by the pro-democracy movement, tearing down tents and dismantling barricades. Around 500 to 600 police carrying wire cutters and riot shields stormed the site, a smaller offshoot of the main downtown protest area, catching the 100 to 200 protesters by surprise. Secretary for Security Lai Tung-kwok called protesters in Mong Kok ""radical,"" saying they were not protesting peacefully but instead carrying out violent acts and violating public order. Protest talks . The city's deputy leader, Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, said Saturday that televised talks with pro-democracy protesters would take place on Tuesday, with Lingnan University President Leonard Cheng, a former adviser of Leung, as moderator. This news received a lukewarm from Yvonne Leung, spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Federation of Students, who said the protest group didn't ""have much opinion"" about the details of the meeting. Political commentator Frank Ching told CNN Monday that the talks are unlikely to produce results because the Hong Kong government is not in a position to meet the demands of the protesters. ""They can't agree to overthrow the August 31 decision [by China's National People's Congress]. I don't think that C.Y. Leung will resign. What is in their authority to do is to open up Civic Square, where the protesters used to be. The protesters want that to be opened up to the public."" Ching was referring to China's insistence that any candidate nominated for the election of the city's next chief executive in 2017 must come from a shortlist approved by a largely pro-Beijing committee. Leung has repeatedly said Beijing will not retract its decision. Currently, the chief executive is elected by a specially-appointed 1,200-member election committee. Protesters are demanding the freedom to vote for a candidate of their choice and the immediate resignation of Leung. Internet clampdown . Meanwhile, police said at least 33 people were arrested following the weekend clashes and now face various charges, including property damage, disorderly conduct, weapons possession and resisting arrest. On Sunday, a 23-year-old protest leader was arrested for posting messages on an online forum encouraging people to join an unlawful assembly and charge at police, as authorities warned against using the Internet to incite ""unlawful"" Occupy protests. The protests have been characterized by the use of social media and technology to organize and mobilize support for a campaign of ""civil disobedience."" Armed with smartphones utilizing super-fast mobile networks, Hong Kong's young protesters have been able to deploy in large numbers at a moment's notice. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph, Katie Hunt, Anjali Tsui, Pamela Boykoff and Esther Pang contributed to this report.","Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung says the protests ""have gone out of control""

"(CNN)After an illustrious golf career that spanned more than four decades, one of the sport's legends has died. Billy Casper, a pioneer of professional golf, died Saturday afternoon at his home in Springville, Utah, at the age of 83, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. The PGA posted news of Casper's death as well, describing him as ""one of the most prolific PGA TOUR winners in history and long considered among the sport's finest putters."" His resume included three major titles and 51 PGA Tour events -- putting him seventh on the U.S circuit's all-time list. ""Billy Casper was one of the greatest winners in PGA Tour history and was a dominant player for the better part of three decades,"" tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said in a statement. ""We remember his three major championships and his incredible work on the greens that made him one of the best putters of his generation. Beyond his career as a player, though, we will remember Billy as tremendous husband and father, a man devoted to family, charitable pursuits and his religion. He truly has left us with a lasting legacy."" Known as ""Buffalo Bill"" for his strict diet of organic meat and vegetables that slimmed him down to a more athletic figure, Casper set about his golf career with the discipline he had learned in a four-year stint in the U.S. Navy. Recently, Casper recalled the evolution of enormous prizes for top golfers. ""The tour when I started in 1956 was for about $650,000 total purse for 40 tournaments,"" he told CNN. ""It started growing in '58 and we grew along with it. It took (Arnold) Palmer about 12 years to become a millionaire. I was the second millionaire, and it took me 14 years."" By contrast, pro golfers these days can become instant millionaires by winning one event. ""It was really a different time of training and building one's life,"" Casper recalled. ""There wasn't a lot of money available. You had to stay with it."" ""I approached golf tournaments the same way -- I was never worried about majors, I just wanted to play the best I could each week. I wasn't like (Jack) Nicklaus -- he geared himself to winning majors and he played for the majors. I wanted to play every week. I always played for my family."" A devoted family man and devout Mormon, Casper said last year that he still had a ""close relationship"" with the military. In the 1960s, he visited U.S. troops (""hitting golf balls off aircraft carriers"") at bases in Vietnam, Thailand and Japan. In the past several years, Casper's golf facility operations company has helped raise more than $1.1 million for the Wounded Warrior veterans project via the ""World's Largest Golf Outing"" event. ""Recently I gave a lecture and a gentleman came to me and asked how I'd like to be remembered,"" Casper said. ""I'd never been asked that before, so I thought for a few seconds. And I said I want to be remembered that I had a great love for my fellow man."" CNN's Gary Morley and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","Golf great Billy Casper dies at 83 .

"(CNN)If that car parked in Harvard Yard is a rockin', school officials may soon come a knockin', because hanky-panky between students and faculty at the elite university has officially been banned. Specifically, the school adopted a new policy this week that prohibits romantic relationships between undergraduates and professors. The previous policy only did so between professors and the students they taught. Harvard released a statement saying a specially appointed committee ""determined that the existing language on relationships of unequal status did not explicitly reflect the faculty's expectations of what constituted an appropriate relationship between undergraduate students and faculty members ... therefore, the committee revised the policy to include a clear prohibition to better accord with these expectations."" The action comes nearly a year after the U.S. Department of Education announced it was investigating 55 colleges and universities, including Harvard, for violations pertaining to Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination on college campuses. Harvard responded at the time by saying it had appointed its first ever Title IX officer, and that the school's president ""recently announced the creation of a university-wide task force -- composed of faculty, students and staff -- that will recommend how we can better prevent sexual misconduct at Harvard."" The new policy is the result of ""a formal process to review Harvard University's Title IX policy,"" the school said.","Harvard bans all romantic relationships between professors and students .

"To New Jersey prosecutors, Caleb Lawrence McGillvary is simply a murder suspect, and a dangerous one at that. But to at least some of the thousands of fans who know him as a hero for using a hatchet to stop another man's attack on two people in Fresno, California, accusations that the long-haired homeless hitchhiker bludgeoned a 73-year-old lawyer to death are unfathomable. ""I'm having a hard time seeing Kai as a cold-blooded killer,"" one of his fans posted on his Facebook page Friday. ""I hope they really listen to him and do a proper investigation."" Another fan started trying to raise money for a legal defense fund. As of midday Friday, it had collected $66. McGillvary, who after the Fresno incident became known on the Internet as ""Kai the Hatchet-Wielding Hitchhiker,"" is accused of killing attorney Joseph Galfy Jr. at the lawyer's Clark, New Jersey, home. Authorities who went to Galfy's house on a welfare check after he failed to turn up at work found him Monday -- severely beaten, dressed only in socks and underwear. Philadelphia police arrested McGillvary on Thursday evening, hours after authorities identified him as a suspect and were then ""flooded with calls from around the country,"" Union County Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow said. One of those calls came in around 5:45 p.m. from a man whose neighbor said she'd dropped McGillvary off at a New Jersey train station earlier Thursday. Around the same time that info came in, another came in saying a worker at a Starbucks in Philadelphia had just spotted a man who looked like McGillvary. Police spotted McGillvary at a nearby Greyhound bus terminal minutes later and arrested him without incident, Romankow said. ""The investigation came together very quickly,"" the prosecutor said. Galfy and McGillvary had exchanged text messages in recent days, and investigators know McGillvary spent Sunday night at Galfy's home, Romankow said. While authorities say they don't know a possible motive, investigators believe McGillvary and Galfy had a sexual relationship, Romankow said. ""There has been some indication of that on Facebook,"" the prosecutor said. A post Tuesday to McGillvary's Facebook page seems to suggest the writer felt he had been sexually assaulted and asked his fans, ""What would you do?"" CNN isn't able to verify who posted the message. McGillvary is being held in Philadelphia pending extradition to New Jersey, Romankow said. Once transferred, we will be held on $3 million bond pending a first court appearance, the prosecutor said. McGillvary received national attention after CNN affiliate KMPH interviewed him about a February incident in which he had hitched a ride with a man who suddenly proclaimed to be Jesus. The man then rammed a utility worker on the side of the road before grabbing a woman who was trying to help. McGillvary's Facebook page says that ""Kai saved a woman's life by cleaving a man in the head, with a hatchet, after he had just hit someone with his car."" With long hair sweeping out of a bandana, McGillvary provided a dramatic account of the rescue for the station, demonstrating how he wielded the hatchet against the rampaging motorist. ""Smash! Smash! Sa-mash!"" he told the affiliate. The female bystander, apparently not injured, confirmed the incident in an interview with KMPH. The utility worker underwent surgery for non-life-threatening injuries, and the driver, who stood more than 6 feet tall and weighed at least 300 pounds, was arrested, the affiliate said. McGillvary's story was featured on ""The Colbert Report"" and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" Romankow acknowledged the Internet fame surrounding McGillvary, but said that means nothing when it comes to the accusations he is now facing. ""This man was well-known. That doesn't mean he did not or could not become involved in a crime,"" Romankow told reporters before McGillvary's arrest. ""We believe he has murdered someone -- an attorney by the way who was in the county, was well respected, well regarded for well over 40 years."" ""I believe that everyone is a little safer with this person off the streets,"" the prosecutor said after McGillvary's capture.","""The investigation came together very quickly,"" the prosecutor says .

"(CNN)The world's most famous commuter thought he was meeting friends for lunch Friday to close out a wild week in the spotlight. But James Robertson, whose 21-mile round-trip work commute garnered worldwide attention and more than $300,000 in donations, got more than just lunch. The 56-year-old is now the owner of a brand new 2015 Ford Taurus. Blake Pollack, who befriended Robertson 1½ years ago and has helped drive him to media interviews all week, helped pull off the surprise, suggesting they stop by a car dealership after lunch to pick up some brochures and start researching cars. Robertson and Pollack were joined by Evan Leedy, the college student who set up a GoFundMe page on Robertson's behalf. They walked into Suburban Ford in Sterling Heights, Michigan, and instead of brochures, saw a shiny red car topped with a big bow. ""There must've been 200 people there to welcome him,"" Pollack said.  ""I though he was going to fall over."" When asked if he liked his new car, which has already been insured, Pollack said Robertson was quite clear. ""I don't like it,"" he said. ""I love it."" Before receiving his new wheels, Robertson had trudged the better part of a marathon each workday, taking buses part of the way -- rain, snow or shine.  But he never thought it was any big deal. ""I never thought anything I did would garner this much attention,"" Robertson said. After reading about Robertson's commute in a Detroit Free Press article that went viral, Leedy was moved. Like Robertson, the 19-year-old lives and works in two counties, so he spends a great deal of time commuting himself. But Leedy has a car. Leedy decided to set up an online fundraiser to buy Robertson a car. ""My first car cost $3,000,"" Leedy said, ""So I set the goal at $5,000. Within an hour, we'd raised $2,000."" Leedy's fundraiser quickly blew past its original goal and had raised nearly $313,000 Friday evening.  Leedy said he plans to stop taking donations on Sunday. Robertson, in a video message posted on the Free Press website, gave thanks. ""Everybody calls me the inspiration, but to those who have been great enough to donate and everything ... it was really so welcome that I don't know what to tell you,"" he said. ""You guys are the heroes."" Comments on the page from people donating money suggested the story of Robertson's dedication to getting to work had tapped into a deep well of public feeling. ""Thank you for inspiring me and hopefully tons of other people to persevere in the face of adversity,"" said a contributor by the name of Kevin LeMelle. ""You are a true American hero."" ""We could use more men like James Robertson in this world,"" wrote a donor named Betty Blanchard. Pollack said he identifies with the strangers' words of support.  Calling Friday's car presentation ""absolutely amazing,"" Pollack remembered spotting Robertson during his own work commute 1½ years ago. ""Climbing over snow banks, when it was pouring down rain in the summer,"" Pollack said, ""Whatever the weather, he was there."" Pollack approached Robertson, who told the financial executive his story.  Pollack promised to give him a ride the next time he saw him. ""Two to three months later, I saw him on a corner,"" Pollack remembered, ""and I asked if he needed a ride to work."" Pollack estimated he's given Robertson between 40 and 50 rides since then, and the two men from vastly different worlds have formed an unlikely friendship. The pleasure, Pollack said, has been all his. ""I'm the lucky one,"" Pollack said. ""Driving him around isn't a chore, it's a reward."" Pollack said Robertson is inspirational and funny, adding that his work ethic puts anyone to shame. ""I set our attendance standard by this man,"" Todd Wilson, plant manager at the engineering factory where Robertson works, told the Free Press. ""I say, if this man can get here, walking all those miles through snow and rain, well I'll tell you, I have people in Pontiac 10 minutes away and they say they can't get here -- bull!"" Robertson apparently has a perfect attendance record. He earns $10.55 an hour, not enough to save up to buy, insure and operate a car in the city, according to the newspaper. When the online donations rolled in,  Robertson, Pollack and Leedy met together for the first time this week. ""Now that [the effort] is so big, there's so much more to think about,"" Leedy said. There are people who want to take advantage of Robertson's newfound celebrity and his generosity, Pollack said. He put together a team that includes an attorney from a large law firm in Michigan, a CPA and a certified financial planner that he says will ensure the donation money is handled appropriately and in a way that best serves Robertson. ""This money that is being given to him -- he earned every penny of it,"" Leedy said, just by his work ethic and his attitude. He's been making the arduous 21-mile commute between Detroit and Rochester Hills since his 1988 Honda Accord gave up on him, but not anymore. Before receiving the car Friday, Robertson said the addition of a car to his life would mean a lot more sleep. But he loves where he works, so he has no plans to change much else. ""I can't imagine not working,"" Robertson said. ""It's what I've always done."" Robertson, in his message, said he never expected as much support as he has received. He encouraged people to look out for one another. ""If this story will touch at least one person and inspire them to do something out of the goodness of their heart, I will be the happiest person alive,"" he said.","James Robertson walks 21 miles round-trip to work .

"South Korea and Japan on Friday postponed the signing of a landmark military intelligence pact after the prospect stirred discontent among Koreans. Japan occupied Korea for 35 years during the first half of the 20th century, and anti-Japanese sentiment still lingers. The two countries had originally been scheduled to sign the accord in Tokyo on Friday. But the ceremony has been put on hold pending consultations on the matter with the South Korean National Assembly, an official at the South Korean Foreign Ministry said. The planned pact is intended to ""provide a legal framework on sharing classified military information,"" including the threat from nuclear-armed North Korea, Cho Byung-jae, a spokesman for the South Korean Foreign Ministry, had said Thursday. But as news of the proposed deal suddenly emerged this week, Koreans expressed misgivings. ""This is clearly a deception,"" said Kim Hwan-young, the head of Korean Veterans for Peace. ""I am angry at the fact that our government pushed the deal ignoring the national sentiment. We were colonized by Japan for more than three decades and we also suffered separation and civil war because of Japan."" Japan has been accused of forcing thousands of Koreans to enroll into the military during the occupation between 1910 and 1945 and of coercing hundreds of thousands of women to serve as sex slaves. They were known as ""comfort women"" for soldiers in the Japanese Imperial Army. Street protests and lawsuits in South Korea have sought redress for the sufferings of the comfort women. The idea of a military deal between the two countries appeared to revive some of that anger. ""I don't want this treaty to take place,"" Choi Jong-kwan, who works for a legal firm in Seoul, said before the postponement of the pact was announced. ""I am especially not happy at the fact that the signing will take place in Japan."" Tokyo and Seoul have also been arguing about who has sovereignty over a group of small islands, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan. Japan has long claimed the islets in the sea east of Korea as its territory, but Seoul insists all Korean territory was returned after  independence in 1945. ""There is still national sentiment on the history and the Dokdo Island dispute,"" said Moon Chung-in, a political science professor at Yonsei University. ""They should have gotten some concession from Japan on the issues and also made the process public,"" said Moon, a former national security adviser to the administration of former president, Roh Moo-hyun. Other observers have argued in favor of the deal, noting the present threat to both countries from the secretive North Korean regime. ""The treaty was inevitable given the current trend in northeast Asia including that of China's growing influence and its ties with North Korea,"" said Kim Tae-woo, the head of Korean Institute for National Unification. ""South Korea is good with human intelligence, while Japan has an upper hand in technology intelligence,"" said Kim, who is also a former vice president of the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. ""The two nations are likely to cooperate when it comes to the North Korean threat."" South Korea has already signed similar treaties with 23 other countries, including the United States and Russia, according to the South Korean Foreign Ministry. And Seoul and Tokyo have deep and long-established economic ties. As of 2011, Japan and South Korea were each others' third largest trading partners, according to Korea International Trade Association. Some South Koreans said they thought it was time for Seoul and Tokyo to move on from the past. ""For the sake of the interest of the country, we need to put historical factors behind us,"" said Park Sung-kwon, who works for a construction company in Seoul. ""I support the deal.""","The planned treaty has revived memories of Japan's occupation of Korea .

"(CNN)A substance described as ""white stuff"" and ""milky rain"" is covering parts of Washington and Oregon states, but  its origin is a mystery. ""We have received reports of 'white stuff' on vehicles. The ash is more than likely from the Volcano Shiveluch,""  Washington state's Walla Walla County Emergency officials said in statement. The volcano, located on the Kamchatka peninsula in extreme northeast Russia, ""spewed an ash plume to about the 20,000-foot level in late January,"" the agency says. ""It has been deposited in a widespread area, including Washington and Oregon."" But in an updated post, emergency officials say it could be as a result of various reasons. ""While the substance is likely ash is from Volcano Shiveluch, they are a number of volcanoes that are currently active,"" they say. ""The source of the material has not been scientifically confirmed."" And the ash may be from another part of the world. ""The strong southerly flow from the jet stream could have brought it from an active volcano in southwest Colima, Mexico. But if we go farther west towards eastern Russia, there's another active volcano there,"" says CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam. The Mexican volcano is near Guadalajara and erupted Wednesday. The distances between the volcanoes and the Washington/Oregon areas are staggering -- the Russian volcano is 4,000 miles away and the volcano in Mexico is more than 2,000 miles away. But there are some other theories floating around. ""We have heard a few theories thus far including; volcanic ash from Mexico or Russia, dust picked up from last night's strong winds, or perhaps ash from last year's wildfires over SE Oregon/SW Idaho. We still don't have a definitive answer,"" the U.S. National Weather Service in Spokane posted on its Facebook page -- along with a picture of what it called ""milky rain"" collected from its rain gauge. Van Dam says the only way to be sure is to conduct scientific testing on the substance. Its chemical makeup would be the best clue to solving the mystery.","Emergency officials say it could be coming from Russia or Mexico .

"The U.S. is not returning combat troops to Iraq, President Barack Obama insisted again Wednesday, despite the suggestion by his top general that option is something the Pentagon could consider. Speaking at U.S. Central Command in Florida, Obama said again that U.S. troops ""do not and will not have a combat mission"" in Iraq against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""After a decade of massive ground deployments, it is more effective to use our unique capabilities in support of partners on the ground so they can secure their own countries' futures,"" he said. ""And that's the only solution that will succeed over the long term."" ""As your commander in chief, I will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in Iraq,"" Obama told troops at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa. Rather, the U.S. forces will support Iraqi forces on the ground as the Iraqis fight ISIS, he said. ""When we do things alone and the countries -- the people of those countries -- aren't doing it for themselves, as soon as we leave, we start getting the same problems,"" Obama said. Kerry: 'We will have enough allies' Obama's position was reiterated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, who testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the administration's plan to defeat ISIS, the terror group that refers to itself as the Islamic State. Kerry also told the senators that a number of countries have agreed to contribute to the fight against the militants. Asked whether any of the nations agreed to put boots on the ground to fight ISIS, Kerry said no. However, Kerry confirmed that some of the countries have committed to carrying out airstrikes. He did not publicly identify the countries. ""We will have enough allies"" for the military action needed to fight ISIS, he said. Kerry's testimony before the Senate committee came at the same time the House approved Obama's request to arm and train Syrian rebels to fight ISIS. The vote was 273 -156, with significant opposition to the proposal in both parties. The proposal would authorize the Pentagon to provide assistance to ""appropriately vetted"" members of the Syrian opposition and require the administration to give Congress a detailed plan for helping the rebels before that assistance could begin. The Senate vote on the proposal could come as early as Thursday. During the sometimes contentious Senate committee hearing, which broke mainly on partisan lines, Kerry defended the U.S. policy,  saying he did not want to ""rehash"" debates about the Gulf War and the Iraq War. ""The issue that confronts us today is one which (all should) be able to agree -- ISIL must be defeated. Period. End of Story,"" he said. ISIS is also known as ISIL. What that fight will look like is still in question. Iraq Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told The Associated Press on Wednesday that foreign troops are ""out of the question."" ""The only contribution the American forces or the international coalition is going to help us with is from the sky,"" al-Abadi told The AP. ""We are not giving any blank check to the international coalition to hit any target in Iraq."" Gen. Martin Dempsey's recommendation . The Prime Minister's remarks came a day after Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told members of Congress he hasn't ruled out recommending U.S. ground forces deploy to attack ISIS targets if the current air campaign in Iraq fails. ""To be clear, if we reach the point where I believe our advisers should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets, I will recommend that to the President,"" Dempsey said. Top U.S. military officer: U.S. ground troops to fight ISIS, if necessary . The hypothetical remark, which sources say was vetted by the White House beforehand, managed to undercut what Obama and his aides have been promising for weeks: that combat troops were out of the question for Iraq. The crossed wires come after a concerted White House effort to spell out a plan against ISIS terrorists, which itself was a response to the President's frank admission late last month that he lacked a ""strategy"" for dealing with ISIS in Syria. The vow to keep U.S. troops out of combat extends as far back as Obama's presidential campaigns, which were run first on the promise to end the Iraq War, and four years later on the assurance that that era of American warfare was over. While three-quarters of Americans support airstrikes in Syria and Iraq, a majority still oppose any combat ""boots-on-the-ground"" scenario. Obama: training and intelligence-gathering only . When Obama addressed the nation last week, he made clear the American military advisers being deployed in Iraq ""will not have a combat mission"" and would act in a training and intelligence-gathering capacity only. ""We will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq,"" he said in the remarks on September 10. Officials are adamant that possibility remains out of the question and say Dempsey's suggestion was using a hypothetical situation -- a practice rarely seen at the message-driven White House. Opinion: What an anti-ISIS strategy should look like . While Dempsey could recommend deploying U.S. combat forces to Obama, the President will ultimately make military decisions himself. ""It's the responsibility of the President's military advisers to plan and consider all the wide range of contingencies,"" press secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. ""It's also the responsibility of the commander in chief to set out a clear policy. And the President has been clear about what that policy is."" A spokesman for Dempsey, Col. Ed Thomas, said the Joint Chiefs chairman ""doesn't believe there is a military requirement for our advisers to accompany Iraqi forces into combat."" ""The context of this discussion was focused on how our forces advise the Iraqis and was not a discussion of employing US ground combat units in Iraq,"" he wrote in a statement. Strategy questions . Tuesday isn't the first time the White House's aim for clarity has fallen short. Obama's frank admission late last month the United States lacked a ""strategy"" for combating ISIS in Syria drew sharp criticism, leading to his eventual prime-time address announcing the potential for airstrikes in the country. The goals cited by the administration in battling ISIS have similarly drawn some confusion, going from reducing the force to a ""manageable problem"" to ""degrading and ultimately destroying"" the terrorists. Opponents of the President quickly accused the administration of muddying the message. ""First of all, the President is just flat not telling the truth,"" Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, said on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" ""We already have boots on the ground there. He knows we have to have boots on the ground. Let's admit we're in a war.""","House approves Obama's request to train and arm Syrian rebels to fight ISIS .

"In the Dominican Republic, a ban on abortion is preventing a teenage girl from receiving treatment for a life-threatening disease. At the Semma Hospital in the captial city of Santo Domingo, a 16-year-old girl is dying of acute leukemia. Doctors say the girl, whose name is being withheld to protect her privacy, needs an aggressive chemotherapy treatment. But there's one problem: the teenager is nine weeks pregnant and treatment would very likely terminate the pregnancy, a violation of Dominican anti-abortion laws. Rosa Hernandez, the girl's mother, is trying to convince doctors and the Dominican government to make an exception so that her daughter's life can be saved.  ""My daughter's life is first.  I know that [abortion] is a sin and that it goes against the law ... but my daughter's health is first,"" Hernandez said. According to Article 37 of the Dominican constitution, ""the right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death.""  Dominican courts have interpreted this as a strict mandate against abortion.  Article 37, passed in 2009, also abolished the death penalty. Turkish women rally against plans to restrict access to abortion . Miguel Montalvo, the director of the bioethics council that rules on the application of the law, says the council is leaning toward allowing the treatment.  ""At the end of the day the patient may decide for himself or herself.  In this case, the family may decide what's more convenient for the patient,"" Montalvo said. Women's and human rights groups are outraged, saying the girl should have received chemotherapy immediately. Lilliam Fondeur, a women's rights activist, complains that conservative politics is preventing necessary treatment to save the teenager's life. ""How can it be possible that so much time is being wasted?  That the treatment hasn't begun yet because they're still meeting, trying to decide if she has the right to receive the treatment to save her life -- that's unacceptable,"" Fondeur said. Some Dominican opposition lawmakers say there should be a new debate over the abortion ban in the Caribbean country and the problems created by the constitutional ban go beyond this case.  Opinion leaders like former representative Victor Terrero say clandestine abortions are also putting the lives of many women at risk. ""The constitution is going to have to be modified sooner rather than later,"" Terrero said. ""We cannot allow under any circumstances that pregnancies that present complications for women be permitted to continue as normal."" Bautista Rojas Gomez, the Dominican minister of health, has publicly indicated he favors chemotherapy over protecting the pregnancy, but doctors are still reluctant to act for fear of prosecution. Pelegrin Castillo, one of the architects of Article 37, says the constitutional ban does not prevent doctors from administering the treatment.  It does, however, prevent them from practicing an abortion in order to treat the patient with chemotherapy. ""It's an artificial debate,"" Castillo said.  ""What we have clearly said is that in this case doctors are authorized by the constitution to treat the patient.  They don't have to worry about anything.  They have the mandate of protecting both lives."" And while the debate rages on around the country, back at the hospital the clock keeps ticking for the 16-year-old pregnant girl. Activists allege forced abortions, sterilizations in China .","A 16-year-old girl with leukemia hasn't received treatment because she's pregnant .

"Often, artists create work with a view to immortality; if they can't live on, perhaps their creations can. Danae Stratou, on the other hand, knows one of her seminal pieces has a death sentence. In 1997, she joined with industrial designer Alexandra Stratou and architect Stella Constantinides to create a breathtaking spiral made up of alternating conical dips and protrusions in the Sahara Desert, near the Egyptian town of El Gouna just off the Red Sea. The project, known as Desert Breath, spreads over one million square feet of sand. While the installation is still visible from the sky, there are marked signs of weathering. A body of water that once acted as the work's center point has since evaporated. The earthen mounds have flattened over time, and cracks can be seen on the overall surface of the piece. For the artists (known collectively as D.A.ST. Arteam), Desert Breath's impending demise is the whole point. ""Through its slow disintegration, it's become an instrument to measure the passage of time,"" says Stratou. And as time has gone on, she adds, she finds she enjoys the piece more and more. ""The more time passes, the more it becomes fragile, but it also has developed a more organic relationship with the site. When it was just made, you could feel the connection to the shape, but now, it looks like it wasn't made by human beings at all, and this is something we like a lot."" In fact, to many users of Google Earth, the site doesn't look man made. Before knowing what it was, several commenters speculated it was anything from the imprint of an alien spaceship to the gateway to a parallel universe. A recent discussion on the Google Earth forum led to the work's rediscovery, almost 17 years to the day after it was first built. ""It's surprising that so many years later it would get all this attention, but on the other hand, sometimes things find their own moment,"" Stratou speculates. ""Perhaps people can appreciate this kind of thing more now than they could back then, when they were caught up in making money or being famous. Today, we're in a financial crisis, and perhaps Desert Breath reflects a new humility people feel, or a new need to connect to nature."" D.A.ST. Arteam spent nine months constructing the work, with the help of a local construction crew who donated the tools and manpower to build the site. ""I was totally cut off from Western civilization -- though I found that a positive thing. It was a huge change in the life I had led up until then. I woke up at four every morning and worked on the site through to sunset. There weren't mobile phones back then, so I couldn't even speak to my family in Greece,"" she recalls. There were times when it seemed the shelf life for the installation would be cut short. In the early stages of construction, the town of El Gouna experienced the worst floods it had seen in 60 years. Five years after it was completed, the government decided to build a new road that cut through the site. ""We had to go back and negotiate with the governor, who nicely agreed to take the road back a few meters. For me, it just showed that the biggest danger is people. I think people are more likely to destroy it than nature itself.""","Google Earth users delved into a range of theories to explain giant spiral in Egypt .

"Political tensions flared Wednesday after more than 70 people were killed when fans rushed the field and rioted at a soccer game in Egypt. It was unclear whether intense sports rivalries or political strife caused the clashes in the northeastern city of Port Said. Hours after the fighting, protesters in Cairo chanted, ""Down with military rule."" And the secretary-general of the Muslim Brotherhood party blamed Egypt's military for the deaths. Egypt's interior ministry blamed fans for provoking police. A committee will investigate the circumstances surrounding the fighting, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said in a statement early Thursday. The clashes left at least 74 dead, Egypt's health ministry said in a statement. At least 1,000 people were injured, 150 of them critically, ministry spokesman Dr. Hisham Shiha said. Most of the injured had concussions and deep cuts, he said. The fighting occurred in a stadium in Port Said after the home Al-Masry team beat Cairo's Al-Ahly team 3-1. Fans from both sides bashed each other with rocks and chairs, said Mohamed Sultan, head of the ambulance association in Port Said. Many of those who died fell from bleachers inside the stadium, according to Ahmed Saeed, an official from the Port Said governor's office. Others suffocated, said Al-Ahly fan Amr Khamis, who returned to Cairo early Thursday with his head bandaged after an Al-Masry fan beat him with a wooden stick. ""The police opened the gates separating us from the Masry fans and their hooligans attack us with everything: rocks, glass bottles, knives, swords. Some had guns. ... How did the police allow them with these weapons into the bleachers?"" he said. Authorities contributed to escalating violence, said Mamdouh Eid, the executive manager of the Al-Ahly fans committee. ""The police stood there watching, and the ambulances arrived late. I carried several dead fans in my arms,"" he said. Tension was building throughout the game, Eid said, as Port Said fans threw bottles and rocks at players. ""There were organized groups in the crowds that purposely provoked the police all through the match and escalated the violence and stormed onto the field after the final whistle,"" said Gen. Marwan Mustapha of Egypt's interior ministry. ""Our policemen tried to contain them, but not engage."" At least 47 people were arrested after the clashes, he said. The interior ministry and the military were not responsible for what happened, Gen. Ismail Osman, a member of Egypt's military council, told Mehwar TV. ""Security is lacking now more than ever before. The government must be more stringent,"" he said. Many Al-Ahly fans were trapped in the bleachers during Wednesday's fighting, Eid said, because police did not open gates that would have allowed them to exit the stadium. ""Some fell off bleachers, others suffocated, and many were beaten to death and stabbed by knives,"" Eid said. When the clashes broke out, about 22,000 people were inside the stadium, which can hold up to 25,000 people. About 2,000 Al-Ahly fans were at the game, he said. Authorities have been dispatched to hospitals to interview the wounded and investigate, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for Egypt's general prosecutor. Egypt's military deployed two planes to transport the Al-Ahly team, some of its fans and some of the injured back to Cairo, he said. Thousands of demonstrators met a train carrying injured Al-Ahly fans returning to Cairo early Thursday. Some demonstrators climbed on top of the train as injured fans were carried out. Port Said is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) northeast of Cairo. Outside the Al-Ahly club's headquarters, angry fans vowed revenge. ""This is a plot to stir violence in Egypt. Why would a winning team attack others ... and kill them? We will not let this one go,"" Al-Ahly fan Ahmed Tabaei said. Protesters outside the club chanted, ""Down with military rule; leave it to civilian rule."" The head of Egypt's military ruling council declared three days of national mourning, starting Thursday, and said those behind the clashes would be punished. ""This period, I assure you, will be peaceful. Egypt will be stable again. The military council is executing a road map to transfer the authority to an elected civilian entity. ... Whoever has any plot against Egypt will not succeed,"" Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi said in a statement released to Egyptian media. The Muslim Brotherhood condemned the violence and said authorities had failed to protect citizens. ""It's a security vacuum in the whole country that has led to armed robberies on banks and random killings. Some have threatened rebellion against the parliament and threatened the youth of the Muslim Brotherhood ... which may indicate that some police officers may be punishing the citizens for causing a revolution,"" the party said in a statement. While authorities were responding to the fighting in Port Said, a fire broke out during a match in a Cairo stadium. It was not immediately clear whether the incidents were related. Lawmakers were scheduled to discuss the situation in an emergency session of Egypt's parliament Thursday. Sepp Blatter, president of the sport's international governing body, FIFA, said he was ""very shocked and saddened"" by the events. ""This is a black day for football. Such a catastrophic situation is unimaginable and should not happen,"" Blatter said in a statement. The large death toll from the fighting is unprecedented in Egyptian soccer, CNN contributor James Montague said. ""It's not unheard-of to have organized violence between football clubs (in Egypt), but something on this scale has never been seen before,"" said Montague, who researched soccer in the Middle East for his book ""When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone."" During Egypt's revolution, well-organized groups of soccer fans became a powerful force for political change, he said. Soccer was also closely tied with former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's government, which used the sport to boost his popularity, Montague said. But it was unclear whether political fury fueled Wednesday's clashes. ""There's been a security vacuum, so we don't know whether it's that or whether there's a Mubarak element to it. We just don't know at the moment,"" Montague said.","A committee will investigate circumstances surrounding the fighting .

"(CNN)The University of Virginia and its campus police department are investigating a new report of a sexual assault in a campus residence as the college community struggles with how to move forward and improve its sexual assault policies after coming under national scrutiny. It's the first report of a sexual assault on campus since the controversial and widely questioned Rolling Stone article, published in October, that depicted the brutal gang rape of a woman named Jackie. It's also the only reported sexual assault in the university police public reports since the start of this 2014-2015 school year, according to a CNN review of records on its website. There are few details about this newest case.  A statement sent to students on Thursday said police were notified by the Dean of Students ""about a sexual assault incident reported to have occurred on January 30, 2015, in a residence hall on-Grounds.""  The notice said police were notified on February 5, six days after the incident. Before the uproar over the Rolling Stone story, UVA policy allowed student victims to decide whether or not police were contacted after a sexual assault. Since then, the university mandated a ""zero-tolerance"" policy, which has yet to be defined; it's unclear if the alleged victim in the latest assault participated in reporting it to police. University officials would not comment on those questions. This all comes as the university is trying to move forward from the fallout of the Rolling Stone piece. The story of Jackie has been questioned and has prompted several investigations -- a police investigation, an internal review at UVA, and a Columbia Journalism Review of Rolling Stone's reporting process. A lot is still unknown. Here's what we do and don't know: . What we know: Some of the details in the story are not true. Charlottesville police informed the university at the start of the spring semester that its investigation has found no evidence that the brutal gang rape happened at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, as the Rolling Stone story alleged. However, the police have not ruled out that Jackie was raped -- possibly even gang raped, somewhere else, perhaps on a different day. The investigation is ongoing, and police aren't releasing any other details of what they've found. CNN talked to several of Jackie's friends who were with her the night she says she was allegedly attacked, and according to them, she told a different version of what happened that night. In the article, Jackie said she was gang-raped by seven men while two men looked on. Her friends said Jackie told them she was forced to give oral sex to five men. Jackie's Rolling Stone version said the perpetrator was a man she met at her job at the university pool. She told her friends it was someone she met in her chemistry class. She told her friends the assailant's name, but no one by the name she gave attended the University of Virginia, nor could anyone by that name be located in a database search across the United States. What we don't know: We don't know how much of the rest of the Rolling Stone story, including Jackie's account, was correct. Jackie has not talked to any member of the media since Rolling Stone issued an apology for its reporting, and the writer of the story has not spoken publicly since the apology, either. Columbia Journalism Review is now fact-checking all of the details at the request of Rolling Stone. What we know: Some of the details in the Rolling Stone story that deal with the broader issue of how sexual assault reports are handled at UVA have been confirmed. For example, the university has admitted that it never expelled a single student for committing sexual assault, even when the student admitted it. The law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP is now looking into how the university has historically handled sex assault claims. Even before the Rolling Stone story, UVA was the subject of a Title IX lawsuit filed by a woman who said she was drugged and raped by a fellow student, and that the university medical center lost some of the evidence, that a nurse didn't tell the truth about the woman's injuries, and that a school administrator shared confidential information. In May 2014, the Department of Education for Civil Rights announced that it was investigating 55 schools, including UVA, for possible violations related to how it handles sex abuse claims. What we know: Part of the independent investigation by O'Melveny & Myers is looking at how UVA responded specifically to Jackie's astonishing accusations against members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. According to Rolling Stone, Jackie first reported her allegations to the university in the spring of 2013, months after the alleged assault happened. The university did not call police because Jackie did not want the police involved, Rolling Stone reported. However, many people on campus were well aware of Jackie's shocking allegations. Several people present at the annual ""Take Back the Night"" awareness event listened as Jackie took to a podium and told her story to a crowd of hundreds in 2014. The police were not called until the account was published in Rolling Stone in November, causing national scrutiny and outrage. What we don't know: It's unclear if police were aware in detail of the allegations before the Rolling Stone story was published. The fraternity Phi Kappa Psi expressed concern to police after members began to field questions from Rolling Stone about the allegation of a gang rape. It's unclear exactly why that did not turn into a full police investigation. UVA officials were also involved in that conversation, Phi Psi said. After being suspended for the rest of the fall semester, the fraternities were allowed to come back in the spring as long as they signed a new operating agreement which mandates sober fraternity brothers at parties, bans the serving of pre-mixed drinks, requires the use of guards at staircases, and other safety measures. This created some tension. Phi Psi was the first to sign the new agreement, but two other fraternities accused the university of ""bullying"" them into signing it. Then, days later, some sorority members were appalled to learn that their national chapters banned them from attending any fraternity bid night activities on Saturday, January 31, one of the biggest celebrations of the year in campus Greek life. From outside Charlottesville, the University of Virginia appears to be a campus in turmoil, struggling with how to move on from allegations that sexual assaults are rampant. But on campus many student leaders, like Student Council President Jalen Ross, agree that some of that discourse is good -- it will help them come up with the best plans for moving forward. But Ross also told CNN he's concerned with the level of involvement the national fraternity and sorority organizations have had, and cautions that they do not speak for students on campus.​ . It's clear from talking to students at UVA that many of them still see some merit to the criticisms of how the university handles sexual assault allegations. Many also believe that something bad may have happened to Jackie, although they are skeptical of the details in the Rolling Stone story. Most students got back from winter break and returned to normal life at school. Behind the scenes, leaders are working on new ways to tackle binge drinking and general campus safety. The university just adopted an ambassador program which provides sober escorts over the age of 21 for any student who needs help getting home. The ""zero tolerance policy"" pledged after the Rolling Stone story has yet to be defined, and some advocates are worried that it will have a chilling effect on reporting of sexual assault. Ross said he's been working with state legislators who have proposed mandatory reporting, to make sure that any new proposals also don't discourage women from coming forward.","Police not ruling out that ""Jackie"" was raped .

"(CNN)Police in a patrol car chase down a man on a scooter. The car stops, and two officers get out and beat the man with their fists and batons. His orbital bone fractures and he suffers lacerations on his head, yet he is the one who is charged with aggravated assault. This week, the tables turned when a surveillance video from a nearby store led to charges of aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and filing false reports against Philadelphia police officers Sean McKnight and Kevin Robinson in connection with the May 29, 2013, arrest of Najee Rivera. ""I will prosecute these two officers to the fullest extent of the law. Simply put, no one -- not even police officers -- is above the law,"" said District Attorney Seth Williams. Rivera's girlfriend  tracked down the surveillance tape, according to CNN Affiliate WPVI, and it became key evidence in a grand jury investigation, in which Rivera testified that he got scared and drove away on his scooter after McKnight and Robinson pulled him over, stepped out of their car with batons extended and said, ""Come here!"" What happened next was captured on the surveillance video and contradicts the original police report claim that Rivera grabbed Robinson and ""slammed him against a brick wall."" It also accuses Rivera of ""throwing elbows during the struggle."" The grand jury found, however, that Rivera was wailing loudly and showed no aggressive actions as he was lying on the ground and being struck repeatedly by the officers. ""The video undermined every aspect of the officer's account,"" said Williams. Coming soon: An app to report police brutality . Rivera, 23, was cleared of all charges and has been awarded a $200,000 settlement for pain and suffering. Rivera is very satisfied with the charges against the officers, according to his lawyer, Leon Flynn, who spoke to CNN affiliate WPVI. ""How can I get beat up, but there were no consequences for the people who did this to me?"" was a question Rivera asked repeatedly, Flynn said. Officers McKnight and Robinson have been suspended for 30 days with intent to be dismissed from the police force. Robinson's attorney, Fortunato N. Perri Jr., said in a statement that his client ""has been a well-respected and dedicated member of the Philadelphia police department for the past seven years. He looks forward to clearing his name."" ""We look forward to trial,"" said McKnight's attorney, Brian McMonagle. He called his client a ""good cop.' ""When suspects flee they create risks for themselves, for the public, and for the officers who bravely pursue them,"" he said. The officers are not getting any sympathy from the police department, however. ""It is painful, it is embarrassing,"" Chief Charles Ramsey told reporters this week. ""We have 6,500 sworn members.

""We need residents to take extra precautions as we prepare for another storm and extremely low temperatures,"" he said in a statement. Flurries and light snow are expected to fall in Boston on Saturday evening, turning into heavy snow Sunday night through Monday. Two brutal storms hit the Northeast just last week, closing airports, canceling classes and creating piles of snow along cleared roadways. ""I'm tired of it,"" said Boston University freshman Cameron Barkan, who's already missed three days of class because of the storms. ""I usually like snow, but this is just a little much,"" he said. Boston set a record for the snowiest seven-day period in history with over 40 inches, according to the NWS. The city is way past its average annual snowfall of 47 inches. Track the storm .

"(CNN)San Francisco General Hospital will soon have a new name and a new face -- thanks to Facebook. Specifically, it's thanks to the social media giant's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan. The San Francisco General Hospital Foundation says the couple's $75 million gift is ""believed to be the largest single private gift from individuals to a public hospital in the United States. It's not just a substantial gift, but a personal one. Chan worked for years at the facility -- the Bay Area city's lone trauma center -- during her pediatric residency. She came away struck by the importance of San Francisco's main ""safety net"" hospital (where more than 70% of patients are underinsured or uninsured), as well as impressed by those who work there. ""Day in and day out, I witness the compassion and dedication of my colleagues as they work tirelessly to deliver the best available care to all of our patients,"" Chan said in a statement released Friday through the foundation. ""Mark and I are proud to support such an important public hospital. The General, as it's known, is in the process of a ""rebuild"" to create a nine-story, 453,000-square foot main hospital and new trauma center. It's scheduled to open in December. Zuckerberg, posting (of course) on Facebook, said that ""our contribution ... will allow The General to double the size of its new Emergency Room and quadruple the number of beds, and provide state of the art equipment for healthcare providers and first responders."" ""We are so fortunate that our work in connecting the world through Facebook has given us the ability to give back to our local community, our country and the world -- and to work to improve education, health care and internet access for everyone,"" he said. ""To serve our community in San Francisco, we can think of no better place to focus than The General."" In light of the pledge, the city has started the process of officially naming the facility Priscilla and Mark Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, according to the foundation. It's not common that someone, especially one going through the rigors of residency, pays back their employer rather than gets paid. Chan and Zuckerberg are in a position to break from the norm. Forbes reported last fall that Zuckerberg, 30, had a net worth of $34 billion. So the hospital donation will hardly set him back much. Still, it fits a pattern of generosity by he and his wife, who the Chronicle of Philanthropy reports pledged $6.2 billion -- more than anyone else -- in 2013 alone. Even with her husband's wealth, Chan hasn't stopped working. The Braintree, Massachusetts, native met Zuckerberg at Harvard University, where both were students. They were a couple for years before getting married in 2012. This happened days after Chan's graduation from the University of California, San Francisco, medical school. Her Facebook profile says that she went on to work at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. During a 2012 interview with ABC News, Zuckerberg said that Chan's work comes up regularly -- just like his does. ""She's going to be a pediatrician,"" he said then, ""so our dinner conversations are often about Facebook and the kids that she's meeting."" No doubt such discussions fed into their donation to San Francisco General. While the couple now calls nearby Palo Alto home, they have long and deep ties to San Francisco. And, as Zuckerberg said Friday, ""We hope this contribution alongside the great work of other contributors, will help The General to continue to save lives and deliver care to everyone who needs it.""","Facility will become Priscilla and Mark Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)Rand Paul kicked off his first event in Iowa this year with a rally that let him blaze through his favorite libertarian-leaning talking points and draw a contrast between himself and his potential Republican rivals. ""You're going to get a choice on who the nominee is for the Republican Party. You're going to have 9, 10, 15, 20 who are eager to go and want troops on the ground,"" he said, talking about the war against Islamic extremism. ""They want 100,000 troops on the ground. Right now. In all the countries."" The Kentucky Republican had a rough week but found a friendly audience Friday night headlining an ""Audit the Fed"" rally at Jasper Winery in Des Moines, an event packed with many of his father's supporters and hosted by a group called Liberty Iowa. It was a curious strategy for a man who's trying to build a broad coalition of voters behind him, but he assured supporters that he hasn't strayed far from his roots. ""Some of you may remember I sued the President,"" he said, pointing to a lawsuit he launched last year against the National Security Agency over its bulk metadata collection effort. He didn't, however, mention that the lawsuit has been put on hold, or that he voted against a reform package in Congress last year because he felt it didn't go far enough in tweaking the agency. Paul, who faced criticism this week over comments expressing doubt about the effectiveness of vaccinations and took heat over drama involving one of his advisers, is in Iowa on a quick two-day swing that puts him in front of familiar audiences. Following the ""Audit the Fed"" rally Friday night, he attends the Iowa State University men's basketball game Saturday, as well as a watch party with young voters and a meet-and-greet with freshman Rep. Rod Blum. Paul is one of many Republicans who will barnstorm the state in the coming months, seeking support ahead of Iowa's first-in-the-nation presidential nominating contest a year from now.  While it's his first time in the state this year, Paul visited Iowa five times last cycle, and has indicated he plans to make the state a big part of his 2016 strategy. His father, ex-Texas Rep. Ron Paul, built a solid foundation of supporters in Iowa during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, a base that Paul is trying to court while also making inroads with the mainstream and socially conservative Republicans in the state. A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll earlier this week showed Paul in second place at 14% support among likely Republican caucus goers,  behind Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker at 15%. Along with repeating familiar refrains that hammer Obamacare and the President's executive action on immigration, Paul brandished his anti-war credentials. He sought to remind the audience that he caused headaches in the Senate in December by forcing a vote that would declare war against ISIS, but stressed that he voted no. ""I said we have to debate this. And they -- can I say bitched and moaned? They bitched and moaned and were so unhappy with me that I brought that up. But we made a vote,"" he said. ""Every time we've toppled a secular dictator, we've gotten chaos and we've gotten a rise in radical Islam, and we've been less safe,"" he added. Paul, attempting to balance his anti-government persona with his efforts to appear bipartisan, pointed out that he's still been ""willing to work with the President"" on criminal justice reform, noting that the same day he sued the administration, Paul sat down for lunch with Attorney General Eric Holder. ""He looks at me and says, 'I see you're suing me and the President today.' I said, 'Well, you know, we can still be friends right?' "" Paul offered some rare praise for Holder, saying at the end he ""did some good things on criminal justice,"" but warned that he may be replaced by current nominee Loretta Lynch, saying she's not strong enough on reforming civil forfeiture. The main thrust of the event was rallying support behind his new legislation to audit the Federal Reserve. It is already audited by a third-party accounting firm arranged through the inspector general and partially by the Government Accountability Office, but Paul's bill would give full auditing power to the GAO and would require regular reports to Congress. ""Is there a revolving door between Wall Street, the fed, and back to Wall Street again?"" Paul asked, twirling his arm in the air. The bill last year passed the GOP-controlled House with bipartisan support but was blocked by the Democratic-led Senate. Critics, including Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, have vowed to aggressively fight such efforts. Emboldened by the new Republican Congress, however, Paul feels that the legislation has a better shot at breaking through and making it to the President's desk. ""I think there needs to be some sunshine. I'm going to fight 'em and we're going to get a vote on Audit the Fed,"" he said to applause.","Rand Paul makes first 2015 trip to Iowa, home of first presidential caucuses .

"(CNN)The HIV/AIDS epidemic might not make as many headlines as it used to, but it continues to infect tens of thousands in our country each year. And, unfortunately, some groups in the United States are being affected at the kinds of rates you would expect to see in hard-hit developing countries. National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, being marked Saturday, is a good moment to reignite the conversation over a crisis that should have ended years ago. Despite representing only 13% of the U.S. population, African-Americans account for nearly half of all new HIV infections each year. True, the impact of HIV varies across the black community -- HIV infection rates have declined among injection drug users, black women, and black infants born to seropositive mothers. And new HIV infections among black heterosexual men are stable. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recorded a troubling spike in new HIV infections among black gay and bisexual men. Black gay men have been the only black population in which new HIV cases have been growing since 2001. Indeed, the CDC estimates that one in three black gay men in major U.S. cities is HIV positive. HIV deaths among African-Americans drop 18%, CDC says . Meanwhile, although HIV rates have declined among black women and black injection drug users, there are regions of the country where mortality among HIV-positive black women exceed other populations, while viral suppression, a goal of HIV medication that limits transmissibility to others and often ensures a long and healthy life, continues to remain elusive for many injection drug users. A common misconception about the higher prevalence of HIV among black people is that it is caused by engaging in more risk-associated behaviors. Several studies demonstrate that black Americans do not necessarily engage in more high-risk behaviors than others. So why are black communities typically disproportionately affected? A new report released by the Foundation for AIDS Research tries to shed some light on this issue, and why the disparities have deepened over time. A close examination of the epidemic within the black population is important because it will mean that we are better equipped to fight HIV/AIDS in America through better understanding how racial discrimination, poverty, lack of access to health care and other socioeconomic factors contribute to the disproportionate burden of HIV among Black Americans. Given the fact that a substantial number of black Americans are uninsured or underinsured, the Affordable Care Act has been a crucial policy development for black Americans living with or at risk for HIV. Historically, many people with HIV were barred from accessing health care services. Now, health insurance programs expanded under the ACA are prohibited from denying coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions. Further, certain preventive services, such as routine HIV screening, must be provided at no cost to the beneficiary.  And all plans must provide treatment. This is especially beneficial is tackling the problem as early HIV treatment has been found to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to other partners by 96 percent. But obstacles remain in delivering health care to black Americans with HIV. For example, an essential tool to fight HIV and racial health disparities is Medicaid, the single largest source of coverage for people with HIV in the United States. However, a Supreme Court decision ruled that Medicaid expansion under the ACA can only be available to uninsured people living in states that choose to implement it. Unfortunately, about 20 states have opted out. In these states, an estimated 8.5 million uninsured Americans who would have qualified for full Medicaid coverage will most likely remain uninsured. Black Americans living in those states are twice as likely to be uninsured and more than six times as likely to have HIV. This is most notably the case in the Deep South, where nine states with high rates of HIV/AIDS diagnoses have opted not to expand Medicaid. Focusing on populations at highest risk for HIV -- especially black gay men -- must also be a priority. ""When new infections among young black gay men increase by nearly 50 percent in three years, we need to show more that their lives matter,"" said President Barack Obama during a World AIDS Day address in 2011. This mandate was heard, and notable efforts are now underway across various federal agencies to better address HIV among black gay men. One encouraging sign has been the way the private sector has responded. For example, a multi-million dollar initiative was just announced by ViiV Healthcare to address the HIV epidemic among black gay and other men who have sex with men in Baltimore, Maryland, and Jackson, Mississippi, two U.S. cities hit hard by HIV/AIDS. But more must be done. One thing that should be the focus of policymakers is ensuring that we prioritize and dedicate resources to boost treatment and prevention programs targeting black gay men, and improve care for HIV-positive black women and injection drug users . We should also expand our education and awareness initiatives to diminish the stigma and discrimination that prevent too many people from seeking HIV testing, prevention and treatment services. And finally, we can do more to ensure proper access to health care for millions of Americans living in poverty and deliver essential care to people with HIV, and help prevent its spread. Closing the gap on racial disparities in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States will require that we confront the underlying factors that fuel the epidemic among black Americans and tackle them head-on, with the urgency they deserve.","Saturday is National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day in the United States .

"(CNN)It's a wild, wet West. Mysterious filth rained down on Walla Walla, Washington. Gales knocked trees down -- and power out -- in Northern California. And then they whirred over Nevada's mountains with hurricane force. More rain is on the way. A new storm marching in from the Pacific promises to leave a total of nearly 10 inches in spots along the coast between Saturday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. That may cause mild to moderate flooding, particularly around rivers and streams. Already on Friday, some cars got stranded in flooded streets in Washington's Jefferson County, and some residents exited their front doors aboard inflatable boats pulled by rescue crews. The rain is landing on a chronic, deep drought in California, but flooding and mudslides may become a concern. Tens of thousands of households lost power on Friday, and limbs had to be cleared from yards, windshields and roofs. As of Saturday afternoon more than 43,000 customers in Northern California still were without power, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said. The utility said it called in crews from Oregon and Washington to help restore power to customers. An ashy rain dribbled onto Washington and Oregon on Friday, and people rubbed a dusty film off of their cars,  took photos of their fingers and posted them online. They described it as ""white stuff"" or ""milky rain."" Rainwater filling a collector at the NWS in Spokane, Washington, looked like it was pulled from a muddy river. Some postulated what the source of the grime may be, including the weather service. Could the jet stream have tracked it over from the hyperactive Shiveluch volcano in eastern Russia? It pumped volcanic ash 20,000 feet into the sky in late January. The dust settled as far away as the American Northwest. Then again, there are other active volcanoes that could be the source, including one that belched ash on Wednesday in Mexico. Or did winds blow up a different kind of ash from last year's forest fires in Oregon or Idaho? Or was it just dust whipped up by high winds? ""We still don't have a definite answer,"" the service wrote on its Facebook page. The wind gave Slide Mountain in Nevada a raw shaving, whipping over at 134 mph. ""That is equivalent to a weak category 4 hurricane,"" said CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam. Even in the flat lands around Reno, top gusts over 70 mph threatened to fling over garbage cans and garden furniture. The NWS Reno recorded a fast-motion video of an usual cloud formed by the high winds called a lenticular cloud. They appear stationary but are very turbulent and jittery. Van Dam said they are sometimes mistaken for UFOs.","Mysterious filthy rain in Washington and Oregon .

"(CNN)Former Olympic decathlon champion and reality TV star Bruce Jenner was involved in a fatal four-car accident in Southern California on Saturday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. Jenner was driving a black Cadillac SUV that was the third vehicle involved in a multiple read-end collision, Sgt. Philip Brooks of the sheriff's department said. The first vehicle was a black Prius that stopped short, CNN affiliate KCAL reported, citing deputies. Behind it was a white Lexus sedan that also hit its brakes. Jenner's Escalade was towing a trailer with an all-terrain vehicle on it when it ran into the Lexus from behind, Brooks said. The Lexus spun into oncoming traffic and was hit by a Hummer H2. The driver of the Lexus was killed. KCAL reported Jenner's SUV left skid marks. The midday wreck came just after noon on Pacific Coast Highway near Corral Canyon Road, the department said in a news release. The sheriff's department later opened a vehicular manslaughter investigation, a source close to the case told CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos. The investigation will focus on everyone in the case, not just one person, the source said. The sheriff's department said on its Facebook page that the surviving drivers were cooperating with investigators. A deputy said Jenner voluntarily took a field sobriety test, was questioned and went home. No information about the deceased was immediately available. Jenner, 65, was not injured in the crash, publicist Alan Nierob said. Pictures posted by TMZ showed Jenner standing by a damaged car talking with a firefighter. Five children and two adults were taken to the hospital with injuries, authorities said. The sheriff's department is still investigating the cause of the accident, the statement said. The accident occurred on a tricky stretch of the highway, where the road is narrow and twisting. In a bizarre twist to the story, a car later drove through safety barriers around the scene and struck two of the cars from the initial accident, Cmdr. Mike Parker of the sheriff's department tweeted. The driver was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, Parker wrote. Jenner won the 1976 Olympic decathlon with a world record score for the 10-discipline event. He quickly capitalized on his success with Wheaties commercials, appearances and other ventures. He became an actor, appearing in the drama ""CHiPs"" in 1981 and occasionally playing himself on shows such as ""Silver Spoons.""

"Full marks for ingenuity. Some 2,440 Chinese students taking a national exam have been caught using high-tech cheating gear that wouldn't be out of place in a spy film. According to state media, invigilators detected abnormal radio signals that were being used to transmit the answers in code to candidates, who wore wireless ear pieces or placed ""electronic erasers"" on their desks. More than 25,000 students took the exam to become licensed pharmacists in the northwestern city of Xian on October 18 and 19. The test took place in seven separate locations. The organizers of the scam sent fake candidates to take the test, who quickly left after memorizing the questions. They then broadcast the correct answers to candidates, who had paid $330 for the service. Jiang Xueqin, a Beijing-based education consultant, said that China's high-stakes, exam-focused educational system had led to a culture of cheating. ""Most examples are not as flagrant or as stark as this but cheating is widespread because the focus is on getting the certification, not the skills you need in the work place."" Test centers for China's notoriously competitive university entrance exam use metal detectors to clamp down on cheating devices, with security often tighter than at airports, he added. Nor do parents always frown upon such scams. In 2012, when authorities tried to stop cheats in the city of Zhongxiang in Hubei, a riot broke out involving parents angry that their children were being singled out when everyone was cheating. Those caught cheating in the national licensing exam would not be allowed to take the exam again for two years, said Du Fangshuai, head of the provincial examination department.","Some 2,440 Chinese students have been caught using high-tech cheating gear in national exam .

"(CNN) -- A task force of European Union finance ministers was meeting in Brussels Friday to discuss proposed tougher measures intended to prevent another regional crisis on the scale of Greece's economic meltdown. The meeting comes as Germany's parliament voted in favor of a near-trillion dollar eurozone rescue package after German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the future of the common currency was in danger. ""If the euro fails, then Europe too will fail. But if we manage to avert the danger, the euro and Europe will emerge stronger than before,"" Merkel told lawmakers earlier this week to justify the €750 billion rescue package. Both houses of the German parliament approved the package on Friday although its passage through the lower house was backed by just 319 out of 622 lawmakers with 195 abstaining and 73 voting against a measure seen by some as a bailout for other countries at Germany's expense. On Thursday French President Nicolas Sarkozy denied reports of a rift between Paris and Berlin after Germany's unilateral ban imposed earlier this week on the naked short selling of eurozone sovereign debt instruments. Q&A: What is 'naked short-selling'? Following talks with Merkel and new British Prime Minister David Cameron in Paris, Sarkozy said the eurozone's two biggest economies were doing everything possible to work in harmony. ""I told Angela Merkel ... that we cannot have disagreements between Germany and France about subjects of this importance,"" Sarkozy said. ""We do everything so that we don't have disagreements together. That's why we talk together."" Fears over Europe's economic stability have triggered markets selloffs in recent days. New York's Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) fell 376 points on Thursday in its biggest one-day point loss since February 10, 2009. Thursday's point loss was equivalent to 3.6%, the biggest one-day percentage loss since March 5 of 2009. New York markets were mostly flat on Friday with the Dow marginally down. Asian markets followed Wall Street's lead earlier Friday with Tokyo's Nikkei down almost 250 points, or 2.45 percent, at 9,785. European stocks, already down heavily for the week, sank lower in afternoon trading with London's FTSE 100 falling below 5,000 points, before recovering a little, down 0.6 percent at 5,041. Friday's meeting in Brussels has been called by EU President Herman Van Rompuy with the goal of delivering ""economic governance"" reform across the 27-state economic and political bloc by October. ""The recent crises and the risk for the stability of the euro area have underlined the interdependence among EU economies and exposed the vulnerability of Member States, in particular inside the euro area,"" the European Commission said in a memo on Thursday. ""Fiscal discipline, competitiveness gaps and private sector imbalances are also a matter for the EU as a whole. This is why there is a need for economic policy coordination across the EU.""","German parliament votes to approve its share of €750B eurozone bailout .

"Actor Paul Walker, who shot to fame as star of the high-octane street racing franchise ""Fast & Furious,"" died in a fiery car crash in Southern California on Saturday. He was 40. Walker was in the passenger seat of a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT, driven by a racing team partner, that slammed into a light pole and burst into flames in an office park in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood. Walker's publicist Ame van Iden confirmed his death Saturday. The driver, identified by CNN affiliate KCAL-TV as Roger Rodas, also died. ""Thank you all for your condolences and prayers while we mourn the loss of our loved ones,"" read a message posted on the Facebook page for Always Evolving,  the high-performance car shop owned by Rodas. Los Angeles Coroner Investigator Dana Bee told CNN on Sunday it would likely take 48 hours to officially identify the remains taken from the twisted wreckage. The families are gathering dental records for use in the identification, which is necessary because of the condition of the bodies, Bee said. Speed was a factor in the crash, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said.  A 45 mph speed limit sign was attached to the light pole knocked down by the Porsche. The car, which sold for $450,000 when new, is a notoriously difficult vehicle to handle, even for professional drivers, according to Autoweek magazine.  A top driver called it ""scary,"" the magazine reported Sunday.  It is powered by a V-10, 610-hp engine. The wreck took place about 3:30 p.m. just a few hundred yards from the shop owned by Rodas.  Both men had attended a holiday toy drive for Walker's charity, Reach Out Worldwide, hosted at the shop Saturday afternoon. Antonio Holmes told the Santa Clarita Valley Signal newspaper that he was at the charity event when Walker and Rodas left for a ride in the Porsche. ""We all heard from our location,"" Holmes told the Signal. ""It's a little difficult to know what it was. Someone called it in and said it was a vehicle fire. We all ran around and jumped in cars and grabbed fire extinguishers and immediately went to the vehicle. It was engulfed in flames. There was nothing. They were trapped. Employees, friends of the shop. We tried. We tried. We went through fire extinguishers."" A crowd of grieving fans, curious onlookers and media surrounded the crash site for hours, watching as investigators and firefighters worked to extract the bodies from the wreckage.  A memorial of flowers, left by fans, remained on the charred roadside Sunday. Walker and Rodas had planned Saturday as a day to help survivors of victims of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. The car shop website invited customers to the Charity Toy Drive & Automotive Social Gathering. ""During the holiday season, many economically disadvantaged children from around the world are faced with the same dilemma year after year; the lacking of joy and cheer,"" the invitation read. ""Our goal here is to be able to provide aid to these less fortunate children in hopes of helping them grow up to become confident, responsible and productive young adults."" Walker's charity is described as ""a network of professionals with first responder skill-sets who augment local expertise when natural disasters strike in order to accelerate relief efforts."" The website lists Rodas as captain and lead driver of the shop's racing team. Walker is also listed as a team driver. Hollywood left stunned by Walker's death . Walker's generosity . Tales of the actor's philanthropy are not new.  CNN confirmed one story from a decade ago when Walker noticed a young U.S. military veteran shopping with his fiance for a wedding ring in a Santa Barbara jewelry store. ""The groom was just back from duty in Iraq, and he was going to be deployed again soon and wanted to buy a wedding ring, but he said he just could not afford it,"" saleswoman Irene King told CNN.  ""I don't think the soldier realized how expensive those rings are, about $10,000."" Although Walker noticed them, the couple apparently did not know who he was, King said. ""Walker called the manager over and said, 'Put that girl's ring on my tab,' "" she said. ""Walker left all his billing info, and it was a done deal.  The couple was stunned.  She was thrilled and could not believe someone did this."" King called it ""the most generous thing I have ever seen."" Box office success . Walker's career began on the small screen, first with a commercial for Pampers when he was 2, and then with parts in shows such as ""Highway to Heaven"" and ""Touched by an Angel."" His first few movie roles were as supporting characters in teen flicks, most notably in ""Varsity Blues."" His career really took off when he was cast as undercover cop Brian O'Conner infiltrating a street-racing gang in 2001's ""The Fast and the Furious."" The box-office success of the surprise summer hit yielded numerous sequels. And along with Vin Diesel, Walker was one of the franchise stalwarts. At the time of his death, he was working on the seventh film of the franchise, due out next year. Walker wasn't just a car enthusiast on the silver screen; offscreen, the actor competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series. On his verified Twitter account, Walker described himself as ""outdoorsman, ocean addict, adrenaline junkie ... and I do some acting on the side."" Walker also is the star of ""Hours,"" an independent film scheduled to be released December 13 about a father struggling to keep his newborn infant alive in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. Twitter and other social media exploded with reactions to Walker's death. ""Completely numb and saddened to hear of the tragic death of Paul Walker,"" wrote one. Hollywood condolences came from Will Smith, Jack Osbourne, DMX and others. ""No, @RealPaulWalker. No. No. No,"" tweeted actress Alyssa Milano. Walker appeared with her as a guest star in the '80s comedy ""Who's the Boss?"" ""Rest with the angels. You. Sweet boy. #beauty #love #RIP."" Walker is survived by his 15-year-old daughter, Meadow.

"(CNN)A new court will consider whether the convicted murderer at the center of a wildly popular podcast should get a new trial, a Maryland judge has ruled. 'Serial', a podcast spinoff of the radio program ""This American Life,"" concluded its 12-episode series in December that chronicled -- in methodic, cliff-hanging detail -- the case of Adnan Syed, the Baltimore high school student convicted in the slaying of ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee. Lee and Syed were seniors at Woodlawn High School in Baltimore County when she disappeared in January 1999. Her body was discovered in a city forest three weeks later. Throughout the podcast, reporter Sarah Koenig pointed to numerous inconsistencies made by Jay Wilds -- a fellow classmate and key witness -- in statements he made to police as well as his testimony. The prosecution centered largely on Wilds' testimony, which ultimately prevailed, according to Syed, thanks to missteps allegedly made by his lawyer at the time. ""Adnan argued that his trial attorney ... had screwed up in various ways,"" Koenig wrote on Serial's official blog following the ruling. ""Chiefly, he'd argued that her failure to speak to Asia McClain, a potential alibi witness, and (the lawyer's) failure to seek a plea deal for him, even though he says he asked her to, amounted to what's called 'ineffective assistance of counsel.'"" Asia McClain claimed in a January affidavit that she was with Syed in the library at the time of the slaying, but she says her attempts to relay this potentially exculpatory evidence to his lawyer fell on deaf ears. McClain filed an affidavit in January indicating that she'd again be willing to testify, prompting Syed's new lawyers to petition the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, requesting that it release the case to a circuit court for a fresh look. Despite opposition by the state attorney general's office, Chief Judge Peter B. Krauser ruled in favor of the motion Friday. Koenig translated what the legal maneuvering means for fans. ""In Episode 10 of the podcast, I reported that (Syed's appeal for a new trial) was alive by a thread,"" she wrote. ""Now, I'd say it's more of a ... well-made string, maybe. Like the nylon kind. Because it means that the Court of Special Appeals judges think the issues Adnan raised in his brief are worth considering. That's a pretty big hurdle for any appellant to clear."" But, she cautioned, ""it's bound to grind on for a long while yet.""

On Saturday, at the annual Munich Security Conference, she said it is uncertain whether their talks were successful, but it was worth trying. She defended borders in Europe as ""inviolable."" Russia has shown disrespect for peace and territorial integrity, she said, and Moscow's actions in Ukraine stand in stark contrast to their commitments. Changing borders by force is out of line with peace and security, and risks escalation, she said. The French, German and Russian leaders met to begin drawing up a new proposal to end the bitter conflict in eastern Ukraine.  The peace talks lasted into early Saturday. The parties will engage in further talks by phone on Sunday, the Kremlin said. ""We want to shape security with Russia, not against it,"" Merkel said. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, addressing the conference after Merkel, said it was time for Russia not to just agree to peace -- referring to a September ceasefire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists that was agreed in Minsk, Belarus -- but to act on it. ""Too many times, President Putin has promised peace and delivered tanks, troops and weapons,"" Biden said, restating Western assertions about Russia's involvement in the conflict. ""We believe we should attempt an honorable peace. We also believe the Ukrainian people have the right to defend themselves,"" Biden said, drawing robust applause. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told the conference that his country ""will be committed to peace."" ""We are against combat. We would like to see a withdrawal of heavy weapons,"" Lavrov said. He called for ""a direct negotiation"" between Ukrainian government leaders and separatist leaders in Donetsk ""within the framework of territorial integrity."" Lavrov said talks will continue, adding, ""We believe that there are good grounds for optimism to issue recommendations for conflict resolution."" The new diplomatic push comes as a worsening conflict in eastern Ukraine is taking an increasingly heavy toll on civilians. Merkel made clear that she would not do a deal with Russia that bypasses Ukraine's leadership, saying she ""will not decide anything over the heads of anyone."" The solution must be in line with the Minsk agreement, she said. Russia, Ukraine and separatist leaders signed that pact, but continued fighting has left it in shreds. It's not yet clear how the new proposal differs from the Minsk agreement. Hollande said Thursday that the joint proposal for new negotiations would be ""based upon the territorial integrity of Ukraine."" The pair hope the proposal will be acceptable to all parties in the conflict, he said. But he said that ""the option of negotiation, of diplomacy, cannot be extended indefinitely."" Merkel is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington on Monday to discuss, among other topics, Ukraine. Western leaders and Kiev accuse Russia of fostering the conflict by providing weapons and training to the pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, as well as sending regular Russian troops over the border to fight. Moscow denies the allegations. Civilians increasingly are falling victim to the violence in Ukraine, with at least 224 killed and more than 540 injured in the final three weeks of January, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said this week.

"Bearing the loss of a child is unimaginable to most. What's even more unimaginable for the Johnsons of Valdosta, Georgia, is how their 17-year-old son died: by suffocating after falling headfirst into a rolled-up gym mat at his high school on January 11. ""It felt unreal. You know I sent my child to school for an education and he did go to school one way and came back dead,"" his mother, Jacquelyn Johnson said. How could Kendrick Johnson, a three-sport athlete, fall into an upright mat while reaching for his shoe and not get out, as investigators said? It was an accident, police said, as there were no bruises on the body and no signs of foul play. But the bizarre circumstances didn't sit right with the family, even though they're not sure what happened to their son. The teen's parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn, allege the local sheriff department did not follow protocol on the case, moving the body and mishandling evidence. They also believe the sheriff was too quick to make a judgment call on what happened. Within 24 hours of finding the body, Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine announced that investigators had no reason to believe there was foul play. Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson agrees with the family, saying that the body had been moved before he arrived. He also told CNN he was not contacted until six hours after the body was found, although Georgia law states the coroner should be notified immediately. The final autopsy report, released just last week, stated that the teen died of accidental suffocation; it's what the preliminary autopsy from January 14 said, too. Taking to the streets . The Johnsons buried their boy in January, but they were still waiting for answers. After months of waiting for the final autopsy report, the family started speaking up. They've taken to the streets, organizing rallies for justice. Chants booming over a megaphone have become a daily scene since April in this south Georgia city of about 56,000. ""No justice! No peace!"" protesters shout. ""I don't feel that there was any investigation until there was protesting and all this attention coming to them,"" Kenneth Johnson said. ""That's when they started to act like they were doing an investigation."" Despite the family's persistent protests and claims that protocol was broken, Lt. Stryde Jones of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office maintains investigators were ""actively working"" on the case from the time Kendrick's body was found on January 11 until the final autopsy was released on May 2. After taking testimony and looking at the physical and forensic evidence, Jones said an accident was the only scenario that fit. More than 100 people, including students, teachers and parents, were interviewed, he added. Chevene King Jr., the attorney for the Johnsons, has alleged that if Kendrick had been white, the investigation would have gone differently. But Jones said the case was handled as professionally as in any case. ""Race never played into it,"" he said. ""The victim played into it. That's who we're working for is the victim and the victim's family."" Kendrick's aunt Keisha Moore has been alongside her family at many of the protests. Her son and her nephew were close and played basketball and football together at Lowndes High School. ""We are just hoping that the truth will come out. It's hard not sleeping at night not knowing,"" Moore said. Like Kendrick's parents, she believes he was beaten to death, referring to a gruesome postmortem photo of Kendrick shown on protest posters. ""The perp is still out there and we don't know if it's a person at the school."" The family isn't rallying alone -- hundreds have joined the movement, from friends to Valdosta residents who barely knew or never met Kendrick. Local businessman and iReporter Larry Johnson -- no relation to the family -- is a concerned community member who has been protesting. He has known Kendrick's mother for several years and met the teen once or twice, he said. ""It's emotional because it's my community,"" he said. ""Even though a tragedy happened, to see that many people come out and support someone in the community, it made me proud to be from here."" Watch videos from a recent rally for Kendrick . Complete strangers are rallying alongside the Johnsons, too. Bonita Lacy first heard about Kendrick Johnson through her involvement with the Atlanta chapter of the National Action Network. The 53-year-old drove down to Valdosta from Decatur to rally alongside family and community members on April 18 and again on May 4. Lacy did not know Johnson, but decided to join the rally because he reminded her of her own grandsons. ""I am a grandmother of two boys whom I want to have the right and opportunity to live, grow up, travel and go to school anywhere they please without fear or intimidation, or death by cloudy statements,"" she said. While the rallies have been peaceful, seven people, including Kendrick's parents, Moore and several other aunts, were arrested for obstruction at a rally on April 25, according to the Lowndes County sheriff's office. The group was blocking people from entering or leaving the Lowndes County Judicial Complex. The rally cries have spread far outside Valdosta. Thanks to a Facebook tribute page and stories sent to CNN iReport, the Kendrick Johnson story started to spread online. Moore, Johnson's aunt, sent in an iReport that has been viewed more than 100,000 times and been shared 8,000 times on Facebook. Moore described Kendrick as a sweet, quiet teen who had dreams of becoming a professional athlete. ""He was determined to do his best and be his best,"" she told CNN. Waiting for resolution . Kendrick's father has been the more vocal member of the family, at least publicly. His wife, Jacquelyn, speaks in quiet, short sentences. Her eyes still express shock. Kenneth didn't let his wife go into the morgue to identify their son. He went alone. Authorities told the family that blood had rushed to Kendrick's head and upper body, his father said. A photo of Kendrick's bloated, postmortem face was almost unrecognizable. ""It's indescribable. You don't expect to see your child lying down like that,"" said Kenneth, recalling seeing his son's body. ""As handsome as my son was, the day you see him like that is crazy."" Even though the case is officially closed, the Johnsons told CNN they will keep protesting. They're still looking for a resolution. ""No matter who you are, how much money your parents have, the color of your skin, everyone deserves justice. Everyone,"" said Kenneth Johnson. While he doesn't believe the official reports of how his son died, Kenneth knows he's not alone. He hopes the attention from outside Lowndes County, including the large online community invested in the story, will keep the issue alive. ""It means that people are not going to fall for anything. You know from the way they said the thing happened, people are not buying it.""","Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead, upside down in a gym mat in January .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN)The parents of Kayla Mueller are imploring ISIS to contact them. They believe -- or at least hope -- that their daughter may still be alive. ""We have sent you a private message and ask that you respond to us privately,"" Carl and Marsha Mueller said in a statement. The couple is not giving interviews to the media as ISIS warned them not to. CNN had previously not published her name at the request of her relatives, who have now publicly identified her. The terror group captured Mueller, an Arizona native, in 2013. It said Friday that a Jordanian airstrike that pounded their de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria also killed her. Her parents, though, are holding out hope ""that Kayla is still alive."" ""You told us that you treated Kayla as your guest,"" they said. ""As your guest her safety and well-being remains your responsibility."" Jordanian officials challenged the veracity of the claim, with Interior Minister Hussein Majali calling it nothing more than a publicity stunt. ""What we know about this terrorist organization is that they are liars when it comes to these things,"" said spokesman Mohammed al-Momani. He cast doubt on the extremists' ability to identify Jordanian warplanes flying at high altitudes. Many are U.S. made F-16s. Officials in Amman have been adamant about their intent to go after ISIS ever since Tuesday, when the terror group released a video showing its members burning Jordanian pilot Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh to death. They've vowed not to give up the fight, even after ISIS' latest claim about Mueller. On Saturday, they proved it. According to state TV, Jordanian fighter jets conducted more airstrikes targeting ISIS position before returning safely to their bases. Anti-ISIS activists reported that coalition strikes pounding targets around the Islamist extremist group's de facto capital of Raqqa. Pro-ISIS reporters said ""heavy airstrikes"" hit more than a dozen areas. Kurds say ISIS destroyed key Iraq bridge . Jordan isn't going after ISIS alone. It's part of the U.S.-led coalition also hitting ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq, helping local forces on the ground. And the United Arab Emirates will station an F-16 squadron ""in fraternal Jordan"" in part to reaffirm ""the UAE's unwavering and constant solidarity with Jordan,"" according to the Arab nation's state-run WAN news agency. ISIS has shown no proof the 26-year-old was killed, other than a building laid to rubble and the claim that her body was inside. Experts have questioned why no militants died in the collapsed building, if they were holding Mueller there, or why -- if the building had just been crushed -- there was no smoke from smoldering debris. Skeptics fear ISIS may have long killed her and just waited for an opportunity to officially announce the death -- a suspicion that has been floated before when ISIS uploaded slickly produced, odious videos of other victims' killings. Jordanian officials said they have reason to believe al-Kasasbeh was actually killed in early January, and that ISIS lied about him still being alive while trying to negotiate advantages in exchange for him. The group has a penchant for executing, not freeing. ISIS had implied they might kill Mueller last summer. They set a deadline of August 13, 2014, for a 5 million Euro ransom to be paid to prevent her murder, according to a source close to the family. U.S. officials are investigating on the theory that she may have died weeks or months ago, but that ISIS was possibly ashamed to announce they had killed a woman. But retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. James Reese says it's plausible a hostage may have been inadvertently killed in Syria. ""We all know that intelligence ... in Syria is not as good as we have in Iraq now,"" Reese said. ""So it is plausible, and it could be unfortunate. But sometimes ... that happens in these wars,"" he said. Mueller landed in Syria following her faith, empathy for human suffering and wanderlust. In her home state, she worked in an AIDS clinic and volunteered at a woman's shelter. After graduating from Northern Arizona University, the Prescott native traveled to India and Israel. ""I find God in the suffering eyes reflected in mine. If this is how you are revealed to me ... this is how I will forever seek you,"" she said, according to her family. In 2012, Mueller went to Syria with the Danish Refugee Council and Support to Life humanitarian agency. She fell into the hands of hostage takers in August 2013 in Aleppo, Syria, her family said, after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital. The list of ISIS atrocities is long and growing. It extends far beyond the glitzy video celebrations of hostage murders. The terrorists have wiped out villages of people whose religion they reject, summarily executing hundreds, kidnapping scores of women, then raping them and passing them into slavery. They have stooped to selling children, a U.N. report this week claimed. They aim to instill fear in people's hearts, as they aspire to virtually take over the world with a caliphate, but their barbarism is having the opposite effect as well, unleashing disgust and wrath against them. Putting al-Kasasbeh in a cage and setting him on fire has fueled resolve among Jordanians to stop the group's smudging of their religion by killing in its name. ""This is definitely not the U.S.'s war,"" said Majali, the nation's Interior Minister. ""This is definitely our war.""

"A Philadelphia college student died from the same strain of meningitis seen in an outbreak at Princeton University, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday. The Drexel University student died March 10 from meningitis B, or ""serogroup B meningococcal disease,"" the CDC said in a statement. Lab analysis showed the disease matched the strain seen at Princeton through ""genetic fingerprinting,"" health officials said. ""The public health investigation of the Drexel University student revealed that the student had been in close contact with students from Princeton University about a week before becoming ill,"" the CDC said. The death raises concern the outbreak strain may still be present in the Princeton community, health officials said. Starting in December, a ""high percentage"" of Princeton undergraduates and eligible graduate students received an unlicensed meningitis vaccination called Bexsero. While the vaccine is approved for use in Europe, Canada and Australia, it is not yet approved for use in the United States. The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the vaccine to be distributed at Princeton. Last month, Bexsero was also distributed to students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, which had an outbreak involving four cases of of meningococcal disease unrelated to the Princeton outbreak. Meningococcal disease can cause meningitis or blood infections. Nine cases of group B meningitis have been associated with the Princeton outbreak, Princeton University said on its web site Tuesday. Eight cases were previously reported; the new number includes the Drexel case, said Princeton spokesman Martin Mbugua. The CDC noted no new cases have been seen at Princeton since the vaccinations began on December 9. ""Available data show most adolescents that get two doses of this vaccine are protected from getting meningococcal disease,"" the CDC said. ""However, vaccinated individuals may still be able to carry the bacteria in their throats, which could infect others through close contact."" No related cases have been reported at Drexel, the CDC said. Health officials were investigating whom the student may have been in contact with and providing antibiotics. A statement on the Princeton website Tuesday urged members of the university community to ""continue to be vigilant in following good health practices to prevent the spread of this illness."" Meningitis is caused by inflammation of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord, known as the meninges. Infection of the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord usually causes this inflammation, according to the CDC. College students are especially vulnerable, and dorms are the perfect breeding grounds for an outbreak, health officials say. Meningitis B spreads through coughing, sneezing, and kissing. It can also spread when people forget to wash their hands or clothes, or among people who drink out of the same cup. Meningitis B is tricky, since students who catch it may first think they have the flu. It starts with flulike symptoms: fever, headache, stiff necks, vomiting and delirium. If the bacteria spread to the meninges, patients can suffer hearing loss, permanent neurological damage and even death. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis in the United States, according to the CDC. Of those, 160 were group B.","A Drexel University student died March 10 from group B meningitis .

"I just attended a New York City prescreening of the CNN Film ""Lady Valor: The Kristin Beck Story."" It was presented by CNN and Psychology Today, attended by CNN executives and a select audience of New York professionals. In the audience was Hedy, an 85-year-old woman married to a marvelous gentleman -- a survivor of the death camps of World War II. Many other stories come to mind as I recall the night's events, but I want to share one short exchange with you, my loyal readers. Hedy enjoyed the film and mentioned her favorite part: In the film someone asks me: ""Who do you like?"" Further questions included: ""Are you gay? Do you like women?"" I simply answered what was in my heart: ""I like people."" The person asking the question was trying to force me into a label of ""straight"" or ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" -- or who knows what. Hedy, with her years of experience and wisdom, was struck by my simple answer. She came up to me after the movie and asked me to go into detail. I spoke about my life of discovery, finding myself and finding others who have open minds and yearn for rational thought beyond mere passages from ancient books or bigotry of stereotypes and such. I'm learning to look beyond the many ""labels"" that we're forced to abide by in society. Hedy said, why can't we do that for everything? OK. Now it was my turn to be awestruck by a simple answer. I gave her a hug and said, ""Thank you. I now understand what I'm really doing and see what you see in me."" You all who are reading this might ask, ""What the heck are you talking about?"" Putting my answer simply, two things: I like people -- no labels -- just people. And, why can't we do that for everything? Opinion: Lift ban on transgender military members . Here's what I mean: Look beyond the label of gender, race, color, religion, age, sexual orientation -- or anything. Why can't we just like each other for just being ourselves in all of our diversity as humans? What is wrong with us that we constantly label and judge each other? This inhibits everyone's potential as humans. I'm so tired of labels, and it seems that EVERYTHING in life and society reinforces those labels. Look around and see how many things point us into a label and divide us as people into those labels. The fashion magazines, the media, the news, our parents, our brothers and sisters, our friends, our neighbors, the church, the mosque, the guy on the corner who never met me is enforcing labels and controlling my thoughts and actions according to those labels. This is my question to the world: When can we all just live our lives as we are and not live the label? When can we just be ourselves and support each other in our own happiness and freedom? I want to see fewer stereotypes in the media, less ""Barbie"" and ""Conan,"" and more of us regular folk who are just as beautiful as people need to be -- maybe more beautiful -- if you look beyond the label. I want to just LIKE every human and enjoy our diversity in all things. When I grow up I want to be like Hedy -- she is really cool.","People ask transgender woman: ""Who do you like? Are you gay?

"This summer 23 year-old Mohammed Assaf won the ""Arab Idol"" singing competition and with his silky smooth vocals has united Arabs across the world. Now he's on a nationwide tour in the U.S. and is set to pack theaters across the country. Before his Chicago concert last week he reflected on his incredible journey from Gaza to America. ""My story is about a person who came from a very humble place -- a place referred to as 'the camp' in Gaza,"" said Assaf. Assaf is a Palestinian, born in Libya. When he was five years old his family returned to Gaza to live in the Khan Younis refugee camp, where he and his six brothers and sisters call home. ""The camp is like a densely populated residential area. There's only a meter or two between each house. With people this close together, conditions are difficult,"" he said. ""Whether politically, because of the occupation, or economically, conditions are difficult. I can't even describe how difficult the conditions are -- and the poverty and unemployment of my society,"" he said. Israel's blockade on Gaza since 2007 has eased in recent years, but the border with Egypt remains the main route for Palestinians to travel in and out of the territory. ""Getting out of Gaza was difficult in terms of the border crossings, mainly because of the occupation,"" he said. ""It took nearly a month to get to travel, I tried every method."" After finally making it across the border and the 250 miles to the Cairo hotel where the ""Arab Idol"" auditions were taking place, Mohammed arrived to find the hotel doors had already been closed, and all contestants had been assigned numbers. He jumped a gate at the hotel, snuck in, and was given a number by fellow Palestinian contestant Ramadan Abu Nahli. ""I didn't have a choice. I said I will do anything to make sure I get to compete,"" he said. He made it through the auditions and all the way to the finals. ""Until I got to the final ten, I really didn't think I would make it,"" he said. In May, when he made it to the finals, his parents spoke to CNN by phone from Gaza. ""We are only refugees,"" his father, Jabar Assaf, said. ""We only dreamed he would get to this point and show the world his beautiful voice. Now we want him to win."" ""I am very proud of him -- the fact that he's Palestinian, he is popular, and he makes people happy,"" his mother, UmShadi said. Backstage in Chicago . At the Chicago performance, Assaf was the main and final act, following performances by fellow ""Arab Idol"" finalists Ziad Khoury from Lebanon, and Farah Youssef from Syria. Before the show, fans flocked to have their photograph taken Assaf. While clearly the center of attention he remained soft-spoken and gracious with them all, whether they simply wanted to congratulate him or tell him how wonderful his smile is. ""The most beautiful thing is the love of the people. When you see that a lot of people see you as something, and encourage you, and they love you, you feel that they want to finish this journey with you that you've been dreaming of,"" Mohammed said. Assaf was aware that he would be one of the few Gazans the world would see who was not involved in politics, and not interested in taking sides. ""My life now is wonderful,"" he said, ""but what I miss most is my family and friends. Where I am from people love each other, we are very close... fame is nice, but when they get to be with me, it will be even more wonderful,"" he said. Before it was time to go on stage he stood quietly out of the view of the crowd, smiling and looking at the floor as he waited for his introduction. When he heard his name, his eyes lit up, a megawatt smile spread across his face, and he took over the stage. An elderly woman in traditional Palestinian clothes was at the very front of the crowd, pressed up against the stage. She waved her arms feebly as he sang. ""Do you see this woman?"" one of the organizers of the event asked, pointing at her. ""She has never been to a concert in her life until now.""","Mohammed Assaf won 2013 Arab Idol show .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama said Thursday that the federal government was guilty of mistreating Native Americans in the past and promised to forge a new relationship between the federal government and tribal leaders. ""You deserve to have a voice,"" Obama told representatives of 386 tribes at a White House Tribal Nations Conference. ""You will not be forgotten as long as I'm in this White House."" Obama signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to submit recommendations within 90 days on how best to improve tribal participation in key government policy decisions. Leaders of all 564 federally recognized tribes were invited to the daylong meeting. Interior Minister Ken Salazar and other Cabinet members participated in the conference, which focused on the challenges and priorities of the tribal leaders and their people. Obama acknowledged misdeeds by the U.S. government in dealing with Native Americans. ""We know the history that we share,"" Obama said. ""It's a history marked by violence and disease and deprivation. Treaties were violated. Promises were broken. You were told your lands, your religion, your cultures, your languages were not yours to keep."" In addition, he said, the federal government failed to properly consult Native American leaders and communities on what they needed, leading to current conditions that include unemployment up to 80 percent on some reservations, roughly 25 percent of Native Americans living in poverty and more than 10 percent of reservation homes lacking electricity or safe water supplies. During a question-and-answer session with conference participants, the tribal chiefs welcomed Obama and thanked him for his leadership, with many asking for his help on problems facing their people. Bill Martin, president of the Tlingit-Haida Indian tribes of Alaska, noted that the suicide rate for Native American men between 15 and 27 years old in the state was 12 times the national average. ""It's a serious issue, and we hope that we can be able to provide more funding to combat suicide,"" Martin said. Others asked for help on securing land rights, improving education and other social issues. ""I want to give you my solemn guarantee that this is not the end of the process but the beginning of the process and that we are going to follow up,"" Obama said to applause in his closing remarks to the conference. ""We are going to keep on working with you to make sure that the first Americans get the best possible chances in life.""","Representatives from 386 tribes gather for White House Tribal Conference .

"(CNN)NBA star Chris Paul has been called for many technical fouls through the years. His latest is drawing perhaps the most notice, and his criticism of the female referee who called it has drawn a $25,000 fine from the league. The conversation around the technical has centered on what Paul said about rookie referee Lauren Holtkamp, one of two female officials in the NBA. The NBA said Paul was being fined for ""public criticism of officiating."" The league's statement announcing the fine didn't mention the official's gender. Paul said her call during a Los Angeles Clippers loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers was ""ridiculous"" and ""terrible."" ""We try to get the ball out fast every time down the court, and when we did that, she said, 'Uh-uh.' I said, 'Why, uh-uh?' And she gave me a tech,"" the Clippers point guard told reporters after the game Thursday. ""That's ridiculous. If that's the case, this might not be for her."" Critics focused on the last sentence, accusing the nine-year veteran of sexism. ""We deplore the unprofessional comments made by Chris Paul. She belongs,"" the National Basketball Referees Association said in a written statement. Other people, including San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon, defended Paul. ""I don't think it had anything to do with the ref's gender,"" she tweeted. And the director of the National Basketball Association Players Association,  Michele Roberts, also denied it was a gender-based comment. ""Any suggestion that Chris Paul would ever conduct himself in a disrespectful manner towards women is utterly ridiculous, outrageous and patently false,"" she said, according to media reports. Before a game Friday, Paul was asked several times about the comment. Each time he said: ""Last night was about a bad call."" Paul, who is the players' union president, was fined $15,000 in 2011 when he was with the then-New Orleans Hornets for verbally abusing a referee. According to ESPN's NBA statistics, Paul has been called for 79 technical fouls in his career. Violet Palmer is the other female referee and has worked NBA games since 1997. Dee Kantner worked NBA games for five years and is now the WNBA supervisor of officials. CNN's Jason Durand and Wayne Sterling contributed to this report.","Chris Paul said a rookie referee made a bad call, so working in the NBA ""might not be for her.""

"(CNN)He was the first detainee at Guantanamo to be convicted in a military commission, and now his conviction has been thrown out. A U.S. military appeals court on Wednesday vacated the conviction of David Hicks, an Australian who pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorism. The court found that the activity for which Hicks was convicted was not an offense triable by military commission at the time he was caught. ""We are very happy for David. Today's decision is a powerful reminder that he committed no crime, he is innocent of any offense,"" said Wells Dixon, senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. ""David Hicks can now be truly free of Guantanamo."" Hicks was captured by U.S. troops in 2001 in Afghanistan after the U.S.-led attacks against the Taliban were launched. He was transferred to Guantanamo in 2002 as one of its original detainees. He was held there for five years before entering a guilty plea in 2007. Under a pretrial agreement, Hicks was sentenced to seven years in prison. However, all but nine months of that was suspended. Because of a transfer agreement between the United States and Australia, Hicks was returned to Australia to serve that time. He was released from prison in late 2007. ""I'm looking forward to getting on with my life now that my name has been cleared,"" Hicks told reporters in Sydney. He spoke about the physical ailments he suffers as a result of his time at Guantanamo, and suggested the Australian government should be responsible for his medical expenses. ""They were aware of the conditions I was being held in at the time. I think they should at least pay my medical expenses. That's not much to ask for, I think."" He said he was kept in metal rooms in freezing conditions for years, and wasn't able to move or exercise. ""The body deteriorates over five and a half years, even without the added torture, such as stress positions, being beaten, etc.,"" he said. ""I'm in need of operation on my left knee, my right elbow, my back. My teeth keep getting pulled because I couldn't brush them for five and a half years,"" he said. ""It's becoming a very expensive exercise to fix myself from the years of torture."" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has ruled out issuing an apology to Hicks. ""I'm not in the business of apologizing for the actions that Australian governments take to protect our country. Not now, not ever,"" he said, according to CNN affiliate SBS. In a statement, Australia's Attorney-General George Brandis said the ruling was based on a question of law, not on whether Hicks had engaged in the alleged activities. He  suggested he would have been convicted under Australia's current anti-terror laws. ""Mr. Hicks has made a number of admissions regarding his activities, including in letters to his family and in his book, for example that he undertook training with militia and terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and that he had met Osama bin Laden on many occasions and considered him a 'brother.'"" Hicks' lawyer Stephen Kenny said his client had traveled to Afghanistan for military training, but that wasn't what Wednesday's ruling was about. ""What he was doing there was not at that time illegal. He wasn't doing anything that was a breach of Australian, international or U.S. law. And that's what this decision today confirms,"" Kenny said. When asked by a reporter whether he was angry, Hicks said no: ""I think I'm too defeated to have any anger. I'm just worn out.""

"Darren Wilson, the police officer who fatally shot an unarmed teenager in August, has resigned from the police department in Ferguson, Missouri, his attorney, Neil Bruntrager, confirmed to CNN Saturday night. In a telephone interview with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Wilson said he resigned after the police department told him it received threats of violence if he remained an employee. ""I'm resigning of my own free will,"" he said. ""I'm not willing to let someone else get hurt because of me."" He said resigning was ""the hardest thing I've ever had to do."" The resignation, which is immediate, comes five days after a grand jury decided not to indict Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown, 18. The shooting sparked worldwide protests and the Monday announcement of no indictment triggered another round of demonstrations that continued through the week and into the weekend. As police and protesters clashed, a contentious national debate on race and law enforcement reopened, with many people complaining that police unfairly target black males. Wilson is white and Brown was black. Wilson says he's sorry but his conscience is clear . 'He's 112 days too late' People gathered again Saturday on the streets of Ferguson. One protester, Monica Chambers told CNN affiliate KMOV that Wilson should have been out of a job much earlier. ""He's 112 days too late,"" she said. ""He should have been fired on Day One."" Wilson had been a member of the Ferguson Police Department for six years. He had been on paid administrative leave since the incident. According to the Post-Dispatch, Wilson said he's not receiving a severance package. He'd been negotiating his resignation for weeks, according to people close to the talks. The letter does not say what Wilson plans to do next. Wilson, 28, cited security fears in his letter of resignation, which reads: . ""I, Darren Wilson, hereby resign my commission as a police officer with the City of Ferguson effective immediately. I have been told that my continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance that I cannot allow. ""For obvious reasons, I wanted to wait until the grand jury made their decision before I officially made my decision to resign. It was my hope to continue in police work, but the safety of other police officers and the community are of paramount importance to me. It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal. I would like to thank all of my supporters and fellow officers throughout this process."" Wilson's lawyer, Bruntrager, told CNN that Wilson had been in hiding since days after the shooting, when he received a phone call saying his home address was circulating on the internet. He was mowing the grass at the time. Former officer moved from house to house . ""He had to leave the grass literally halfway mowed and he had to go into hiding because there are death threats against him, there are bounties on his head,"" he said. He stayed under the radar by moving from house to house, including briefly living with one of his lawyers, and spending time watching movies in dark theaters to avoid detection. During this time, Wilson married a fellow Ferguson police officer. According to a St. Louis County marriage license, Wilson on October 24 married Barbara Lynn Spradling, with whom he shares a home in St. Louis. On Tuesday, Wilson told ABC News that Brown was the aggressor in the minutes before the shooting. In an account that generally mirrored his testimony before the grand jury, Wilson said Brown had attacked him while the officer sat in his car, then fled. Wilson said he chased after Brown until Brown turned back toward him, refusing Wilson's commands to stop. Wilson denied some witnesses' claims that Brown had his hands up when he was fatally shot. ""That would be incorrect,"" Wilson said. As Brown approached, Wilson said, he warned Brown to stop. When he didn't stop, Wilson fired his handgun. ""I had to. If I don't, he will kill me if he gets to me,"" Wilson said. Brown, who had been hit, continued to come toward Wilson, the officer said. Wilson fired again and began backing away. ""He gets to about 8 or 10 feet, and as he does that he kind of starts to lean forward, like he's going to tackle me. And I look down the barrel of my gun and I fired and what I saw was his head, and that's where (the bullet) went."" Governor calls for special session . In other action related to Ferguson, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon called for a special state legislative session to address ""critical funding"" needs for the National Guard and state police after violent protests in Ferguson this week. In a late-night call with state legislative leaders Friday night, Nixon highlighted the session's urgency to ensure Guard members are paid on December 15, his office said in a statement. Hundreds more protesters turned out late Friday after a quiet Thanksgiving, clashing with officers and National Guard troops outside the Ferguson Police Department. As protesters stepped into the street, authorities rushed across to take them into custody -- pulling some to the ground and shackling them with plastic zip-tie cuffs. At least 16 people were arrested, including one facing a charge of assault on a law enforcement officer. One officer was injured, police said. The protests have spread beyond Ferguson. Nationwide demonstrations included service disruptions at an Oakland, California, transit station and a march in New York City. Protesters in Seattle clashed with authorities as well, prompting police to use pepper spray.

"(CNN)You need look no further than the glut of beautiful, young and immortal vampires and permanently incapacitated zombies overpopulating our culture to see that America has issues when it comes to aging. We want to be forever vital, self-sufficient and powerful, like the vampires of ""Twilight,"" and we are fearful of aging into the semi-sentient zombies of ""The Walking Dead."" The good news is, when it comes to thinking about how we age, taking action early significantly increases one's odds for a better result and aging on our own terms. Caregiving for loved ones the 'new normal' for boomers . So, as you think about the new year and you get together with your family, let's have ""the talk"" -- the adult version of the birds and the bees -- a discussion of how we want to care for our parents and how we ourselves, in the prime of our lives, want to age, and how to accomplish those goals with long-term care planning. Staying silent could mean getting caught off guard. That's what happened to my family. When my dad was 50, he won our local golf and tennis championship and was diagnosed with lymphoma, all within a matter of days. Life can change that fast, and failing to plan only makes painful surprises more painful. Later, when my mother fell ill, my brothers and I had the ability to take time from work to care for her and provide help when we were unable. Many families don't have this kind of flexibility. The time and cost of caring for a loved one can be both rewarding beyond measure and financially and emotionally debilitating. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, 70% of those who reach 65 years old will need long-term care of some kind. The time to plan is now, and planning begins with family discussions about what many of us will need as we age. Uncovering the secrets of a longer life . Long-term care is not end-of-life care. Millions of older adults rely on it for help with day-to-day activities -- everything from getting dressed in the morning to cleaning the house to running the most basic errands. The majority of that care occurs in the home, and who doesn't want to say in their home? This care is in increasingly high demand in large part because of how much longer and fuller older Americans' lives have become thanks to a half-century of advances in health and medicine. In short, our increased life spans have also increased the likelihood of suffering from certain diseases and conditions that often require long-term care -- from Alzheimer's or dementia to a heart attack or stroke. The 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's . Families need to plan ahead because the cost of long-term care can get extremely expensive -- especially for nursing home care, with median costs of $87,000 a year nationally and even higher. Even when friends or family provide ""unpaid"" care, they often spend their own money and give up their personal time and even jobs to do so. Many people mistakenly believe that Medicare or the Affordable Care Act cover long-term care. They don't. Neither do the vast majority of health insurance policies. That's why it's so important to have a plan. This year, I partnered with Genworth to launch the ""Let's Talk"" tour to raise awareness about the importance and benefits of long-term care planning. As an alternative to paying out of pocket, long-term care insurance reimburses you for some of the cost of that care. The most important conversation you'll ever have . More important than how we choose to plan ahead is that we chose to do it. Getting the advice we need starts with taking the time to sit down with loved ones and have the necessary talk about how we want to age. Sure, it's not exactly a traditional conversation for the new year, but having it is an indication of your care and an articulation of your love. In that light, this time of year is the perfect time to have the talk about long-term care. If you're watching vampires and zombies, like my family will be, go ahead and take advantage of that next commercial break to have ""the talk.""","Seventy percent who reach 65 will need long-term care, but few plan for it, Rob Lowe says .

"(CNN)Three more babies who attended a Chicago-area day care center are confirmed to have the measles, bringing the number of infant measles patients linked to the business to five, the Cook County Department of Public Health said Saturday. Health officials had said earlier in the week that two children under age 1 who attended the KinderCare Learning Center in Palatine, Illinois, tested positive for the measles, and tests for the three others had been pending. Officials aren't sure whether the cases are linked to a multistate outbreak associated with Disneyland in California, the department said. At least two of the children were not vaccinated against measles, though that was to be expected given their ages, the department said. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine generally is not given to children under the age of 1. Parents messages to anti-vaxxers . One other measles case has been reported in suburban Cook County; it isn't clear if that case is connected to the Palatine cases. Since January 1, at least 110 confirmed measles cases have been reported in 16 states and the District of Columbia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health departments in four of those states. That's a notable number for the nation in five weeks, given that the country's number of 2014 cases -- 644 -- was the highest in one year since 2000, when measles was declared to be effectively eliminated in the United States. California has reported 103 cases since mid-December -- dozens of which are not counted in the nationwide 2015 total since they were confirmed before New Year's Day. Many of the California cases, 32, are in Orange County, home to Disneyland, where an outbreak of the disease began. The first measles case in New Jersey this year has been confirmed in a 1-year-old baby, the state's department of health said. No link has been found to the ongoing measles outbreak  in California. The infant, who had not yet been vaccinated, has recovered. People who have not had the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine were told this week to stay away from the Palatine day care center and from others who have not been vaccinated for 21 days. Infected people are contagious from four days before their rash begins through four days afterward. The day care center said that starting Monday, it will require all employees working in its infant rooms to be vaccinated against the measles -- an effort to prevent exposure to children who are too young to receive the vaccine. The center also said that received a deep cleaning after the first cases were reported. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease. It causes fever, red and sore eyes, runny nose, cough and a rash. It can cause deadly health complications including pneumonia and encephalitis. Measles is spread by contact with an infected person through coughing or sneezing. It can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.","It's not clear if these cases are linked to Disneyland outbreak .

"Finally going back home to Indonesia this month after toiling for 13 years in Hong Kong, migrant worker Riyanti was looking forward to being reunited with her child. But as she waited at the airport departure gates she couldn't help noticing the distressed condition of one of her compatriots. With blackened skin and obviously in pain, Erwiana Sulistyaningsih told Riyanti her condition was due to a skin allergy exacerbated by the winter cold. But when she couldn't stand up to walk to the departure gate, Riyanti knew that something was seriously wrong. Erwiana was so weak, Riyanti put her on a trolley to wheel her to the gate. Eventually, she had to help her onto the plane. Allegations of torture . ""She said, 'I'm scared.' I asked her why and told her she didn't need to be scared because I was there to help. I immediately took photos of her hands, her body. I asked again, are you sure these are really from allergies?"" Riyanti told CNN. ""Then she told me: 'The truth is I was tortured by my employer. She beat me up and didn't give enough food to eat. I got very weak so she sent me home.' ""I told her we should report it to the police but she said 'No, I'm scared because she threatened to have my parents killed by her husband's friends.'"" Riyanti, one of four Indonesian workers who came to the aid of Erwiana at Hong Kong Airport, traveled with the ailing domestic helper to her home in Ngawi, East Java, and stayed on to help her. ""Because I'm already involved, I refuse to be silent,"" Riyanti said. ""I can't accept what happened, that kind of torture. How she suffered while she was walking, while she was sitting (at the airport). I wonder what she went through during the months she worked there."" Despite abuses, foreign domestic workers still flock to Hong Kong . Arrest made . Erwiana's case is now at the center of an investigation and protests by thousands of people who rallied in Hong Kong on Sunday to demand justice for the young Indonesian maid. Allegedly beaten by her employer in a case that has sparked outrage and a police investigation into accusations of torture, Erwiana's plight has drawn attention to the risks faced by migrant workers in Asia and the Gulf regions. The employer also threatened to kill Erwiana and her family if she revealed the abuse she suffered, Eni Lestari, head of the Indonesian Migrant Workers Network, told the South China Morning Post. On Monday afternoon police arrested a 44-year-old housewife believed to be connected with the case at the Hong Kong airport. Police combined Erwiana's case with that of another Indonesian maid who was allegedly abused by the same person. After finding similarities in the cases, officers decided to pursue both investigations together, said Chan Wai Mun, the police chief of Kwun Tong, a district of Hong Kong, in a press conference Monday night. Erwiana is now recovering from her injuries at a hospital in Sragen, a city in central Java, after flying out from Hong Kong in early January. The maid had suffered extensive injuries but her condition was stabilizing, the South China Morning Post reported. 'Live-in law' questioned . At the heart of the issue is a Hong Kong law that requires domestic helpers to live with their employers. While domestic helpers in Hong Kong are guaranteed a minimum wage of HK$3,920 ($505) a month under heavily policed labor laws, support groups say the live-in law contributes to abuse. Hong Kong's Mission For Migrant Workers (MFMW) released a study last year based on interviews with more than 3,000 foreign domestic workers. It found that almost one third had no proper accommodation within the house. ""They do not have their own room provided and have to either share the bedroom with other members of the household or sleep in common areas of the apartment, such as the living room, study or playroom where there is very little privacy,"" the study reported. ""Some even sleep in unsuitable spaces such as the bathroom, toilets, veranda, corridor, kitchen and storage rooms, with only makeshift beds on top of ovens, cupboards or bathtubs. There are foreign domestic workers that are forced to share the room with young adult male members of the household,"" it added. MFMW director Cynthia Ca Abdon-Tellez told Hong Kong media that the government requirement that maids must live with their employer meant they had nowhere to run when they were abused. She said the decision should be left to the employers and the maids whether they live together. She also urged the government to scrap a policy that requires domestic helpers to leave Hong Kong just two weeks after their contracts expire, saying it did not give workers enough time to find new work. ""It often forces the helpers to endure abuses so they can hold on to their jobs,"" she said, adding that they needed the jobs to support their families back home.

"(CNN)An ISIS outfit based in northeastern Syria has been drawing up plans since at least the middle of last year to kidnap Westerners and others in neighboring countries, a Middle East security source told CNN on Friday. The source said the terrorists want to go into countries such as Lebanon and Jordan and bring hostages back to Syria, where they could be used in ISIS propaganda videos, according to intelligence gathered on the planning. After producing at least seven highly publicized clips in which hostages were beheaded, ISIS may believe it needs to kidnap more people. It's hard to know how many captives ISIS and other groups have because governments, employers and families tend to keep kidnappings quiet for fear of putting the victims in greater danger while negotiators work to secure their release. The group, which is based in the area of Raqqa, has financial resources to sneak across borders and bribe security guards who might be sympathetic to their cause. Some of the funds have come from ransoms paid for the release of other hostages. A new ISIS-affiliated group in Egypt might be keen to help snatch Westerners. Opinion: ISIS has miscalculated . CNN national security commentator and former Rep. Mike Rogers said the report is ""very plausible."" The large number of refugees streaming out of Syria into Lebanon and Jordan could give the terrorists cover at the border, he said. ISIS may try to capture aid workers at the refugee camps. There are many ISIS sympathizers in northern Jordan, which borders Syria, said Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a retired airman and a former U.S. military attaché in Syria. ""And that border is very, very porous,"" he said. Another big concern, the experts said, would be that other groups could abduct people and sell them to ISIS. ""It is a cash business. We should make no mistake about it,"" Rogers said.

"(CNN)One of the strangest right-wing conspiracies is that Barack Obama is not really a Christian. It's strange because the President has missed few opportunities to inject Christianity into his rhetoric -- to an extent that really ought to irritate his more radical liberal allies. Yet all his talk about being ""brought to Christ"" has done little to bring conservatives to him. On the contrary, this week they responded to Obama's remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast with righteous anger. The President used the occasion to warn against the distortion of faith for the sake of promoting violence. Few would disagree with that, but Obama upped the stakes by reminding the audience that Christians could be just as guilty of this as Islamists -- name-dropping the Crusades, Inquisition and Jim Crow as examples. The President urged listeners to recognize the role that doubt can play in faith, embracing humility and rejecting the idea that ""somehow we alone are in possession of the truth."" ""The President's comments this morning at the prayer breakfast are the most offensive I've ever heard a president make in my lifetime,"" said Jim Gilmore, former Republican governor of Virginia. ""Barack Obama is not, in any meaningful way, a Christian,"" wrote Erick Erickson at RedState.com. ""Christ himself is truth. When we possess Christ, we possess truth. The President is a moral relativist."" I am reminded of The Onion's reporting of an imaginary speech in which Obama urges the Democratic Party to ""destroy Jesus and usher in a new age of liberal darkness that shall reign o'er the Earth for a thousand years."" No, Obama is not the anti-Christ. But conservative Christian skepticism about his religion is justifiable. From the perspective of the religious right, his faith is contradicted by his policies: How can a Christian support same-sex marriage or say ""Thank you, Planned Parenthood. God bless you"" when it is an organization that provides abortion services? If his rejection of natural law infuriates Catholics, some conservatives have identified a lack of commitment to the principle of American exceptionalism and, therefore, to its associated dream of building ""a shining city upon a hill."" If you believe that God intervenes directly in the lives of individuals and nations (as did Benjamin Franklin), then the blessings enjoyed by the United States are not an accident but providence. Hence, Barack Obama's suggestion earlier in his presidency that exceptionalism is not necessarily exceptional to America, validates the accusation that, in the words of Gilmore, he ""does not believe in America or the values we all share."" Just as controversial are the President's claims that one does not necessarily achieve salvation through Christ alone (that there is more than one ""path to grace"") or that Christianity is stained by some sort of historical sin of political manipulation. But if Barack Obama contradicts one faith tradition in America, he is in tune with another. There is a modernist, post-'60s brand of Christianity that places an emphasis upon man as broken and in need of healing. This is a difficult process because, I and others would argue, that part of our ""broken state"" involves being disconnected from God, and it's this disconnection that leads to sin. Said the President at the breakfast: ""We should assume humbly that we're confused and don't always know what we're doing and we're staggering and stumbling towards [God], and have some humility in that process."" By acknowledging what we don't know about God and focusing upon improving our human relationships here on Earth, says the modernist Christian, we become fuller human beings and fuller Christians. Perhaps we can be redeemed through social action, while our understanding of the truth begins by acknowledging that we weren't born with ownership of it. Maybe it's OK to be gay? Maybe Allah is just another way of saying ""God""? Back in 2004, State Sen. Obama explained, ""I'm suspicious of too much certainty in the pursuit of understanding just because I think people are limited in their understanding."" This take on faith dominates in English Anglicanism and its American Episcopalian branch. Personally, I don't much like it. As a Catholic, I believe that the truth is contained in the Bible and is lived through communion in the Catholic Church -- and all this talk of humility is navel-gazing in a world crying out for the Good News: that Jesus has died for its sins and offers a shot at heaven for those willing to trust in him. I also think that politically empowering this brand of Christianity has not always been best for the United States, either. Barack Obama's rejection of American exceptionalism is reasonable and sometimes has helped avoid reckless intervention. But it has also reduced the United States' self-confidence and weakened the ability of the West to provide moral leadership. The cost is counted in the caliphates that flourish in Nigeria and the Middle East -- places where an appeal to humility is a nice idea but never going to catch on. While the Judeo-Christian West is busy being modest, its Islamist enemies brim with self-assurance. But I wouldn't deny that Obama is a Christian, belongs to a valid and probably growing strain of Christianity, and that he is in fact one of the most interesting religious thinkers to inhabit the White House for a very long time. The challenge faced by conservatives is surely not to brand him un-American but rather to answer his specific points in a manner that asserts that our brand of Christianity is just as compassionate and intellectually rigorous. Among Christians, surely, humility is a blessing.","Timothy Stanley: Obama riled right at prayer breakfast by invoking Crusades, Inquisition to show danger of violence used to advance faith .
Stanley: It's wrong to say Obama not Christian, but the humility of his approach weakens the West's moral leadership ."
"Atlanta (CNN)Investigators are focusing on Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, as they try to determine how she ended up facedown in a tub of water,  a source with knowledge of the case told CNN. In another development, a source close to her family told CNN that she has injuries that still need to be explained. The nature of those injuries was not disclosed. The daughter of musical superstar Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina was found facedown in a bathtub full of water in her Atlanta area home on January 31. The 21-year-old was ""unresponsive, meaning not breathing, no heartbeat,"" a Roswell police spokeswoman said at the time. Doctors have placed her in a medically induced coma, a source close to the family said soon after she was hospitalized. The status of her brain function won't be known until sedatives are reduced, the source said. A week after she was rushed to the hospital, details of her condition are scarce. Sources close to the family say she opened her eyes briefly on Monday and also suffered seizures that same day. It was not immediately clear what medical significance these reported events have in Brown's case. As she fights for her life, more family members are coming to Atlanta to visit the legendary singer's daughter. Her grandmother, Cissy Houston, mother of the late Whitney Houston, arrived at Emory University Hospital on Friday, a source close the family told CNN. Other family members, including Bobbi Kristina's father, singer Bobby Brown, have been in Atlanta for days. She ""was not breathing"" when Gordon and a friend, who has been identified as Maxwell Lomas, found her inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell. They called 911 and performed CPR until emergency crews arrived and took over, police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said. Nobody knows what caused her unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. Bobbi Kristina had said she was married to Gordon, but an attorney for her father said the two were never married. Meanwhile, the three-year anniversary of Whitney Houston's death approaches. She was found dead in a bathtub at a hotel near Los Angeles on February 11, 2012, hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party. A coroner ruled her death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Bobbi Kristina is her only child.","Source: Bobbi Kristina Brown has injuries that still need to be explained .

"(CNN)President Obama admitted Friday that his basketball game is suffering and he prefers golf nowadays, but for Attorney General Eric Holder it's nothing but net. In a town hall event Friday, President Obama said he's fallen a long way from his days ""dominating"" the court. ""I'll be honest with you, my game is a little broke,"" Obama said. ""I've been a little busy, and what happens is that, sort of, the risk-reward ratio starts shifting."" Holder, however, is seen sinking the ball with ease in a YouTube video posted Friday. On Thursday, Holder was in San Francisco to visit the Willie Mays Boys & Girls Club, where he played a pickup game with local police officers and teens. As Holder finishes up his six-year term, expected to be replaced by attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch, he doesn't seem too worried about his skills. ""I'm finished, guys,"" Holder said as he high-fived another player after his shot. ""I'm going out on top."" White House adviser Valerie Jarrett tweeted out the video, challenging Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who played basketball while attending Harvard, to show his own skills. Obama, on the other hand, was thinking back to his 2008 campaign for the presidency, when he would squeeze in pickup games whenever he could. At a campaign event in 2008 he played a three-on-three game refereed by WNBA star Tamika Catchings. When asked about the possibility of playing Catchings in a one-on-one game, he was less than confident. ""She was a witness to my domination on the court, but when it comes to me playing her one-on-one, at this point I'm not sure."" The President probably remembers all too well when one basketball game resulted in an injury. In 2010, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the President received a dozen stitches after getting hit with an errant elbow during a Friday morning basketball game with White House aide Reggie Love and others at Fort McNair military base in Washington. Although there's been no sign of any other recent basketball-related injuries, the President said he's wary of taking the risk. ""The chances of an Achilles tear or an ACL injury is increasing each month, and then the satisfaction I get from playing diminishes because I'm so bad,"" the President said. ""I think golf, likelihood of injury much lower.  But I still love the game.  I still love the game."" Catchings, however, is ready. Friday afternoon she tweeted: ""I'm game LOL""","President Obama says he leans more toward playing golf these days .

"(CNN)Coalition airstrikes again pounded ISIS positions in Iraq and Syria on Saturday, including at least a dozen strikes on Mosul, where anti-ISIS forces have been trying to weaken targets ahead of an anticipated fight to wrest Iraq's second largest city from the terror group. A CNN crew watching from Kurdish positions on Mount Zartak, to the southeast of Mosul, saw at least 12 blasts in the city and heard jets streaking overhead. ISIS swept into Mosul in June, with Iraqi forces at the time largely fleeing the advance. The Sunni Muslim terror group, also called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, folded Mosul into what it calls its Islamic caliphate -- territory that it has captured in both countries. Kurdish forces, which protect a Kurdish autonomous region in northern Iraq, recently have been trying to surround Mosul to cut off ISIS's lines of supply from Syria, setting up what could be an eventual assault to try to expel the terror group from the city. Iraqi ground forces could begin a move to retake the city as soon as April, a U.S. Central Command official told CNN earlier this week. Kurdish forces say the frequency and intensity of airstrikes on Mosul have increased sharply since Tuesday, when ISIS released a video showing its fighters burning to death a Jordanian captive pilot, Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, who was captured in December after his jet crashed in Syria. ISIS defenses in Mosul could be trigger for U.S. ground troop recommendation . Airstrikes also hit ISIS targets near the terror group's de facto capital of Raqqa, Syria, on Saturday, anti-ISIS activists there said. At least 10 explosions were reported Saturday in Hazema, north of Raqqa, and six other strikes happened in Tabqa to the west, the activist group ""Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently"" said on Twitter. Jordan, one of Syria's southern neighbors, again sent its jets to strike ISIS targets Saturday, and all of the jets returned safely to their bases, Jordanian state-run TV reported. Jordan, which has promised revenge for al-Kasasbeh, has publicly pressed to participate in more of the coalition's airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. U.S. and coalition aircraft conducted 11 airstrikes over Syria and 15 airstrikes over Iraq from 8 a.m. Friday to 8 a.m. Saturday, the U.S. military said. ISIS declared it had established a caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria last year. Since then, it has gone on a murderous rampage that has included beheadings of foreigners. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and Syrians have fled areas it has seized. The United States, along with European and Arab nations, began airstrikes against the terror group last year. ISIS militants have destroyed a bridge they recently used to assault Iraq's oil-rich Kirkuk city -- a possible attempt to hinder a counterattack against them, a Kurdish political and military leader said Saturday. About 30 kilometers southwest of Kirkuk, ISIS late Friday blew up a bridge that helps connect an ISIS-held area to the city, said Saman Jabari, a senior Kurdish political leader who also commands Kurdish Peshmerga troops near Kirkuk. ISIS had used the bridge to reach the Kirkuk area in a surprise attack on January 30, Jabari said. Kurdish troops have counter-attacked since. As the coalition's struggle against ISIS continued in northern Iraq, a pair of suicide bombings on Saturday killed at least three dozen people hundreds of kilometers to the south in Iraq's capital, Baghdad, a police source in the city said. An attacker blew himself up at a busy restaurant in southeastern Baghdad's Al-Jadida neighborhood, killing at least 30 people and injuring 66 others, the police source said. In the center of the city, a different suicide bombing at a market killed six people and injured 28 others, the source said. Information about who was responsible for the bombings wasn't immediately available. CNN's Phil Black reported from Iraq's Mosul area.

"(CNN)Weeks after a grand jury chose not to indict the officer who shot Michael Brown, officials have released a new mound of documents from the weeks of proceedings. They include more witness interviews, an autopsy conducted by a Justice Department medical examiner, as well as radio communications from the day of the shooting, which CNN has reported on previously. The documents do not seem to shed any new light on the events that led to Officer Darren Wilson shooting Brown. On November 24, the day the grand jury's decision was announced, the St. Louis County prosecutor's office released thousands of documents from the proceedings.  Among the details that emerged: Wilson fired his gun 12 times; the officer said he feared Brown could beat him to death; and Wilson said he was not carrying a stun gun because ""it is not the most comfortable thing. They are very large."" The latest document release does not include one notable element: the FBI interview with witness Dorian Johnson, Brown's friend who was with him at the time of his shooting. Despite the promises of St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch, who had promised to make all witness testimony in the case public, McCulloch's office told CNN affiliate KSDK that it has kept some records secret at the request of federal authorities, who are still investigating the incident. Executive assistant Ed Magee said the office had ""turned over and relinquished control"" of the FBI's interview, according to USA Today. He said the FBI asked the county not to release records that are part of an ongoing federal civil rights probe. What Darren Wilson told the Ferguson grand jury . The Justice Department autopsy found that Brown's multiple gunshot wounds included one in the right hand at close range. Those findings are similar to previous autopsy results.

"(CNN)Some members of the U.S. Congress may be resisting proposed new sanctions on Iran, but their opposition doesn't seem likely to stop Congress passing legislation on Tehran's nuclear program by the end of March. As one of the negotiators who sat across the table from the Iranians for the past 15 months, though, I can assure you that legislation at this juncture risks undermining a deal that is clearly in the interest of all parties. Fortunately, there now seems to be broad consensus that introducing more sanctions with immediate effect would simply play into the hands of Iranian hard-liners. With that in mind, ideas for moving legislation have turned to focus on two concepts: establishing a ""trigger"" for new sanctions, linked either to an arbitrary future date or a collapse in the talks, and defining what would constitute a good deal and requiring an ""up or down"" vote on it. But as attractive as these concepts might appear, movement of such legislation still risks sparking an escalatory cycle that the talks neither need nor can handle.  Indeed, Iran's parliament has already demonstrated the risk of raising the stakes now. In a step that directly mirrors the Senate Banking Committee's decision on January 29 to bring to the Senate floor a ""trigger"" sanctions bill, Iranian lawmakers moved forward a bill of their own that would require the termination of all compliance with the Joint Plan of Action, or JPOA, if new U.S. sanctions were approved or imposed. Should talks collapse, there is common understanding that the JPOA would fall apart and the status quo approach would return. But, through their separate actions, legislators on both sides guarantee it. To justify such a risk, proponents of new U.S. legislation often suggest that there are doubts internationally that sanctions will be expanded significantly should talks fail. However, there is scant evidence to support this supposition and much to suggest otherwise. For a start, sanctions enforcement has continued apace during the JPOA, which was originally agreed in November 2013. Nearly o100 entities and individuals have been sanctioned, and there are daily efforts by U.S. personnel to investigate cases and work with foreign partners on enforcement. Second, although businesses are showing new interest in Iran, no new commercial deals have emerged. I have discussed this issue with companies and banks, and they have relayed that they are waiting to see whether a final deal can be reached before plunging back into Iran because it was expensive and complicated to get out in the first place, and because many underlying risks remain present.  The fact is that they won't go back until they know how the talks will turn out. Other critics focus on the quality of the deal being negotiated and want Congress to have a say. And as a negotiator, I spent almost as much time with members of Congress over the past 15 months as I did with Iranians and the P5+1.  As a result, I was acutely aware of congressional views and ensured that they directly affected the policy options we pursued in the talks.  Congressional concerns were raised at the negotiating table not only by U.S. negotiators, but by fellow members of the P5+1, and even by the Iranians.  Congress is very much present in these negotiations. It is also important to remember that the disadvantages of defining a deal explicitly in law outweigh the theoretical negotiating advantages. If the point is to prevent a bad deal from being implemented by the United States, then Congress has less provocative ways to do so while talks are ongoing, including by refusing to fund the implementation of such a deal once reached.  If the point is to create red lines for the Iranian negotiators, then Congress will have the opposite of its desired effect:  defining a ""good deal"" in detail forces Iranian negotiators to cross our red lines to maintain their revolutionary credentials and sell a deal at home. Indeed, I have seen first-hand how Iran tends to reject any P5+1 idea that is leaked, because, if accepted, then Iran would be forced to admit a concession.  Negotiating in private, with U.S. and Iranian requirements neutrally described in public, avoids this morass. All this suggests that the push for legislation now hinges on the claim that U.S. strength needs to be reasserted.  This is staggering to me.  If nothing else, our sanctions efforts against Iran -- of which I was a leading architect since 2006 -- demonstrate the strength and reach of U.S. power, if judiciously applied. The Iranian government will have to make real concessions to correct the damage sanctions have done to its economy -- it is not the United States that needs to shore up its position and we should act accordingly. Ironically, the one thing that could imperil our leadership abroad would be to undermine the talks at home.  And legislation can have other negative effects: a slightly noticed part of the Iranian bill would require all sanctions to be terminated before a comprehensive arrangement could be implemented.  If this became law, then Iranian negotiators would be powerless to allow the phased reduction of sanctions in response to Iran taking specific nuclear steps, a key element of the P5+1 approach. Ultimately, there is a role for Congress to play, but lawmakers should fulfill their oversight role without being unnecessarily prescriptive and, having set expectations for negotiators already, should leave the exact contours of a deal to our scientists, experts and diplomats. Congress should not harm its own cause by legislating on Iran now.","Congress has been discussing whether to impose more sanctions on Iran .

"Eight-year-old Laney Brown will never see Christmas again. Her doctors say leukemia will take her soon. Laney loves music. Loves to dance, loves Taylor Swift, loves Christmas carols. As her dying wishes, she asked to meet the country superstar and for some people to come by her house for a night of caroling, CNN affiliate WFMZ reported. On Friday -- her birthday -- Laney and Swift video chatted through FaceTime, a software application that allows callers to see each other on Apple products. Saturday night the singers came. At first it was hundreds of people, then thousands. Then it was 10,000. They came to her home in West Reading, Pennsylvania, and even though she was too weak to go to the window, she heard the wonderful music. ""I can hear you now!!! Love you!"" she said through a photo her family posted to a Team Laney Facebook page showing the girl, two thumbs up despite a breathing mask, lying in bed. Laney was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia seven months ago. Last week doctors told her family that she has 70% cancer cells in her blood. She came home from the hospital on Thursday and said she wanted to hear Christmas carols. So two days later people came from all over. Her dance team was there to honor her through one last number. Even Santa showed up. Many of them held back tears. ""I can't even express how I feel,"" Krysta Rebe, who has a daughter Laney's age, told WFMZ. It was only an hour of singing, but it lifted the spirits of everyone who jammed the block outside the Browns' home. On Facebook one woman wrote that she had seen and taken part in a miracle. ""As much as I want that miracle to be saving the life of an 8-year-old little girl, Laney, the miracle was an 8-year-old little girl teaching an entire community, town, city and the whole country the true meaning of Christmas,"" Marianne Franken wrote.

"Gerardo Martino was unveiled as Barcelona's new manager Friday -- promising not to change their attacking style of play but introducing ""new ideas"" to help the Catalan giants dominate European club football. The 50-year-old Martino has replaced Tito Vilanova, who stood down last week to undergo further treatment for throat cancer. Martino, who took Newell's Old Boys to the Argentine Clausura Championship, has signed a two-year deal at the Nou Camp. He will take charge of a side which romped to the La Liga title last season with a record points tally, but suffered a crushing humiliation in the semifinals of the Champions League, going down 7-0 on aggregate to eventual winners Bayern Munich. It led to suggestions that Barcelona needed to make tactical changes, having gone out at the same stage of the competition for the past two years, but Martino believes it will not need a major revamp. ""Every team, even Barcelona which has already attained certain moments of excellence, can always improve, and Barca still has things to win,"" he told gathered reporters. Analysis: Martino who? Is El Tata the right man for Barca? ""We are going to try to recover certain things that we've seen when Barca  have been at their best, and add a few ideas of our own."" Martino confirmed that Barca's talisman and fellow Argentinian Lionel Messi would continue to operate in his current role. ""He will continue to play in exactly the same position. He has to feel comfortable,  after that he'll do the rest."" Messi will be joined by big-name Brazilian signing Neymar for the new campaign, while Martino appeared to rule out the departure of midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who is the subject of a bid from English Premier League champions Manchester United. Asked about United's attempts to sign the Spanish international with a $38 million bid on the table, Martino gave a firm reply. ""If the club has signaled its refusal twice, then I signal it a third time - and  so he (Fabregas) will be staying here,"" Club vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who flanked Martino with president Sandro Rosell, also chipped in. ""We are not thinking of selling Cesc,"" he said. ""That United are showing interest in Cesc is normal, because he's a great  player. ""That doesn't upset us, that makes us proud that they want one of our players. ""But whatever the offer, we won't be selling him. We are relying on him."" Martino's appointment Tuesday came as a surprise as he has no managerial experience in Europe. But his pedigree is clear, winning four championship titles in Paraguay, before guiding their national team to the quarterfinals of the 2010 World Cup. He has also been a success at Newell's, a former club of Messi. Martino is the fourth Argentine to take the helm at Barcelona after Roque Olsen, Helenio Herrera and Cesar Luis Menotti.","Barcelona new manager Gerardo Martino unveiled Friday .

"New York (CNN)What kind of microscopic life lurks in the depths of New York's sprawling subway system -- on railings, turnstiles, benches, the ubiquitous closing doors? A team of New York City scientists spent more than a year collecting hundreds of samples of microorganisms. Some DNA samples on subway surfaces matched no known organisms studied before, while others were fragments associated with anthrax and the bubonic plague. In some cases, the germs reflected the diversity of the city's neighborhoods. Medical students, graduate students and volunteers -- under the direction of senior investigator Dr. Christopher E. Mason of Weill Cornell Medical College -- had the unenviable task of spending 17 months in the New York underground collecting microorganisms from every subway station along the system's 24 lines, according to a report published this week. There should be a Nobel category for that? Scientists chose the New York City subway system because it is the largest in the world by station count and transports 5.5 million people per day, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ""This vast urban ecosystem is a precious resource that requires monitoring to sustain and secure it against acts of bioterrorism, environmental disruptions or disease outbreaks,"" according to the report. That New York's underground -- or its surface, for that matter -- teems with all manner of repugnant microbes is no surprise to any longtime resident or newcomer to the city. But the scientists believe the largest and most dense city in the United States is the ideal setting for some of the first ever large-scale microbe studies, according to the report. The goal: to develop new ways to monitor disease outbreaks and guard against bioterrorism threats. After sequencing samples were picked up at subway stations, researchers determined that nearly half did ""not match any known organism"" -- a fact that underscores ""the vast wealth of unknown species that are ubiquitous in urban areas,"" the report said. Those that were identifiable were studied, however, with researchers determining the effect those microorganisms could have on the general subway-riding public. More than half of the bacteria strands identified were not associated with disease but some 31% could affect ""immune-compromised, injured, or disease-susceptible populations,"" the report said. The researchers tested culture samples grouped by the subway station in which they found and determined that 28% represented colonies ""resistant to standard antibiotics."" One subway station even produced a ""multi-drug-resistant culture."" ""These results indicate, not surprisingly, that there are live bacterial communities present on the subway, but they also show that a substantive proportion of these possess some resistance to commonly used antibiotics,"" according to the report. Even though researchers picked up elements deemed ""infectious agents"" by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as anthrax and the bubonic plague, subway users are not at risk, the report said. Even low levels of those elements ""will not necessarily confer a risk of acquiring these pathogens."" ""The subway, in general, is primarily a safe surface,"" the report said. ""Although evidence of B. anthracis, Y. pestis, MRSA, and other CDC infectious agents was found on the subway system in multiple stations, the results do not suggest that the plague or anthrax is prevalent, nor do they suggest that NYC residents are at risk."" New York City health officials called the study ""deeply flawed."" ""The interpretation of the results is misleading,"" the Health Department said in a statement. ""We don't know what bacteria they found, but for a number of reasons, we're convinced that it wasn't the plague or anthrax. There are other possible explanations for their findings, ‎and it is a common and best practice in scientific papers for authors to acknowledge them. Instead, the Cornell team simply claimed that they had found these bacteria without acknowledging any scientific uncertainty."" Phew! One subway station in particular yielded fascinating results. The South Ferry Station on the No. 1 subway line, which had been closed for a period of time after being completely flooded during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, according to the report. In the station on the southernmost tip of Manhattan, scientists picked up species normally associated with the maritime life two years after the flooding. The organisms ""mirror bacteria that are more commonly associated with fish species, marine environments, or very cold Antarctic environments; yet these species are still distinct from"" others sampled from the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, which was also studied in this report. But it did not take a natural disaster for the microorganism ecosystems of a subway station to vary noticeably from the next station. The study found that DNA swabbed at certain subway stations paralleled the ethnic demographic of the community that lived around it. Researchers studied samples that could be analyzed with ""ancestry-informative markers"" and then compared the results to a map of a demographic community compiled from the 2010 census. In one station in a primarily Hispanic/Amerindian area of the Bronx, for instance, the team identified Mexican, Colombian and Puerto Rican as the top three ancestries. There was also an increase in Han Chinese and Japanese indicators at the subway station that matched an area adjacent to the station, according to census data. Mason said the report can have broad and lasting implications. A DNA clue can ""represent a 'genetic history' of that person's daily or weekly travels,"" which may evoke a fear of privacy invasion in some. But there is also a potential for new forensic tools and methods to those in the criminal justice field. In the immediate future, however, Mason and his team believe their study is a ""first step"" towards protecting the health of New Yorkers -- and could be the basis for a ""smart city"" where leaders use the data to improve city planning as well as management of mass transit and human health. And leave the latex gloves at home. ""It is absolutely not necessary to ride the subway with gloves on,"" Mason, the senior investigator, told CNN affiliate WCBS. ""When we were taking samples, I saw people with paper towels, gloves with plastic on their hands -- all of it is unnecessary.""","New York City health officials say the study is ""deeply flawed""

"Atlanta (CNN)More family members are coming to Atlanta to see Bobbi Kristina Brown in the hospital. On Friday, grandmother Cissy Houston arrived at Emory University Hospital, a source close the family told CNN. She's the mother of the late musical superstar Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina's mother. Other family members, including Bobbi Kristina's father, singer Bobby Brown, have been in Atlanta for days. Bobbi Kristina, 21, was found facedown in a bathtub full of water in her Atlanta area home last Saturday. The Roswell police spokeswoman said Brown was ""unresponsive, meaning not breathing, no heartbeat."" Doctors have placed her in a medically induced coma, a source close to the family said soon after she was hospitalized. The status of her brain function won't be known until sedatives are reduced, the source told CNN. A week after she was rushed to the hospital, details of her condition are scare. Sources close to the family say she opened her eyes briefly last Monday and also suffered seizures that same day. It was not immediately clear what medical significance these reported events have in Brown's case. Meanwhile, the three-year anniversary of Whitney Houston's death approaches. On February 11, 2012, she was found dead in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel near Los Angeles hours before she was to attend a pre-Grammy Awards party. A coroner ruled her death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Brown is her only child. After Houston's death, Bobbi Kristina talked of pursuing a career in acting and music, just like her mother. In 2012, she reportedly lobbied for a role in a planned biopic of her mother's life. Lifetime's ""Whitney,"" which was directed by actress Angela Bassett, debuted in January 2015, but the Houston family was not involved. Concerns that she may have substance abuse issues, as her mother did, intensified in July 2014 after a picture was posted on her Instagram account showing a young woman who looked like Brown appearing to be smoking from a bong. Bobbi Kristina Brown ""was not breathing"" when Nick Gordon -- the man she has referred to as her husband -- and a friend, who's been identified as Maxwell Lomas, found her inside her townhouse in the Atlanta suburb of Roswell. They called 911 and performed CPR until emergency crews arrived and took over, police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said. Nobody knows what caused Brown's unresponsiveness, Holland said, but police consider it a medical incident at this time. She said investigators had found nothing to indicate it was drug- or alcohol-related. Bobbi Kristina Brown had said she was married to Gordon, who had lived with Houston and her daughter since he was 12 years old. However, Bobby Brown attorney Christopher Brown said the two were never married. CNN's Carolyn Sung, Lisa Respers France, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Sunny Hostin, Nischelle Turner and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Cissy Houston arrives to see granddaughter Bobbi Kristina Brown, source says .

"Demanding ""justice for Mike Brown"" and other African-Americans killed by police, protesters hit the streets Friday in eastern Missouri, kicking off four days of demonstrations, discussions and civil disobedience. ""Today is not the start of an event, today is the beginning of your movement,"" a man said Friday through a megaphone, with protesters in the crowd echoing his words. ""From this day forward, we say no more. We say enough."" The event, which has been dubbed ""Ferguson October"" and the ""Weekend of Resistance,"" centers on the 18-year-old Brown. Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed the black teenager on August 9. Authorities have said Brown attacked the officer and tried to take his gun; Brown's camp contends the unarmed teenager had his hands in the air when he was shot. The dispute soon spilled over onto the streets of the St. Louis suburb, sometimes violently, as protesters and police clashed. That public discord has died down somewhat, though the events Friday through Monday aim to keep the demonstrators' message out there -- both to demand Wilson's arrest and to bring attention, more generally, to what they describe as racial profiling and police violence elsewhere as well. ""Our country can no longer deny the epidemic of police violence facing black and brown communities,"" the movement's website states. ""Mike Brown is now part of a long list of people like John Crawford, Ezell Ford, Eric Garner, Oscar Grant and countless others who have been unjustly killed by police. Their lives mattered."" The first event happened Friday afternoon under rainy skies in Clayton, about 8 miles south of Ferguson. Demonstrators picked this spot because it's the office of St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch. For months, McCulloch has faced -- and resisted -- months of calls to push harder the case against Wilson or to recuse himself entirely amid allegations he's too cozy with police and not a good representative for the local black community. Hundreds of people, many of them wearing rain jackets or carrying umbrellas, alternated chants of ""don't shoot!"" and ""hands up"" -- a reference to their claim Brown was shot with his hands high, in apparent surrender. A few people addressed the crowd with megaphones, before the crowd moved toward McCulloch's office. ""Mike Brown means ... we've got to fight back!"" the spirited, if soaked, crowd chanted. McCulloch's office is presenting the case to a St. Louis County grand jury, which could indict Wilson on charges related to Brown's death or opt not to. The deadline for the grand jury to reach a decision is January 7. But Brown's death isn't the only one on protesters' minds. There are also the high-profile deaths of men like Garner, Grant and others, who died at the hands of police officers across the country. That includes a shooting Wednesday, just 12 miles from Ferguson in St. Louis. Protests erupted there after a white police officer fatally shot another black teenager. But this one was very different from the Brown case, because this black teenager was armed, according to authorities. Many activists have expressed dismay not just at one particular case, but at what they characterize as a disturbing pattern of police being too heavy-handed, especially against blacks. That includes anger over how law enforcement handled protesters who hit the streets in the days after Brown's shooting. ""I'm fed up with (what's) been going on in my neighborhood and this police brutality,"" a Ferguson resident said at Friday's protest. ""I'm fed up with it."" Four days capped by 'civil disobedience' Friday's march was the start of four days of planned events in the same vein. Demonstrators will invoke a Mexican Halloween tradition, and they will erect a Day of the Dead altar on Friday night in Ferguson to memorialize Brown and the deaths of any other loved ones offered up by participants. The altars feature candles, flowers, and photos of the deceased. Participants also plan to hold a silent candlelight march carrying a mirrored coffin 2 miles from the altar site to the Ferguson Police Department, organizers said. On Saturday, activists and protesters plan to march through downtown St. Louis and rally at Kiener Plaza in the center of downtown to ""show our strength as we stand united against police violence, both here in Ferguson and across the country"" and to send a message of ""Not One More,"" organizers said. On Sunday, several events will be held in St. Louis, including an evening meeting of ""reflection and resistance"" at St. Louis University's Chaifetz Arena with author and professor Cornel West, rapper-activist Tef Poe, poet and activist Suheir Hammad, and Rabbi Susan Talve of St. Louis' Central Reform Congregation. On Monday, a closing ceremony will feature participants removing items from the Day of the Dead memorial and taking them home ""to seed work in their community,"" said organizers, which includes the groups Hands Up United, Organization for Black Struggle, and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment. The organizers seek ""to build momentum for a nationwide movement against police violence,"" their website said. The official schedule also calls for ""a series of actions throughout the Ferguson and St. Louis area"" exercising civil disobedience.

"U.S. fighter jets and drones repeatedly bombed Sunni Islamic extremists in northern Iraq on Friday, targeting what officials described as ISIS artillery units and convoys advancing on the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. The airstrikes ramped up America's involvement in Iraq where ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is seizing control of towns and key infrastructure in an advance that has forced hundreds of thousands to run for their lives. The critical Mosul Dam is now in the hands of ISIS fighters, authorities said, while 150 hundred miles to the east tens of thousands of Iraq's minority Yazidis were trapped on a mountain by ISIS fighters below who vowed to kill them. News of the second round of U.S. airstrikes came just after the governor of Irbil told CNN that ISIS may be as close as 30 kilometers (just over 18 miles) from the city of more than a million people. The airstrikes began just hours after President Barack Obama authorized ""targeted airstrikes,"" saying in a televised address late Thursday that the United States had an obligation to protect its personnel in Iraq and prevent a potential genocide of minority groups by ISIS. Obama said there will be no buildup of U.S. combat troops in Iraq. ""As commander in chief, I will not allow the United States to be dragged into fighting another war in Iraq,"" the President said. Hitting ISIS . Two U.S. F/A 18 fighters first struck an ISIS artillery unit outside of Irbil, dropping two 500-pound laser-guided bombs at about 6:45 a.m. ET Friday, Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said. Later, a drone targeted an ISIS mortar position, Kirby said. When ISIS fighters returned to the site a short time later, the drone struck the target again, he said. That was followed a short time later by a second round of airstrikes, carried out by four U.S. fighter jets, that targeted an ISIS convoy of seven vehicles and another mortar position, Kirby said. The F/A 18s made two passes, dropping a total of eight laser-guided bombs, he said. Before the ISIS onslaught, the region had been the most stable in Iraq and a cooperative ally of the United States. U.S. military advisers and consular personnel are stationed in Irbil. At this point, the United States has hundreds of military personnel in Iraq, including advisers sent in recent weeks to coordinate with Iraqi and Kurdish military officials in response to the ISIS rampage. The USS George H.W. Bush and other Navy ships also are in the region, and the FA/18s in Friday's initial strike came from the aircraft carrier, officials said. Airstrikes are ""very important"" because ISIS fighters are well-armed and are outgunning the Kurdish forces, thanks to the weapons the militants seized from the Iraqi military in Mosul, Irbil Gov. Nawzad Hadi said. Map: Where is ISIS? Even as the airstrikes were under way, there was news that ISIS militants captured Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, just north of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. According to a senior Kurdish official, the militant fighters have been using U.S.-made weapons seized during fighting from the Iraqi army, including M1 Abrams tanks. There had been conflicting reports about who controlled the dam on the Tigris River, with heavy fighting under way between ISIS fighters and Kurdish forces, known as peshmerga. U.S. officials have warned that a failure of the dam would be catastrophic, resulting in flooding all the way to Baghdad. In other fighting, an Iraqi airstrike killed 45 ISIS fighters and injured 60 Friday in the northern town of Sinjar, the country's state-run National Media Center said. Sinjar is the town that ISIS overran last weekend, forcing tens of thousands of Yazidis to flee into surrounding mountains without food, water or shelter and prompting concerns of a potential genocide. The Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. U.S. flights prohibited . In other signs of a growing regional conflict: The Federal Aviation Administration issued a notice prohibiting U.S. airlines from flying through Iraqi airspace ""due to the hazardous situation created by the armed conflict."" The developments showed that the lightning advance by ISIS fighters across northern Iraq this year has become a battle for the nation's future and overall stability in a part of the world wracked for decades by periodic war. U.S. warplanes patrolling the skies over northern Iraq have a ""green light"" to go after perceived ISIS threats to the Kurdish capital, Irbil, or to minority populations, said deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. Airstrikes are also possible to help Kurdish forces end the siege by ISIS in the northern Iraqi mountains, where tens of thousands of Yazidis have sought refuge, Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Friday. ISIS fighters have surrounded the Yazidis on the ground below. ""If there can be American military might that can tip (the) balance, we'll look for an opportunity to do that,"" Earnest said. Kurdish pleas . In announcing his airstrike decision Thursday night, Obama said the militants would get hit ""should they move towards the city."" Kurdish leaders have been pleading for the United States or NATO to buttress their forces against ISIS from the air. The President seems to have heard their appeal. ""We do whatever is necessary to protect our people,"" Obama said, adding, ""We support our allies when they're in danger."" Before Obama announced the airstrikes, two U.S. military cargo planes airdropped 5,300 gallons of water and 8,000 meals onto Mount Sinjar, where some Yazidi children had died from dehydration. According to a U.S. official, a Predator drone flying overhead indicates the Yazidis have 63 of the 72 pallets dropped with aid supplies. It's not clear if the other pallets missed the drop zone or are in ISIS hands. Late Friday, the Defense Department announced that U.S. military planes made another airdrop of food and water for Iraqi citizens stranded on Mount Sinjar. The British government said Friday it would support the U.S. humanitarian effort and planned airdrops of its own. French President François Hollande joined the growing chorus of condemnation of the ISIS attacks and called on the international community to respond. ""France is ready to take its part,"" Hollande said in a statement from his office that called for the European Union ""to take an active role very quickly""  and put in place all the necessary assistance to respond to the crisis. Meanwhile, the United Nations in Iraq was ""urgently preparing a humanitarian corridor to allow those in need to flee the areas under threat,"" said Nickolay Mladenov, the special representative to the U.N. secretary-general. He welcomed the ""cooperation between the Government of Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the international community to help prevent genocide and fight terrorism,"" according to a U.N. statement. Iraqi Foreign MInister Hoshyar Zebari told reporters Friday from Irbil that his government is working with the KRG -- including supplying the Kurdish peshmerga with ammunition and military helicopters. This hasn't always been the case ""because of political issues,"" the KRG's official website notes. Yet the same site reported that Zebari said ""it is now clear that the peshmerga and the Iraqi security forces are fighting together against a common enemy."" Beheadings . ISIS has executed people who don't share their fanatical interpretation of Sunni Islam and posted videos of their killings to the Internet. ""Convert to Islam or die"" is the militants' ultimatum to those captured. They also have beheaded victims and placed their heads on spikes to strike terror in the population, a senior administration official said. Already, the Obama administration is rapidly funneling weapons to Iraqi forces. Factories are operating seven days a week to produce them, a senior administration official said. The administration has pushed for Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated regime to be replaced by an ethnically more inclusive government . But two Republican senators said in a statement that the President's actions do not go far enough. And the United States should not wait on Iraq to pull together before Washington takes action. Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina want to see U.S. forces take the fight to ISIS. ""It should include U.S. airstrikes against ISIS leaders, forces, and positions both in Iraq and Syria,"" their statement read. Who will stop ISIS?

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN)Nigeria's elections have been postponed from next Saturday to March 28, the country's election commission announced Saturday. The postponement was due to security concerns, the commission said. The Islamist terror group Boko Haram has increased its attacks against troops and civilians in the weeks leading up to the elections. ""In consideration of the advice by the security agencies, it will be unconscionable to have elections without adequate security,"" said elections chairman Attahiru Jega, according to a tweet from the Independent National Electoral Commission. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, who is running for re-election, has been criticized for not doing enough to combat Boko Haram. In January, an angry mob pelted his motorcade with rocks while he was visiting northeastern Nigeria. Jonathan a member of the Peoples Democratic Party, faces a formidable challenge from a opposition alliance. The All Progressives Congress called the delay a ""major setback for Nigerian democracy."" "" I strongly appeal to all Nigerians to remain calm and desist from violence and any activity which will compound this unfortunate development. We must not fall into this obvious trap,"" party chairman John Odigie-Oyegun. ""Change we must. They can only delay it; No one can stop it."" The announcement comes the same day Benin, Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria and Chad pledged to deploy 8,700 troops, police and civilians, as part of a regional effort to fight Boko Haram. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, as well as bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Recently attacks in Nigeria and in neighboring Cameroon and Chad have increased. Boko Haram attacks Nigerian city in second takeover attempt .

"Sen. Lindsey Graham hinted at China's involvement in the North Korean cyberattack on Sony Pictures and called for additional U.S. action against North Korea to make the hermit kingdom ""feel the pain that is due."" ""I can't imagine anything this massive happening in North Korea without China being involved or at least knowing about it,"" Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union."" Graham called for more sanctions against the regime and said President Barack Obama should put North Korea back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism, something Obama is currently reviewing. The Republican senator gave Obama rare kudos for the President's handling of the North Korean affair so far. ""So far so good, Mr. President,"" Graham said, despite adding that Obama should have labeled the attack as cyberterrorism and not ""cybervandalism,"" as Obama called the hack in a CNN interview last week. ""What's happened here it shows how exposed we are in America to cyberattack,"" Graham said. ""If North Korea can do this to a major corporation in America, what can other people do to our country."" The FBI determined that North Korea was behind the attack on Sony Pictures amid plans to release ""The Interview,"" a movie about an assassination plot against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The FBI added that it did not suspect any other country was involved in the attack. Graham did criticize Obama's leadership of the U.S.'s prison at Guantanamo Bay. While Graham supports Obama's vow to close the detention facility, the Senate Armed Services Committee member said he doesn't want the U.S. to release terror suspects held at the facility. Instead, Graham wants the detainees transferred to a military prison in the U.S., where many would continue to be held indefinitely without trial ""under the laws of war."" More than 100 prisoners have been released from Guantanamo after a top U.S. task force deemed them low-level threats to the U.S. RELATED: Shutting down Guantanamo: Who's left and what's in the way . ""I don't think there's any appetite in Congress to close Guantanamo Bay. I think the American people want to keep it open,"" Graham said. ""Most people in the world are more worried about terrorists leaving Guantanamo Bay than they are the prison being open."" The U.S. released 10 detainees in the last month and hopes to transfer dozens more in the next six months as Obama looks to close Guantanamo in the last two years of his presidency.","Graham said he believes China was involved or knew about North Korea's cyberattack .

"The Obama administration has taken another step in its effort to combat rape on college campuses with the release of a new report. The White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault produced the 20-page report. The task force, including Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, spent the last three months talking to ""thousands of people"" and compiled a number of very specific recommendations: . More data: The task force wants to know more about the scope and scale of the problem. The report cites a statistic from the National Institute of Justice that one in five women experience rape or attempted rape in college but say the group needs to know more. This year, the task force is pushing schools to use its tool kit in 2015 to survey their campuses. By 2016, the task force will be reporting. The report said ""we will explore legislative or administrative options to require the schools to conduct a survey."" Survivors need more: In 2011, the administration first alerted schools about their responsibilities to survivors of sexual violence. The administration said that under Title IX schools had to address sexual violence in order to provide equal access to education. But schools have struggled with that. In the past three years many have been publicly cited for failing to live up to these standards. Most recently, the Department of Education announced that Tufts University ""failed to comply with Title IX"" in the way it handles sexual assaults. The school wrote it was ""surprised and disappointed"" with the finding, adding it was ""deeply committed to the safety and well-being of our students."" So now the administration is getting more specific. The importance of having confidential advocates is now emphasized. This point clarifies what had been confusing for many, namely that not everyone on college campuses has a duty to report. ""In recent years, some schools have directed nearly all their employees ... to report all the details of an incident to school officials,"" the report said, ""which can mean a survivor quickly loses control over what happens next."" That's a critical issue for many advocates who emphasize the importance of returning control to survivors. The administration calls for further training for those who deal with sexual violence on college campuses. ""Insensitive or judgmental comments -- or questions that focus on a victim's behavior (e.g., what she was wearing, her prior sexual history) rather than on the alleged perpetrator's -- can compound a victim's distress,"" the report notes. On the enforcement side, the report calls for new models for investigating and adjudicating cases on campus and for a pilot program aimed at rehabilitating offenders. Tuesday, the White House unveiled a new public service announcement encouraging men to help women who are in danger of being sexually assaulted. The PSA features several Hollywood stars, including Steve Carell and Seth Meyers and will air in movie theaters beginning in May. Transparency: One of the biggest problems with sexual violence on college campuses is that no college wants to admit it has a problem. Parents don't want to send their children to a school where data shows more sexual crimes occur, that could ding rankings and potentially cause problems with donors. Paradoxically, advocates say, those schools that have high numbers may actually be taking the problem seriously. That's because they have robust systems in place that allow for students to file complaints. Now the government wants to centralize all that data on NotAlone.gov. Accountability: It won't just be numbers on NotAlone.gov. The administration will also put forms online making it easier for students to complain if their school fails to live up to the other obligations. Many of the Department of Justice and Department of Education investigations over the years have resulted from student complaints. So what does this all mean? According to Know Your IX, an organization that seeks to educate college students about Title IX rights, it's a good step, but more is needed. ""These changes will mean little until Title IX enforcement is finally given teeth,"" the organization said. Know Your IX said the administration is reluctant to use the best leverage it currently has, namely pulling a school's federal funding. ""The agency has never once sanctioned a school for sexual violence-related violations of Title IX,"" the organization said. Students accuse Columbia of mishandling sexual assault complaints .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Poland will withdraw its troops from Iraq by the end of October, according to a spokesman for the Polish military Thursday. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, right, paid a surprise visit to Polish soldiers in Diwaniya in December. October 31 will be the last day of the Polish presence in Iraq, Major Dariusz Kacperczyk said, speaking from Warsaw. The precise date of withdrawal and when  security would be handed over to local forces in Qadisiya, the southern Iraqi Shiite province where most Polish troops in Iraq are based, are still being determined, he said. ""One thing we know for sure is that after the last day of October, there will be no more Polish soldiers in Iraq,"" Kacperczyk said. Poland's new prime minister, Donald Tusk, has promised to bring the troops home from Iraq, where Poland has one of the larger non-U.S. contingents. There are around 900 Polish troops in the war-torn country, with most in the Qadisiya capital of Diwaniya, some in Baghdad and others in the southern city of Kut. Twenty-two soldiers from Poland have lost their lives during the nearly five year war in Iraq. Meanwhile, in Baghdad, a parked car bomb detonated in a predominantly Shiite district on Thursday, killing five civilians and wounding eight other people, the Interior Ministry said. The attack followed a string of roadside bombings that wounded 21 people, according to the Interior Ministry. Those included a homemade bomb that exploded near a convoy of the deputy minister of electricity, wounding at least five people. The deputy minister in the convoy escaped injury, State TV reported. Three roadside bomb explosions in different parts of Baghdad wounded 16 people. Two of those attacks targeted police. In southern Iraq, one Iraqi was killed and five were wounded Thursday when British troops returned fire after an attack on their base in Basra, the British military said. The early morning rocket and mortar attack left three British soldiers with ""very minor injuries."" Troops fired back, killing an Iraqi and wounding five others. British authorities are investigating the incident. The British military handed over security control in Basra late last year to Iraqi security forces but maintains a presence in the region. Basra and other areas of southern Iraq have been rocked by fighting among rival Shiite militias. Also Thursday, Coalition troops detained 11 people in raids in the volatile northern Iraqi city of Mosul and in the Baghdad region, the U.S. military said. Troops in Mosul seized the alleged leader of an al Qaeda in Iraq suicide bombing network and two other people. They also captured two ""suspected terrorists"" in the city, which is soon to be the object of an Iraq-led offensive against militants. Six other people were arrested in operations near Abu Ghraib, in Baghdad province, and in Baghdad. E-mail to a friend .

"Editor's note: Below is an excerpt from author Alex Wellen's new novel, ""Lovesick."" In this chapter, after weeks of procrastinating, Andy Altman finally works up the nerve to ask his future father-in-law, Gregory Day, for his daughter Paige's hand in marriage. Alex Wellen is an award-winning television producer for CNN. Nothing like mixing love and a battle with a crime ring of geriatric gangsters to cause some dizziness. (CNN) -- I go to the dining room for some privacy. It's now or never. I press the speed dial for ""Gregory Home."" While the phone searches for a cell tower among the sticks, I confirm the coast is clear. Reception here is spotty. My phone flickers between one and three bars. You can't do this with anything less than three out of five. The quality of the connection is crucial. ""Come again, Andrew? Why on God's green earth would you want my dressing?"" I've got two bars. It's ringing. Holy crap! Holy crap! Holy crap! I'm getting married. I should have done this in person. I should have taken him to Applebee's or bought tickets to an Oakland A's game or just asked him over lunch at Langley's Diner. This should be easier. Doesn't every man secretly want a son? ""Hello,"" Gregory says, bracing for a telemarketer. ""Dad! It's me."" No. ""Mr. Day, Andy Altman here."" No. ""Gregory, we need to talk."" No. ""Is anyone there?"" ""Hi, it's Andy,"" I say finally. ""Hello, Andrew,"" he says, still concerned I might sell him something. I can hear him tearing paper like he's opening mail. ""Everything okay?"" he says suddenly. ""You bet. We arrived safely in Sonoma,"" I assure him. ""Paige is getting ready for dinner."" His daughter may have just turned thirty, but a father never wants to be reminded that his unwed daughter is on a sleepover with a boy. ""Ignorance is bliss,"" ""plausible deniability,"" this is how a father deals with his daughter's virginity, Paige tells me. ""After dinner, it's bingo at the Baptist Church, a mug of hot cocoa, and straight to separate sleeping quarters,"" I want to tell him. ""How are things?"" I ask, scanning the reception area, working up the nerve. ""Same as they were two hours ago,"" he says coolly. Gregory clears his throat: ""What can I do for you this evening?"" ""So I wanted to call,"" I say, taking a deep breath. ""Let me stop you right there. I don't need an apology about before. Just don't let it happen again. I want to put this whole evening behind us. Tomorrow's another day."" ""You want to put this evening behind us?"" ""Yes."" I let out a long sigh. ""God, I've never done this before,"" I say. Was that my inside voice or my outside voice? Calm down. ""I wanted to call you,"" my outside voice says. ""You know Paige and I have a wonderful time together. I love her very much and I would like to ask her to marry me. I have such great respect for you and I wouldn't feel right not checking with you first."" It sounded better in the shower. A tumbleweed rolls through the dining room. Crickets chirp. ""Hello?"" I ask. Gregory speaks, finally. ""I appreciate that, Andrew,"" he says kindly. ""I do."" He seems genuinely touched. ""When did you want to do this?"" Didn't I say ""tonight""? I swore I said ""tonight."" ""Tonight."" ""Tonight!"" He's appalled, his voice rising. ""You're proposing tonight and you're asking me now?"" ""You're totally right. I screwed up. I'm sorry. I was just worried about spoiling the surprise."" ""You don't trust me to keep a secret?"" Gregory demands. ""No, not at all, I trust you. I bet you're the best with secrets."" Gregory takes a deep breath. Then another. He clears his throat. I'm blowing this. ""Wait,"" he commands finally. ""Okay. No problem."" I lean against the dining room wall, sandwiching the cell phone between my ear and the window. I close my eyes, bracing for what Gregory might say next. Nine long hours pass in silence. Then I hear him take three short hits of his inhaler. ""Hello?"" I ask. ""Hello?"" he asks. ""Oh, hey, you're back."" ""What do you mean 'I'm back'?"" he asks. ""You're back, you told me to wait. Didn't you just go somewhere?"" ""I'm just sitting here. I was waiting for you to say something."" ""I thought you wanted me to wait,"" I say. ""I do. I want you to wait to ask Paige to get married."" It's as if Paige and I are back in the car and I've narrowly missed that head-on collision. My blood vessels widen. The adrenaline kicks in. What is he asking me? Is he saying no? Is he saying maybe? ""If this is about money,"" I prod, ""I've got savings."" ""That's not it at all."" ""You think a year is too short to get engaged,"" I conclude. ""It's been more like nine months, and that's not it either. Listen,"" he begins. ""I don't want to pressure you, Gregory,"" I jump in, ""but I love Paige. We're a good couple. I'd be honored to be a part of your family."" ""Just wait, Andy,"" he says, his voice shaky.

"Washington (CNN) -- A 21-year-old man who admitted posting online threats against the creators of the animated TV series ""South Park"" was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison. Zachary Adam Chesser encouraged violent jihadists to attack ""South Park"" writers for an episode that depicted the Prophet Mohammed in a bear suit, court documents said. He posted online messages that included the writers' home addresses and urged online readers to ""pay them a visit,"" the documents said. ""His actions caused people throughout the country to fear speaking out -- even in jest -- to avoid being labeled as enemies who deserved to be killed,"" U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said. ""The fact that a young man from Northern Virginia could support such violence and terror is a sobering reminder of the serious threat that homegrown jihadists pose to this country."" Chesser pleaded guilty in October to providing material support to terrorists, communicating threats and soliciting others to threaten violence. The three charges carried a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. ""I accept full responsibility for all of my actions, and I would like to take the opportunity to express remorse,"" he said in court. Chesser, who was born in the United States, converted to Islam in high school. U.S. District Court Judge Liam O'Grady told Chesser he had made a big leap from being a high school athlete to a traitor. Chesser also admitted that he tried to go to Somalia to join Al-Shabaab, an Islamic militant group that the United States considers a terrorist organization.","NEW: A ""South Park"" episode depicting Mohammed in a bear suit upset Chesser, documents say .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Pennsylvania woman has been indicted for conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and kill a person in a foreign country, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. Colleen LaRose, known as ""Jihad Jane"" and ""Fatima LaRose,"" has also been charged with making false statements to a government official and attempted identity theft. She was arrested in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 15, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office said. No arraignment date has been set, the official said. LaRose is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office. LaRose and five unindicted co-conspirators recruited men on the Internet ""to wage violent jihad in South Asia and Europe, and recruited women on the Internet who had passports and the ability to travel to and around Europe in support of violent jihad,"" according to a Justice Department statement. Irish police arrest 7 on murder plot charges . If convicted, LaRose faces a possible life prison sentence and a $1 million fine, the statement said. The conspiracy began in June 2008, when LaRose posted a comment on YouTube under the username JihadJane saying she is ""desperate to do something somehow to help"" Muslims, according to the indictment unsealed Tuesday. From December 2008 to October 2009, LaRose engaged in electronic communication with the five co-conspirators about their shared desires to wage jihad and become martyrs, according to the indictment. Read the indictment (PDF) LaRose and the co-conspirators, according to the statement, used the Internet to establish relationships with each another and develop plans ""which included martyring themselves, soliciting funds for terrorists, soliciting passports and avoiding travel restrictions (through the collection of passports and through marriage) in order to wage violent jihad."" According to a U.S. government official familiar with the case, LaRose was successful in recruiting some people to join the cause. She also was able to raise money, the official said, adding that she was in contact with committed jihadists in South Asia, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. The official declined to link her to any specific terrorist organizations. LaRose, the indictment claims, stole a U.S. passport at one point in order to ""facilitate an act of international terrorism."" She received ""a direct order to kill a citizen and resident of Sweden, and to do so in a way that would frighten 'the whole Kufar [non-believer] world.' "" The indictment does not identify the Swedish resident, but a government official familiar with the case acknowledged that Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was the intended target. Justice Department officials declined to comment. ""I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying,"" LaRose said via electronic communication, according to the indictment. LaRose, along with the co-conspirators, believed that ""her appearance and American citizenship would help her blend in while carrying out her plans, calling it a possible ""way to achieve what is in my heart,"" according to the indictment. The indictment alleges that LaRose even agreed to marry one of the co-conspirators to obtain residency status in a European country. LaRose traveled to Europe in August and ""tracked the intended target online in an effort to complete her task,"" the statement said. According to the indictment, LaRose told the co-conspirator who ordered the murder that she considers it an ""honour & a great pleasure to die or kill for"" the co-conspirator and pledged that ""only death will stop me here that I am so close to the target."" The killing did not occur, and LaRose was arrested about two weeks after the electronic message was sent. Mark Wilson, a federal public defender representing LaRose, declined to comment on the case Tuesday. LaRose, according to the Justice Department, was born in 1963 and lives outside Philadelphia in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

"Washington (CNN)The U.S. military is trying to gather as much intelligence as it can about ISIS defenses in Mosul to make a key decision about whether it's necessary to recommend American ground troops accompany Iraqi forces on the looming fight to retake Iraq's second largest city. The first move by Iraqi forces on the ground could come as soon as April, a U.S. Central Command official told CNN. ISIS is continuing to attempt to reinforce its defenses of Mosul. If those defenses grow to a significant level, then Iraqi forces may need U.S. help in locating military targets to hit, the official said. If ISIS defenses reach that critical point, the Pentagon and Central Command may then recommend to President Obama that U.S. troops be involved, the official said. Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of Central Command, and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, have both suggested a small number of U.S. troops could be needed to help with targeting, but not to go into combat. Now there is a more specific explanation of the trigger — ISIS defenses — that could cause the recommendation to go to the President. The United States already is observing ISIS members protecting their families by sending them out of Mosul, the official said. Recent coalition airstrikes around Mosul have been aimed at cutting off all supply lines to ISIS in the city. That way, when the military operation begins, ISIS will be isolated inside Mosul and unable to reinforce its fighters. Centcom believes ISIS has lost the ability to gain significant new amounts of territory in Iraq and hold onto it, the official said. And in both Iraq and Syria, the assessment is that ISIS fighters are stretched so thin, leaders are having to make choices and prioritize where they want to put their resources and fighters, the official added. That became a key reason they abandoned the fight for Kobani. There is also some evidence that the number of foreign fighters coming into Syria and Iraq may have declined over the last four to five months. However, hostage killings videos do underscore that the ISIS social media propaganda campaign remains strong, the official said. U.S. military and intelligence officials are noting the highly produced nature of some of the videos indicate ISIS had spent considerable time on the efforts.","Iraqi forces could begin to move to retake Mosul as soon as April, a U.S. official says .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- As more governments approve same-sex marriage laws, officials here are hoping to attract a growing part of the tourism market: gay honeymoons. The first couple to wed under Argentina's recent law allowing same-sex marriages nationwide arrives in Mexico this week on an all-expenses-paid trip -- part of a new push by the government in Mexico City, Mexico to woo gay travelers. ""We hope that many same-sex couples who get married around the world spend their honeymoons here,"" says Alejandro Rojas, the city's tourism secretary. In July, the city opened an office aimed at catering to gay tourists that officials describe as the first of its kind in Latin America. ""We are a very tolerant, liberal, avant-garde city,"" Rojas says. Officials inaugurated the new office by cutting a rainbow-colored ribbon. Rojas said the office's goal is to make Mexico City the No. 1 gay-friendly destination in Latin America. ""Mexico has a tradition of being a rather macho culture... This is a sign of a very important social change,"" says Argentinean architect Jose Luis David Navarro, who will be spending part of his honeymoon in Mexico City this week. The city's tourism secretary called to congratulate Navarro and his husband soon after they wed in northern Argentina in July. For years, it was rare to see gay rights issues gaining traction in Mexico and other Latin American countries. Not anymore, according to Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts. ""Latin America currently has some of the most gay-friendly cities in the developing world,"" says Corrales, who ranks cities' gay-friendliness in a new book he co-edited, ""The Politics of Sexuality in Latin America."" Homosexuality remains a divisive issue in much of Mexico, with conservative politicians pushing for laws banning same-sex marriage in many states after Mexico City approved a gay marriage law last year. The country's Roman Catholic Church leaders have been vocal opponents of the Mexico City law, which took effect in March and also allows married gay couples to adopt children. But Mexico City officials say they hope to set a strong example that the rest of the country will follow. Project plans for the new gay tourism office are still in the works. In addition to training local hotels and restaurants on how to be sensitive to gay clientele, officials say they hope to create maps of the city highlighting attractions for gay tourists and possibly host an international gay tourism conference. Hotels, restaurants and businesses in Mexico City have responded positively to the program so far, Rojas said. So many sponsors offered to chip in for the Argentinean couple's free honeymoon that the city government didn't have to contribute any funds. The annual economic impact of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travelers is about $63 billion in the U.S. alone, according to Community Marketing, Inc. of San Francisco, California. On the global scale, Rojas says, that number is even greater. ""Around the world, it is a very important market,"" Rojas says. Gay tourists represent 15 percent of the world's tourism market, and they spend more money than heterosexual tourists when they travel, he says. Recognizing the commercial value of gay tourism is a positive step, Navarro says, but it also shows that more social change is needed. ""I hope that there comes a day in the future when they don't have to have an office for gay tourists, just like there isn't an office for Asian tourists,"" Navarro says. But for now, he says, he and his husband are looking forward to the chance to visit Mexico City for the first time. ""Our suitcase is already packed,"" he says. ""After 27 years of happiness together, this is the icing on the cake.""","The first couple to wed under Argentina's new same-sex marriage law arrives this week .

"A documentary on the 1996 explosion that brought down TWA Flight 800 offers ""solid proof that there was an external detonation,"" its co-producer said Wednesday. ""Of course, everyone knows about the eyewitness statements, but we also have corroborating information from the radar data, and the radar data shows a(n) asymmetric explosion coming out of that plane -- something that didn't happen in the official theory,"" Tom Stalcup told CNN's New Day. All 230 people aboard TWA 800 died when the plane, headed for Paris, exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Scores of witnesses observed a streak of light and a fireball, giving early rise to suspicions that terrorists had struck the plane with a rocket. Investigators concluded the streak was likely burning fuel streaming from the plane's wing tank. The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that the explosion was caused by an electrical short circuit, most likely originating in a fuel gauge line, which found its way into the center wing fuel tank, where it detonated fuel vapors and caused the B-747 to fall in pieces into the waters off Long Island. But some people have come forward, ""all saying the same thing: that there was an external force -- not from the center wing tank, there's no evidence of that -- but there is evidence of an external explosion that brought down that plane,"" Stalcup said. He cited ""corroborating information from the radar data"" and complained that ""not one single eyewitness was allowed to testify -- that's unheard of."" ""The family members need to know what happened to their loved ones,"" he said. Asked why such information might have been suppressed, Stalcup said, ""That's a question that should be answered when this investigation gets reopened."" Possibility of a review of new information . The NTSB acknowledged receipt Wednesday of the filmmakers' petition -- signed by former investigators -- requesting that the investigation be reopened. ""As required by NTSB regulation, a petition for reconsideration of Board findings or a probable cause determination must be based on the discovery of new evidence or on a showing that the Board's findings are erroneous,"" said board spokeswoman Kelly Nantel. What really happened . ""We assign petition responses to the relevant modal office for drafting. The NTSB's Office of Aviation Safety will assign staff, to the maximum extent practicable, who did not work on the original investigation to carefully prepare a response. The response will be presented to the full Board for their consideration and vote."" The board's investigation of TWA 800 lasted four years and ""remains one of the NTSB's most extensive investigations,"" Nantel said. Investigators ""spent an enormous amount of time reviewing, documenting and analyzing facts and data and held a five-day public hearing to gather additional facts before determining the probable cause of the accident,"" she said. But she left open the possibility the case will be reopened. ""While the NTSB rarely re-investigates issues that have already been examined, our investigations are never closed, and we can review any new information not previously considered by board,"" she said. One TWA 800 family member reacted to the news of the documentary with skepticism. ""Some of the people involved in this group have been involved in Internet conspiracy theories for the last 15 years,"" said Joe Lychner, whose wife, Pam, and two daughters, Shannon, 10, and Katie, 8, died in the incident. ""So far as I can tell, this is just a rehash of what's been out on the Internet,"" he said. ""If they have no new information and this is just trumped-up stuff that's been out there forever, yes, it is hurtful,"" Lychner said. ""Why go through this again.  Conversely, if they do have new information and it's provable, it's a game changer. I will watch this thing with a very critical eye, knowing what I know."" John Goglia, a member of the five-person NTSB during the investigation, said he ""took offense"" at the filmmakers' suggestion that board members ignored evidence. ""I would never be part of any coverup -- period,"" he told CNN. ""This accident, this report, over 50,000 pages, if you take and just look at certain pieces of it, you can move the cause of this accident any way you want. You can take just the radar; you can say it was a missile. You have to take all of the pieces and look at them as a whole. ""The sequencing report that told how the airplane fell apart, none of it supports a missile -- none of it. When you look at the physical evidence inside the tank, it's clear that there was an explosion inside the tank. If the top of the tank goes up and the bottom of the tank goes down, and the forward side goes forward and the back of the tank goes back, that tells you that the blast was inside the tank -- not outside."" He said that no holes were found in the tank that would indicate something had penetrated it. But the documentary asserts that a missile may have exploded adjacent to the plane. Critics challenge government investigation . Skeptics have long theorized that TWA Flight 800 was brought down by sinister forces. They include Hank Hughes, who served as a senior accident investigator with the NTSB and helped reconstruct the aircraft. Others include Bob Young, a TWA investigator who participated in the investigation, and Jim Speer, an accident investigator for the Airline Pilots Association. ""These investigators were not allowed to speak to the public or refute any comments made by their superiors and/or NTSB and FBI officials about their work at the time of the official investigation,"" a news release announcing the documentary said. ""They waited until after retirement to reveal how the official conclusion by the (NTSB) was falsified and lay out their case."" James Kallstrom, who headed the FBI's investigation into the explosion, dismissed suggestions that investigators concealed information and were not receptive to clues. ""If they felt that way back then, they could have come to me,"" Kallstrom said. ""I was someone desiring to get to the bottom of this, believe me. And I had a reputation for not, you know, for not pussyfooting around. Yet it seems like they've comfortably waited until they have their pensions before they became whistle-blowers. So I think it's a bunch of bullcrap."" The documentary, ""TWA Flight 800,"" will premiere July 17, the 17th anniversary of the crash. Stalcup is co-founder of the Flight 800 Independent Researchers Organization and has been a longtime and passionate critic of the official investigation. Suspicions that criminals or terrorists were behind the TWA 800 explosion are not new. The FBI conducted a parallel investigation, but concluded that the incident was not a crime or terrorist attack. The NTSB said Tuesday that it was aware of the pending release of the documentary, which will air on EPIX TV network, and of the producers' intent to file a petition to reopen the investigation. The documentarians said they have a ""trifecta of elements"" that will ""prove that the officially proposed fuel-air explosion did not cause the crash."" That trifecta includes forensic evidence, firsthand sources and corroborating witnesses, and the new statements from retired investigators. The evidence proves that ""one or more ordnance explosions outside the aircraft caused the crash,"" the producers said. But it does not identify or speculate on the source of the ordnance explosions.

"After years of controversy, the Ugandan parliament has passed a bill that punishes certain acts of homosexuality with life in prison. A Ugandan lawmaker first introduced the bill in 2009, sparking worldwide condemnation for tough measures that included the death penalty. It was briefly shelved  amid the backlash. At the time,  some European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community. Before its passage Friday, parliament adjusted the death penalty clause to life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality.""  It includes  acts where one person is infected with HIV, ""serial offenders"" and sex with minors, Amnesty International said. In cases where one has HIV, the punishment applies even when the sex is consensual or protected. ""Ugandans have been anxiously waiting for this bill. This day will be a good day for all Ugandans,"" said Benson Obua Ogwal, a member of  parliament  for Moroto. The bill also proposes years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to homosexuals, a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people. ""The knock-on effect of passing this bill will reach far beyond gay and lesbian people in Uganda, impeding the legitimate work of civil society, public health professionals and community leaders,"" said Aster van Kregten, deputy Africa director at Amnesty International. Homosexuality is illegal in most African countries, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. But lawmakers in the conservative nation sought tougher legislation, saying Western lifestyle risks destroying Ugandan family units. ""This is a piece of legislation that is needed in this country to protect the traditional family here in Africa, and also protect the future of our children,"" David Bahati, the lawmaker who first introduced the bill, said last year. ""Every single day of my life now I am still pushing that it passes."" Rights groups urged President Yoweri Museveni to veto the bill. To become law, it requires his signature within 30 days.","The bill calls for life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality""

"A strong earthquake shook central Japan on Saturday night, injuring dozens of people and destroying homes in a well-known ski resort, authorities said. Reports differed on the intensity of the quake, centered in a remote mountainous area of Nagano prefecture. The Japan Meteorological Agency reported it was magnitude 6.8; the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said it was magnitude 6.2. One of the hardest hit areas was the skiing village of Hakuba, where at least seven housing and storage structures collapsed. Seven of the 39 people hurt in the quake suffered serious injuries, Nagano prefectural police said. Japanese television stations carried images of landslides that had cut off roads and railroads, as well as flattened houses and warped highways. More than 300 rescue workers were deployed to search for people trapped in collapsed homes. Authorities said the rescue operation was completed. No electric facilities, including nuclear power plants, were damaged, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. said via Twitter Saturday. Aftershocks followed the main quake Saturday night, including one measured at magnitude 4.1, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.","Thirty-nine people are injured, seven of them seriously, police say .

"(CNN)A newly distributed ISIS release appears to show the decapitated body of captive Japanese journalist Kenji Goto, after an English-language lecture is given by masked ISIS member ""Jihadi John"" to the people of Japan. The video, 67 seconds long, was released Saturday as others before it, by ISIS media wing Al Furqan Media, and cannot be authenticated by CNN. ""We are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in Tokyo, according to broadcaster NHK. ""To the terrorists, we will never, never forgive them for this act."" He said that Japan will continue to provide humanitarian aid to countries affected by the bloody fight against ISIS. Goto's mother, Junko Ishido, said he wanted to help create a world without wars. ""I'm shedding tears of sorrow, I just can't think of any words to say. But I don't want this sorrow to create a chain of hatred,"" she said, NHK reported. The video opens with a black slate that reads, ""A Message to Japan."" The video then shows a kneeling Goto wearing an orange outfit. The man known as ""Jihadi John"" is standing behind him. The terrorist speaks while holding a knife in his left hand. ""Abe, because of your reckless decision to take part in an unwinnable war, this knife will not only slaughter Kenji, but will also carry on and cause carnage wherever your people are found. So let the nightmare for Japan begin,"" the man says. The video cuts to black as the militant puts the knife to Goto's throat. It then shows the apparent result of the decapitation. It's not clear who conducted the apparent killing. The knife-wielding masked man with a London accent, nicknamed ""Jihadi John,"" has issued threats and overseen the beheadings of other captives. He has appeared in at least six videos with hostages. New questions raised about 'Jihadi John' The fate of a Jordanian pilot captured by ISIS in Syria, Moath al-Kasasbeh, was unclear. He is not mentioned in the video. ISIS had been demanding that Jordan exchange a convicted terrorist, Sajida al-Rishawi, for the pilot. If there was no swap, ISIS said it would kill al-Kaseasbeh first, then Goto. Goto would be the second Japanese hostage to be killed by ISIS recently.  A video file posted online a week ago by a known ISIS supporter shows an image of Goto holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow captive, Haruna Yukawa. U.S. President Barack Obama called the act a ""heinous murder."" ""We stand today in solidarity with Prime Minister Abe and the Japanese people in denouncing this barbaric act,"" the President said in a written statement. ""We applaud Japan's steadfast commitment to advancing peace and prosperity in the Middle East and globally, including its generous assistance for innocent people affected by the conflicts in the region."" The 47-year-old Goto left Japan last fall, when his youngest daughter was 3 weeks old. His wife, Rinko, first heard from his captors December 2. Jordanian officials have said they are willing to swap al-Rishawi -- a female jihadist imprisoned in Jordan for her role in a 2005 suicide bombing at a wedding reception that killed dozens -- for the pilot. But Jordan's key condition is proof that al-Kaseasbeh is still alive. Al-Kaseasbeh was captured after he ejected from his F-16 jet last month near Raqqa, the extremist group's de facto capital in Syria. Fahed al-Kaseasbeh, an uncle of the pilot, told CNN: ""I am sad and devastated to hear this news, regardless of the nationality of the person. I am sad about this act of the beheading of any human.  Also, I am  very worried about the well-being of the son of my brother, my nephew.""

"(CNN)An eruption of Guatemala's so-called ""fire volcano"" has closed an airport and forced the evacuation of at least 100 people. Guatemala's national disaster agency says the volcano, known locally as Fuego Volcan, erupted Saturday and spewed ashes ""to an altitude reaching 5,500 meters (18,000 feet) above sea level."" The smoke and ash forced Guatemala's La Aurora International Airport to stop all air traffic around the area. Guatemala's alert level has been raised to ""orange,"" which puts in place the possibility of rescue operations, the disaster agency said. The volcano is near the Pacific Ocean coast about 60 miles from the capital, Guatemala City. Fuego Volcan is one of Central America's most active volcanoes and has an elevation of 12,343 feet. It is a popular tourist attraction in Guatemala.

"A Syrian jihadist group appears to have pledged allegiance to al Qaeda's leader -- but also stressed it can achieve a Syrian Islamic state only by working with other rebels, including secularists. The group, al-Nusra Front, also denies an earlier claim that it has merged with Iraq's al Qaeda affiliate, according to an audio message purported to be from al-Nusra general commander Abu Muhammad al-Joulani. The message was posted on various radical Islamist websites known for posting similar statements by al Qaeda figures. Al-Joulani's message comes after the leader of the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State of Iraq purportedly claimed this week in an audio statement that al-Nusra Front is part of its network. Opinion: Syria rebel group's dangerous tie to al Qaeda . A speaker identifying himself as Islamic State of Iraq leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had said -- in a message posted to online jihadist forums -- that the two groups would combine their names and be known as ""The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Syria)."" But al-Joulani distanced himself from al-Baghdadi's message, saying it took al-Nusra off guard. ""We would like to inform the public that we were not informed or consulted of the content of the announcement,"" al-Joulani said. Despite denying a merger, al-Joulani said that he is raising the bar higher by pledging allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. Still, such a pledge ""will not change the policies of Nusra Front on the ground,"" al-Joulani said. READ MORE: Syrian rebels issue warning to Hezbollah . He said the group's goal of achieving an Islamic state in Syria ""can only be built with the help of everyone -- without excluding any of the main parties who bled and fought with us and waged jihad in Syria."" Al-Joulani said that includes ""all the other rebel factions."" Al-Joulani, acknowledging that al-Nusra Front fought with jihadists in Iraq before turning its attention to the Syrian civil war, said he would delay consideration of a merger with al Qaeda in Iraq in part so his group can consult with various supporting groups. The U.S. State Department labeled al-Nusra Front a foreign terror organization linked to al Qaeda in Iraq back in December. Moaz al-Khatib, president of the main Syrian opposition alliance, said this week on his official Facebook page that al Qaeda's way of thinking ""does not suit us."" Al-Khatib heads the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, which has leadership largely consisting of expatriates. He said that ""there are those who want to impose themselves even on al-Nusra Front."" ""We reject ownership of any of the rebel factions inside Syria,"" he said. Al-Joulani's message comes a week after the White House, according to U.S. officials, signed off on new nonlethal aid for Syrian rebels. Officials said it is expected to include equipment such as body armor, night vision goggles and other military equipment that is defensive in nature, but could be used to aid in combat by Syrian rebels battling forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. READ MORE: Al-Assad warns of domino effect . Syrian opposition leaders asked for more aid, including lethal aid, at a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in London on Wednesday, according to two senior State Department officials who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity. But the requests weren't specific, and Kerry didn't make any promises, the officials said. Kerry urged the opposition to work together and organize more effectively, the officials said. Opposition officials said they were in the process of doing that. Meanwhile, Kerry, who also discussed Syria with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, will head to Turkey on April 20 for more talks with European and Persian Gulf states on the crisis, the officials said. READ MORE: Syrian war is everybody's problem . President Barack Obama agreed last month to send food and medicine to the rebels, the first direct U.S. support for the armed opposition. But the package falls short of the heavy weapons and high-tech equipment sought by the rebels. The decision also comes as Britain and France are leading efforts to lift a European Union arms embargo on Syria. Both have suggested they are prepared to join nations like Qatar in providing the rebels with weapons and are urging the United States to do the same. The United Nations says more than 70,000 people have been killed in Syria's two-year civil war. Opposition activists reported at least 75 more deaths on Wednesday amid heavy fighting in and around Damascus and Daraa.","Syrian opposition coalition leader: We reject ownership of any of the rebel factions .

"Concepcion, Chile (CNN) -- The death toll from Saturday's 8.8-magnitude earthquake in Chile reached 795 on Tuesday, the president's office said. Officials say the tally likely will increase in coming days as search-and-rescue crews dig into collapsed buildings and discover more bodies. While that work continued, officials also dealt with another pressing problem: looting and lawlessness in the city of Concepcion and other areas of central and southern Chile. Authorities said they would enforce a curfew from 6 p.m. Tuesday until noon Wednesday. Speaking at a Tuesday morning news conference, President Michelle Bachelet said mayhem will not be allowed. ""We have seen images that are, frankly, intolerable,"" Bachelet said. ""We want to make it clear that it won't be accepted."" The government will ""apply the full force of the law,"" she said. The president's comments came after another restless night in Concepcion, where looters openly ransacked stores in front of soldiers standing guard nearby and neighborhood residents have set up armed security committees. The unrest broke out as thousands of desperate residents in southern and central Chile remained without food, water, electricity, gas and other basic services in the wake of the earthquake. More than 13,000 soldiers were being dispatched to secure order, Bachelet said. A CNN crew witnessed looters being arrested Tuesday and observed that more troops seemed to be patrolling Concepcion on Tuesday than Monday. See scenes of devastation from the quake . But no troops or police could be seen in nearby Talcahuano, a correspondent for CNN Chile said Tuesday afternoon. The network showed live images of people pilfering fuel from a closed gas station and other residents walking out of stores carrying large sacks of goods or placing them into car trunks and driving off. The threat of violence slowed the flow of aid, said Michael Black of the nongovernmental organization World Vision. ""The truth is it's taken a lot longer than needed for them to deploy the forces and re-establish order, which is necessary for any NGO,"" he told CNN. The Christian humanitarian group had not yet released any supplies from its warehouse in Santiago, he said. He predicted that would change on Wednesday. ""With the arrival last night of army forces, we think that's going to improve,"" Black said. A weeping Talcahuano resident told CNN Chile, CNN's partner network in the nation, that the city had not received any help and residents felt abandoned. Bachelet vowed to address the situation. ""What worries us the most today is to provide security and tranquility to the nation,"" she said. ""We ask for understanding and patience because the aid will arrive."" But some of that aid was temporarily delayed Tuesday at a military checkpoint on the Itata Route about 12 miles (20 kilometers) outside of Concepcion. Images broadcast by CNN Chile showed at least 12 tractor-trailers filled with aid stopped at the checkpoint. Dozens of other vehicles were lined up, stretching to the horizon, behind the trucks. One truck driver said he had been waiting for four hours. An unidentified army captain interviewed at the checkpoint said if it was up to him the convoy would pass, but he had to wait for approval from the National Emergency Office. ""We haven't received any aid,"" Concepcion Mayor Jacqueline Van Rysselberghe said Tuesday morning. On Monday night, she had complained about the lack of security. ""We don't want to spend one more night in the darkness and in fear,"" she said on CNN Chile. ""We are no longer hungry, we are so scared."" Bachelet said all emergency measures should be in place by Tuesday. Carmen Fernandez, director of the National Emergency Office, said Tuesday afternoon that aid is starting to reach all regions. Distribution is becoming standardized, she said, and the flow of aid is starting to become constant. Rescuers in the hardest-hit areas, including Concepcion and the Maule and Bio Bio regions, continued to scramble to reach possible survivors Tuesday. At least 12 aftershocks were recorded in the past 24 hours, ranging in magnitude from 4.8 to 5.3, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The strongest of the more than 90 aftershocks was a 6.2-magnitude quake on Sunday near the main quake's epicenter. Although damage was significant in Santiago, the nation's capital, electricity and water were restored to much of the city by late Monday and many residents could use their cell phones and other conveniences. About 90 percent of the city's stores were open. In the quake's immediate aftermath, more than 1.5 million people had been without power in and around Santiago, which is about 270 miles (432 kilometers) northeast of Concepcion. Rescuers from Santiago, recently returned from a stint in quake-ravaged Haiti, were working to free residents who were trapped in a 15-story building in Concepcion, about 70 miles (112 kilometers) from the earthquake's epicenter. Fire commander Juan Carlos Subercaseaux confirmed Monday three people were trapped inside the collapsed building, CNN Chile reported. Rescuers said they heard banging and yelling from an apartment on Monday but had not heard anything Tuesday. Subercaseaux told reporters Tuesday afternoon that rescuers would work overnight, though he held out little hope of finding survivors. Six people were missing, seven were dead and 79 had been evacuated from the structure, with 20 apartments still unsearched, he said. Chile has received offers of international aid and will accept the help that it needs, Bachelet said. Paul Simons, U.S. ambassador to Chile, said that the international community and Chilean government have realized in the past two days ""that the magnitude of this earthquake is very, very substantial."" ""Chile is a country that's not really used to asking for outside help,"" Simons said in Santiago. ""Quite frankly, it's been a donor country."" Simons said field hospitals are among Chile's greatest need, given its loss of 19 hospitals, representing more than 4,000 beds. ""The doctors are fine, but they need places to operate,"" Simons said. The nation's ambassador to the United States, Jose Goni, listed Chile's top priorities Monday afternoon. ""After a detailed assessment of the situation,"" Goni said, ""the Chilean government has requested aid from the U.S. government consisting essentially of field hospitals, power generators, water-purification plants, rescue teams, medical crews, tents, satellite telephones, temporary infrastructure for people in need and dialysis autonomous systems."" The United Nations also said Monday that Chile had requested international assistance and indicated it is ready to help. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton traveled to Santiago for a brief visit Tuesday on a previously scheduled trip through Latin America. She had originally been scheduled to arrive Monday. Clinton brought with her 20 satellite phones and a technician, part of the aid the United States will provide to Chile. Chilean Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez ticked through a list of promised international aid: from Canada, 150 portable houses; China, $1 million and a field hospital; South Korea, a planeload of medical equipment; Cuba, a portable hospital equipped with a surgical suite and 25 doctors; Indonesia, $1 million; the European Union, $4 million; Spain, rescue teams, including structural engineers and search dogs; Japan, $3 million and emergency materials; the United Nations, health aid. Other promised aid, according to Fernandez: from Argentina, three portable hospitals; Peru, one portable hospital and 25 doctors; France, a team of 15 structural engineers; the Organization of American States, 20 satellite phones; the United States, 60 satellite phones; Switzerland, a team of engineers; Russia, 100 portable houses and seven tons of food; Uruguay, two water-purification plants. Saturday's earthquake is tied for the fifth-strongest since 1900, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Another 8.8 quake struck off the coast of Ecuador in 1906. Stronger earthquakes occurred in Kamchatka, in northeastern Russia, in 1952 (magnitude 9); off the west coast of northern Sumatra in 2004 (magnitude 9.1); at Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1964 (magnitude 9.4); and just south of Concepcion, Chile, not far from the epicenter of Saturday's quake, in 1960 (magnitude 9.5). Bachelet said Saturday that about 2 million people had been affected in some way, but she did not elaborate. The Chilean Red Cross reported that about 500,000 homes had considerable damage. The armed forces were available to help with security and the distribution of food, she said. CNN's Ana Maria Luengo-Romero, Sara Sidner and Soledad O'Brien contributed to this report.","NEW: Slow deployment of troops hindered aid deployment, relief group says .

"Six decades ago, Charlie Follett was a teenager living in California's Sonoma State Home. As he did most days, Follett sat in a field, singing popular songs to himself, enjoying the sunshine and the solitude. Suddenly, someone came outside to get Follett and brought him to the hospital. They told him to lie down on an operating table, and then the needle came out. ""First, they shot me with some kind of medicine. It was supposed to deaden the nerves,"" he said. ""Then the next thing I heard was snip, snip, and that was it."" The doctors didn't tell Follett what they were doing, but he knew anyway. Other boys at the Sonoma State Home had told him how much it hurt to have a vasectomy. Now it was his turn. ""When they did (my right side), it seemed like they were pulling my whole insides out,"" said Follett, now 82 and living in Stockton. California: Leader in forced sterilizations . Follett was one of 20,000 Californians forcibly sterilized by the state from 1909 to 1963. The goal was to rid society of people thought to be undesirable: people labeled ""feeble-minded"" or ""defectives."" ""It's one of the most horrific and shameful chapters in California's history,"" said Los Angeles civil rights attorney Areva Martin. Thirty-two states had eugenics programs, but California was in a league of its own. The Golden State sterilized more than twice as many people as the next state, Virginia, which sterilized 8,300, according to Paul Lombardo, a professor at Georgia State University's College of Law. The law said that wards of the state like Follett had to be sterilized in order to be discharged from institutions like Sonoma, according to Christina Cogdell, a cultural historian at the University of California-Davis and author of ""Eugenic Design."" Men and women, boys and girls, were sent to state institutions for all sorts of reasons. Some had serious developmental disabilities. Follett ended up at Sonoma because his parents were alcoholics and couldn't care for him. In the mid-20th century, the country's intellectual elite such as doctors, geneticists and Supreme Court justices supported forced sterilizations. In California, the eugenics movement was led by figures such as William Starr Jordan, president of Stanford University, and Harry Chandler, publisher of the Los Angeles Times. In other states, the sterilization program would stop and start due to legal challenges, but California's ran strong for more than half a century, Cogdell said. ""If you were deemed worthy of being sterilized by a doctor, there was no board where you could have a hearing to protest,"" he said. California's movement was so effective that in the 1930s, members of the Nazi party asked California eugenicists for advice on how to run their own sterilization program. ""Germany used California's program as its chief example that this was a working, successful policy,"" Cogdell said. ""They modeled their law on California's law."" ""It kills my last name"" In 2003, then-Gov. Gray Davis apologized for the forced sterilizations, but Follett wants compensation for not be able to have children of his own. ""What really ticks me off is, it kills my last name,"" Follett said. ""If I should die tomorrow, everything's died."" Over the past few years, a friend of Follett's has tried to help him seek justice. Rudy Banlasan, a nursing student, has written letters and e-mails on Follett's behalf to Gov. Edmund ""Jerry"" Brown and other state politicians and officials. He has not succeeded in getting any of them to speak with him. Banlasan keeps a file of the e-mails he's sent to politicians and the form letters he's received in return. ""I hate to sound so cynical, but I think they're just waiting for the victims to die and forget this whole thing ever happened,"" Banlasan said. ""There's nothing more to add"" CNN's attempts to contact politicians have been unsuccessful. The governor's office referred CNN to the state Department of Developmental Services, which sent a two-sentence statement: ""The State of California deeply regrets the harm caused to victims of involuntary sterilization that occurred through the first half of the 1900s. This was a sad and painful period in California's history, one that should never be repeated."" When CNN asked Brown for his stance on reparations for sterilization victims, press secretary Gil Duran sent an e-mail referring to the statement. ""There's nothing more to add,"" he wrote. CNN also sent e-mails and made phone calls to the office of John Perez, speaker of the California Assembly. When no response was received, CNN visited his office in Sacramento. His spokesman, John Vigna, said the speaker was tied up in meetings. ""This is an issue I personally am just learning about and looking into,"" Vigna said. California's response to victims stands in stark contrast to North Carolina's. North Carolina task force recommends $50,000 for sterilization victims . In that state, Gov. Bev Perdue has sought out victims and held hearings where she apologized personally and heard their stories. She also set up a task force to help the victims and recommended that each receive $50,000 in reparations. ""That's not happening in California,""  said Martin, the civil rights attorney.  ""To think that we're behind on this issue instead of leading on this issue is very troublesome."" ""California has not done right"" Art Torres is the former California state senator who wrote the 1979 legislation outlawing sterilization. He said he's not surprised politicians are reticent on the subject. ""I would venture to say most people in this legislature -- and most people in California -- aren't even aware there was a eugenics movement in California,"" Torres said. Californians, he added, need to face their history and at least hold hearings and invite victims to tell their stories. ""California has not done right by these victims,"" Torres said. ""But I think California and Californians need to be aware of their history.""","California forcibly sterilized 20,000 people from 1909 to 1963 .

"(CNN)A man who shot three people at a Pittsburgh-area mall Saturday has been arrested, police said Sunday. Two of the three victims were critically wounded at Monroeville Mall in Pennsylvania, authorities said. The third was in stable condition with injuries that were not life-threatening, Monroeville police Chief Kenneth ""Doug"" Cole said. A motive for the shooting has not been determined. But Cole said he thinks the gunman knew one of the victims. ""We believe that one of those three people that were shot was a targeted individual, so this was not a random,"" the police chief told reporters Saturday night. Allegheny County Police Lt. Andy Schurman said the two other shooting victims were apparently bystanders. ""The two innocent victims, we don't believe were the intended targets,"" he said. Schurman said the targeted victim was the most seriously wounded. The shooting took place in a Macy's store on the lower level of the mall. Two men and a woman were shot. Witnesses at the mall, about 10 miles east of downtown Pittsburgh, described a chaotic scene. ""We were in Dick's (Sporting Goods), and all of sudden a whole bunch of people started running,"" Madison Strohl told CNN. ""There were five shots fired right outside of the Macy's inside the mall ... it was really scary."" Two officers were working at the mall when the shooting occurred, Cole said. The mall was locked down and evacuated, with 15 agencies helping secure stores while authorities looked for the gunman. A series of fights at the mall forced it to close temporarily in December, CNN affiliate KDKA said. ""There is a pattern here as you are well aware,"" the police chief said. ""We don't know why the mall is having the problem it's having."" ""Back in the '90s, we had shootings down there ... associated with gangs and drug activities,"" Cole said. ""Maybe that's coming back around."" CNN's Laura Ly contributed to this report.","Suspect arrested in shooting at Monroeville Mall near Pittsburgh .

"Pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that began Monday with students boycotting classes and demanding less involvement of China's Communist Party in Hong Kong's future continued Sunday and are growing into a wider movement. Organizers said some 60,000 protesters turned out for a Saturday night rally and police tried to block them from joining other protesters that are part of a sit-in outside government headquarters. They're protesting  new election rules issued by the Chinese government in August that say candidates for the top posts in Hong Kong must be selected by a committee perceived to serve the Chinese Communist Party. The students want to pressure China into giving Hong Kong full voting rights and the ability to choose candidates independent of Beijing. Some protesters wore rain jackets, goggles and umbrellas in anticipation of the police's use of pepper spray as tension rose following more than 70 arrests of student activists. Organizers  said they would continue to occupy the area outside government headquarters indefinitely until the students are released. They want to speak directly to Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung. Hong Kong authorities said 34 people had been treated in hospital for injuries suffered in the protests. Student's home seached . Those arrested include 17-year-old protest leader Joshua Wong, whose parents issued a statement saying that their son's lawyer ""can see no legal justification for this continued detention given the nature of the allegations, his young age and his clean record."" Grace and Roger Wong said they can only conclude that their son is being detained for political reasons and call his arrest "" political persecution."" According to protest organizers, police spent two hours searching Wong's dorm room Saturday. They confiscated his computer, two SD cards, his phone and a thumb drive, they said. Amnesty International issued a statement Sunday calling for the release of the activists and condemned violence against protesters Friday night, when police used pepper spray. A government statement issued this week urged teachers and parents not to let minors take part in the rallies, saying their future opportunities could be affected. Teachers were also warned that if they are convicted ""as a result of participating in unlawful activities, they will have to bear their legal responsibilities as well as professional- and career-related consequences."" Other protest group joins in . Leaders of Hong Kong's Occupy Central movement, which had planned  a separate mass protest in the city's financial district over voting rights, decided Sunday to join the student movement. Co-founder Benny Tai said he would stay with the students until the last minute and was prepared to be arrested. ""We are willing to pay the price for civil disobedience,"" he said. Since the handover from Britain to China 17 years ago, the people of Hong Kong have been granted a wide range of civil liberties and a measure of autonomy under the governing principle known as ""one country, two systems."" But many believe that way of life is under threat as Beijing affirms its political authority over Hong Kong. Although most are not old enough to drive in the former British colony, the students' political vision is clear. ""The future of Hong Kong is ours,"" said 16-year-old student Phoebe Leung. ""I can't change Hong Kong, but if all of us are here ... we may change Hong Kong's future.""","Weeklong student protests grows into larger movement .

"(CNN)A man crashed through the gates of a Michigan Coast Guard station around 6 a.m. ET on Sunday, assaulted personnel and said he had a bomb in his truck, authorities said. No Coast Guard officials were injured in the incident in Grand Haven, said Petty Officer Christopher Yaw, a spokesman with the Ninth Coast Guard District. The city is on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, about 36 miles (58 kilometers) west of Grand Rapids. According to Yaw, a man called saying that he had put a bomb in his truck. Coast Guard officials notified the command center for the Lake Michigan sector while ordering that all people be evacuated from the station, he said. After driving through the gates and parking his truck, the man ""gained access to the station building,"" Yaw told CNN but provided no further details. He said the man, who authorities said is 34, was confronted, subdued and turned over to the Grand Haven Department of Public Safety. Officials are continuing to search the grounds, and an explosives ordnance team is working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Yaw said. The incident was initially investigated as a possible ""domestic act of terrorism,"" said Erin Von Tom of the Department of Public Safety.

"A Sudanese Christian woman who was sentenced to die for refusing to renounce her faith -- and then released -- was detained with her family on Tuesday as they tried to leave the African country. Her legal team told CNN that Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, her American husband, Daniel Wani, and their two children were stopped at an airport in Khartoum and interrogated at national security headquarters in the Sudanese capital. The problem involved what the legal team described as an alleged ""irregularity with her documentation,"" according to Ibrahim's lawyers, who said she was in police custody. Ibrahim has a U.S. visa and was headed to the United States with her family, her legal team said. The U.S. State Department said the family was stopped at the airport. ""The State Department has been informed by the Sudanese government that the family was temporarily detained at the airport for several hours by the government for questioning over issues related to their travel, and I think travel documents,"" said spokeswoman Marie Harf. ""They have not been arrested. The government has assured us of their safety."" Harf said that the U.S. Embassy ""has been and will remain highly involved in working with the family and the government,"" saying ""we are engaging directly with Sudanese officials to secure their safe and swift departure from Sudan."" Sudanese authorities said Ibrahim had been detained because of the documents she submitted. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents, despite not being a citizen of South Sudan, and she was heading to the United States, which is not her native country. ""This was considered illegal by the Sudanese authorities, who have summoned both the U.S. and South Sudanese ambassadors,"" the agency said in a message posted on its media Facebook page early Wednesday. The airport detention came a day after Ibrahim's legal team announced the 27-year-old woman had been released from prison after weeks of international controversy over her conviction on apostasy and adultery charges. According to her lawyer, the case began when one of Ibrahim's relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. The Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim, but she said she was a Christian and never practiced Islam. She was charged with adultery, because a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan, and with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith. Authorities warned her to renounce Christianity by May 15, but she did not, instead responding that  her mother, an Ethiopian Orthodox Christian, raised her as a Christian. She said her Sudanese Muslim father abandoned her when she was 6. ""I am a Christian,"" she said during her sentencing hearing last month, ""and I will remain a Christian."" She was convicted and sentenced to death by hanging, along with 100 lashes. Sudanese Parliament speaker Fatih Izz Al-Deen defended the apostasy conviction, insisting last month that Ibrahim was raised in a Muslim environment. After her sentence drew international condemnation from rights groups and foreign embassies in Khartoum -- including those of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada -- an appeals court this month ruled that the judgment against her was faulty and she was released, according to her lawyer. Her husband, Wani, called CNN on Tuesday to say he and his family were being held at the national security office, but he provided no additional information. Ibrahim's legal team said the family was trying to leave the country when it was stopped by authorities and taken to the security headquarters. Meanwhile, a man who says he is Ibrahim's brother, Al-Samani Al-Hadi, slammed the appellate court's decision and hinted at retribution. ""The family is unconvinced by the court's decision. We were not informed by the court that she was to be released; this came as a surprise to us,"" al-Hadi said Tuesday. ""The law has failed to uphold our rights. This is now an issue of honor. The Christians have tarnished our honor, and we will know how to avenge it."" Al-Hadi did not comment on Ibrahim's detention at the airport on Tuesday. In court proceedings earlier this year, Ibrahim denied being related to al-Hadi. Ibrahim gave birth to her second child -- a girl -- in prison last month. Her first child, a 1-year-old son, stayed with her at the prison but was free to leave at any time, Ibrahim's lawyer said.","Sudanese authorities summon U.S. and South Sudanese ambassadors .

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN)Sen. Rand Paul embraced his libertarian roots in Iowa this weekend, speaking unapologetically about his apprehension about foreign intervention and stoking the fire in one of the libertarian movement's biggest crusades: auditing the Federal Reserve. In his first trip to Iowa this year, just under a year before the caucuses, the Kentucky Republican and potential presidential candidate ventured into familiar territory, rallying young voters and libertarian-minded supporters who turned out big for his father's presidential campaigns. Paul found friendly audiences at the end of a stormy week filled with negative headlines over comments he made about vaccinations and swirling controversy involving one of his advisers in Iowa. The crowds this weekend were a marked contrast to the social conservative audience that packed a Des Moines theater two weeks ago to hear 10 hours of speeches from a hoard of other potential candidates at the Iowa Freedom Summit. The Federal Reserve was hardly mentioned at that event, and the rhetoric on war and the fight against ISIS was more forceful and hawkish that the positions Paul took this weekend. 'One loud voice' Last fall, the senator struggled to communicate his stance on the war against terror. At first he urged restraint against ISIS, but after American journalists were beheaded by the group, Paul began supporting limited action. He eventually, in a committee vote, voted ""no"" to authorizing war against ISIS, saying he felt the bill was too open-ended, and it was a vote he stood proudly by this weekend as he used it to separate himself from his potential competitors. ""You're going to get a choice on who the nominee is for the Republican Party. You're going to have nine, 10, 15, 20 who are eager to go and want troops on the ground,"" he said at the ""Audit the Fed"" rally Friday, which took place at a winery in Des Moines. ""They want 100,000 troops on the ground. Right now. In all the countries."" ""I can tell you there will be one loud voice in our party saying, think of the unintended consequence. Think about what we're going to accomplish and whether it will work before we go to war.' I promise you that will always be something I take very, very seriously."" The theme of ""acting before thinking"" was the way he described the Obama administration's foreign policy, for which he squarely placed blame on Hillary Clinton, hammering her for supporting military action in Libya and calling for the arming of Syrian rebels. At a Saturday morning event, held at a bar and grill in Marshalltown, Paul acknowledged that he ""begrudgingly"" thinks the United States should intervene in the Middle East to protect American interests, such as the embassy in Baghdad and consulate in Erbil. ""But I don't want to send 100,000 GIs in."" That should be left to regional fighters, he said, before launching into a fiery diatribe. ""And don't get me started about Saudi Arabia. There need to be 20,000 Saudi Arabians fighting that war because they've been a problem."" Building a brand . With so many Republican candidates likely to echo each other's talking points in the next year, Paul has tried to run in his own lane by shaping his libertarian foundation into a selling point that says he's best poised to expand the Republican base. To stop the ""dismantling of the country,"" Paul said it's going to take someone with a nontraditional approach. ""It's not going to take a ho-hum, same-old, same-old, we'll-get-a-Republican-that's-a-little-bit-different-than-the-Democrats. It's going to take someone who can unite the country. Republican. Democrat. Working class. Business class. Rich. Poor. Black. White. You name it. When our party looks like the rest of America, we're going to win."" Rep. Rod Blum, a Republican success story in Iowa who won a largely Democratic district in November, introduced Paul at the Saturday morning event and said he was attracted to Paul's efforts to broaden the GOP tent, though he stressed in an interview with CNN he wouldn't be endorsing anyone this early on, if at all. Margaret Meade of Marshalltown, who identifies as a Democrat, said Paul ""might have some success"" attracting voters like her but argued he needs to ""stop saying mean things about Hillary Clinton,"" saying it only turns off those same voters. Courting the youth . Later Saturday, Paul popped by by the Iowa State University men's basketball game in Ames before dropping in at a watch party hosted by College Republicans and Young Americans for Liberty, a group founded by his father, ex-Rep. Ron Paul. ""I think the energy in any political movement is the youth,"" Paul told CNN, explaining why he wanted to kick off his year in Iowa with a libertarian-leaning focus. The senator, however, was dressed in blue -- staying true, he said, to the University of Kentucky, where two of his sons go to school. ""I do have an Iowa State pen on my jacket, but I'd get in too much trouble if I had an Iowa State shirt on,"" he told the students. Staff from his political committee were at the ready at the watch party, providing students with smartphone covers emblazoned with the logo ""RAND"" and collecting names and contact information. Standing at a podium with a minibar close by, Paul spoke freely about what he considers the dangers of civil forfeiture and the malpractice of the National Security Agency. ""The Bill of Rights is not for the prom queen. The Bill of Rights isn't for the high school quarterback,"" he said. ""The Bill of Rights is for those who are unpopular, for those who want to speak their mind."" Young people also were prevalent at the ""Audit the Fed"" rally. The Federal Reserve is already audited by a third-party accounting firm arranged through the inspector general and partially by the Government Accountability Office. But Paul reintroduced legislation that would give full auditing power to the GAO and would require regular reports to Congress. Paul was noticeably more comfortable shaking hands and taking pictures with voters than he has been in the past. The first-term senator and ophthalmologist is known for his no-frills, less-than-warm style. But while meeting with students on Saturday, Paul frequently smiled and avoided looking down at his shoes in between photos, as he's been known to do. At the restaurant earlier Saturday, he occasionally would ask questions and engage in small talk. Anthony Neutout, who went to both the Marshalltown event and the ""Audit the Fed"" rally, said he liked Paul's unusual style. ""He's not a brass polished politician, not a walking mannequin... A lot of candidates, it's like they have multiple personality disorder,"" Neutout said. ""Rand is very consistent."" Still, Paul was more celebrity than Average Joe to some voters. He was asked to sign five baseballs at the Marshalltown event and a copy of Time magazine from when he appeared on the cover back in October. Others were more ardent supporters of Paul. One pair of friends drove from Lake County, Indiana -- a five-hour drive. A week of headaches . Paul was courting the very same base this weekend that became the focal point for a damaging story this week by National Journal, which profiled the negative reputation of A.J. Spiker, a Paul adviser who was at the helm when activists in Iowa's liberty movement took over the state party in 2012. The report quotes party officials who had strong misgivings about what they described as Spiker's divisiveness. But Paul defended his adviser and expressed confidence in Spiker's connections with the liberty movement and Christian conservatives. ""There are always going to be people who have chosen other candidates or who for one reason or another hold a grudge. But I think really with both A.J. and (Paul's other Iowa adviser, Steve Grubbs) there's a broad reach to a broad swath to the party,"" Paul told the Des Moines Register on Thursday. Paul spent several days trying to clear up comments he made that lent credibility to theoriesâ€‹ that vaccinations cause mental disorders. That, combined with negative attention over how he shushed a female interviewer, sparked a wave of criticism from pundits over whether the senator is ready for prime time. ""Rand Paul is not inspiring a lot of confidence that he his ready for a national campaign,"" said Iowa GOP strategist Tim Albrecht, who works for Dave Kochel, a consultant recently hired by Jeb Bush. ""You can coach a candidate on messaging and how to give a speech but what you cannot coach is thick skin. He needs to toughen up and that starts by not talking down to people interviewing him. We've already got that in the White House."" Rand Paul defends shushing interview . But the supporters who showed up at his events this weekend appeared unconcerned with the senator's recent dust-ups. ""I don't take one week at a time,"" said Dave McCluskey of West Des Moines. ""I look at the big picture.""","Rand Paul kicks off his first event in Iowa this year with events that appeal to libertarian-minded voters .

The EE British Academy Film Awards, known as the BAFTAs, are the most anticipated event for the British film industry. And with the Oscars only two weeks away, the ceremony is often seen as an indicator of who is in the running for an Academy Award. Patricia Arquette won best supporting actress Sunday for her role as a mother in ""Boyhood."" She also won a Screen Actors Guild Award last month for her performance. Held at the Royal Opera House in London and presented by comedian Stephen Fry, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" was at the top of the leader board going into the awards with 11 nominations. The film won five awards for best costume design, best production design, best makeup and hair, best original music and best original screenplay. Eddie Redmayne won best leading actor for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything,"" paying tribute to the Hawking family in an emotional acceptance speech. Redmayne was not only a favorite of the BAFTA judges, but also with hundreds of fans who lined up -- some since Friday -- to watch him walk on the red carpet and chant his name as he went by. But it was Hawking himself who got some of the biggest cheers of the night, drawing a standing ovation when he took the stage with actress Felicity Jones to present the award for best special digital effects. ""I'm particularly pleased to be presenting with the only person on the planet more intelligent than Stephen Fry,"" Jones said. ""Yes, and better looking,"" Hawking quipped.

"Here's a roundup of five medical studies published this week that might give you new insights into your health, mind and body. Remember, correlation is not causation -- so if a study finds a connection between two things, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. More babies are being breast-fedCenters for Disease Control and Prevention . Breast-feeding rates in the United States are on the rise, according to the latest Breastfeeding Report Card from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC reported that 79% of babies born in 2011 were breast-fed. Southeastern states lagged behind the national average, with Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi and West Virginia exhibiting breast-feeding rates below 65%. California, Montana, Oregon and Washington led the nation with breast-feeding rates above 90%. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breast-feeding continue for at least 12 months, but only about 50% of infants were still breast-feeding at 6 months. That number dwindled to just above 25% for infants at 12 months. Extreme weather kills thousands in U.S. each yearCenters for Disease Control and Prevention . About 2,000 people in the United States die from extreme weather conditions each year, according to a report released Wednesday by the CDC. The report analyzed death certificates from 2006 to 2010 for deaths attributed to weather-related causes, such as heatstrokes, hypothermia, floods, storms and lightning. Roughly one-third of the weather-related deaths were attributed to excessive natural heat, and nearly two-thirds were attributed to excessive natural cold. The CDC also found that males, African-Americans and the elderly had the highest weather-related mortality rates of any other demographics. Women in the military are less likely to drinkArmed Forces & Society . Although male military enlistees and veterans have a history of increased alcohol consumption, it turns out the opposite may be true for women. A study published Thursday in Armed Forces & Society found that women in the military are less likely to drink alcohol than women who haven't served. Researchers used data taken from a 1997 survey of almost 9,000 people and followed up with the young men and women each year until 2010. The study's authors suggest the threat of sexual harassment and assault may be a possible explanation for enlisted women not imbibing. They also speculate that women in the military abstain from alcohol to avoid being looked down upon by fellow soldiers. Blood sugar linked to how brains respond to foodSociety for the Study of Ingestive Behavior . Does your mouth water at the sight of foods such as pizza and French fries? Genetics aren't all to blame. Your brain's response to the sight of food actually has more to do with your blood sugar levels, according to research presented Tuesday at the Society for the Study of Ingestive Behavior's annual conference. Researchers at the University of Washington examined 21 pairs of identical twins to see whether the brain's response to the sight of food was linked to genetics. The scientists found twins with lower blood glucose levels saw greater activation in the brain in response to pictures of food. But when it came to rating their appetites and choosing portions for meals, the twins reacted similarly. Autistic brains seen as less flexible at switching tasksCerebral Cortex . When switching from one task to another, the brains of autistic children show little change in connectivity, according to a study published Tuesday. Researchers at Stanford University compared functional MRI images of the brains of 34 autistic children to those of 34 typically developing children during different types of activities. In the experiment, the study authors examined the children's brains at rest, while they looked at pictures and while they were solving math problems. The authors found that it was much easier to distinguish how brain connectivity changed between tasks in children who were not autistic. In the brains of children who were autistic, researchers saw little change.","CDC says that 79% of U.S. babies born in 2011 were breast-fed .

"Long before the candidates set foot on stage in Florida, President Barack Obama headed into the final debate of the 2012 campaign with the biggest advantage of all: he's already commander-in-chief. The foreign policy face-off on Monday was devoted to a subject on which presidents can speak about decision-making in the first person and challengers can't. As recently as a few weeks ago, coming off a rocky foreign summer tour and a widely panned response to the deadly September 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, Mitt Romney seemed headed for a tough night. But that was before the administration faced its own politically charged questions on the Libya assault over security and its response to what actually occurred and who may have been behind it. Five things we learned from the final debate . Whether it was a reaction to the White House's handling of the situation or just a reflection of Romney's overall growing strength, several recent polls suggested Obama's edge on foreign policy had narrowed. And Romney's biggest strength in the debates so far -- an aura of unshakeable confidence -- promised to be a critical asset in a night devoted to leadership. More than what he said, voters reacted to the way he said it. Foreign policy is an area where many voters don't feel entirely confident themselves; Americans are less likely to have passionate and strongly held positions on currency speculation or trade negotiations than on abortion or taxes. Read a transcript of the debate . Winning the policy debate is important. But looking like the stronger leader might be an even bigger priority. Last time, Romney pushed so hard on details about the president's response to the Benghazi attack that he unintentionally let him sidestep the heart of the original question about diplomatic security. It was a mistake he didn't seem likely to make twice. But this time, he barely pressed the president on Benghazi. Instead, the night played like a mirror image of the first debate. Romney approached the face-off with a cautious frontrunner strategy: a priority on appearing presidential and, wherever possible, emphasizing common ground. Debate's global reaction: Disappointment . And Obama took on the aggressive underdog role, needling Romney with virtually every response. On a night where sharp policy distinctions were in short supply, the president even tried to turn the areas of agreement into an attack: ""You say you would do the same things we did, but you would just say them louder."" From one angle, Romney's approach -- to sound presidential and stay largely above the fray -- was the best strategy to win over the women voters he needs. And on a night where the final debate of campaign 2012 competed with both Monday Night Football and the pivotal game of baseball's National League championship, women may well have made up a larger share of the viewing audience than ever before. Fact Check: Obama, Romney and Iraq . But allowing your opponent to come across as the tough guy when the showdown is a 90-minute audition for commander-in-chief is a risky strategy -- especially when you're a challenger with a short foreign policy resume who needs to convince voters you're strong leader who can keep the country safe. Romney had the benefit of seeing the president's play-it-safe strategy flop in the first debate -- which made his decision to adopt it in the final one even more puzzling. So the only candidate with an actual foreign policy track record wasn't the one who faced the toughest attacks tonight. The president didn't necessarily score a knockout -- but he did land the most punches. This was the last, best chance for Obama and Romney to make their pitch to a sizable audience in every battleground state. So, since foreign policy hasn't exactly ranked high on voter priority lists this year, virtually every question ended up with an answer close to home. For more than 10 minutes, the debate stayed focused on domestic education policy, the deficit and jobs. Obama wins final debate, but does it matter? A question about America's role in the world drew an answer about the U.S. unemployment rate. Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin all rated mentions; Europe and the United Nations didn't. The candidates had one, extended tense exchange over the auto bailout and ""Green Economy"" investment. In CNN's post-debate poll, voters gave Obama the edge on performance -- but that opinion didn't necessarily shift their votes. The most recent pre-debate surveys show Romney gains resulting in a virtual tie among likely voters nationally, and hinted at momentum in key swing states like Florida. If Romney's measured performance drew higher marks from women or the vanishingly small sliver of remaining swing voters, he might be able to maintain that momentum. But unlike previous debates, there was a big gender gap, with women responding much more favorably to Obama's performance and men giving a small advantage to Romney. The president has retained a healthy edge among registered voters; if the debate boosts Democratic enthusiasm, the likely voter model could shift, and the president would see a bump in the polls even if he failed to win over a single undecided voter. The first debate dramatically altered the campaign dynamic; but in a race now so tight that 1- or 2-point swings practically rate surge status, the question is whether Monday's winner can expect any major impact at all. Were your questions answered? Let us know on CNN iReport .","Barack Obama as president had a certain advantage on foreign policy in debate .

"Ellen Moshweu was just trying to go to church. A police officer shot her in the back on that November day in 1990. David Mabeka was at home in 1986, sleeping through a newly declared South African government state of emergency, when police burst in to his home and took him away. A young black man, just trying to get home, was thrown into the back of a police van and taken to jail despite the indignity of presenting a white police officer valid identity papers. The officer crumpled the pass at the man's feet and took him to jail anyway. Thaabo Moorsi, ""severely tortured and detained."" Soyisile Douse, ""shot dead by policemen."" Families separated. Races relocated. This was apartheid. For many too young or too distant to remember, apartheid is little more than a distant historical fact, a system of forced segregation to learn about in history class, to condemn and to move on. But for South Africans who survived the decades of punishing racial classification, humiliating work rules, forced relocation and arbitrary treatment by authorities, the end of apartheid was the birth of an entirely new world, midwifed in large part by Nelson Mandela. A history of apartheid . Though white Europeans had long ruled in South Africa, the formal system of apartheid came into existence after World War II. The country's National Party -- led by the descendants of European settlers known as Afrikaners -- ushered it into existence after sweeping into power on a campaign calling for stricter racial controls amid the heavy inflow of blacks into South African cities. Between 1949 and 1953, South African lawmakers passed a series of increasingly oppressive laws, beginning with prohibitions on blacks and whites marrying in 1949 and culminating with laws dividing the population by race, reserving the best public facilities for whites and creating a separate, and inferior, education system for blacks. One of the laws, the Group Areas Act, forced blacks, Indians, Asians and people of mixed heritage to live in separate areas, sometimes dividing families. Blacks had to live in often barren tribal homelands or townships near cities, often in polluted industrial areas. Whites got the best agricultural areas, the choicest city addresses. A system of passes and identity papers controlled where blacks could travel and work. ""Ooo, don't talk about the Group Areas Act,"" the resident of one such area, Gadija Jacobs, said, according to the Apartheid Museum in Johannesburg. ""I will cry all over again. There's when the trouble started ... when they chucked us out of Cape Town. My whole life came changed. What they took away they can never give back to us."" Apartheid rules governed virtually every aspect of daily life. Blacks had to use different beaches and public restrooms. Signs distinguished facilities reserved for whites -- often referred to as Europeans. Blacks earned meager wages compared with whites, and their children went to poorly funded schools. In one of the telling anecdotes of the apartheid era, black nannies who dressed and fed and sang to the children of their white employers were unable to join them in the Dutch Reformed Church, the main Afrikaner congregation. South Africa since apartheid: Boom or bust? Growing defiance . In the 1950s, growing calls for civil disobedience against the government took hold, sometimes resulting in violence as police cracked down on the protests. The 1952 Defiance Campaign, for instance, prompted thousands of black Africans to flout the laws in hopes that their arrests would overwhelm the country's prison system and bring attention and eventual change. Thousands were arrested, but the African National Congress, which organized the campaign, had to call it off after scores were hurt by police. In 1960, the tide began to turn when South African police killed 69 protesters gathered outside the Sharpeville police station for a nonviolent protest. The killings led not only to international outcry but calls for armed struggle by the ANC and other groups. A grim record . That struggle continued for years. It's laid out in gruesome detail in the records of South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, formed after the end of apartheid to help expose and heal the country's many wounds. Moshweu, the woman shot in the back as she went to church, told her story to the commission in 1996. She told an awful story, of a police officer with almost complete power in her neighborhood, a man who used to randomly fire off his gun -- and who she said had also killed her son. ""He brought suffering to me by killing my son. He wanted to kill me. That is why he shot me,"" she told the commission. Mabeka, who testified at the same hearing, told the commission he spent two months in prison after being taken from his home in 1986 and beaten at a police station. ""They assaulted me with fists; they kicked me, and I fell on the ground,"" he said. ""They didn't ask me anything; they didn't tell me what do they -- what did they want."" John Biyase told his story to researchers from Michigan State University in 2006. He recalled marching in Johannesburg in 1977 after police closed many of the high schools attended by blacks in an apparent effort to break up resistance efforts. Police trapped the marchers and set on them as they tried to escape. ""They just hit everybody,"" Biyase told his interviewers. ""There was blood, cries. I remember we were shouting, 'Peace! Peace! Peace!' "" He spent three weeks in the city's John Vorster Square prison in a cell with 20 other young men. There, he remembers police threatening to take troublemakers to the 10th floor ""workshop,"" where police were suspected of staging fatal accidents involving inmates. ""We knew what the workshop meant,"" he told his interviewers. ""Death."" Finally free . When Mandela was freed in 1990, four years before he would become president, another surprising element of apartheid reared its head. Before his release, few had seen Mandela's now-famous face or heard his voice. Under apartheid, the government banned the publication of anything to do with opposition groups such as his African National Congress. ""We were fed the information we were allowed,"" said Susan Campbell, a former prosecutor who now is an environmental lawyer in the coastal town of Knysna. ""It was only after his release, really, that we actually saw who he was."" Nelson Mandela: 10 surprising facts you probably didn't know .","Apartheid was more than racial segregation .

"Sao Paulo (CNN)Call it a prison break that left little to the imagination. Two women, dressed in skimpy, ""sexy"" police officer costumes, allegedly showed up at a prison in Brazil's interior Mato Grosso state on Thursday, according to local media reports. The women talked guards into letting them inside and seduced them, spiking their drinks in the process, according to reports. What happened next is what one might expect when strangers in lingerie appear unannounced at your work place: the guards were found the next morning, naked and handcuffed with little recollection of the night before. And 26 prisoners had escaped from the prison, located in Nova Mutum, a small city near Cuiaba. A spokesman for the Justice Secretariat of Mato Grosso, which oversees prisons, confirmed to CNN that officials found bottles of spiked whiskey and a pair of provocative, police-themed costumes next to the handcuffed guards, who were passed out. ""We assume that is what the women were wearing when they seduced the guards,"" spokesman Willian Fidelis said. Eleven of the inmates had been recaptured by Sunday, Fidelis said. The spokesman said he did not know who was behind the prison break, saying that civil police were handling the investigation. In addition to the two guards who were duped, the director of the prison was also being held, Fidelis said. Even though the director was not involved in the encounter and subsequent escape, he was asleep on the premises when it occurred, the spokesman said. ""Nothing like this has ever happened,"" he said.

"(CNN)At least 19 people died Sunday when soccer fans clashed with police outside a stadium in Cairo, the health ministry said. Egypt's government-controlled Al-Ahram newspaper website reported that at least 30 people were killed. The violence took place ahead of a scheduled match between Zamalek and ENPPI. The match went ahead. The Interior Ministry blamed the violence on fans who didn't have tickets and tried to push their way in. ""They climbed the fence. Ten were injured in a stampede. The security forces tried to disperse them, the fans fled to the main road and blocked traffic and stopped the bus carrying the Zamalek soccer team. They set fire to a police vehicle. We got reports of fatalities because of a stampede,"" that ministry said in a statement. But the Facebook page of the Ultras White Knights, a hardcore Zamalek group, said that members were tear gassed as they tried to go through a single, small-gated entrance that was opened to allow them into the match. Egypt's general prosecutor is sending a team to investigate. In the wake of the violence, the country's Cabinet indefinitely suspended the country's Premier League soccer matches, Al-Ahram reported. Victims from Sunday's clashes were taken a morgue in central Cairo, where family members and friends waited for the bodies. Some fans from a rival club showed up at the morgue as a show of solidarity with those killed.

"The ghastly video shows how barbaric the Syrian civil war can be. A man, said to be a well-known rebel fighter, carves into the body of a government soldier and cuts out his heart and liver. ""I swear to God we will eat your hearts out, you soldiers of Bashar. You dogs. God is greater!"" the man says. ""Heroes of Baba Amr ... we will take out their hearts to eat them."" He then puts the heart in his mouth and takes a bite. Opinion: Is Obama failing on moral leadership? A group loyal to President Bashar al-Assad posted the video online Monday. The group describes the mutilation as a ""crime that crosses all lines."" It's a sentiment shared by the main opposition alliance, which describes the act as ""horrific and inhumane."" ""The Syrian Coalition strongly condemns this act, if it is revealed to be true,"" the dissident group said in a statement. ""The coalition stresses that such an act contradicts the morals of the Syrian people, as well as the values and principles of the (rebel) Free Syrian Army."" On Wednesday, the FSA said it will investigate whether the man in the video is a member of the rebel army. In a Facebook post, the group also said ""the abuser will be punished severely even if they are associated with the Free Syrian Army."" Rebel spokesman: There's more to the story . Although CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, CNN has interviewed a local rebel spokesman who confirmed the incident and said he has spoken to the man in the footage. Tariq al Sayed, a spokesman from the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr, said he is a friend of the rebel in the video. He said the incident took place more than two weeks ago, after several rebels and government troops were killed in a battle in western Homs. Al Sayed said when he saw the video, he told his friend to take it off the Internet because the act was so perverse. ""This was an isolated incident. (His) actions do not represent the FSA. His actions only represent himself,"" al Sayed said. ""This is not just a normal person who sits home. He has had two brothers killed. His mom and dad were detained, and the rest of his family displaced."" The Baba Amr district of Homs, once a bastion of anti-government sentiment, was subjected to a brutal counteroffensive by the Syrian army starting in February 2012, Human Rights Watch said. Homs came under weeks of relentless attacks by government forces, including indiscriminate shelling on civilian areas. But the government has repeatedly denied attacking civilians, saying Syrian forces were targeting armed gangs and foreign terrorists bent on destabilizing the government. Regardless of the horrors suffered in Homs, the atrocious act in the video is inexcusable, Human Rights Watch said. ""It is not enough for Syria's opposition to condemn such behavior or blame it on violence by the government,"" said Nadim Houry, Middle East deputy director at Human Rights Watch. ""The opposition forces need to act firmly to stop such abuses.""","The rebel Free Syrian Army says it will investigate whether the man is in the FSA .

"(CNN)""Age before beauty"" goes the old adage, but in the advertising industry the opposite has always seemed to be the case. Young, fresh faced women were chosen as the poster girls for brands selling products to make women look and feel young again, or maintain that ever essential 'youthful glow'. But now it seems that fashion and cosmetics companies in particular are moving towards a somewhat older group of models. At 80 years old, author Joan Didion was announced as the new face of Céline for SS15 and is the subject of a new photography show  -  and she is not the first older woman to have been chosen by big brands. She joins other older models including Helen Mirren (69) and Jane Fonda (76) for L'Oreal, Joni Mitchell (71) for Saint Laurent and Charlotte Rampling (69) who became the face of Nars lipstick late last year. Hiring older models has been de rigueur lately with Julia Roberts, 47, having continued success as the face of Lancôme, but that does not mean she is not feeling the pressure. ""By Hollywood standards, I guess I've already taken a big risk in not having had a facelift,"" Roberts told the UK's You Magazine. ""I've told Lancôme that I want to be an ageing model -- so they have to keep me for at least five more years until I'm over 50."" Eschewing plastic surgery, Roberts has her own methods of looking young; ""It's about non-grasping, non-hoarding, cleaning out your closet, dusting out your mind and letting go of the things that weigh you down mentally and emotionally."" Award-winning photographer Nancy Honey has her own ideas about why its important to see images of older women: ""In my own lifetime I have witnessed a profound shift: from little girls imagining their future as marriage and children to the now total belief from childhood that a woman will grow up to have a career outside the home."" ""It is more important than ever to see the important women from all fields in our society and hear their voices of experience."" Honey's recent exhibition at Somerset house, 100 Leading Ladies, aimed to transform the perception of what is possible for women to achieve in their lives. 100 older British women were photographed Honey in settings that inspire them and interviewed by former Times journalist Hattie Garlick, the results were all compiled into a book, published by Dewi Lewis Media which was launched in tandem with the Somerset House exhibition.

"(CNN)Colombian beauty queen Paulina Vega may soon have a new role: peace negotiator. The newly-crowned Miss Universe got an invitation Saturday from Colombia's leftist FARC rebels to attend their peace talks with the government. Rebels took her up on an offer she's made in the past that she's willing to attend the negotiations in Cuba. ""We have read with interest about your desire to contribute your services to achieve peace and reconciliation between Colombians,"" FARC said in a statement on its website. ""We salute your willingness to travel to Havana at the same time that we invite you to make the trip to exhibit the development of the process of talks."" Vega, 22, a business administration major at a Bogota university, was crowned Miss Universe in Miami last month. Though the native of Barranquilla has not  responded to the offer, the rebels emphasized that her input is important. ""Rest assured that there is complete willingness to respond to your concerns and to value your opinions as a valuable contribution to peace,"" the statement said. The talks are crucial to helping end 50 years of fighting between FARC and the government. Negotiations between the two sides have stalled several times over the years, and the group has been accused of bombings, murder, extortion and kidnappings. FARC started as an insurgency in 1964 and continues to champion leftist causes. But with Colombia being one of the world's top cocaine producers,  the rebels have added drug trafficking to their list of atrocities. The group is estimated to make $500 million from the illicit trade per year, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)Amid renewed violence in eastern Ukraine, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, Germany and France planned a face-to-face meeting in Belarus on Wednesday. The gathering of the four presidents, who have been talking for days on the phone or through diplomatic channels, is a significant development, as the heads of state would not want to walk away from such a gathering empty-handed. A spokesman for the German government told CNN that ""all sides have agreed"" to the meeting. But an attempt to gather these four leaders in January fell through after negotiations failed to reap agreements before the meeting date. Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, speaking with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, hinted that Wednesday's announced meeting might not be a done deal. Putin confirmed that he spoke with his counterparts in Ukraine, Germany and France, but he added that the meeting will happen ""if we succeed in settling the various points that we have discussed so intensively over these last days."" So there is uncertainty about this meeting happening, but given the serious worsening of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the Germans feel it is worth a try. The big challenge facing Putin, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande is whether they can reach a peace agreement that will stick. A peace agreement was signed in September -- also in Minsk, Belarus -- that envisaged a ceasefire and the creation of a buffer zone between the warring sides, as well as constitutional changes. However, it quickly crumbled amid continued fighting. Western leaders and the Ukrainian government accuse Russia of providing weapons and training to the pro-Russian separatists battling Ukrainian forces in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. They have also accused Russia of sending troops to the border to fight. Russia has denied the allegations. But some Western leaders continue to strongly hit at Putin. On Sunday, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Putin was acting like a ""mid-20th century tyrant."" Speaking to Sky News, Hammond said Russia's behavior was ""outrageous and outdated"" and warned that Putin will ""pay the price for what he is doing in Ukraine."" All the while, the conflict -- which actually stemmed from a trade agreement -- has killed more than 5,000 people. Over the past day, shelling killed eight civilians in Ukraine's Donetsk region, a rebel official told reporters Sunday. At least 17 other civilians were injured in the shelling, said Eduard Basurin, the self-declared deputy defense minister of the rebel group Donetsk People's Republic. Civilians increasingly are falling victim to the violence in Ukraine, with at least 224 killed and more than 540 injured in just the final three weeks of January, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said. Meanwhile, Ukrainian forces killed 70 insurgents and a eliminated a number of tanks, artillery and rockets over the past day, a military spokesman said Sunday. But 12 Ukrainian soldiers were also killed, and another 24 were wounded by pro-Russian forces who shelled the town of Debaltseve, Col. Andriy Lysenko said in Kiev. Some U.S. officials are considering sending lethal aid to the Ukrainian military. ""Asserting that there is no military solution -- which is a truism -- should not lead us to believe that there is no military dimension to the problem or that hard power can play no role in a favorable solution,"" U.S. Sen. John McCain said Sunday. ""Putin does not want a diplomatic solution, he wants to dominate Ukraine as well as Russia's other neighbors,"" McCain added, calling Russia's military backing of rebels ""a harsh reality."" But some Europeans, such as Merkel, have concerns about arming Ukrainian fighters. ""The progress that Ukraine needs cannot be achieved with more weapons,"" she said. ""I have grave doubts about the validity of this point."" Merkel said she believes that if the West provides lethal aid to Ukraine, then Russia could up the battle -- and possibly introduce its air force into the fight. But on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States and Europe are united in their diplomatic efforts. ""Let me assure everyone there is no division, there is no split,"" he said at the Munich Security Conference in Germany. He reiterated that there is no military solution to the crisis with separatists in eastern Ukraine, and that borders should not be changed by force. ""But the longer that it takes,"" Kerry warned, ""the more the off-ramps are avoided, (and) the more we will be forced to raise the costs on Russia and its proxies.""

"Cairo (CNN)International human rights lawyer Amal Clooney will travel to Cairo in hopes of freeing jailed journalist Mohamed Fahmy, the journalist said in a statement released by his family Sunday. Fahmy, who holds dual Canadian-Egyptian citizenship, has been granted a retrial, he said in the statement. ""The trial date on February 12 represents our worst nightmare, to have to go through another circus of a retrial,"" he said. Fahmy was one of three Al Jazeera journalists arrested in Cairo in December 2013 and accused of being part of the country's banned Muslim Brotherhood. Producer Baher Mohamed, who is Egyptian, also remains behind bars. Australian Peter Greste, who was sentenced to seven years and spent 400 days in prison, was released last week. On February 2, Clooney gave CNN a statement regarding Fahmy, who also used to work for CNN. ""I have been in touch with the Fahmy family and we are all delighted that Peter Greste has been released,"" it said. ""As Mr. Fahmy's counsel we are doing all we can to ensure the same outcome for Mr. Fahmy, who has suffered the same injustice."" Fahmy's fiancee, Arwa Emara, told CNN in December that she had hoped, before Fahmy's arrest, that they would have a ""very simple life."" ""I was very happy when I first met Mohamed,"" she said. ""I felt that he's the one. And after his arrest, I found myself doing things that I never expected that I`m able to do."" Emara sent a letter at that time to Clooney requesting that Fahmy be released and sent to Canada. For many months, Fahmy's family has tried to call attention to serious health problems the journalist is enduring in prison. Fahmy is suffering from a dislocated shoulder, they say. The journalist's brother Adel Fahmy told CNN on Sunday that the Fahmy family is shocked and devastated by word of a retrial. Adel Fahmy blames the Canadian government for failing to secure his brother's release. ""We have no clue what happened, but we are very upset with how the Canadian government has dealt with this case from day one,"" he said. ""We had confirmations from highest sources that he would be deported in the coming days ... and all we got is false hope."" He said that his brother formally renounced his Egyptian citizenship because officials told him that if he did, he would be released. ""We don't understand why he has to stand in court when he has (renounced) his passport,"" Adel Fahmy said."" That was the deal ... that he'd denounce his citizenship, that they (the Egyptian government) would not announce it to the media, but they did the exact opposite. They did announce it to the media and he is devastated that this is happening to him."" Mohamed Fahmy has a ""permanent disability in his arm,"" his brother said, adding that because the journalist had been wrongly imprisoned, his ""reputation has been severely tainted."" Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Greste's freedom was won ""unconditionally."" The journalists were accused of supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood, though each has maintained steadfastly that they did nothing wrong. One of Greste's lawyers suggested days ago there could be more legal issues ahead for him. ""According to Egyptian law, this is considered an extradition,"" Amr Eldib said. ""Peter must be tried in Australia and authorities there must determine if he is guilty or not."" CNN's Ian Lee reported from Cairo; CNN's Ashley Fantz and Josh Levs reported from Atlanta.","Clooney will go to Cairo to push for Mohamed Fahmy's freedom .

"Washington (CNN)Republican 2016 presidential maneuvering dominated our Sunday trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table: . The cast changes, somewhat, at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, but for years the format has been the same: back-to-back-to-back-to-back speeches by politicians and activists. But this year will be different, and perhaps include some interesting interaction involving 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls. Politico's Mike Allen had the scoop on some of the new format ideas on the table as the planning enters its final stages. ""They're going to try to have as many of the candidates on stage as they can, maybe with an anchor asking them questions, then maybe have their board members asking the questions, have people from the audience asking them questions,"" he said. ""And that's part of the Conservative Political Action Conference trying to say to Republicans, 'We're going to play a role in vetting these people. Here's what they look like without a teleprompter.' "" It's no surprise that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will be speaking to two big conservative gatherings this month: the annual conferences of CPAC and The Club for Growth. But this will be fun to watch: an incursion into ""enemy"" territory. Cruz has agreed to be the keynote speaker next week at the Duval County GOP Lincoln Day Dinner in Jacksonville, Florida -- home territory of GOP prospects Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Cruz is also staffing up as he gets closer to making the obvious official. CNN is told that longtime Newt Gingrich spokesman and strategist Rick Tyler is joining the Cruz political operation, adding a veteran communications operative with D.C. and presidential campaign experience to the team. Jeb Bush is an obvious winner now that Mitt Romney has bowed out of the 2016 GOP race: The two leading establishment figures were courting many of the same donors and operatives. But Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker also sensed an opening and acted quickly, and CNN's Peter Hamby tells us it was a smart and effective play. ""He has been as aggressive as Jeb Bush in making phone calls and hiring staff, digital people, fundraisers,"" said Hamby. ""This is really interesting to watch, because the invisible primary is not just about poll numbers and who's up and who's down. It's what you're doing with it. And he's actually done a lot, especially with the departure of Mitt Romney from the field."" South Carolina's senior senator, Lindsey Graham, says he might make a long-shot bid for the GOP nomination. Now, his junior colleague, Sen. Tim Scott, is making moves to expand his influence in the state that votes third in the nominating process. Scott this week is playing host to Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, yet another 2016 prospect, for a forum about educational choice. And Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post reports that it's part of an effort by Scott to expand his national profile and influence in the presidential race. He is up for re-election in 2016, and he plans to help his campaign by inviting all of the Republican presidential contenders to join him. ""Not certain yet whether or not he'll actually make an endorsement,"" said Henderson. ""Someone asked him whether or not Lindsey Graham runs, whether or not that would be an automatic endorsement. He said maybe, maybe not."" His endorsement would help, and Henderson says that while Scott very much likes and respects his colleague Graham, he can't take things for granted. Mitt Romney decided against a third run for the presidency in 2016, but Democrats aren't ready to throw away their anti-Romney playbook just yet. As long as Jeb Bush has a prominent place in the GOP field, the Democrats think -- Julie Pace of The Associated Press tells us -- those notes might still come in handy. ""They both worked in finance, they both backed the Wall Street bailout, they both opposed the auto bailout,"" said Pace. ""After Jeb Bush makes his speeches, you sometimes get notes from Democrats saying: 'Oh, look how similar this is to things Mitt Romney said.' ""The obvious advantage for Jeb Bush is that he's seen this playbook run before. He may be able to come up with a better strategy than Mitt.""","The Conservative Political Action Conference is considering a new format for the 2016 candidates .

"A man who says he was molested by Jerry Sandusky has filed a private criminal complaint in Pennsylvania, trying to force prosecutors to reopen their investigation into the former coach and take him, once again, to trial. The man, who we're calling Victim X, told his story to CNN. ""A big part of the healing process is to face your accuser,"" he said. Victim X said Sandusky molested him in 1988 when he was a junior in high school. He was a top recruit in football and baseball who was being sought by several schools, and decided to attend a weeklong football camp at Penn State. There, he met Sandusky, and said that he was molested twice by the then-defensive coordinator: once in the showers in the assistant coaches locker room and once in Sandusky's office. Both places are well known to investigators as places where other victims were abused several times. The showers in particular were a main setting and focal point of Sandusky's trial. It's in those showers that at least four of Sandusky's victims claim to have been abused, and it's the place where former assistant coach Mike McQueary said he witnessed Sandusky abusing a different boy in 2001. By January 1989, Victim X said his life of promise had spiraled into one of vices he couldn't shake, which he blames on the abuse. ""From drinking and drugging, destruction, confusion, anger and rage,"" he said. ""One episode triggers another one and it becomes an everlasting nightmare."" In his 20s, he racked up a rap sheet that included drug and theft charges, and later a killing that he pleaded down to manslaughter. All those years, he never told a soul that Sandusky had touched him, until November 2011, as Sandusky's arrest in other cases was making national headlines and leading news coverage for days. He watched from his jail cell where he was serving time on a parole violation and decided to call his lawyer. Within days, he said, investigators from the Pennsylvania State Attorney General's Office showed up and conducted a four-hour interview, during which he drew a diagram of the football facilities that his lawyers say police found to be credible. Even though his story, he said, was initially verified by police, it wasn't part of the original case of 10 boys against Sandusky. Instead, it was shelved for the possibility of a ""round two"" prosecution that was not pursued because Sandusky is serving a de facto life sentence; at age 68 he was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison for 45 counts of child sexual abuse. ""They told me that I would be part of the second criminal trial the following year, but they never had a second trial,"" Victim X said. ""What we're asking for is his day in court against Jerry Sandusky,"" said Victim X's attorney, Mitchell Garabedian, in Boston. ""It's not unusual for victims to take this avenue to want to proceed criminally against a person who effectively has a life sentence. A victim has their right to a day in court. A crime was committed against him."" Sandusky's attorney, Al Lindsay, declined to comment on Victim X's allegations. Garabedian said he believes it's up to the Attorney General's Office whether it pursues another criminal case, but Garabedian said it's important to Victim X, who was an aspiring athlete, to finally face his abuser. Renee Martin, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, told CNN that while the statute of limitations may have run out in Victim X's case, the office is ""talking to the victim's attorney and the district attorney and working through the issues together because of the importance of the case."" More than 30 victims in total have come forward, although 10 cases were tried. Most of the victims have settled with Penn State, but a few have refused to settle and Victim X is one of them. He and his family said they didn't feel Penn State's settlement offer was fair, given the fact that three university officials have been charged with knowing about abuse in 1998 and in 2001, and not doing enough to stop it. The man and his family said that if Sandusky's crimes had been properly reported earlier, his abuse would have been discovered far sooner, and his case would have fallen within the civil statute of limitations. Now, 26 years later, it does not, and they are in a weaker bargaining position for a monetary settlement. They are also upset that no official from Penn State ever attended a meeting with them or apologized. Ken Feinberg, who was hired on the university's behalf to settle with victims, was the only person to meet with the family. University officials declined to comment on Victim X's case. ""The main point for me is coming forward and learning how to live with it on a day-to-day basis,"" he said. ""I don't want to hide anything.""","""Victim X"" says Sandusky abused him when he was a junior in high school .

"The man who shot up downtown Austin last week had the words, ""Let me die,"" written in marker on his chest, the city's police chief said Monday. Larry McQuilliams, 49, was killed outside police headquarters Friday, after opening fire at a federal courthouse and a Mexican consulate, which he also seemingly tried to set ablaze. ""Folks are saying that this man wasn't trying to hurt anybody. I beg to differ. ""He shot at an occupied police headquarters. It's occupied 24 hours a day, and by the grace of God we were able to dodge quite a few bullets here,"" Chief Art Acevedo told reporters. No one -- besides the suspect -- was killed or injured in the attacks, which the chief said could have been much worse. He said investigators found a map that included 34 locations marked as targets in McQuilliams' possessions. The majority of the locations were either government buildings, including the ones that he attacked, or financial institutions, Acevedo said. The map included two churches. Investigators also found a book, ""Vigilantes Of Christendom,"" the police chief said. Inside the book was a handwritten note that discussed McQuilliams' rank as a ""priest in the fight against anti-God"" people, Acevedo said. According to Christopher Combs, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio division, McQuilliams had mentioned to some people that he was upset because he couldn't find a job and because, in his view, immigrants were able to get more services than he was. Authorities believe McQuilliams acted alone. ""We were very lucky,"" said Acevedo. ""When you look at the fact that we had 34 buildings marked, I really believe that the men and women of the Austin Police Department saved lives.""","Larry McQuilliams, 49, shot up downtown Austin last week; he was killed .

"(CNN)A selfie taken by a homicide suspect posing with his alleged victim and later posted to the social media site Snapchat ""was a key piece of evidence that led investigators to the defendant,"" John Peck, district attorney for Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, said Monday. The photo shows the victim, 16-year old Ryan Mangan, sitting in a chair with a gunshot wound to his face, according to police documents. A male taking the photo faces the camera with the victim behind him. According to the criminal complaint, Mangan was found dead by his mother last Wednesday after he was shot in the face inside his home. When police searched the home, they found a 9 mm shell casing but no firearm. A couple of days after Mangan's body was discovered, police received a call from a mother whose son received a Snapchat photo from the suspect, 16. The photo had the suspect's first name across the top, and it matched the description of the crime scene. Peck says authorities plan to charge the suspect as an adult. CNN is not naming him because he is a minor and has not yet been formally charged. The mother said her son also received messages from the suspect that said, ""Told you I cleaned up the shells"" and ""Ryan was not the last one."" Authorities executed a search warrant at the suspect's home, where they found a 9 mm handgun in the basement hidden under the steps. Police say he confessed to using the firearm to shoot Mangan in the face and leaving him in his room. He is accused of homicide and a firearms count. A preliminary hearing for the suspect has been scheduled for February 19. CNN's Karan Olson contributed to this report.","Ryan Mangan was found dead in his home last Wednesday .

"Dzanga Bai is a magical place of natural wonder. It is on the Central African Republic's southwest border with the Republic of Congo and is widely considered the most important gathering place for forest elephants in the entire Congo basin. For decades -- and probably centuries -- elephants by the hundreds from across the region have congregated there, reconnecting with family members and drinking the mineral-rich waters. Last May, a group of heavily armed men, believed to be linked to the Seleka rebel group, entered Dzanga Bai and slaughtered a reported two dozen elephants. By the time Dzanga Bai's elephant carcasses were discovered, the perpetrators were gone, leaving in their wake a horrific crime scene of heads carved up for their precious ivory. Tusks like these, typically destined for Asian markets, where growing demand has quickly driven up prices, have in recent years presented a new opportunity for quick cash to finance the operations of armed gangs from  the Central African Republic east to Somalia. It is now widely understood that groups ranging from Darfur's Janjaweed to Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army have turned to this revenue source. The growth of these groups, with funds from illegal wildlife trafficking, is destabilizing African governments even as it devastates populations of elephants, rhinos and other high value wildlife. Operating through terror and intimidation, roving rebel armies undermine democratic governance and responsible resource management while devastating regional economies through disruptions to tourism and local livelihoods. In meetings in the United States, Asia and Africa this year, we have listened as leaders have shared their growing anxiety. The new poachers are tied to criminal syndicates.  Rifles and machetes have been enhanced or replaced with helicopters, night visions goggles, sophisticated telecommunications and automatic weapons. Local communities are terrified and national governments fear losing large swaths of territory to these gangs. Out of these conversations has emerged a challenge to the world—from African nations--to stop buying ivory. Representatives of the governments of Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Gabon, Liberia, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda, along with the international nongovernmental organizations we represent, have gathered in New York this week to announce an important commitment through the Clinton Global Initiative. Together, we have three straightforward goals: (1) stop the killing; (2) stop the trafficking; and (3) stop the demand. To stop the killing and the trafficking, the international community can help states that make up the present range of the African elephant by providing equipment, training and expertise. President Obama recently dedicated $10 million for law enforcement efforts and the creation of a wildlife trafficking task force at the highest levels of the U.S. government, complementing existing U.S. initiatives. European and other nations, along with private citizens, need to join him in committing emergency resources to enforcement efforts in elephant landscapes and ivory trafficking ports. Despite a ban on international trade in ivory imposed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 1989, domestic sales remain legal in a number of countries, including the United States.  Because these legal markets can provide a front for laundering illegal ivory into the trade, moratoria on domestic sales of ivory are also a vital part of anti-trafficking efforts. Stopping the demand requires new strategies. Removing the prestige associated with buying ivory requires creative new uses of social media and other tools to change consumption behavior in China and elsewhere. Once the demand for ivory is curtailed there will be little financial incentive for criminal groups to continue elephant poaching and trafficking. Yet because carved ivory is a centuries-old cultural tradition, this change will take time -- something the world's dwindling elephant populations don't have. That is why African nations with the greatest remaining elephant populations have begun to call for nations across the globe to stop selling and purchasing ivory until all African elephant populations have recovered to healthy levels. The devastating poaching crisis that has gripped Africa over the past decade has left multiple tragedies in its wake: the loss of roughly three-quarters of all remaining African forest elephants; the murder of hundreds of courageous wildlife guards; regional government resources stretched to their limits as villagers across sub-Saharan Africa live in daily terror. The initiative launched this week by representatives of elephant range states, ivory consumer nations, and our organizations has been endorsed by an unprecedented group of conservation partners that include the African Parks Network, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the Frankfurt Zoological Society, the Freeland Foundation, the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, National Geographic, Save the Elephants, TRAFFIC, WildAid, and Wildlife Direct. This effort is our best bet at saving these majestic, highly intelligent and socially complex creatures while bringing much-needed stability to governments whose hopes for a brighter future require that armed gangs no longer operate within their borders. Before it's too late, let's stop the killing, stop the trafficking and stop the demand.","Writers: Elephant poaching in Africa helps finance armed gangs and rebel armies .

"(CNN)Italy's former soccer coach Arrigo Sacchi has told CNN he's been misunderstood over comments attributed to him that there were ""too many black players"" in the country's youth ranks. Sacchi, who won back-to-back European Cup titles with AC Milan and led Italy to the World Cup final in 1994, has come under fire after speaking at an awards ceremony in Tuscany. ""I'm not racist and my history as a coach shows that, but watching at the Viareggio Cup makes me think there are too many colored players,"" Sacchi was quoted as saying by the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport. The Viareggio Cup is an important Italian youth tournament. ""Business interests now come first. Italy has no dignity, it has no pride: you shouldn't have squads including 15 foreigners,"" added the 68-year-old in the Gazzetta interview. When contacted by CNN the former director of football at European champions Real Madrid explained: ""It's the media -- some of them, not all of them -- which are always looking for scoops. ""There's nothing I have to clarify, if there is ignorance and bad faith you can't clarify."" Sacchi's successive European triumphs with AC Milan in 1988 and 1989 were completed with a team for whom black players Frank Rijkaard and Ruud Gullit were instrumental. He pointed to the Dutch pair as proof that he wasn't racist when clarifying his comments but reiterated his belief there were too many foreign players in Italy. It's a widely held belief in football that the more overseas players there are in a league the less likely it is a country's national team will be successful on the international stage. Italy last won the World Cup in 2006 and failed to escape the group stages at the 2010 and 2014 events. According to the respected CIES Football Observatory -- specialists in statistical analysis for football -- Italy has seen a bigger spike in overseas players than any of Europe's other big leagues since 2009. In an article published in November 2014, it said the percentage of non-Italian nationals had risen from 42.4% to 54.8%. ""I just said that we don't have the Italian pride, we are losing our identity. I was watching a match today and I saw four black guys in a team,"" Sacchi told CNN. ""They weren't labeled as foreigners, they were guys. I am 68, I have a 40-year history. Thirty years ago I made (Ruud) Gullit and (Frank) Rijkaard play, when you weren't even born. What do you want? ""It's not a matter of color. I think the problem is having too many foreigners."" Sacchi left his role as technical coordinator of youth development with the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) in July after four years, citing stress as the main factor. ""I am leaving behind an assignment which I care a lot about, but I have a terrible adversary -- one I was able to manage for 22 or 23 years but that is now winning the battle -- and that is stress,"" he said on the FIGC's website at the time. When contacted by CNN, the FIGC said it would not be commenting directly on Sacchi's remarks given he was no longer an employee. But Diego Antenozio, from the FIGC, said: ""Our engagement against racism both inside and outside the pitch is transparent and consistent. ""I can firmly state that the FIGC believes and operates before the FIFA Regulations and Statutes, aims to include people without any sort prejudice and by granting everybody the opportunity to practice football beyond any race or gender as you can understand from this whole story."" Sacchi's five-year stint in charge of the national team saw him guide Italy to its first World Cup final in 12 years when it faced Brazil in the 1994, only to lose on penalties. As well as his storied stint at Milan, Sacchi also had two spells at Italian club Parma and coached current Spanish champions Atletico Madrid. This is the latest in a line of incidents involving race to cloud Italian football. Last year world football's governing body FIFA banned the current FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio for six months after he referred to African players as ""banana eaters."" The 71-year-old waded into the debate that followed Italy's disappointing performance at the 2014 World Cup and said there should be more stringent criteria for foreign players to operate in Italy's leagues. Tavecchio was running to become president of the FIGC when he made the comments and though several Italian clubs withdrew their support, he was elected with 63% of the vote. UEFA also banned Tavecchio for six months but though the FIGC investigated his remarks it decided not to take any disciplinary action.","Former Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi says his comments on black players were misunderstood .

"(CNN)Bruce Jenner says he's cooperating with police as they investigate a fatal car crash involving the reality TV star. ""My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident,"" Jenner said in a statement released Sunday by his publicist, Alan Nierob. ""It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible."" Jenner earlier told police that paparazzi were chasing him when he was in the wreck, but investigators have said there's no sign photographers following him played a role in the crash. ""That is a very regular occurrence, and (there is) no indication at this time it was a contributing factor of the crash,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Lt. John Lecrivain said. Authorities haven't determined who was at fault in the Saturday crash, Sgt. Phillip Brooks of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told CNN Sunday. They also haven't released details about the victim. Jenner first catapulted to fame after winning the 1976 Olympic decathlon and now draws the celebrity spotlight for his role on the ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" reality show. He was driving a black Cadillac SUV on Saturday that was the third vehicle involved in a multiple rear-end collision, Brooks said. The first vehicle was a black Toyota Prius, CNN affiliate KCAL reported, citing deputies. Behind it was a white Lexus sedan that also hit its brakes. Jenner's Escalade was towing a trailer with an all-terrain vehicle on it when it ran into the Lexus from behind, Brooks said. The Lexus spun into oncoming traffic and was hit by a Hummer H2. The driver of the Lexus was killed. Photos published on the TMZ celebrity gossip website purported to show the moment of impact. No information about the deceased was immediately available. Jenner, 65, was not injured in the crash, publicist Alan Nierob said. KCAL reported Jenner's SUV left skid marks. The wreck took place shortly after noon on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, the Sheriff's Department said. The department later opened a vehicular manslaughter investigation, a source close to the case told CNN legal analyst Mark Geragos. The investigation will focus on everyone in the case, not just one person, the source said. The Sheriff's Department said on its Facebook page that the surviving drivers were cooperating with investigators. A deputy said Jenner voluntarily took a field sobriety test, was questioned and went home. Five children and two adults were hospitalized with injuries, authorities said. The accident occurred on a tricky stretch of the highway, where the road is narrow and twisting. In a bizarre twist to the story, a car later drove through safety barriers around the scene and struck two of the cars from the initial accident, Cmdr. Mike Parker of the Sheriff's Department tweeted. The driver was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, Parker wrote. Jenner won the 1976 Olympic decathlon with a world record score for the 10-discipline event. He quickly capitalized on his success with Wheaties commercials, appearances and other ventures. He became an actor, appearing in the drama ""CHiPs"" in 1981 and occasionally playing himself on shows such as ""Silver Spoons."" More recently, he has gained fame as the well-known stepfather of Khloe, Kim and Kourtney Kardashian on their family's E! entertainment network reality show. He and Kris Jenner, the show's matriarch, divorced last year. E! said Jenner was not shooting for ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" on the day of the accident.

"(CNN)When fields get plowed, diamonds don't usually pop up. That's unless you're visiting Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro, Arkansas. That's where Dean Filppula, an offshore steward from Shreveport, Louisiana, found a yellow 2.01-carat diamond last week. It's finders, keepers at the state park's 37-acre search field, which is named for an ancient eruption that littered the area with gems. The area, which became a state park in 1972, is the only public site in the world where -- for a small fee -- you can dig for diamonds and keep them. The sparkling wedge-shaped stone is about the size of an English pea, park interpreter Waymon Cox said in a news release. It's the largest stone of the 20 found this year, he said. ""More than half an inch of rain had fallen two days before his visit, washing loose soil from the surface of the diamond search area, and, no doubt, uncovering the large, yellow gem,"" Cox said. ""Anyone could have found it, but Mr. Filppula was in the right place at the right time."" Filppula, who plans to sell the diamond, named it the Merf Diamond after his mother's initials. It's not clear how much Filppula will get for the diamond, and park officials aren't trained to appraise them, according to the park website. But Oklahoma Tara Clymer found a 3.85-carat diamond in 2013 and sold it last year for $20,000. A CNN 50 states pick: Crater of Diamonds . Before Filppula's find, park staff had plowed the area to bring more diamonds to the surface for visitors to find. The 40.23-carat Uncle Sam, the nation's largest diamond, was found in 1924. The ""perfect"" 3.03-carat Strawn-Wagner diamond was found in 1990, and a man discovered the white 6.19-carat Limitless Diamond in April. The park stretches for more than 900 acres along the Little Missouri River, but the hunt in the diamond field is the big draw. More than 75,000 diamonds have been discovered there since farmer John Huddleston discovered gems on what was then his property in 1906.","A Louisiana man finds a 2-carat diamond in an Arkansas state park .

Of the 100 bodies recovered, 72 have been identified, police said. Efforts are underway to identify the remaining victims. AirAsia Flight 8501 plunged into the sea on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore. It had 162 people on board. Divers resumed their attempt to lift up the fuselage of the Airbus jet on Sunday after earlier attempts failed. Before the plane crashed, the co-pilot was flying the jet as the more experienced pilot monitored the flight. Things may have gone wrong in a span of three minutes and 20 seconds, triggering a stall warning that sounded until it crashed into the Java Sea, according to Indonesia's transportation officials. Though it's common for the co-pilot to be in control of the aircraft, significant questions remain.  Why did the plane start a sudden, steep ascent? Was bad weather a factor? The plane was in good condition and the entire crew was certified, said Mardjono Siswosuwarno, the chief investigator for the transportation committee. The flight took off and cruised at 32,000 feet amid stormy weather. The pilot then asked the control tower whether the plane could ascend to 38,000 feet, according to the committee. The plane was veering left and wobbling, said Ertata Lanang Galih, a senior pilot and investigator with the committee. It then ascended from its cruising altitude to 37,400 feet in about 30 seconds in a steep ascent, the chief investigator said. Commercial planes are not designed to ascend so quickly, and may have been climbing at a rate twice as fast as it should, analysts said. Officials have said that the aircraft climbed rapidly before it tumbled into the water. Investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash, but officials said they would not release it just yet. It's unclear whether or when the initial report will be released. While that report presents facts, officials indicated there isn't enough verification yet. CNN's Faith Karimi wrote and reported from Atlanta, and journalist Masrur Jamaluddin reported from Jakarta, Indonesia .","Of the total bodies recovered, 72 have been identified, officials say .

"(CNN)Sorry, Northeast. It's not over yet. Another winter storm barreling toward some parts of the region Sunday is expected to pile on to already record snowfalls. Experts issued winter storm warnings across upstate New York, northern Connecticut, northern Rhode Island and the greater Boston area. Schools in parts of the Northeast, including Boston, will be closed Monday and Tuesday. ""Snow accumulations of 10 to 20 inches, possibly up to 24 inches in parts of central and northeast Massachusetts,""  the National Weather Service said. It described it as a ""long duration snow event"" that could last until Monday night. Warnings are in place through early Tuesday morning. Upstate New York could see 9 to 18 inches of snow through Monday night, the National Weather Service said. Flurries and light snow fell in Boston on Saturday night, and heavy snow was expected Sunday night through Monday. ""At this time, our concern is not just about the snow that has begun to fall. It's about the cumulative impact of this storm coming on the heels of the others,"" Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker told reporters Sunday. Wind gusts could be up to 35 mph, bringing poor visibility and possible whiteout conditions, said CNN meteorologist Michael Guy. In what appears to be a common theme these days, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh urged people to stay indoors and off the roads. ""We need residents to take extra precautions as we prepare for another storm and extremely low temperatures,"" he said in a statement. The weather forced big Massachusetts trials to be delayed. The murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez was postponed until Tuesday, while jury selection in the trial of Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was also delayed. Two storms have hit the Northeast in the past two weeks, closing airports, canceling classes and creating piles of snow along cleared roadways. ""I'm tired of it,"" said Boston University freshman Cameron Barkan, who has missed three days of class because of the storms. ""I usually like snow, but this is just a little much."" Boston has set a record for the snowiest seven-day period in history, with over 40 inches, the National Weather Service said.  The city is way past its average annual snowfall of 47 inches. Winter weather will keep its grip on the region late in the week, with temperatures dropping to the teens again by Friday, Guy said. Track the storm .

"(CNN) -- Freed activist Aung San Suu Kyi has made a passionate plea for dialogue and reconciliation to build democracy and improve human rights in Myanmar, calling for her country to back her as she cannot ""do it alone."" But long-term fundamental political and economic reforms will not just depend on shifting internal dynamics, but also on the stance of its neighbors, particularly the regional superpowers China and India. Both countries are significant investors in Myanmar, also known as Burma, and both are also competing for influence in the state, with neither country taking a genuine interest in reconciliation or democracy in Myanmar, some analysts say. Maung Zarni, a research fellow on Myanmar at the London School of Economics, told CNN: ""China and India both have a serious influence on Burma... both provide billions of inward investment into the country and they are dealing with a junta that is not accountable to anyone, and that serves the interests of Chinese and Indian investors."" But according to Debbie Stothard, of the Thailand-based Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma, the competition between India and China serves only to stymie the cause of democracy in Myanmar. China has been Myanmar's closest ally since the hardline military took control in a bloodless coup in 1962. China has in the past refused to back Suu Kyi, saying the matter of her trial was an internal affair. China is building pipelines to ship oil and gas from Myanmar to Yunnan province and is Myanmar's second-largest trading partner -- it is keen to tap Myanmar's mineral, timber and other natural resources needed for its booming economy, analysts say . India also has been investing in Myanmar's power sector as it looks to secure future energy supplies. Many regional observers say that the generals of the Myanmar military junta, who have remained largely isolationist for 50 years, are more likely to listen to and accept pressure from China and India than either the West, the U.N. or ASEAN, the political and economic organization. ""Economics is one of the external enablers that have permitted the Burmese regime to stay the course. I am extremely skeptical of what the ruling elite in India and the communists in China will do to assist the Burmese people,"" said Zarni. Both China and India have had a difficult relationship with Suu Kyi, who won a landslide election victory in 1990 with the National League for Democracy party. The military junta rejected the results and despite the recent freeing of Suu Kyi, the regime is still holding an estimated 2,200 political prisoners according to Amnesty International. Mark Farmaner, director of the Burma Campaign UK, told CNN: ""Chinese officials were reluctant to talk to her [Suu Kyi] and Indian government officials didn't want to upset the [Myanmar] government. Ordinary people in Burma feel betrayed by India and they see China as backing the generals."" Thailand, another Myanmar neighbor, buys about 30 percent of its gas from Myanmar, estimated to have been worth $3.3 billion in 2008. The sales are giving Myanmar a financial cushion, rendering ineffective economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union designed to pressure the junta. Suu Kyi recently indicated she might be willing to support an easing of these sanctions. ""The Thais now feel vulnerable because they are so reliant on Burma for energy so it would not be in their interests to upset the regime. India's main concern is China and its potential dominance of Burma... India doesn't want Burma to become another Chinese outpost,"" said Farmaner.","""China and India both have a serious influence on Burma,"" says Maung Zarni, LSE .

"London (CNN)Cosmologist Stephen Hawking says he was ""happy"" to lend his trademark synthesized voice to actor Eddie Redmayne, who portrays the British scientist in the drama about his life, ""to give him a bit of a boost in his efforts to win an Oscar."" Although, joked the 73-year-old physicist, ""Unfortunately, Eddie did not inherit my good looks."" Hawking suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a degenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. He irreversibly lost the ability to speak in 1985 after having a tube inserted into his windpipe during a bout of severe pneumonia and now communicates in instantly recognizable tones using an electronic speech synthesizer. ""Before I lost my voice, it was slurred, so only those close to me could understand [it]. But with the computer voice, I found I could give popular lectures,"" Hawking said. ""Although it gave me an American accent, I have kept that voice, because it's now my trademark."" Hawking's comments came as he gave a personal guided tour of London's Science Museum to 24-year-old L.A.-resident Adaeze Uyanwah, who beat more than 10,000 entrants in a competition to be named London's Official Guest of Honor. Redmayne, 32, has been nominated for an Academy Award for best actor for his uncanny transformation into Hawking. The actor has already picked up an armful of awards for the role, including both the BAFTA and Golden Globe prizes for best actor, and is in the running to take home an Oscar when the winners are announced on February 22. ""The Theory of Everything"" follows Hawking from the 1960s during his early days as a bright postgraduate student at Cambridge University to the 1980s when he publishes the seminal  ""A Brief History of Time,"" and focuses on his relationship with his first wife Jane and his battle with ALS. It is based on the memoir ""Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen,"" written by Jane, who is played in the film by Felicity Jones. Initially, the filmmakers used a voice-box programmed to sound like the one Hawking uses, but after watching an early screening, the physicist was so pleased that he allowed filmmakers to use his voice, according to Newsweek. ""He offered us his voice,"" Redmayne told Newsweek. ""For me, that was the most wonderful thing."" The British actor has confessed to nerves about playing a living legend and told Variety that he always knew that his toughest critic would be Hawking. But when the lights came up Hawking's nurse wiped a tear way from his face -- and he called the film ""broadly true,"" Variety reported. During the tour, Hawking said the museum is one of his favorite places and ""helped fuel"" his fascination with physics. The physicist showed Uyanwah items from the museum of particular significance to him, including a rare copy of Newton's Principia Mathematica from 1687 and a reconstruction of a 1953 model of the famous double helix structure of DNA discovered by Francis Crick and James Watson. ""We are now entering a new phase of what might be called self-designed evolution in which we will be able to change and improve our DNA,"" he told her. ""Now that we have read the book of life, we can start writing in corrections, to make us more intelligent and better natured."" As well as meeting the science legend, VisitLondon.com's Guest of Honor initiative, part of the ""GREAT Britain"" campaign, treated Uyanwah to a private tour of Shakespeare's Globe theater, a walk down the red carpet at the premiere of ""The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" and tea with London Mayor Boris Johnson. Uyanwah didn't leave her meeting with Hawking -- which she described as something she'll ""never forget"" -- without taking the opportunity to ask him what he would change about the human race -- and what virtues he would magnify. ""The human failing I would most like to correct is aggression. It may have had [a] survival advantage in cave man days ... but now it threatens to destroy us all. A major nuclear war would be the end of civilization, and maybe the end of the human race. ""The quality I would most like to magnify is empathy. It brings us together in a peaceful loving state."" The eminent thinker finished the tour by telling her that he hoped the objects he'd shown her would remind her to ""hold on to that childlike wonder about what makes the universe exist."" ""Look up at the stars, and not down at your feet,"" he said.","Renowned cosmologist Stephen Hawking approves of ""The Theory of Everything""

"(CNN)In the spring of 2000, my friend Michael and I hopped on a bus in Grand Rapids, Michigan, heading to Washington. The reason? To participate in the ""Millennium March on Washington for Equality,"" a mass demonstration in the nation's capital in support of LGBT rights. This was not quite two years after the death of Matthew Shepard, the University of Wyoming student who was brutally murdered for being gay. We were barely two seasons into what was then a groundbreaking television series, ""Will and Grace."" Spring 2000 was so long ago that network executives were still afraid to put an openly gay Ellen DeGeneres on television. That was the social climate then. And we were heading to D.C. to help change it. Then two transgendered women boarded the bus. I won't repeat the jokes I whispered about them to my friend and some of the others nearby. I'll just say their presence exposed me for the fraud I didn't even know I was. It was the spring of 2000, and I -- an openly gay man seeking LGBT equality -- had just rendered the T silent without even noticing. One can only imagine what those women had to endure from people who didn't consider themselves ""progressive"". Fifteen years later, I'm happy to say I am different. The country is different as well. But there are many reminders of the work that still needs to be done -- for example the disproportionate murder rate for transgender women and the fact that a person can still be fired or lose a home for being transgender. And then there is Bruce Jenner. When my editor first asked me to write about his reported ""journey"" she jokingly asked me to be brilliant. I responded that I wasn't sure if I could be brilliant -- but I promised I would be honest. This is why I shared my own past struggles with the issue. Public gender transitions still uncommon . Sure Jenner is a reality TV star who actively seeks attention. But that doesn't mean jokes about gender identity are appropriate. Especially now, as details regarding the fatal car accident Jenner was involved in during the weekend come to light. So far police have said Jenner was not speeding and alcohol was not a factor. And while he told police he was being followed by paparazzi, they said the photographers did not appear to be a factor in causing the accident. (Jenner released a statement, saying, in part, ""It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible."") Those of us who are cisgender do not know what it is like to look in the mirror and be in conflict with the body that we see, to have our souls be at odds with the gender assigned to us at birth. At this point we have read the stories with quotes from unnamed sources and seen the pictures with Jenner having longer hair and makeup. However we have yet to hear from Jenner himself. If he is wrestling with gender identity, being involved in a tragic car accident can only add to what must be an incredibly difficult time for him. Even someone who seeks the spotlight can hurt. When Jenner does speak, I hope we resist the urge to mock. If not for his sake, then for the sake of the countless others who may be able to identify with what Jenner says. According to a recent Williams Institute study, 50% of respondents who are openly transgender attempted suicide. Unfortunately in December, 17-year-old Leelah Alcorn succeeded. ""My death needs to mean something,"" she wrote in her final Tumblr post. The shame of my behavior on that bus 15 years ago re-emerges each time I read that sentence. I thought I was just having some harmless fun that day on the bus until I stumbled across a quote from James Baldwin that revealed to me the depth of my hypocrisy. ""You think your pain and your heartbreak are unprecedented in the history of the world, but then you read. It was books that taught me that the things that tormented me most were the very things that connected me with all the people who were alive, or who had ever been alive."" Over time I have learned to replace the urge to judge with the desire to seek our like humanity. Over the years I have spent my fair share of time around people fighting for LGBT rights and I can tell you the mocking of transgender people is not something that is exclusively heterosexual or conservative. It is not only found in red states or in Christian homes. I have learned a person can be progressive on numerous social issues and still house bigotry in the hidden, dusty corners of an otherwise illuminated heart. So as we wait for Jenner to tell us what his journey is, now would be a good time for many of us to embark on a soul-searching journey of our own. We think jokes are harmless because we're only paying attention to the people who are laughing.  ​ .","LZ Granderson: It's long past time to take a more mature view of transgendered people .
Bruce Jenner's story challenges us to think and rethink, he says ."
"European industrialists are sounding the alarm over a growing skills shortage on the continent that threatens their competitiveness and leaves manufacturing companies scrambling to find enough engineers. Chief executives of some of Europe's biggest manufacturers said that problems around youth unemployment, demographics and the education system all mean that engineers could be increasingly difficult to find in the future. This would force their companies to move more research and development facilities to countries with a greater supply of engineers, such as China or India. ""By 2025, we might need 500,000 engineers,"" said Olof Persson, chief executive, of Volvo Group, the world's second-biggest truckmaker. Peter Löscher, chief executive of Siemens, Europe's largest engineering group, said ""the skills shortage, particularly in Germany, is a big issue. We have to ensure that our education system is providing the right engineering skills, that we have qualified immigration coming to Europe . . . And perhaps the biggest issue that European industry has to grapple with is that we have almost 24 per cent youth unemployment."" Their warnings come as the Financial Times starts a four-day series into how European manufacturing has fared in the eurozone crisis and the challenges it faces in the future. Many of Europe's leading industrialists laid out an array of problems facing the continent's manufacturers, from more expensive energy compared with US competitors to the lack of financing, especially in countries such as Italy and Spain for small companies. ""We are losing a lot of small companies that support medium-sized business like ours due to financing problems,"" said Flavio Radice, chief executive of Pietro Carnaghi, an Italian company that is the world's largest maker of vertical lathes. Industrial production in the EU remains more than 10 per cent below its pre-crisis peak from 2008, while manufacturing companies have shed 3.4m of the 35.4m workers they had at the same time. But some manufacturing company executives also argued that European industry was holding its own against both the old-world competition from the US and Japan and newer rivals from China or India. ""Let's stop being pessimistic. Yes, we have to face a moment of crisis and a moment of restructuring in many countries but companies are continuing to develop. Europe stands for high quality and keeps on innovating even more,"" said Jean-Pascal Tricoire, chief executive of France's Schneider Electric. Nonetheless, business leaders are worried about the skills of Europe's newly educated workers compared with estimates of at least 400,000 and 100,000 engineers graduating each year from China and India respectively. Germany alone currently lacks 70,000 engineers, according to the VDI, the association of German engineers. Mr Persson said that other issues such as the availability of energy and regulation were important but meant little without skilled workers. ""If you don't have a good, transparent, motivating education and innovation system, then the other things are very difficult to achieve,"" he added.","European industrialists warn a growing skills shortage threatens their competitiveness .

"The man who shared images of the abuse that a Filipino maid allegedly suffered on the job in Saudi Arabia said he did so because he didn't know what else to do. Arnel Tahal is a cousin of the victim, Pahima Alagai Palacasi, and was shown the graphic photos of burns all over Palacasi's back, arms and legs by another cousin. Tahal said he posted the pictures on Facebook because ""I did not know what to do. But after people started sharing the pictures, some told us what we can do to help her."" The result is that the injured Palacasi, who is married and has two young children, will remain in Riyadh in a search for justice. The burns allegedly came at the hands of her employer's mother. The 22-year-old maid was at the home of her employer's mother on May 4 when ""her sponsor's mother poured boiled water over Palacasi due to a simple misunderstanding,"" according to a Philippines Labor Ministry statement posted Tuesday. Tahal told CNN that the employer's mother poured a thermos of scalding water on the maid after yelling at her for not preparing coffee quick enough. Two days later, the employer took Palacasi for medical care. While at hospital, Palacasi was able to reach a relative who lives in Riyadh who helped her sneak out of hospital. The cousin then posted graphic photos of Palacasi's wounds on Facebook, showing bright pink and white scalded skin all over her back, the backs of her arms, and parts of her leg, according to the ministry statement. ""I feel that we need more help from the government of the Philippines to get justice for my cousin,"" Tahal said. The Philippines government said it would help Palacasi file a case against her employer and has suspended the work of the Saudi recruitment agency that hired her. The English-language Saudi daily Arab News reported Wednesday that Riyadh police were conducting a joint investigation of the case. Palacasi alleges that her employer began physically abusing her within days of her arrival, kicking and lashing her after she complained of being homesick. She also claimed her employers deprived her of food. ""[My employer's mother] asked me to throw away all the leftover food but I didn't do it so that when I got hungry I could have something to eat,"" Palacasi said in a cellphone video reportedly taken by her cousin and released to ABS-CBN, a CNN affiliate in the Philippines. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video. ""Please help me,"" Palacasi says in the video. ""Help me file a case against my employer. I suffered a lot."" Palacasi is currently at an embassy shelter in Riyadh. ""She is stable, in high spirits, and is relating well with fellow (Filipino workers),"" according to the government statement. ""We are following up on the case with the police and the embassy and we will respond once we have all the details of the case,"" Mohammed Almadi of Saudi Arabia's Human Rights Commission told CNN.

"Replete in felt peak caps and with long embroidered coats, the eagle hunters of Kazakhstan are an arresting sight. With golden eagles, some standing almost 3-feet-high perched on their arms, they also carry with pride the Kazakh tradition of hunting using birds of prey that stretches back to the days of Genghis Khan. The practice of hunting with eagles and falcons was almost wiped out by the Soviets who regarded it as a feudal throwback, but thanks to organized eagle-hunting competitions - and a growing interest in Kazakh traditions - the eagle hunters are making a comeback. A bird show at Sunkar Raptor Sanctuary, situated outside the city of Almaty, uses a wolf-skin lure to demonstrate the lethal striking ability of trained eagles. One of the world's largest birds of prey, a golden eagle can swoop on quarry as large as a wolf, reaching speeds of 120 mph in its initial strike. Its talons can exert pressure of upwards of 200 pounds per square inch, allowing it to hold down prey while ripping into it with a razor-sharp hooked beak. According to Paul Pfander, one the leading bird handlers in Kazakhstan, hunting with eagles is unique to the country and neighboring Kyrgyzstan, noting that there are now some 50 eagle handlers Kazakhstan. ""Most of eagle handlers are happy to make a living posing for photographs for tourists,"" says Pfander, but he notes that there is a very small group of around 10 traditional eagle hunters still who ride the Kazakh steppes seeking out live prey. As interest in the Kazakh tradition of falconry and eagling increases, shows such as those at the Sunkar sanctuary are helping to finance programs to preserve the Central Asian habitat of another of the country's birds of prey, the saker falcon. ""There are a lot more conservation groups now,"" says Pfander. ""And they are attracting a lot more money than before."" It's an important project as Kazakhstan's falcons, unlike its eagles, are in the sights of poachers. ""I would say in the past two decades the numbers of saker falcons (in Kazakhstan) has dropped by 90%,"" says Pfander. The birds are listed as ""endangered"" on the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species that notes the species ""may be undergoing a very rapid decline"". Wealthy states in the Middle East like the UAE are the main destination for wild-caught birds, where a falcon perched on the leather glove of a rich Emirati is as potent a status symbol as a private jet or top-end Mercedes. Efforts to send birds back to Kazakhstan, like a recent program by the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital to return 66 falcons to their natural habitat, are small in comparison to the size of the market. The 150 birds bred each year as part of the Sunkar Raptor Sanctuary's breeding program also represent a mere drop in the bucket compared to the estimated thousands smuggled out of the country. The international black market in hunting falcons is estimated to be worth as much as $300 million a year, according to conservation groups, with gyr, saker and peregrine falcons commanding as much as $200,000 a bird. It is so lucrative that a 2010 documentary called ""Feathered Cocaine"" alleged it is linked to the murky world of funding for Islamic terrorism. Pfander believes the problem is a simple equation of too many people, too few nature reserves and a thriving foreign market. ""Now you can drive anywhere in Kazakhstan and this allows people to get to more and more areas of the falcons' habitat,"" he says. ""There are specialist teams operating that capture wild falcons. It's a very organized, it has its own hierarchy and everyone knows who they are -- it's a kind of Mafia,"" he adds. Despite the problems for the saker falcon, the Kazakh tradition of hunting with birds of prey -- especially the golden eagle - is not likely to die out in the near future. The sheer size of the bird, mixed with the difficulty of training a raptor that can present as much a danger to its handler as its prey, means its numbers in Kazakhstan are presently stable. ""There is just no foreign market for these birds,"" says Pfander.","Tradition of hunting with golden eagles remains in Kazakhstan .
Most handlers survive through doing shows, although some use to hunt .
Kazakhstan's falcons targeted by poachers for sale in Middle East .
Number of native saker falcons in wild is rapidly declining ."
"(CNN) -- Vonderrit Deondre Myers, a teenager who died in a police shooting, was struck by seven or eight bullets, St. Louis city Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Graham said Thursday night. ""All but one gunshot wound were to the lower extremities,"" Graham said. ""The one fatal wound was to the head."" Police Chief Sam Dotson said the killing happened Wednesday evening when a suspect shot a pistol three times at the St. Louis officer, who was off-duty but wearing his uniform while moonlighting for a security company. The officer fired his pistol 17 times, police said. The shooting sparked angry street protests, with residents pointing out similarities to the August killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson. Myers and Brown were both 18 and black and killed by white police officers. One big difference: Police said Brown was not armed. ""It`s a clear case of this young man being gunned down by an insensitive white officer who was off-duty,"" Akbar Muhammad, part of a coalition seeking justice in the Brown shooting, told CNN affiliate KTVI. ""He chased them off a corner."" Were 17 shots excessive? St. Louis Police Officers' Association lawyer Neil Bruntrager discussed that Thursday night on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""When he uses deadly force he uses deadly force until the threat is gone,"" Bruntrager said. Bruntrager said without video of the incident or unbiased witnesses, the police and the public must rely on physical evidence. A 9mm pistol allegedly fired by Myers was found at the scene, police said. But Van Jones, a civil rights activist and CNN contributor, said nobody can trust the police after the Brown killing. ""You're seeing a wholesale breakdown of trust,"" he said on ""OutFront."" Thursday night, St. Louis residents held a candlelight vigil for Myers at a sandwich shop where he bought food shortly before being shot. They sang hymns, prayed and released balloons into the air. Speakers urged the people to remain peaceful. ""The chief did an outstanding job yesterday, keeping the tension down between the police officers, as well the protesters,"" Missouri state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed of St. Louis said to KTVI. ""It is an unfortunate situation. My heart goes out to the family, but again from what I am hearing it was a direct correlation to racial profiling, racial profiling went deadly."" The Myers shooting occurred just ahead of a ""Weekend of Resistance"" in St. Louis, where activists will push for movement in the investigation into the Brown case. Tensions are already high in the community, and it's uncertain how the latest shooting will affect its mood. An animated crowd quickly gathered late Wednesday near the shooting site close to the Missouri Botanical Garden, chanting slogans as St. Louis police officers stood by. ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, these killer cops have got to go,"" the crowd chanted, repurposing a popular chant from the Brown protests. The confrontations with police were intense and laced with profanity. ""That was somebody's baby,"" screamed one man, referring to the man who was killed. ""Think about your own child,"" pleaded another person in the crowd. Despite the tensions, Dotson said no businesses were looted and no windows were smashed. He praised officers for showing a ""tremendous amount of restraint"" as members of the crowd confronted them face-to-face and damaged three police cruisers. CNN affiliate KMOV reported that a post office was damaged. Complete coverage of Ferguson . The officer, a six-year veteran who has not been named, was placed on administrative leave. Bruntager said he served two tours of duty with the military in Iraq and was awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. While on patrol, the officer saw three black males run away as he approached, Dotson said. He gave chase because one of them was holding up his pants in a way that made the officer believe the teen may be carrying a gun, Dotson said. The officer and one of the three tussled. The teen ran off, then turned around and fired at least three shots at the officer, Dotson said. The officer returned fire, killing the teen. Online court documents show Myers was arrested June 27 and charged with unlawful use of a weapon, a felony, and resisting arrest. He'd been released on bond. A hearing scheduled for Monday had been postponed, with the next hearing on November 17, the documents show. The two other males have not been apprehended. A man describing himself as the owner of Regal Foods in St. Louis, but who didn't want to give his name, told CNN in a phone interview that Myers was in his store before the shooting. Myers was wearing a T-shirt, the store owner said, adding that he didn't see a gun. The teen bought a sandwich and left. He was shot across the street from the store about 10 minutes later, he said. Myers' cousin, Latara Franks, said another cousin, her brother and a family friend were with Myers, and they confirmed to her he purchased a sandwich at a corner store shortly before the shooting. ""He got in trouble with police, but he went to school and work,"" Franks said of Myers. ""I can't believe they did him like this."" Share your stories and opinions on the protests with CNN iReport .

"Annapolis, Maryland (CNN)   -- Several thousand hoarse  voices raise the rafters of the old Halsey Field House on a special night each year on the Annapolis campus of the U.S. Naval Academy.

Every midshipman, male and female, knows what its like to tie on the gloves, Naval Academy boxing coach Jim McNally says. ""There's a lot of interest in the Brigades because they all take boxing, and they get a taste of it, and a lot of them would never have thought about boxing until they take it in a phys. ed. class."" The boxing team practices daily on the top floor of MacDonough Hall, beneath names and photos of teams and champions past that line the walls. There's not a modern weight machine, elliptical exerciser or yoga ball in sight. This is hard-core, old-school training. Leather heavy bags hang swing from chains as they are repeatedly struck. Jump ropes nick the wood floor in constant repetition. Mirrors are used for shadowboxing. Three boxing rings quickly fill with activity as midshipmen lace up gloves, strap on headgear and spar with each other until they drip with sweat. The rhythmic pounding of leather on leather and leather on muscle creates a constant thudding and smacking sounds. February's fights marked the 69th time midshipmen faced each other in the ring for the annual championships. ""It's a tournament with a lot of history and tradition here, and a lot of famous alumni who have graduated who have been brigade champions or brigade boxers,"" McNally said. ""We've had generals and admirals, space shuttle astronauts, the secretary of the Navy and U.S. senators."" One of the most famous matches took place in 1967 between Larry North, whom many know today as Oliver North of Iran-Contra fame, and Jim Webb, now a U.S. senator from Virginia and former secretary of the Navy under President Reagan. North won the bout, and his name now hangs on the wall in the boxing room. McNally has seen a lot of boxers in his more than two decades with the program and says Midshipman 1st Class Michael Anthony Steadman of College Station, Texas, is one of the best he's seen in a long time. Steadman is a two-time national champion, McNally says. ""He's one of the hardest-working guys in the gym, a great team leader."" Steadman is the team captain and boxes in the 175-pound weight class. Every ounce is chiseled muscle, from his calves to his shaved head. His eyes are focused and his look determined. After graduation, Steadman plans to become a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps and serve in the infantry. ""We here in the boxing program have a tradition of a lot of us tending to go to the Marine Corps or the [special ops] communities. Because boxing builds that warrior spirit, we like to really think we have the warrior ethos, and every time we step in the ring, it gives us a chance to test ourselves to the limit."" This is his fourth year in the brigade championships. He lost his first year but came back to defeat that foe as a sophomore. Steadman dedicates all his fights to his mother, who suffered a stroke in 2007. ""I draw a lot of strength from my mom and her situation, and I know that through her and all the sacrifices she's made for me, stepping in the boxing ring is nothing."" He calls her on his cell phone before every match. Steadman is heavily favored in his fight against a plebe, or freshman, boxer named Angelo Loreno of San Jose, California. Eight matches have taken place by the time the 175-pound weight class participants enter the ring. Steadman wears a navy blue shirt and shorts with gold trim; Loreno is clad in gold with blue trim. Matches consist of three two-minute rounds, with a minute of rest in between. Boxers who have traded blows in the ring now relax, socialize and cheer on the remaining competitors. It's hard to believe that only minutes before, they were taking swings at each others' heads. ""The Navy boxers here are like brothers,"" Steadman said. ""We hang out on the weekend, call each other on break; we look out for each other. I've bled with them. I've fought with them. I've trained with them in the gym. It's just like a family."" At the bell, Loreno comes out hard and connects with a flurry of punches in the first round. But tonight is not his night. Steadman's strength and experience carry him through the fight as he scores with rights and lefts, uppercuts and jabs. Loreno stays on his feet the entire bout and puts forth a respectable showing. The crowd is clearly for Steadman. Those packed behind his corner chant ""Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike"" as the clock ticks down before the final bell. Steadman is declared a three-time Brigade Champion, and his arm is raised high. The two midshipmen embrace, and Steadman walks Loreno back to his corner and gives him words of encouragement. ""He really rocked me in the first round,"" Steadman said. ""I'm old Navy boxing. He's the future of Navy boxing."" Steadman was also singled out for a special award and was named the Brigade's Most Outstanding Boxer of the tournament. It's not a surprise that boxing is popular at the Naval Academy. ""Being the nature of the institution that we're developing warriors here,"" McNally said, ""you get a lot of individuals that say, 'I want to go our for a sport that's a warrior-type sport that's going to help me be a warrior in my career in the Navy or the Marine Corps.' "" With the introduction of high technology and specialization in athletics in recent years, McNally puts boxing and what his team does in very simple terms: ""Boxing is as basic as it comes. As soon as man learned how to stand up on two feet and curl his hand into a fist, they've been fighting.""","Midshipmen face off in Naval Academy's Brigade Boxing competition .
