"Britain will have three men in the Australian Open for the first time since 2002 after Kyle Edmund produced a superb battling performance on Saturday to secure his debut in the main draw. Edmund came from a set down against local favourite Dane Propoggia to win 6-7 (3/7) 6-4 9-7, but compatriot Liam Broady fell at the final hurdle as he lost in straight sets to American veteran Michael Russell in the last round of qualifying. British number three Edmund joins James Ward and Andy Murray in the tournament proper and faces American Steve Johnson - the world number 39 - on Tuesday. The last time Britain had such strength in depth was courtesy of Tim Henman, Greg Rusedski and Martin Lee 13 years ago. Kyle Edmund of Great Britain plays a forehand in his qualifying match against Australia's Dane Propoggia . British No1 and World No6 Andy Murray serves the ball during his practice session on Saturday . Edmund, who is ranked 192nd in the world, took until midway through the second set to force a break point against Propoggia, who was playing far better than his ranking of 323 would suggest. But after breaking in the 10th game to claim the set, the 20-year-old from Yorkshire broke again in the decider and served for the match at 5-3, only to lose his serve and allow Propoggia back into the contest. Edmund still had the advantage of serving first however and recovered his composure to break again and seal victory in two hours and 23 minutes. 'It is good confidence coming through grand slam qualifiers, you have earned your right to get into a grand slam which is a great feeling and gives you confidence going into the upcoming tournaments,' said Edmund, who turned 20 on January 8 and spent his present of iTunes vouchers on acclaimed TV drama Breaking Bad. 'You are always looking to improve, that's what I want to keep doing. It's a good start to the year but that's all it is, the year is full of ups and downs so you can't get too up on the results.' Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman of Great Britain pose with their Cadbury World plaques back in 2009 . Tim Henman, Martin Lee (centre) and Andrew Murray of cheer on Greg Rusedski at the Davis Cup in 2004 . Edmund and Ward have both benefited from spending time with Murray during his winter training sessions and Edmund added: 'I don't know how much you guys (the media) see of it but he really wants guys like me and Liam to do well. He's texting to say well done and good luck and it's a nice feeling when someone like that wants you to do well. 'Working with Andy in 2013 it was obviously a higher standard, so for me to play with him I was having to work really hard to win points. This year when I went back and played with him I felt a lot more comfortable with the balance and speed of play. I felt a good improvement from that year which is what you want.' James Ward of Great Britain serves during his match against the USA's John Isner on Thursday . Edmund beat  home favourite Propoggia in three sets to qualify for the main draw . On an adjacent court at Melbourne Park, Broady lost 7-5 6-3 to veteran Russell, the 36-year-old using all of his experience to win each set with a single break of serve. 'You can't play great every day,' Broady said. 'I felt pretty relaxed, pretty loose, but he played quite smart, used his slice well and obviously he's very experienced and knew what he was doing on the court. 'I just lost a bit of rhythm and he's a very smart, very experienced player and it showed today. It's tough to rush Mike because he defends very well. When I play eight out of 10 at this level it's good enough, but my six out of 10 isn't good enough yet and that's what needs to improve.' Liam Broady lost in three straight sets to the USA's veteran Michael Russell in the last round of qualifying .","Kyle Edmund beat Dane Propoggia to qualify for main draw .

"Top seed Novak Djokovic has played down concerns over his fitness ahead of the Australian Open, which gets under way in Melbourne on Monday. Djokovic was forced to postpone his pre-tournament press conference by a day due to illness, but practised on Sunday and declared himself fit to seek a fifth win in the year's first grand slam. 'I had a tough couple of days but it's all behind me now. I'm ready for the Open,' said the world No 1, who won the title for three years in a row before losing to eventual champion Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter-finals 12 months ago. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Novak Djokovic: I am ready for the Australian Open . Top seed Novak Djokovic has played down concerns over his fitness ahead of the Australian Open . Djokovic was forced to postpone his pre-tournament press conference by a day due to illness . Asked what he had been suffering from, Djokovic added: 'Little bit with the flu and stomach. But I carried that already from the Middle East a little bit. But now it's good. It's passed.' Djokovic was unable to play Britain's Andy Murray in the final of an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi at the start of January due to illness, and then reached the quarter-finals in Doha before losing to Ivo Karlovic. The 27-year-old will face Slovenian qualifier Aljaz Bedene in the first round on Tuesday and is looking to become the second man in history to win five or more Australian Open titles. Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andre Agassi, Ken Rosewall and Jack Crawford have all won four, with Roy Emerson (six) the only player to win more than five.

"Eugenie Bouchard was joined by Rafael Nadal, Maria Sharapova and Roger Federer as a host of tennis stars attended the annual Players Party in Melbourne on Sunday ahead of the Australian Open. The 20-year-old admits change can be 'scary', but also believes splitting from her long-time coach was necessary to build on her brilliant performances in 2014. Bouchard reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open and French Open before making her first grand slam final at Wimbledon, where she lost to Petra Kvitova. VIDEO Scroll down to see Eugenie Bouchard ask for help with her tiny pink shorts . Eugenie Bouchard poses for the cameras ahead of the Sunday's player's party before the the Australian Open . The 20-year-old Canadian attended the annual event in Melbourne with a host of other tennis stars . Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer also attended the party ahead of the tournament which begins on Sunday . The Canadian was unsurprisingly voted the WTA's most improved player after climbing from 32nd in the rankings to seventh, but opted to stop working with coach Nick Saviano in the off-season. The pair had worked together since Bouchard was 12. 'It was definitely a different off-season for me. I made a lot of changes,' admitted Bouchard, who is currently working with Diego Ayala as she seeks a coach to take her to the 'next level'. 'I kind of wanted to wait till the end of the year to do that when we have a few months off. I think it was better to not do it in the middle of the season. 'Change can be scary, but change can also be good. It's just about adapting now, I think slowly putting the pieces in the right place. I'm feeling good.' Maria Sharapova was another tennis star who dressed up for the party in Melbourne, Australia . Bouchard reached the semi-finals in Melbourne 12 months ago in just her fourth grand slam, losing to eventual winner Li Na in straight sets. But while that came out of the blue, her subsequent performances at Roland Garros and the All England Club ensured that the seventh seed will be expected to reproduce that form in 2015. 'I try to see it as just a new year,' added Bouchard, who takes on Germany's Anna-Lena Friedsam on Monday evening. 'I'm not concerned about defending points from last year. To me it's 2015. I start at zero and try to do as well as I can. Britain's Heather Watson also posed for photographers at the event in Melbourne . 'My past results don't mean anything when I'm going to walk out on the court tomorrow. I still have to fight and try to play as well as I can. I have great memories from last year, but it doesn't really mean anything to me this year. 'This was a great tournament for me last year. It kind of started a great year for me. I think I gained so much more experience after that as well, more big matches, more high-pressure situations. But it's great to be back. I just have memories flooding in all the time, any court I practice on, the locker room, this press room. It's great memories from last year.' Second seed Maria Sharapova is also in action on the opening day against Croatia's Petra Martic, with third seed Simona Halep up against Italy's Karin Knapp. Germany's Sabine Lisicki (left) and Petra Kvitova (right) pose for photographers at the event . Halep opens proceedings on Rod Laver Arena and will be followed on court by fifth seed Ana Ivanovic, who takes on Lucie Hradecka. Top seed Serena Williams and Wimbledon champion Kvitova must wait until Tuesday to play their first round matches, with Kvitova keen to make amends for losing at the same stage 12 months ago. 'I would like to forget about last year. Unfortunately it's impossible,' Kvitova said. 'On the other side I know I can do only better, so that's the good thing. 'I'm excited to play, of course. It's a grand slam. It's what I love to play. I just will do everything that I can to be just better than last year because it was very disappointing. It wasn't really a nice time for me.'","The Players Party was held on Sunday ahead of the Australian Open .

"Manchester United and Real Madrid are going head-to-head for the signature of Athletic Bilbao's central defender Aymeric Laporte. The 20-year-old France Under 21 international has been on  United's radar for the past couple of seasons - with their well-documented defensive problems yet to be solved. But with Pepe getting older and Sergio Ramos debating a new contract, Madrid have made the first steps to taking him to the Bernabeu. Real Madrid and Manchester United are both interested in signing Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte . Laporte has been on United's radar for the past couple of seasons as they look to bolster their defence . 20-year-old central defender (right) has a buyout clause of £31.5million at the Basque club . Age: 20 . Position: Central defender . Club: Athletic Bilbao . Appearances: 79 . Transfer value: Buyout clause of £31.5m . The deal won't be cheap though with Bilbao refusing to negotiate and typically pointing to his buyout clause of £31.5m plus the VAT. Laporte has potential and is a great athlete but is still a little raw. Another option for Madrid is Inigo Martinez at Sociedad. David Moyes' side are keen on Madrid's former Sociedad midfielder Aser Illarramendi and a deal could be done in the summer unless he opts to go abroad. Elsewhere, United have been warned they may have to break the world record fee for a defender after also enquiring about Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos. United stumbled through a 0-0 draw at Cambridge United in the FA Cup fourth round on Friday which left more questions about the strength of their squad and their defence continues to look fragile. They have sounded out the French champions ahead of a possible summer move for the stylish Marquinhos. Manager Louis van Gaal has drawn up a list of potential targets and the Brazilian is among those names, however, they have been warned the defender won't come cheap. Paris Saint-Germain centre-back Marquinhos has been linked with a move away from the French champions . The 20-year-old central defender joined PSG 18 months ago from Roma in a £23.4million deal but has found himself playing at right-back to accommodate the arrival of David Luiz this season. United value Marquinhos at around £30million but PSG have laughed off those figures and United would have to supass the £50m fee PSG paid to Chelsea for Luiz to get him. His agent Giuliano Bertolucci said: 'Last summer, PSG's president Nasser Al-Khelaifi declared that Marquinhos was unsellable. We will see what their position is this summer. Many clubs are interested in the player. Manchester United are one of them, this is true.' Marquinhos appeals to Van Gaal as he can play in a four or three-man defensive line and is comfortable in possession. United predictably are being quoted huge sums for their defensive targets as they weigh up options for the summer. Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin would be £28.5m, Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels will command £30m and Nicolas Otamendi at Valencia has also been discussed but the Spanish side want his buy-out figure of £37m. The 20-year-old is under contract until 2018, but Manchester United are said to be interested in him .","Aymeric Laporte has a buyout clause of £31.5million .

"Villarreal have confirmed they have agreed a deal in principle with Arsenal for defender Gabriel Paulista to join the Gunners in a £15million deal. The 24-year-old, who Arsene Wenger recently confirmed was a transfer target for the club, is expected to join the club imminently with Joel Campbell joining the La Liga side on loan for the remainder of the season as part of the agreement. The news comes following Paulista was left out of Villarreal's 18-man squad to face Levante at El Madrigal on Saturday night, increasing speculation that the Brazilian was closing in on a move to the Emirates. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been keen on a move to bring Gabriel Paulista to the club from Villarreal . The Brazilian defender will be looking to bolster Arsenal's defensive ranks if a move goes through . The La Liga side confirmed the news on their official Twitter account saying: 'The principle of agreement for the transfer of Gabriel with @Arsenal has been completed. He will say his goodbyes today before the party. good luck!' They also announced the signing of Campbell adding: 'Welcome @joel_campbell12 to Villarreal as Arsenal agree to loan the player until the end of the season!' Work permit rules may yet prove to be an issue in the deal though, as Paulista is yet to play international football. But as Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday, Arsenal will appeal any decision not to give Paulista - who has a £15m buy-out clause - a permit this month in an attempt to land him now.

"Arsene Wenger has confirmed Gabriel Paulista's switch to Arsenal from Villarreal is expected to be completed on Monday. The Gunners have agreed a £13.5million deal to take the Brazilian and despite initials fears regarding a work permit for the Brazilian, the Arsenal boss is confident the move will go through on Monday.

'From a sporting point of view it's unfortunate, but neither the club nor the player could afford to resist Arsenal's offer. 'I wish him the greatest professional success of course.

"Tomas Rosicky stole the show as Arsenal beat Brighton 3-2 in their FA Cup fourth round clash, but Phil Neville caused uproar when he flippantly claimed he would have 'two-footed' him for some of his antics. The Gunners' Czech midfielder scored one goal and set up another, but former Manchester United defender Phil Neville felt some of his tricks showed a lack of respect for the opposition. Three times during the game, including in the build up to his own goal, Rosicky passed one way and looked the other - something Neville said would have earned him a strong challenge if he'd been fooled by it. Tomas Rosicky looks one way but passes another during the build up to his spectacular goal . The Czech midfielder used the same move a number of times during Arsenal's 3-2 defeat of Brighton . Neville made the comments on Match of the Day, but later claimed it was 'tongue in cheek' Speaking on BBC One, Neville said: 'If that was a training session and somebody did that I'd be first over there and I'd probably look to two-foot him or take him out of the game. 'If somebody did that in training to me, winding me up, I would be straight in there. I'd smash them.' The comments led to a wave of incredulity from Arsenal supporters online, and Neville was forced to clarify his position. He tweeted: 'The Rosicky ""look one way pass the other"" piece was tongue in cheek by someone who wasn't capable of doing such!!!' One man who definitely didn't agree with Neville's assessment was Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, who said: 'If you love football, you love Rosicky.'

"Mark Pougatch is to replace Adrian Chiles at ITV's lead football host with immediate effect. Pougatch will present ITV's next live match which is the Chelsea vs Paris Saint-Germain Champions League game next month. ITV will not comment on the reasons for Chiles' departure. Adrian Chiles, who has been replaced as ITV's lead football host, pictured in west London on Friday . Chiles appeared in good spirits despite the news, as he walked near his home in west London .

BBC - Premier League highlights, FA Cup . BT Sport - Premier League, FA Cup, Europa League . 2015-16 SEASON . ITV - England international games, Champions League and Europa League highlights . Sky Sports - Premier League, other home nations internationals . BBC - Premier League highlights, FA Cup . BT Sport - Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League, Europa League . Chiles was the subject of a Facebook campaign to have him removed from ITV's football coverage after last year's World Cup, and last summer it was announced he was being given a much bigger role on BBC Radio 5 Live as a presenter. The decision follows ITV choosing not to renew their current second presenter Matt Smith's contract at the end of the season, while pundit Andy Townsend recently left by mutual consent. ITV also lost Roy Keane as a pundit when he decided to focus on his coaching duties prior to the start of the World Cup. It's understood that Chiles was told this week that ITV wanted to terminate his one-year contract extension that was signed shortly before the World Cup last year. It was a one-year deal worth around £500,000  just to host football. He had had to take a £1million cut in salary at that time as he was no longer hosting the doomed Daybreak breakfast show.

Former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane (centre) left ITV prior to last summer's World Cup in Brazil . Chiles presented ITV's Champions League coverage but the channel will not show live games next season . The fact ITV will make no comment about Chiles' shock departure points to a likely legal battle over the terms of his pay-off. ITV, who employed Chiles on hugely extravagant terms, finally came to the conclusion that he wasn't the football presenter they wanted going forward. Pougatch will continue to work for 5 Live but will cut down his football commitments to ensure there is no conflict with his new role on ITV. He ironically was in competition with Chiles for the anchor role when BBC first launched Match of the Day 2. After being confirmed as ITV's new lead presenter, Pougatch said in a statement: 'I am absolutely delighted to be joining ITV and to be given this great opportunity.

ITV Director of Sport, Niall Sloane, said: 'Mark is a highly-respected sports journalist and an outstanding broadcaster. We're delighted to welcome Mark to the ITV Sport team.' Although the reasons for Chiles' departure remain unclear, ITV's reduction in staff may be linked to their dwindling broadcast rights. Their FA Cup deal ended last season, while they will not show live Champions League or Europa League games until at least 2019 after losing out on the rights to BT Sport. They will, however, show highlights from both competitions, while continuing to broadcast all of England's home and away matches, both friendlies and qualifiers.

Pougatch and Chiles both work for BBC Radio 5 Live, with Chiles being handed an expanded role last summer . Chiles poses with ITV's World Cup squad of pundits at Wembley prior to the start of the tournament in Brazil . Chiles, who earned £4.1million last year, was no stranger to controversy during his four-and-a-half year spell at ITV, often drawing criticism from viewers. In October 2013 there were calls for him to be sacked after he made a potentially offensive remark at the end of England's win against Montenegro. Chiles said: 'And it’s practically a home game for Poland – 15,000 Poles will be in here, I’m sure.' And in February of last year he told viewers that had not fallen asleep at half-time in extra-time of Fulham's FA Cup clash with Sheffield United that he would 'send them a fiver' if they wrote in. The comment led to plenty of activity on social media, with viewers taking to Twitter to demand money from the presenter. Mark Pougatch has joined ITV Sport as a presenter for the channel's football coverage. Mark joins the ITV Sport team as the Champions League and Europa League enter their knockout rounds and England's Euro 16 qualifying stages are set to resume. He will appear alongside ITV's panel of pundits, commentary and reporting team for the live England international and European football programmes from February. He brings with him a wealth of experience in sports broadcasting over 20 years, including presenting major events such as World Cups, European Championships and the Olympics.

ITV also holds the rights to show Champions League and Europa League matches and highlights until the end of the 2014/2015 season, after which it will show Champions League and Europa League highlights.

"Arsene Wenger promised a new-look Mesut Ozil upon his return from injury. A stronger, bulked-up, better than he was before, Ozil. A knee problem has kept him out since October - a terrible shame given he was just getting started in a vital campaign that could have restarted his career. In truth, Ozil has not been as good for Arsenal as most expected he would be. £42.5million is a lot of money, and for that you would expect more world-class performances than he has given to date. Mesut Ozil fires the ball past Lewis Dunk and into the back of the net for his first goal since returning to Arsenal . Ozil (right) is congratulated by his team-mates after firing Arsenal into a 2-0 lead at the AMEX Stadium . But here is another opportunity to shine. His first start for the Gunners since October 5, a chance to show his best qualities against opposition from the league below. Brighton, all told, are not a bad side. Not as good as they were two seasons ago though, and Arsenal should have been able to flex their muscles with relative ease. It couldn't have started much better for Arsene Wenger's side in this FA Cup fifth round match. Two minutes in, Calum Chambers to Theo Walcott. 1-0. Sunday was only the sixth time that Walcott and Ozil have started together for Arsenal. It's surely a combination that Wenger will have longed for, but various injuries have meant that while one is fit, the other is laying on a treatment table in London Colney. Ozil watches on as his perfectly-placed effort flies past the outstretched arm of David Stockdale . Ozil impressed on his first start since October 5, but he must now take that form into the Premier League . As Arsenal began to really impose themselves on the game, so too did Ozil. Aside from a cameo appearance against Stoke earlier this month, these were his first real minutes of 2015. Ozil was given a free rein to drift around the midfield. Technically wide on the team-sheet, but in reality able to come and go as he pleased. And that works for him. If you pigeon-hole him, he runs the risk of being ineffective. Wenger has been honest in his assessment of Ozil's positioning, admitting that the German doesn't enjoy being sent to hug the touchline. And so, his overriding moment in this game came from him drifting in and sitting on Brighton's back four. Tomas Rosicky played the ball through; an eye-of-the-needle, perfectly-weighted knock. A touch with his left foot, a touch with his right foot, and then a shot into the bottom corner of the net from Arsenal's No 11. David Stockdale could not have been expected to save it; it was too far into the corner of his net, and Ozil had taken the first steps on the road to regaining his form. Arsene Wenger (left) had promised Arsenal fans that they would see a stronger Ozil upon his return from injury . Ozil, and Arsenal, played well and despite only just winning, deserve their place in the fifth round draw . As the half-time whistle blew, most players trudged towards the tunnel, grateful for a rest. Not Ozil. He continued at the same pace he'd played the first 45, running towards the changing rooms. Get the team-talk done, and let us get back out there. He was hungry for more. Arsenal netted a third in the second-half, after a brief scare from Brighton when Chris O'Grady brilliantly fired into Wojciech Szczesny's net, and after that things calmed down. In the eyes of many, the tie was won and it was now about maintaining a steady pace for Arsenal. Ozil's game slowed too. It is to be expected in his first game back, of course. This is just the beginning, providing that he stays injury-free. Brighton pulled another back; 3-2. Ozil's final few minutes were nervy and frantic, perhaps exactly what he didn't need. Wenger, at 2-0 and 3-1, will have hoped for a simple finish but it was not forthcoming... not if the Seagulls had anything to do with it. In the end, Arsenal's back-line stayed strong, Ozil came off after 80 minutes, and they held on for a 3-2 win. Just. The German playmaker performed well and deserved his first-half goal. Perhaps there won't be a post-match changing room selfie, but Arsenal's performance did deserve a place in Monday's fifth round draw. For Ozil, this is just the beginning. After an FA Cup tie against lower-league opposition, he cannot claim to be fully reintegrated into the team. Brighton will not pose the same test as, say, Tottenham a week on Saturday, or Monaco in the Champions League later in February. But it's a start, and a good one at that. Now he must kick on and fully prove himself in the Premier League.","Mesut Ozil started his first game for Arsenal since October 5th .

"On January 25 1995, Eric Cantona was involved in an incident that would see him spend three-and-a-half hours in jail, miss eight months of football and do 120 hours of community service.

The game carried on, David May scored for us, then Gareth Southgate got the equaliser. It ended 1-1. That second half you had 21 footballers carrying on in a state of surprise. I can’t recall the manager saying anything about it in the dressing room. If he did have a tizzy then our heads were too frazzled to take it in. JONATHAN PEARCE (Commentating for Capital Gold Radio) Cantona is dismissed! Can there be a place in the game for a man with such extravagant talent and such wicked temperament? A man who has now… Oh my goodness me! He just kicked… He’s punched a fan! Eric Cantona has jumped in and scissor-kung-fu-kicked a fan! I have never seen as disgraceful an incident as that in all my years in football. Eric Cantona should be thrown out of the game for that sort of incident. Andy Cole, left, played up front with Cantona at Manchester United in the late 1990s . Cantona reacted angrily to abuse from a Palace fan after he was sent off during the match at Selhurst Park . ALAN WILKIE (The referee) People say Palace had been winding Cantona up but that’s not true. My recollection is he was only challenged twice in the first half. Then, early in the second half, there was Cantona’s kick at Richard Shaw. Peter Schmeichel launched one of his long kicks. There were only two players in the Palace half — Shaw and Cantona. They came together and Shaw turned more quickly. Cantona kicked out at Shaw so I dismissed him. I did not see him kick the fan because I was dealing with Andy Cole who was suggesting I might not have made the right decision! After the game one of my assistants told me what had happened but it was only when I saw it — at 2am on CNN — that my jaw dropped to the floor. I just thought ‘wow’. NED KELLY (United’s ex-head of security, speaking to the BBC) I followed him down the stairs with the wardens and when we stopped he looked at me and sort of shrugged his shoulders. We went into the cell and were sitting down together, and the police warden came in and said: ‘Listen, don’t take any food from here. I’ll pop down the road and get some McDonald’s and chips’. I gave him [Cantona] my phone so he could phone his wife. Then we’re eating away and having a chat about it, and he said: ‘I just can’t be bothered with all this, I’ll just serve my sentence’. I said: ‘No way. Let’s see what the outcome is’. But he was relaxed, signed autographs and took a couple of photos while he was there. He was so cool about it. Stewards attempt to restrain the forward after his assault on the Palace supporter . The French forward was found guilty of assault at Croydon Magistrates Court as a result of the incident . GARETH SOUTHGATE (Palace player that day) A big altercation was going on as Eric was going off then we heard this strange noise from the crowd and saw stewards running over. We carried on with the game and I remember my goal but as soon as we got back to the dressing room I realised it was not going to get the headlines! It hit me how serious it was when we left our dressing room. The United players were lined up in the tunnel, dressed in club blazers, but nobody was speaking. They were very subdued and had been told not to make any comment, not to us, the press, nobody. MAURICE WATKINS (United director and legal advisor at the time) Eric took the situation very seriously. He attended every meeting and was always on time. I recall vividly the moment in Croydon Magistrates’ Court, when the magistrate, much to the surprise of everyone, imposed an immediate prison sentence of 14 days. Suddenly Eric was taken to the cells. We lodged an immediate application for bail, which was turned down. So I then had to run up to the Crown Court and successfully got bail and leave to appeal. But Eric had to spend three-and-a-half hours in a cell, and it’s fair to say he wasn’t too happy when we got him out. We had called an emergency meeting at United and agreed to ban him for the rest of the season; four months, an unprecedented 21 games. But the FA extended it til the end of September, which we thought was harsh. I thought we should have a press conference and he said he would only attend if he could say a few words. That’s when he delivered the infamous trawler and seagulls line. I thought it would be the best way to draw a line under the whole episode. I remember him asking me for the English word for the boats that collect the fish, and the English for the birds that fly over the sea. Then he wrote the line on a piece of paper. As one legal periodical put it, Cantona had committed the most high-profile common assault in the history of the English legal system. He was banned from English football by the FA for eight months and ordered to carry out community service .

"Arsenal ensured themselves of progress to the FA Cup fifth round with a 3-2 win at Brighton on Sunday. The Gunners were in complete control in the first half with goals from Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil putting them firmly in the ascendancy. But the Championship side fought back after the break with goals from Chris O'Grady and Sam Baldock, sandwiched between Tomas Rosicky's sublime volley, nearly forcing a replay against the Premier League opposition. Here, Sportsmail assesses how each player performed on the day. Arsenal players celebrate their second goal of the afternoon against Brighton . BRIGHTON (4-2-3-1) David Stockdale - 6 .

ARSENAL (4-1-4-1) Wojciech Szczesny - 6 . Had little to do throughout the afternoon, bar the two goals which he was unable to prevent. Calum Chambers - 6 . Provided an excellent assist for Walcott's goal, but could have been stronger  in the build-up when O'Grady netted for the hosts. Laurent Koscielny - 5.5 .

Tomas Rosicky was in impressive form for the Gunners as they secured a narrow win at Brighton . Mesut Ozil's classy finish doubled the Gunners' lead after 24 minutes . Mesut Ozil - 7.5 . On his first start in nearly four months the German showed his class with a brilliant left-footed finish to double Arsene Wenger's side's lead before half-time. Olivier Giroud - 7 .

"Arsene Wenger admitted his Arsenal side are one of the FA Cup favourites after they did what their big rivals failed to do this weekend — reach the fifth round. The Arsenal manager, whose side avoided an upset with a 3-2 win at Brighton, said the string of fourth-round giant-killings on Saturday ‘woke us up a bit’.

Wenger said: ‘We will fight and we want to retain our Cup. I think Saturday’s results were a bit of a subconscious warning for us. It woke us up a bit.’ Chelsea were beaten 4-2 at home by League One Bradford, while City went down 2-0 to Championship side Middlesbrough. Wenger said: ‘Yes, Brighton are a Championship team, but if you are not ready you can lose. I thought that the results showed our game would be different against them. ‘We will be one of the favourites now but with Saturday’s results you would be a bit cautious, the Cup is the Cup. What you want is to focus on the next round and go through. ‘We have good experience from last season to know that every round is difficult. The most difficult games weren’t the expected ones.’ On his side’s display, he added: ‘I believe our performance was good and there was room to score more goals, with the chances we created. After that they had two shots on target, so overall we did the performance I expected. ‘We’ve got good momentum, but let’s keep the urgency level very high and we know how quick momentum can die in football. Bradford celebrate in front of their own supporters after coming from two goals down to beat Chelsea . The rampant League One side put four goals past Chelsea in one of the biggest Cup upsets in recent times . Middlesbrough are in the hat for the fifth round after they were victorious over Manchester City on Saturday . ‘So we have to compete in every game and earn the right to win games.’ Brighton boss Chris Hughton believes that Arsenal have a good chance to go on and win the trophy. He said: ‘Yes, I would expect them to be right up there and of course they had a very good day on Saturday, with the might of Chelsea and Manchester City going out. ‘So I would see they are right up there as favourites, perhaps with Manchester United.’ Of his own side’s display, Hughton said: ‘I thought we showed great character against a very, very good Arsenal side.’ Meanwhile, Wenger revealed Arsenal’s £13.5million move for Villarreal defender Gabriel Paulista was close to completion. He said: ‘The deal is on the line at the moment, I expect it to be over the line overnight.’ The move, however, is subject to the Brazilian obtaining a work permit, which is not a formality as he has not played international football.","Chelsea and Manchester City are out of the FA Cup after shock defeats .

"Manchester City could have Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony in their ranks for this weekend’s title showdown with Chelsea. The pair are currently on international duty with the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Toure (left) would be a welcome return to the Manchester City midfield ahead of their clash with Chelsea . City have struggled without the midfield spark of Toure. They drew 1-1 at Everton and have lost their last two matches at home to Arsenal in the Premier League and Championship Middlesbrough in the FA Cup by a scoreline of 2-0. They would welcome having the 31-year-old back in the ranks along with Bony, who has not yet played for the club since his £28milion signing from Swansea City shortly before the tournament kicked off. In the event of a defeat for the Elephants both would be expected to fly back on Thursday. That is unlikely to cause any problems for Manuel Pellegrini, given that his whole squad landed back from a mid-season trip to Abu Dhabi on Friday before taking on Boro on Saturday. Bony (left) could make his debut against Jose Mourinho's side if the Ivory Coast lose to Cameroon . Meanwhile, winger Jesus Navas acknowledged that City need three points at Stamford Bridge after falling five behind Jose Mourinho’s league leaders. ‘The truth is we have a very important match now,’ he said. ‘Three points that would be very good for us so we need to go there and try to get them.’ The Spaniard believes the 5.30pm kick-off will be a spectacle. Jesus Navas (centre) knows how important the title showdown is but also hopes for a great football spectacle . ‘I think it will be a beautiful match between two very big teams and I hope it will be a great football match,’ he explained. Navas will be familiar with many of his opponents from his time with the Spain squad. But he pointed out striker Diego Costa, who has 17 goals in 19 top-flight matches, as the danger man. ‘It’s been a long time since I spoke with them but Diego Costa is a very important player for them,’ he said. ‘He’s scoring lots of goals and he’s always proving his value, there and also in the Spanish national team.’ Diego Costa (left) is identified as the danger man by his Spanish companion Navas ahead of Saturday's game .","Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations .

"Eric Cantona has had 20 years to forgive, forget or apologise for the kung-fu kick at Selhurst Park which saw the Frenchman transformed from maverick to madman — but, fittingly, he will not have a bit of it. Two decades after that moment of insanity, when Cantona launched himself over the advertising hoardings to attack a Crystal Palace fan, he simply said: ‘I didn’t punch him strong enough. I should have punched him harder.’ Anyone who remembers the incident or remembers Cantona, will not be in the least bit surprised by his recollections of one of the most seismic events in Premier League history. Eric Cantona launches a a kung-fu kick at Crystal Palace supporter Matthew Simmons in 1995 . The French forward flies into the crowd, hitting target Matthew Simmons and the woman next to him . The Frenchman lost his temper in a league match and kicked out at Palace player Richard Shaw. He was shown a red card and as he left the pitch, Cantona blew his top at fan Matthew Simmons who was berating him in the front row of the stands. Cantona launched himself into the crowd, following up his kick with a volley of punches before being dragged away by stewards. He was banned for nine months, given 120 hours community service and gave a surreal press conference with references to trawlers and sardines. Cantona reacted angrily to abuse from a Palace fan after he was sent off during the match at Selhurst Park . Stewards attempt to restrain the forward after his assault on the Palace supporter . The French forward was found guilty of assault at Croydon Magistrates Court as a result of the incident . Even today, Cantona, 48, sees the episode as a piece of theatre. ‘I played that moment, at Selhurst Park,’ he said, in an interview with FourFourTwo magazine. ‘It was a drama and I was an actor. I do things seriously without taking myself seriously. I think Nike found that side of my character and used it very well. Even when I kicked the fan, it’s because I don’t take myself seriously. ‘I didn’t think that I had a responsibility not to do it because of who I was. No, I was just a footballer and a man. I don’t care about being some sort of superior person. I just wanted to do whatever I wanted to do. 'If I want to kick a fan, I do it. I’m not a role model. I’m not a superior teacher, telling you how to behave. I think the more you see, the more you realise that life is a circus.’ He was banned from English football by the FA for eight months and ordered to carry out community service .

"Cathy Churchman has been trying to draw a line under Eric Cantona's kung-fu kick for 20 years. 'I'm 60 now, by the time the 30th anniversary comes around I'll be 70 - I probably won't be able to remember what happened,' the Crystal Palace supporter told Sportsmail. 'I just hope that now the 20 year anniversary is over, we can start to stop talking about it.' Cathy Churchman (left) has been trying to draw a line under Eric Cantona's kung-fu kick for 20 years . Cantona launches a a kung-fu kick at Crystal Palace supporter Matthew Simmons in 1995 . The prospect of that seems highly unlikely, such is the lasting imprint that night has made on English football folklore. For those of you who don't know, Churchman is the person stood just to the right of Matthew Simmons - the target of Cantona's fury that night - that night. It's not an exaggeration to say, it could have been her. 'After it happened I remember looking down at my coat and seeing a scuff mark from Eric's boot, that's how close it was to being me,' she said. 'I just wanted to get out the way, you could see it in Eric's eyes. 'Could it have been me? Absolutely.' Churchman jokes that her immediate thoughts upon seeing replays of the incident when she arrived home after that fateful night was that it was it was 'time for a new hairdo'. Cantona reacted angrily to abuse from Palace fan Simmons (left), Churchman can also be seen (centre) Stewards attempt to restrain the forward after his assault on the Palace supporter . But the seriousness of the implications following that night would soon dawn on her. Churchman would become central to the subsequent court cases for Cantona and Simmons given her proximity to the incident. She maintains the story Cantona was reacting to a racial slur from Simmons is one hard to believe given the noise reverberating around Selhurst Park in the seconds leading up to Cantona's kick following the Frenchman's sending off. Not that is a defence of Simmons in anyway. During his trial for threatening language and behaviour, Simmons launched himself at the prosecution after being found guilty. Churchman, who was in court, recalls: 'It was a foolish act. The whole thing started with a kick from Cantona and that was how it ended with Simmons doing the same. 'Twenty years on, do I ever pay Simmons a thought? To be honest, no. 'I've heard he still goes to games sometimes, even though he has been banned from Selhurst Park.'

The 25-year-old came off the bench to net the winner for the Hammers against the League One high-flyers to send them through to the next round. However, Sakho's inclusion was a surprising one considering he withdrew from the Senegal squad to take part in this month's Africa Cup of Nations, after aggravating a back injury he picked up on international duty in November - which consequently ruled him out for three Premier League games.

"There was a time when Middlesbrough would not have been such outlandish underdogs against Manchester City. In fact, it wasn't so long ago that the Teessiders inflicted one of the most humiliating defeats in City’s history. On Saturday, they meet again in the FA Cup Fourth Round with City the overwhelming favourites to progress. On loan Middlesbrough striker Patrick Bamford will be hoping start against Manchester City in the FA Cup . On the final day of the 2007/08 Premier League campaign City were thumped 8-1 at Middlesbrough . But just eight years ago they were unrecognisable from the club we know today. It was on the final day of the 2007/08 campaign that Sven-Goran Eriksson’s side were thumped 8-1 at the Riverside Stadium. The former England boss wore a haunted look as his team capitulated, suffering their biggest loss in more than 100 years. It had been reported Erkisson already knew of his fate and that owner Thaksin Shinawatra had long since decided the Swede was not the man for the job. The 8-1 defeat was Sven-Goran Eriksson’s last game in charge of City as he was sacked three weeks later . Middlesbrough: Schwarzer, Young (McMahon 75), Riggott, Wheater, Pogatetz, Boateng, Rochemback, Arca (Johnson 62), Downing, Sanli (Aliadiere 62), Alves. Goals: Downing 16 pen, Alves 37, Downing 58, Alves 60, Johnson 70, Rochemback 80, Aliadiere 85, Alves 90. Man City: Isaksson, Jihai, Corluka, Dunne, Ball, Ireland, Gelson, Petrov (Elano 71), Garrido, Vassell (Hamann 62), Benjani (Castillo 13). Goals: Elano 87. And so it proved his last game in charge. In fact, he hasn’t managed in the Premier League since. Bizarrely, the performance of City’s players at Boro was said to be a show of support for Eriksson, a protest at the treatment of their boss. A deliberate act of unprofessionalism or otherwise, their cause was hardly aided when Richard Dunne was sent off following a reckless challenge on Tuncay Sanli inside the penalty area after just 15 minutes. Perhaps the sight of their skipper getting his marching orders for such a needless lunge persuaded the rest of the visiting team to throw in the towel also – either way, Boro certainly took advantage. Stewart Downing scored from the resulting spot-kick before Alfonso Alves – the misfiring Brazilian striker – made it two before the break. Richard Dunne (right) was sent off after a reckless first half challenge on Tuncay Sanli inside the penalty area . Stewart Downing (left) tucked home the resulting spot kick to give Middlesbrough a 1-0 lead on 16 minutes . Fabio Rochemback scored the Teesiders sixth goal of the match with a free-kick . And then the floodgates opened. Downing netted the goal of the game with a with a stunning left-foot volley, before Alves sprinted clear for a fourth. Future City star Adam Johnson came off the bench and got in on the act – albeit via a deflection off Michael Ball – and Brazilian Fabio Rochemback smashed a sixth courtesy of a powerful free-kick into the top corner. Jeremie Aliadiere was another substitute desperate to seize upon City’s weakness and he got the seventh with a cool finish before Alves completed his hat-trick. With the score at 7-0, Elano had nicked a goal which barely merits the term ‘consolation’. For Eriksson, there were no positives. The scoreline is one of the largest in Premier League history and one of City's largest-ever defeats . ‘It is difficult to take whenever you lose. But, when you lose like this, it is awful,’ he said. ‘To concede a penalty and have Richard Dunne sent off was a bad start but we were in the game until it was 3-0. ‘After that, mentally we had nothing left. We were not even on the pitch - the team had totally gone and it was embarrassing for everyone.’ Remarkably, Eriksson stayed in his job for another three weeks before the axe fell. Supporters protested and handed in a 14,000-strong petition to the club. City have certainly come a long way in the seven seasons since.

"Kevin Pietersen just won’t be put down. Having been out of the headlines for several days, he gave a toe-curling interview in which he said: ‘I know the current captain would love to have me in the England team.’ To which Eoin Morgan, the one-day skipper, swiftly responded: ‘I’m very happy with the squad of players I have.’ An ordinary man might have been crushed, but KP seemed to take it as a challenge. So he promptly did something far more disturbing. He engaged the services of one Mick Squires, who is apparently ‘well regarded in the tattoo community’ and was once dubbed ‘The Wizard of Oz’ by Tattoo Master magazine.

And Mick, operating at a private clinic in Melbourne, drew a map of the world which started on KP’s chest and stretched around his ribs to his back.

Like one who listens only to the twittering sycophants who tell him he has been grievously wronged, that one day English cricket will come to its senses. So Pietersen, wilfully deluded, takes himself off to Mick the Wizard. He then ambles topless along Bondi Beach, gauchely posing for the passing snappers.

Hewitt produced some inspired tennis to race through the opening two sets on Rod Laver Arena against a player who had never won a five-set match in his career. However, the former Wimbledon champion was unable to maintain that level and Becker - who admitted to kicking a door to let off some steam after leaving the court following the second set - roared back to secure a 2-6 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-2 victory in just over three hours. Veteran Lleyton Hewitt waves goodbye after crashing out of the Australian Open in Melbourne . The former Wimbledon champion would not confirm what his future now holds . Australian tennis fans cheer on their fading hero at Melbourne Park . Becker's win over Andre Agassi in the third round of the US Open in 2006 prompted Agassi to retire, but the 33-year-old German said: 'I hope it's not Lleyton's last match because then I get asked about it all the time. He is a great warrior, an unbelievable player, so I hope he continues.' Asked about his future plans, Hewitt - who won just one grand slam match in 2014 - said: 'I'll sit down and think about it. As I've said the whole time, I haven't thought about anything. 'But obviously the Davis Cup is the next main thing. Now that we've got some guys playing really good tennis at the moment, it's an exciting time. We have a good chance to possibly pull off an upset away (against the Czech Republic in Ostrava). That's the next focus.' Earlier in the day, top seed and four-time champion Novak Djokovic lost just five games as he cruised into the third round. World No 1 Djokovic thrashed Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 6-0 6-1 6-4 in an hour and 24 minutes, with all three singles matches on Rod Laver Arena in the afternoon completed so quickly that a men's doubles match was hastily added to the day schedule. The 33-year-old Australian raced to a two sets lead before blowing it against Benjamin Becker . Hewitt's wife Bec was in the stands to watch what may be her husband's final match at the Australian Open . Becker punches the air after completing a remarkable five set comeback . Djokovic won the first nine games against a hopelessly outclassed Kuznetsov, who received a sympathetic cheer when he finally troubled the scorers in the fourth game of the second set. The former Wimbledon boys' champion at least had the temerity to break Djokovic at the start of the third, but normal service was instantly resumed and Djokovic closed out the match in ruthless fashion. 'After my first-round match I was hoping to have this kind of performance, especially the opening two sets,' Djokovic said. 'Everything went as I planned and wished and hopefully I can stay on this path. '(Kuznetsov) is a very talented player. He's still young and he's of the generation of my younger brother (Marko) who knows him well, so I spoke to him because I had not seen Kuznetsov play a lot.' Djokovic has dropped just two sets over the first and second rounds since 2007, winning his first title at Melbourne Park in 2008 and lifting the trophy three years in succession from 2011. 'Generally this is my most successful grand slam and the tournament where over the years I've performed my best tennis,' the 27-year-old said. 'The reason? I think there is not one reason. A few reasons together. Andre Agassi cries as he announces his retirement after losing to Becker at the 2006 US Open . World No 1 Novak Djokovic breezed into the next round for the loss of just five games . Russian Andrey Kuznetsov could not cope with Djokovic's superiority on centre court . 'Probably the fact that I enjoy the conditions of play. Even though the last two years the courts have played faster, significantly faster than they were before, still I do enjoy being here in Australia. Some nice, positive, easy-going, sport-oriented energy going around. People appreciate the sport and make you feel good. 'Of course it's the beginning of the year. It's the first big tournament. Everybody comes fresh and motivated. I guess in this kind of package it's a combination of things that make me feel comfortable on the court here.' Defending champion Stan Wawrinka, who ended Djokovic's 25-match unbeaten run here in the quarter-finals last year, also safely reached the last 32, but needed two hours and 16 minutes to finally subdue the resistance of Romanian qualifier Marius Copil. The first two sets took longer to complete than Djokovic's entire match as they lasted an hour and 35 minutes, with Wawrinka winning both in tie-breaks before taking the third set 6-3. 'It was quite a tough match,' fourth seed Wawrinka said. 'I'm happy to get through, especially in three sets. Djokovic's coach and former Australian Open champ Boris Becker applauds his charge from the sidelines . Defending champion Stan Wawrinka was forced to work before coming through againstqualifier Marius Copil . 'The conditions weren't easy today. Quite hot. Really fast on the court. And he was playing great. He was serving big, putting lots of pressure. I wasn't playing my best tennis, but I'm happy the way I fight today and the way I did with the match. 'I'm happy with my game in general. To win the two first matches in three sets, it's great. I'm playing great tennis. As I say, if you want to get far in the tournament, it can be two long weeks. So you need to be ready to have some ups and downs. So far it's been good tennis. I'm happy.' Wawrinka will face Jarkko Nieminen in the third round after the Finn defeated German qualifier Matthias Bachinger in straight sets, with fifth seed Kei Nishikori taking on American Steve Johnson after coming from a set down to beat Croatia's Ivan Dodig.","Lleyton Hewitt lost to Benjamin Becker in five sets at the Australian Open .

"The NHS is recruiting 50 doctors directly from India in a bid to fill desperate staffing gaps in Britain's A&E departments. Around 150 candidates, some of whom have not yet taken final exams in emergency medicine, will be interviewed in New Delhi over Skype next week and begin a four-year spell in Britain this summer. Health bosses insist the drastic measure, which will cost the NHS £3,120 per doctor in flights, visas, registration and access to training tools, is the only way to keep emergency wards safely staffed. Breaking point: NHS bosses insist the move is the way to plug drastic staff shortages on A&E wards (file photo) Some A&E training courses in Britain have been more than half empty with 135 vacancies across the board this year. One campaigner criticised the fact not all candidates will have to complete the Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board (PLAB) test - designed to check they have the right skills and knowledge to work in Britain. Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents, told the Daily Telegraph: 'I am really . concerned to hear about the exceptions being made to the normal rules. 'I can see that the situation is urgent, but we really need to avoid being . forced to take the sorts of panic measures which could compromise . patient safety.' Lifeline: The pilot scheme will last four years . But Health Education England, which is arranging the programme, insisted the PLAB test was one of just three ways in which foreign doctors can be registered in Britain. A spokesman added every doctor on the scheme would have to pass an English language test and they will also be questioned face-to-face before making the final cut. The Overseas Development Project has had around 150 applications from Indian doctors and those successful will be placed in 'learning posts' in hospitals across Britain. The pilot project is running for the first time this year and comes after several reviews on poor standards, including a high-profile crackdown under NHS England director Sir Bruce Keogh. The worst-hit A&E units had thousands of patients waiting longer than four hours and staff shortages so severe they compromised patient safety. One Victorian-era unit named and shamed by the Keogh Review at Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Kent, was described as 'not fit for purpose' and has had to be rebuilt. In some areas the pressure is making shortages even worse as medics move out of A&E departments because they cannot cope. To combat the shortages hospitals have seen a huge rise in the amount they spend on agency staff since 2010, including £242million last year alone. Wye Valley NHS Trust, in Hertfordshire, paid £3,717 for one doctor to work a 30-hour shift, the highest single payment of any NHS body. Some doctors were paid not just for the hours they spent in the hospital, but also time they spent on call, including time they spent asleep. Dr Cliff Mann, President of the College of Emergency Medicine - which is also working on the Indian programme - told the Daily Telegraph: 'The pressures are heaped on Accident and Emergency; we currently have the worst doctor to patient ratio that we have ever had, with demand vastly outstripping supply.' Plugging the gap: Hospitals spent £242million on agency staff last year. One earned £3,700 for a 30-hour shift . Defending the move, a Health Education England spokesman told MailOnline the department was also trying to recruit within Britain and one course this year is 100 per cent full. He said: ‘Our recommendations will ensure availability of more doctors in emergency medicine in 2014, both in terms of appropriately qualified middle grade doctors and additional trainees for the future, to help ensure that patients receive consistent, high quality, safe and effective care. 'Our recommendations promote sustainable solutions for the medical workforce and the development of other roles to support patient care in emergency medicine departments, such as advanced clinical practitioners, physician associates and paramedics.'","Candidates will be shortlisted in an interview over video link next week .

"An Australia Day rap parody of Iggy Azalea's hit song Fancy has been uploaded to YouTube, but don’t expect the tourist board to be using it to promote the country. Called I'm So Aussie! the rapper known only as Robbo packs plenty of references into the song from Vegemite to ciggies to Alf Stewart from Home and Away. Starting with the line 'first things first I'm fair dinkum', pretty much gives you a good idea of what else is to come over the next two minutes. Scroll down for video . I'm So Aussie! is rapper Robbo's tribute to Australia Day and being Australian . The rapper takes a light-hearted look at the joys of living in Australia today . Robbo's tune is a rap parody of Iggy Azalea's hit song Fancy . Apart from the tourist board international superstar Azalea may not be too happy at what Robbo has done to the chorus of her song either. It now goes: 'I'm so Aussie, You already know. I'm in the only lane from Tamworth to Bendigo. I'm so Aussie. Drinking XXXX Gold. Remember my name... it's Robbo!' Robbo goes on to rap about how he likes to 'chuck a sickie', spends his time 'doing bugger all' and describes himself as a 'lower class bogan'. His chances of the song being used in a national tourism advertisement will probably have gone at this stage. The city of Tamworth gets a mention in Robbo's song and video . Robbo packs plenty of references into the song from ciggies to cricketer David Boon . However, Robbo's only getting started as he gives a shout out to Tim Tams, scallops, fish n' chips, and meat pies, telling everyone 'you should taste that', while also claiming to have a 'moustache on my face like David Boon'. His YouTube video definitely is a light-hearted look at Australia and follows Coach Bombay's song and video package on YouTube earlier this month called ‘Straya!’ which is a cover of Outkast’s number one 2003 hit ‘Hey Ya!’ with appropriate Australian images and lyrics. Both videos were aimed at Australia Day celebrations and only time will tell which one proves to be the most popular in the long run. Robbo's version may just get him in more trouble. Tim Tams, scallops, fish n' chips, and meat pies all get a run out too in Robbo's rap .

"Brendan Rodgers believes Thibaut Courtois was the main reason Chelsea reached the Capital One Cup final after his Liverpool side were dumped out after extra-time at Stamford Bridge. After a brilliant performance in the first leg at Anfield, Courtois kept a clean sheet as Jose Mourinho's men advanced with a 1-0 victory (2-1 on aggregate) courtesy of Branislav Ivanovic's header. Rodgers claimed his side were the better team over the two legs, despite failing to make it to Wembley. Thibaut Courtois (left) keeps the score level at 0-0 with a fine save from Liverpool's Alberto Moreno . Brendan Rodgers insists his side were the better team despite being knocked out by Chelsea over two legs . He said: 'I'm very proud of the team, over the two legs we were the better side and their goalkeeper has got them to the final. At Anfield and here tonight he's made very, very important saves and that's won them the game. 'Obviously they got the goal at the beginning of extra-time but that was irrelevant - we knew we needed to score tonight and the players gave everything. They're dead on their feet at the end. 'We pressed, worked hard, played fantastic football and created chances to win the game but unfortunately we were not clinical enough.' Branislav Ivanovic rises highest to score the decisive goal and send Chelsea to Wembley . Diego Costa appeared to stamp on Emre Can during the first half, caught Martin Skrtel with his studs in the second period and then clashed with Reds skipper Steven Gerrard. Asked about Costa's clashes, Rodgers said: 'These things happen but I don't think anyone watching likes to see what Diego Costa's done, not just on (Martin) Skrtel, but also on Can, a young player who is clearly stamped on. 'It's easy to land somewhere else without having to land directly on an opponent's ankle and it's disappointing to see on the replay. He's very fortunate the linesman and referee didn't see that.' Diego Costa appears to stamp on Emre Can's right leg during a feisty opening period at Stamford Bridge . Chelsea striker Costa stands on the foot of Martin Skrtel as he chases down a pass . Rodgers decided to leave Daniel Sturridge out despite the striker's return to training, although he is hopeful he will see some action against West Ham on Saturday. 'It was too soon for this game but we really relish him coming into the team,' said Rodgers. 'He's worked very hard to get back and trained with the team. Hopefully by the weekend he can play some part.'","Chelsea beat Liverpool 1-0 after extra-time (2-1 on aggregate)

"A woman desperate to have a baby lost five stone after being told she was too fat to have fertility treatment on the NHS. Jessica Madine, from Liverpool, lost the weight in 11 months to improve her chances of having a child. At 15st, she was classified as obese - and her doctor warned she would need a lower BMI (Body Mass Index) in order to get the  treatment. Jessica Madine, 23, weighed 15st (left) and was told by doctors she was too fat for IVF treatment. She joined Slimming World and changed her diet of McDonald's and Subway sandwiches for salads and fruit and vegetables. She is now five stone lighter (right) and has begun fertility treatment on the NHS . Miss Madine, with her partner, Duane Miller (right), has always wanted a family of her own, and knew she had to lose weight in order to make conceiving easier . So Miss Madine, who has always wanted a family of her own, decided to tackle the bulge to make it easier for her and partner, Duane Miller, to conceive. The 23-year-old said: 'I've always wanted children, but ever since we found out it would be a struggle for us to conceive a couple of years ago it has been more important than ever. 'We went to the doctor to discuss our options and he told me I needed to get my BMI to a healthier level in order to get the treatment funded on the NHS. 'It was then that I realised I was bigger than I thought - I decided I needed to lose about four stone.' Miss Madine, a support worker, who is 5ft 6in tall, weighed 15st 2.5lbs when she started losing weight with Slimming World in November 2013. Her BMI of 36.1 put her in the obese category, which studies have shown makes IVF treatment more complicated and lowers the success rate. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 to 25. National guidelines from health watchdog NICE say women under 40 should be offered three cycles of IVF on the NHS if they have been trying to have a baby for two years and have not been able to conceive after 12 cycles of artificial insemination. But each local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), the NHS organisation responsible for funding fertility services for the local area, can set criteria for who is eligible for IVF treatment. St Helens CCG only offers treatment to women whose BMI is under 30. Research has shown IVF is less successful for obese women and experts have warned being overweight is known to affect IVF conception, pregnancy and birth. Now the couple have begun fertility treatment, which Miss Madine says is 'like a dream come true'. The pair are pictured on her 21st birthday before she lost weight . Research has shown fertility treatment is less successful for obese women and experts have warned being overweight is known to affect IVF conception, pregnancy and birth. NHS guidelines say women with a BMI of over 30 will find it more difficult to conceive, and a study published in 2012 found having a high BMI could adversely affect the quality of women's eggs. Healthy eggs have one spindle attached to a set of chromosomes. But the researchers found obese women were more likely to have eggs with multiple spindles and disorganised chromosomes. A study published in November last year reiterated the findings, showing that the eggs of overweight women – who have a BMI of over 25 – were smaller and had a different biochemistry from the eggs of healthy weight women. This jeopardises the chance of a successful pregnancy. Royal College of Midwives advise that overweight women undergoing IVF are almost twice as likely to miscarry. The IVF procedure itself is more difficult if the woman is overweight, according to the Advanced Fertility Centre for Chicago. When a woman is significantly overweight, the ovaries are pushed up high, away from the top of the vagina. This means it is more difficult to inject the needles into the follicles to get the eggs out.

Miss Madine was desperate for a baby, and so decided to transform her diet – cutting back on the McDonald's meals, Subway sandwiches or the pizza and chips she would normally opt for. She started following a healthy meal plan including salads and lots of fruit and vegetables, as well as an exercise regime. 'I lost half a stone on my own but had struggled to motivate myself,' she said. 'I joined Slimming World because I knew I'd stick to it if I had other people around to help. She added: 'I was constantly snacking on the wrong food - crisps, chocolate, fizzy drinks, skipping breakfast and just generally eating rubbish. 'Now I eat three meals a day and if I'm going to have a treat I'll make sure to balance it with lots of fruit and veg. 'I did try the gym but found it wasn't for me, so I just walked the dogs twice a day instead. On a typical day, Miss Madine now eats Weetabix or porridge for breakfast, a salad for lunch and chicken or fish with plenty of veg for dinner. She shed almost five stone in 11 months and now weighs 10st 7lbs. Research has shown that having a high BMI adversely affects IVF conception, pregnancy and birth. Miss Madine, pictured here before her weight loss, lost weight through changing her diet and exercise regime. 'I know it's a life changing move though, so I can't go back to my old habits,' she said . The couple have now started ICSI treatment or Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection. This is where the sperm is injected into the egg, instead of fertilisation taking place in a dish where many sperm are placed near an egg, as is the case with IVF treatment. Miss Madine is receiving daily injections, and doctors hope to have embryos implanted within a couple of weeks. She said: 'This means the world to us, and it's even better that both families are behind us. 'It's like a dream come true, and now we're just waiting. 'It's actually been harder keeping the weight off than losing it, so it has been a bit of a fighting game. 'I know it's a life changing move though, so I can't go back to my old habits. 'I still go to Slimming World meetings because everyone there keeps me on track and reminds me of why I did this in the first place.'","Jessica Madine, 23, was told her BMI of 36 made her ineligible for IVF .

"It is 25 years since 22-year-old Phillip Zerrillo was hit by a car and left to die outside a gas station in Cortland, New York. The driver was never found and his then-one-year-old son, Phillip Jr, has grown up yearning for the truth. But now the mysterious cold case could be solved after 25-year-old Zerrillo bumped into a woman who claims she was in the vehicle that night. He was at a gas station buying coffee when the supposed witness approached him. Killed: Phillip Zerrillo, 22, was walking home on May 25, 1990, when he was hit by a car and left to die . Answers? His son, Phillip Jr, 25, was approached by a woman in a gas station claiming she saw the incident . 'She said, 'Are you a relation to Phil Zerrillo?' and I said that was my father and he had passed away. She said, 'I knew of your father...I didn't know him personally but I was in the vehicle the night that he was killed,' the son told NBC News. The woman told him the driver's name and that the car is buried in a plot of land that now lies under a garage. 'I said, ""Why didn't you come forward at the time?"" And she said, ""I was scared."" I was so shocked I don't remember if she ever told me what her name was. And then she took off in a blue minivan.' His father had been walking home from to his apartment on May 25, 1990, after staying with family five miles away. Hours later he was found alive but gravely wounded on a street by a passing motorist. He died en route to the hospital. 'Some days I wonder if I should have let it fly over,' he said. 'I mean, it has been 25 years. Struggling: The victim's sister (center), stepfather (right) and son (left) are optimistic of solving the case . 'Some days I wish they'd find out who did it and I could just choke them. Other days, I feel like if they found them and they were sentenced to jail, it would ruin another family, and I don't want that.' The woman's revelation prompted Cortland police to reopen the case - and they have been flooded with tips. 'They were inundated,' Trooper Nathan R. Riegal, a spokesman for Troop C, said. 'Now they are going through those leads.' Meanwhile, the Zerrillo family has been struggling to cope with the grief - which they believe caused the victim's mother to suffer numerous strokes. 'It absolutely killed her. She was destroyed. She lost her soul,' said her ex-husband Stephen Joseph, who was the dead man's stepfather. 'I talked to her about letting it go and she said, 'I can't forgive whoever killed my son. They took my life away from me,' Joseph said.","Phillip Zerrillo, 22, was hit by car and left to die on May 25, 1990 .

"The number of foreign-born people living in London will outnumber native Britons by 2031, it was revealed today. The immigrant population of the capital will reach at least five million in 16 years - having more than doubled from one million in 1971 to three million in 2011, when the last census was carried out. New research has found the rise of non-British born Londoners will take the city's total population to more than 10 million in 2031 and 11 million in 2041 - compared with the 8.6 million living there today. But while the city's immigrant population will continue to rise sharply in the coming decades, the number of British-born people will continue to slowly decline. In 1971 this figure was at more than six million but this is likely to sink below five million in the coming decades. Tipping point: New research has revealed that the immigrant population of London will reach at least five million in 16 years - and outnumber British-born residents . Immigration groups have said that the situation will be 'totally unacceptable' to many voters while political parties say it will but put even more pressure on public services. Vice chairman of MigrationWatch UK Alp Mehmet said: 'The public understand the enormous effect that the present rate of immigration is having on many of our cities and especially on London. White British: 44.9% . Other white: 14.9% . Asian: 18.4% . Black: 13.3% . Arab: 1.3% . Mixed race: 5% . According to the 2011 census . 'On current trends, the UK-born will be in a minority in their own capital within 20 years, despite strong public opposition to mass immigration. 'It is time that the political class woke up to the implications for the future of our society before they find their credibility in shreds.' Research by The Times has revealed the likely change in London's population by 2031 and used previous studies. According to the national census from 2011 the capital's population was 8.2 million, up from 7.5million in 1971. Of the three million foreign-born residents 40 per cent were from Europe, 30 per cent from the Middle East and Asia, 20 per cent from Africa and 10 per cent from America or the Caribbean. Picture of Britain: Of the three million foreign-born residents in London in 2011 40 per cent were from Europe, 30 per cent from the Middle East and Asia, 20 per cent from Africa and 10 per cent from America or the Caribbean . Since 1951 the number of Londoners from Africa has rocketed from 90,000 to 620,000, with people from Nigeria making up 100,000 of those. In the same period those originally from Asia and the Middle East went from 180,000 to 970,000 - with people originally from India making up 155,000 of those. The 2011 census also revealed other social changes in London, including that white British people became a minority in London for the first time. Just 3.7million Londoners described their ethnicity as 'White British' in 2011 - down from 4.3million in 2001, and making up 44.9 per cent of the city's population. Five London boroughs saw the proportion of white Britons fall by more than a quarter. The largest decline was in Newham, East London, where the decrease was 37.5 per cent. In Barking and Dagenham, on the East London/Essex border, 80 per cent of residents were white British in 2001 but by 2011 the proportion was 49 per cent.","Foreigners living in London set to outnumber native Britons in 16 years .

Experts say the trees have been hidden in the North Sea since the Ice Age . The 45-year-old, who has been diving in the North Sea for about 16 years, said she was 'absolutely thrilled' to find the ancient oak trees. She said: 'You certainly don't expect to go out for a quick dive and find a forest' Ms Watson, who runs the Marine Conservation Society's survey project, Seasearch in East Anglia with partner Rob Spray, said she was 'absolutely thrilled' with the find. She said: 'I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first. 'The sea was quite rough by the shore so I decided to dive slightly further out and after swimming over 300 metres of sand I found a long blackened ridge. 'When I looked more closely I realised it was wood and when I swam further along I started finding whole tree trunks with branches on top, which looked like they had been felled. 'It was amazing to find and to think the trees had been lying there completely undiscovered for thousands of years. You certainly don't expect to go out for a quick dive and find a forest.' Ms Watson, who has been diving in the North Sea for about 16 years, said the trees are thought to have formed part of a huge forest, measuring thousands of acres. But it is believed the forest was drowned when the ice caps melted and the sea level rose 120 metres. The fallen trees are now lying on the ground where they have formed a natural reef, which is teaming with colourful fish, plants and wildlife.

The incredible forest is believed to have become exposed following the stormy weather last winter . 'At one time it would have been a full-blown Tolkein-style forest, stretching for hundreds of miles,' added Mr Spray, who has begun surveying the forest with his partner. 'It would have grown and grown and in those days there would have been no one to fell it so the forest would have been massive. 'It would have looked like a scene from the Hobbit or Lord of the Rings, which is something we don't get in this country anymore. Geologists are very excited about it, it was a really miraculous find.' The pair now hope that radio carbon dating will be carried out on the trees to discover exactly how long the forest has been there. Mr Spray said: 'We plan to do more dives so we can map the forest and get an idea of its size and scale. It is hoped radio carbon dating will now be carried out on the trees to discover how long they have been there . Ms Watson said the trees are thought to have formed part of a huge forest, measuring thousands of acres . 'It is extremely exciting as it may be hiding lots of undiscovered fossils of mammoths and sea creatures.' The forest bed is at the start of the chalk reef which forms the proposed Cromer Shoal Marine Conservation Zone just to the East. It is also near the Norfolk Wildlife Trust's Cley Marshes reserve, which is famous for birdlife. The area became a popular dive spot for the wildlife on a nearby wreck, the Vera which sank in 1914. Last year, ancient forests were exposed along the Welsh coastline after the storms washed away peat and exposed gnarled tree trunks on the shore near the village of Borth, Ceredigion in Mid Wales.","Diver Dawn Watson found incredible ancient forest under the North Sea .

The comments were made by Mr Musk during an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit. When asked to expand on his Mars lander plans, the 43-year-old said: 'The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. 'I'm hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learnt a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon.'

Mr Musk wants to help establish a colony of up to 80,000 people on the red planet. However, he admitted he’d like to start small, with a group of 10 people, and build the colony from there. He ultimately plans to use a reusable rocket, fuelled by liquid oxygen and methane, to reach the red planet in six years. It would need to be much heavier than SpaceX’s current rockets, including the Falcon Heavy. During the mission, Mr Musk said the goal is take 100 metric tonnes of 'useful payload' to the surface, and this will require 'a very big spaceship and booster system.' And, on the subject of what the Mars visitors will wear, Mr Musk said his spacesuit design is coming together and will also be unveiled later this year. 'We are putting a lot of effort into design aesthetics, not just utility. 'It needs to both look like a 21st century spacesuit and work well. [It's] really difficult to achieve both.'

The rocket is reusable and it crashed into a target in the Atlantic Ocean shortly after the Dragon capsule delivered supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). At the weekend, the space firm attempted to land the reusable rocket on a floating platform off the east coast of America. However, the first stage of the unmanned Falcon rocket made it to the platform, but the booster came down too hard and broke apart. The test was carried out as part of a supply mission to the International Space Station. 'Close, but no cigar this time,' Mr Musk tweeted. Although, he said the test bodes well for the future, though.

Mr Musk maintains that recovering and reusing rockets is essential for bringing down launch costs and speeding up operations. The primary mission for SpaceX was delivering more than 5,000 pounds of supplies ordered by Nasa, including hasty replacements for experiments and equipment lost in the destruction of another company's cargo ship last fall, as well as extra groceries. A ship with SpaceX staff watched from a safe 10 miles (16km) away as the booster approached the platform, marked with a giant X. Musk reported that the platform itself - 300 feet (91 metres) by 100 feet (30 metres), with wings stretching the width to 170 feet (51 metres) - was fine following the attempted touchdown well before dawn.

But he said some of the equipment on deck will need to be replaced. A pair of attempts last year to bring boosters down vertically on the open ocean went well, but company officials conceded before Saturday's try that a platform touchdown was considerably more challenging. Once separated from the upper stage of the rocket Saturday, the main booster re-ignited as planned for the flyback, according to SpaceX. Automatic engine firings maneuvered the booster down toward the autonomous, modified barge. The Air Force maintained the ability, as always, to destroy the booster if it strayed off course. The shipment - the sixth by SpaceX since 2012 - is needed more than usual because of the recent loss of another company's supply ship. Orbital Sciences Corp's Antares rocket exploded seconds after liftoff in October, destroying the entire payload and damaging the Virginia launch complex. That rocket is grounded until next year. This SpaceX delivery was supposed to occur before Christmas, but was delayed by a flawed test-firing of the rocket. Then a problem with the rocket's steering system cropped up at the last minute during Tuesday's initial launch attempt. Nasa is paying SpaceX and Orbital Sciences to keep the space station stocked in the wake of the retired shuttle program. The $1.6billion contract with SpaceX calls for 12 flights; the $1.9billion contract with Orbital calls for eight. SpaceX also returns items to Earth; Orbital can't.

"A band of wild chimpanzees have been caught on camera slipping into fields under the cover of darkness to steal ears of maize. The apes, which included females and infants, were then seen escaping back into the Ugandan forest clutching armfuls of the crop. Over a 20-day period the primates were filmed raiding the nearby maize fields a total of 14 times. Scroll down for video . Over 20 days, researchers observed parties of around eight chimpanzees climbing across a branch and lowering themselves into maize fields near the Kibale Forest National Park, Uganda, where they would spend up to two hours foraging. The group carried out this act a total of 14 times . Primatologists believe the behaviour is an adaptation the chimpanzees have learnt as their normal habitat in Kibale Forest National Park, is being destroyed by commercial logging. The animals predominantly performed the raids on moonless nights because they were less likely to be spotted by the local farmers who guard their crops as they reach maturity, said the researchers. Experts have found that West African chimps in Guinea have a favourite tool set for catching their staple food of ants. They search far and wide to find a spindly shrub with straight shoots, called Alchornea hirtella, which makes the ideal tool to hunt aggressive army ants, new research reveals. The plant provides the animals with two different types of tool - a thicker shoot for ‘digging’ and a more slender tool for 'dipping'. When they have found an army ant colony, chimpanzees will dig into the nest with the first tool to aggravate the insects. They then dip the second tool into the nest, causing the angry ants to swarm up it. Dr Sabrina Krief, from the National Museum of Natural History in France, explained: 'To our knowledge, this is the first report of long, repeated and group night activities by a great ape species outside of moonlit nights. 'The nightlife of chimpanzees has been neglected and we have probably missed some interesting activities as night-time lasts around half of each 24 hours in the equatorial regions.' The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Plos One, set up cameras on the edge of an area of forest where it bordered a maize field. Over 20 days, the research team observed parties of around eight chimpanzees climbing across a branch and lowering themselves into the maize field where they would spend up to two hours foraging. Footage then shows them stealthily creeping out of the fields and back into the direction of the national park. The chimps also carried out their raids throughout the day, but the researchers spotted the animals were noticeably more anxious during these light hours. Although the raids occurred at different times over the 20-day period, the chimpanzees predominantly carried out the robberies on moonless nights (pictured) because they were less likely to be spotted by the local farmers who guard their crops as they reach maturity . In a number of the recordings, the animals were seen scanning the distance, scratching themselves and regularly defecating, often diarrhoea, which the study claimed is a common sign of nervousness. A number of the animals also appeared to be standing guard during the recordings, too, in which they assumed a quadrupedal posture for more than five seconds without moving. Dr Krief added: Even though the chimpanzees' home range has been seriously damaged and disturbed by both logging activities and significant human demographic pressure, chimpanzees have shown great behavioural flexibility including unexpected nocturnal behaviour, in order to take advantage of the proximity of domestic nutritive food.'

Just nine days ago, Virgin Galactic's experimental space craft disintegrated over the Californian desert when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces tore it apart. Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed in the accident and pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured but managed to escape after activating his parachute system. An inquiry into the crash is said to be focusing on the decision by Mr Alsbury to push a lever allowing the spaceship's two wings to be moved as it broke the sound barrier. Per Wimmer, an adventurer who knew both pilots, said they were both 'extremely competent' and claimed the action would be 'a very strange error to make'.

Disaster: An investigation has revealed that Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo did not explode in mid-air due to fuel ignition - but it could have come apart for mechanical reasons after one of the pilots pulled a lever . It has emerged that nine months ago, a group of ten of the firm's customers had written to Virgin Galactic expressing their concerns over the space programme's delays. Each had paid a £125,00 deposit to be among the first to be taken into space - and two of the group have now asked for refunds. At least 24 of the wealthy investors who signed up to be among Richard Branson's first space tourists have given up their tickets. Tragedy: The broken hull of SpaceShipTwo (above) in the Mojave desert after it exploded last Friday . Peter Ulrich von May, an asset manager based in Switzerland, told The Independent he no longer wishes to travel into space with Virgin Galactic and he has demanded his money back. He said: 'I want out. I subscribed seven years ago at 63, am still an active private pilot and in good health but who knows how long it will now take. I have already informed VG of my wish - no reply yet. The Daily Mail reported that one of the program's highest-profile customers, Princess Beatrice, will not be boarding the Virgin Galactic spacecraft after the disaster last week.

"An Israeli farmer has reinvented the wheel after an accident left him wheelchair-bound. When Gilad Wolf broke his pelvis in 2008, he wanted to continue work - but found a wheelchair was not ideal for traversing fields. After years of development, he managed to do the seemingly impossible - and reinvent the wheel. Scroll down for video . The Acrobat wheelchair, which shows off the unique design . The SoftWheel's design features a rim that has three shock absorbing compression cylinders. This suspends the wheel's hub while evenly distributing mass along the chair, giving the rider the ability to easily descend stairs and overcome bumps. The 'selective suspension' mechanism remains static on standard floors or pavements, but prompts a shift upon hitting an obstacle. Upon hitting the bump, the wheel’s hub moves into action, extending or shrinking symmetrically as needed and dramatically reducing the shock transmitted.

How it workds: Upon hitting the bump, the wheel¿s hub moves into action, extending or shrinking symmetrically as needed and dramatically reducing the shock transmitted. Whereas 30-35 percent of the propulsion energy provided to a typical wheel goes into the suspension – to sustain sagging and bobbing – approximately 97 percent of the propulsion energy provided to the SoftWheel system goes right into the wheel itself, Barel said. The firm has already developed a wheelchair and a bicycle using the technololgy, which it hopes to sell soon. The fluent,. the bicycle version of the wheel, which is expected to go on sale next year. With our unique design, the Acrobat wheel delivers flexibility while preserving wheel functionality with no added energy loss and bouncy unstable sensation,' the firm said. 'On flat terrain it rolls like a rigid wheel and only when encountering impacts the suspension mechanism jumps into action to absorb the shock from the impact, lessening the stress to the rider’s body.' However, it says the system could work for any type of wheel. The firm is about to starting selling the Acrobat wheelchair wheels,, and hopes the bicycle wheels will follow next year.","Invented by Israeli farmer who wanted his wheelchair to be more adaptable .

"Forget the soft approach, ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male-dominated industries, according to a controversial study. The advice was given by female psychologist, Ann Marie Ryan, who claims women applicants should 'play up their masculine qualities' in job interviews. Her research suggests recruiters prefer more masculine traits to the 'warmth', 'supportiveness' and 'nurturing' commonly associated with women. Forget the soft approach, ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male-dominated industries, according to a controversial study. The advice was given by female psychologist, Ann Marie Ryan, who claims women applicants should 'play up their masculine qualities' in job interviews . Professor Ann Marie Ryan of Michigan State University conducted an experiment with volunteers for the research journal Psychology of Women Quarterly. She asked women to apply for leadership roles in male-dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates' suitability. Some of the women were asked to emphasise supposed masculine-like traits such as assertiveness, independence and raw ambition. Others were asked to display more feminine traits, in this case defined as warmth, supportiveness and a nurturing nature. As part of the tests, the panel - irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it - decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process . Professor Ryan said: 'We found that manning up seemed to be an effective strategy because it was seen as necessary for the job.' The panel, irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it, decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process. The study is part of Professor Ryan's research into why women, ethnic minorities, the disable and the elderly are discriminated against in society and what they can do to avoid it. Though it may seem wrong for women to act like men in order to succeed. Professor Ryan said it may help candidates overcome an obvious bias in the very early stages or recruitment. She said: 'Companies and recruiters should make sure they are not exhibiting discriminatory screening practices. 'There's a lot of advice out there for applicants to help combat this type of bias, but our research is aimed at figuring out what kind of advice is beneficial and what kind of advice may harm you.' The amount of women in executive positions at Fortune 500 companies has remained at a dismal 15 per cent. Only last month UN investigator Rashida Manjoo declared that the UK has a ‘boys' club sexist culture’ with sexism work in Britain than any other place. Part of the problem, according to psychologists, is that many men are in fact ‘secret feminists’ but are afraid to speak up because their motives may be misread. Adam Grant, a professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, highlights the fact that in conversation about women in leadership, male voices are noticeably absent. For instance, of Amazon’s 100 top-selling books this week about women and business, only four were written by men. ‘Some men want to voice their support, but fear that no one will take them seriously, because they lack a vested interest in the cause,’ Professor Grant writes in the Atlantic. But is this just an excuse? ‘I don’t think so,’ said Professor Grant. ‘There’s evidence that when a cause seems inconsistent with our self-interest, we fear that we’ll incur a backlash, so we hold back.’","This is according to experiments conducted at Michigan State University .

"A mother of three was forced to burn her daughter's cot and throw out furniture after her home became overrun by bed bugs. Clare Knight and her family have left unable to sleep at night and covered in bites since the insects infested her home in Mitcham, south west London last summer. The 41-year-old called in pest controllers to kill the bugs but says they were back within weeks - and have made life in their home a nightmare. Clare Knight said her home has become overrun by the bugs which keep her and her large family awake at night . 'It's awful. We were waking up in the middle of the night itching, put the light on and see these little black things running around. 'It started out just a few. Then we realised what they were and we contacted the housing association and said what was going on and they sent someone round, but it seemed to get worse. 'I have been to the doctor, I have been to the health visitor who was disgusted at how we have to live like this.' Ms Knight, a single mother, lives in the house with children who are aged between one and 25. Her three-year-old granddaughter and her son's girlfriend also live in the property owned by a housing association. The mother-of-three said despite calling in pest controllers in the summer, the situation has become worse . Ms Knight, who lives with her daughter Cara (left) and granddaughter Leyla (right) hopes the housing association which owns the property will solve the problem. Bed bugs (file image right) feast on the blood of humans and are thought to have doubled in numbers in the UK in the past six years . The house in south west London is owned by a housing association which says it has done its due part to solve the problem . A small trail of blood is often found in the sheets of a bed infested with bugs which feast on humans as they sleep (file image) The number of bedbug cases in the UK has more than doubled in the past six years, according to pest control experts Rentokil Pest Control. Bedbugs feed on human blood like mosquitoes. A single pregnant bedbug can create an infestation of thousands within weeks. Forecasters predicted a big increase this winter due to the wet, mild weather. Bedbugs don’t choose a dirty home over a clean one - they just care about blood. Resistance to insecticides and increase in travel have fuelled the bedbug increase. After failing to get rid of the pests, she burned her daughter's cot along with other furniture but says she can still see the bugs coming through skirting boards. 'I called for a quote and was told just to treat three rooms would cost me over £1,000. 'I can’t believe how L&Q have left us to live,' she added. London and Quadrant, which owns the house, sent pest-controllers to treat the property in July, but failed to exterminate them. An L&Q spokesman said: 'We appreciate that Miss Knight is experiencing a pest problem, however our tenancy agreements make it clear that infestations within a property are the responsibility of the tenant.

"Bedbugs have become a growing problem around the world, with epidemics New york and other world cities. However, researchers have found an unlikely solution - kidney bean leaves. Inspired by a traditional Balkan bedbug remedy, researchers found microscopic hairs on kidney bean leaves effectively stab and trap the biting insects. Scroll down for video . The Bedbug (Cimex lectularius) may have finally met its match - in the unlikely form of a kidney bean leaf . Bedbugs have made a dramatic comeback . in recent years, infesting everything from homes and hotels to schools, . movie theaters and hospitals. Although not known to transmit disease, their bites can cause burning, itching, swelling and psychological distress. It helps to catch infestations early, . but the nocturnal parasites’ ability to hide almost anywhere, breed . rapidly and “hitchhike” from place to place makes detection difficult. They can survive as long as a year without a blood meal. Current . commercial prevention methods, including freezing, extreme heating, . vacuuming and pesticides, can be costly and unreliable. Scientists at UC Irvine and the University of Kentucky are now developing materials that mimic the geometry of the leaves, according to findings published today in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Their work was motivated by a centuries-old remedy for bedbugs used in Bulgaria, Serbia and other southeast European countries. Kidney bean leaves were strewn on the floor next to beds and seemed to ensnare the blood-seeking parasites on their nightly forays. The bug-encrusted greenery was burned the next morning to exterminate the insects. Through painstaking detective work, the scientists discovered that the creatures are trapped within seconds of stepping on a leaf, their legs impaled by microscopic hooked hairs known botanically as trichomes. Using the bean leaves as templates, the researchers have microfabricated materials that closely resemble them geometrically. The synthetic surfaces snag the bedbugs temporarily but do not yet stop them as effectively as real leaves, Loudon said, suggesting that crucial mechanics of the trichomes still need to be determined.Theoretically, bean leaves could be used for pest control, but they dry out and don’t last very long. They also can’t easily be applied to locations other than a floor. Synthetic materials could provide a nontoxic alternative. Close-up of the bedbugs getting caught on a kidney bean hair, which researcher now hope to replicate in artificial materials . 'Plants exhibit extraordinary abilities to entrap insects,' said Catherine Loudon, lead author of the paper. 'Modern scientific techniques let us fabricate materials at a microscopic level, with the potential to ‘not let the bedbugs bite’ without pesticides.'“Nature is a hard act to follow, but the benefits could be enormous,” said Michael . Potter of the University of Kentucky. 'Imagine if every bedbug inadvertently brought into a dwelling was captured before it had a chance to bite and multiply.'Funding for the study was provided by the National Science Foundation. Common adult Bedbug- Bed bug (Cimex lectularius.) Bedbugs, or cimicidae, are small parasitic insects that feed on human blood. Reddish-brown, flattened, oval shaped and wingless, adult bed bugs grow to 4–5mm in length and 1.5–3mm wide. To feed, the pests pierce the skin of their hosts with two hollow feeding tubes shaped like tongues. With one tube it injects its saliva, which contains anticoagulants and anaesthetics, while with the other it sucks the blood of its host. It takes between five to ten minutes for a bed bug to become completely engorged, after which it usually returns to its hiding place. Bedbugs can cause a number of health effects including skin rashes and allergic symptoms. Worryingly, they have been found with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA. The creatures were largely eradicated in the developed world in the early Forties, but since 1995 they have enjoyed an unwelcome resurgence, the reasons for which are unclear. Elusive and usually nocturnal, bedbugs can be hard to spot. Aside from bite symptoms, signs include faecal spots, blood smears on sheets, and molts. They can be found singly, but often congregate once established. Close-up of the bedbugs getting caught on a kidney bean hair .","Traditional Balkan bedbug remedy found to be extremely effective .

"The amount of women in executive positions at Fortune 500 companies has remained at a dismal 15 per cent. Only last month UN investigator Rashida Manjoo declared that the UK has a ‘boys' club sexist culture’ with sexism work in Britain than any other place. Part of the problem, according to psychologists, is that many men are in fact ‘secret feminists’ but are afraid to speak up because their motives may be misread. Recent studies suggest men are reluctant to support women in the workplace in case their motives are misread. Adam Grant at the University of Pennsylvania claims that 'secret male feminists' need to be brought out of their shell if more women are to get executive positions . Adam Grant, a professor of Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, highlights the fact that in conversation about women in leadership, male voices are noticeably absent. For instance, of Amazon’s 100 top-selling books this week about women and business, only four were written by men. ‘Some men want to voice their support, but fear that no one will take them seriously, because they lack a vested interest in the cause,’ Professor Grant writes in the Atlantic. But is this just an excuse? ‘I don’t think so,’ said Professor Grant. ‘There’s evidence that when a cause seems inconsistent with our self-interest, we fear that we’ll incur a backlash, so we hold back.’ 'Some men want to voice their support, but fear that no one will take them seriously, because they lack a vested interest in the cause,' said Professor Grant. Pictured is a sexist vintage advert from Schlitz . Rashida Manjoo, the UN's special rapporteur on violence against women, last month said the culture of gender inequality in Britain was 'more . prevalent' than anywhere else . While wolf whistling might rankle, it seems that not all sexist behaviour is seen as a bad thing, according to a recent study. 'Benevolent sexism', where women are treated as helpless entities in need of protection, is seen in a positive light by many - particularly those women with a strong sense of entitlement. The results appeared in a study conducted by researchers at the University of Auckland  The study was set up to test part of the Ambivalent Sexism Theory, which splits discrimination against women into two varieties - hostile and benevolent. Hostile, also known as misogyny, encompasses those who see women as second class and those who think women are intellectually inferior to men as well as other obviously sexist standpoints . Benevolent sexism, meanwhile, is the term used to describe the actions of those men and women who believe females depend on their male partners for everything from money to guidance and find it difficult to exist independently. The study, which spoke to 2,700 women and 1,600 New Zealand men, found that women with a greater sense of entitlement were more likely to agree with statements such as 'Women should be cherished and protected by men.' Separate research by psychologists, Rebecca Ratner at the University of Maryland and Dale Miller at Stanford, seems to support Professor Grant’s theory. During a series of studies in which men actively supported women’s rights, people responded with surprise and aggression. Both men and women were shocked and resentful toward the men. Professor Ratner asked a group of students whether they opposed a fictional policy called proposition 174, in which funds were to be cut for research into a health issue that affected either men or women. Whatever their gender and whether they were told it concerned men or women, the level of opposition did no vary. However, when asked if they would give active support people were far less willing to do so for the opposite sex. ‘I saw this happen recently when I facilitated a conversation for a group about gender and leadership,’ said Professor Grant. ‘A man raised his hand to share his support for bringing more women into leadership positions. I expected enthusiastic reactions from his female peers, but instead, his comment was greeted with skepticism. ‘One woman directly questioned his intentions: What was his ulterior motive? Was he trying to ingratiate himself with women to improve his dating prospects?’ Professor Grant believes that ‘secret male feminists’ need to be brought out of their shell if more women are to get executive positions in the workplace. ‘That support depends not only on breaking glass ceilings and attacking overt sexism, but also on dismantling the fears that prevent men from being better allies,’ he said. Advertisers once played on the fact many saw women as good for little other than shopping. While attitudes have come a long way, recent research suggests many men are still afraid to speak up in support of women .","Professor Adam Grant claims women are being held back by secret feminists .

"From revolvers to cricket stumps and matchboxes to watches, you’re unlikely to see these sorts of camera models in your local technology store. Dating back as far as 150 years, they are history’s most unusual photographic devices - with some even designed for concealed use by detectives. Among the most interesting is the Thompson's Revolver Camera from 1862 - with a brass cylinder as the camera body, holding a circular glass plate. Scroll down for video . Based on Colt Revolver: Thompson's Revolver Camera from 1862 had a brass cylinder as the camera body, holding a circular glass plate . Taking a shot: The Sands and Hunter Gun Camera was launched in 1885. It was held like a rifle and aimed through a conventional gun sight . Believed to have taken its inspiration from the Colt Revolver, after each exposure the back of the cylinder was rotated through 90 degrees. Four successive ‘shots’ could be taken in this before a ‘reload’ was required – but the camera was not a big success, with fewer than 100 produced. Two decades later brought the launch of the Sands and Hunter Gun Camera, which was held like a rifle and aimed through a conventional gun sight. Around this time in the 1880s it was becoming popular for cameras resembling other objects to be built - either for secret photography or novelty value. Other unusual cameras in the collection - compiled by the National Media Museum in Bradford - include a more modern one fitted inside stumps. Snaps: The stumps camera from 1993 held two tiny cameras for cricket viewers (left), while the 1949 Steineck ABC Wrist Camera is seen (right) To be concealed: Other hidden cameras include Stirn's Waistcoat Camera from 1891, which was designed to be worn underneath a waistcoat . This device from 1993 followed the development five years earlier of the charge-coupled device sensor chip, to replace fragile camera tubes. This technology meant cameras could become smaller or remain the same size with better quality – and the stumps had two tiny cameras built in. This gave slightly different angles of view and allowed television viewers of cricket matches to experience the batsman’s view of the action. Another fascinating device is the Eastman Matchbox Camera - a miniature camera housed inside a metal case, the size of a normal matchbox. It was designed to be disguised as a box of matches by sliding inside a match box cover, and used by Allied spies during the Second World War. Other hidden cameras include Stirn's Waistcoat Camera from 1891, which was designed to be worn underneath the photographer's waistcoat. Early days: In 1906, the Ticka Watch Camera was launched, which carried rollfilm that was contained in a special cardboard drop-in cartridge . Different ages: The 2.5-inch Coronet Midget Camera from 1935 (left) and the Mick-a-Matic camera from 1970, designed for children (right) And in 1885 we saw the Demon Detective Camera - priced at five shillings when first released, and designed to be hidden within clothing. An advert said: ‘No movement is too rapid for it – the racehorse at greatest speed, the flight of birds, even the lightning flash itself’. Colin Harding, curator of photographic technology at the National Media Museum, told MailOnline: ‘From the 1880s, with the introduction of dry plate photography, cameras became more portable and could be held in the hand to take pictures. ‘This quickly led to cameras being designed, or disguised, to look like other objects. ‘Since then, hidden and unusually-shaped cameras have regularly appeared, with varying degrees of popularity.’ Other interesting models include the Steineck ABC Wrist Camera, designed in Germany in 1949 in the shape of a wristwatch so it could be worn. More than 40 years earlier, the Ticka Watch Camera was launched, which carried rollfilm that was contained in a special cardboard drop-in cartridge. Festive: The Santa Claus camera was launched in 1980, a century after the Demon Detective Camera, designed to be hidden within clothing . Used in WWII: The Eastman Matchbox Camera - a miniature camera housed inside a metal case, which was the size of a normal matchbox . The lens, carried in the winding stem, was covered by a screw-on cap between exposures – and a clip-on viewfinder was available as an add-on. Also in the selection are the Santa Claus Camera from 1980 and the Mick-a-Matic camera from 1970, which was designed for use by children. The Mick-A-Matic was made in the US from about 1970 under licence from Walt Disney Productions and incorporates a 126 cartridge camera. For indoor shots, a flash cube can be plugged into the top of Mickey’s head – and publicity claimed it had everything for ‘perfect pictures, every time’. Meanwhile, the Santa camera had a viewfinder on his forehead, a shutter release on his cap and a film advance dial running across his left cheek. Mr Harding said: ‘The back carries a label with a useful piece of advice that all photographers should consider - “Remove nose when taking pictures”.'","Among collection is Thompson's Revolver Camera (1862) - four 'shots' in a row could be taken before 'reload'

"Nasa's next rover to land on Mars could have a little helper to help keep it safe while exploring the planet's surface. British engineers have been testing a new type of intelligent robot that can be deployed from a larger vehicle on the Martian surface to act as a scout in the surrounding landscape. They hope the scout, which is about 30 inches (76cm) long, will be used on a planned joint Nasa and European Space Agency mission to bring back samples of soil from Mars to Earth. Scroll down for video . British engineers are testing a new intelligent scout robot (shown). They say it could be deployed from a larger vehicle on the Martian surface. It would 'scurry' ahead to find objects of interest for the rover to explore. This would make the process of analysing objects on Mars quicker . The scout would trundle ahead of the main rover to assess its route across the red planet for soft sand and hidden rocks that have damaged and even killed off previous rovers. Using a range of laser scanners and soil analysers, the scout is able to tell the main rover that its path is safe, allowing it to move far faster than has been possible on previous missions. Up until now rovers on Mars have moved at an achingly slow pace to give them time to avoid hazards. The Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, of which the latter is still active, managed an average of just 0.02mph (0.03km/h), while Curiosity has a top speed of 0.08mph (0.13km/h). The next generation rover will carry on exploring the Red Planet, with upgraded hardware and instruments to examine Mars' rocks. The rover will assess the potential of the environment for humans to live in one day and search for signs of Martian life. It will identify and collect rock and soil samples, which it will eventually be able to send back to Earth intact with the help of another future spacecraft that will land on the surface and pick them up. Dr Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has previously said that collecting a rock sample and bringing it back to Earth is Nasa's top priority. Scientists are particularly interested in the samples so they can understand the hazards posed by Martian dust and demonstrate how oxygen can be created - details important to consider for human missions to Mars and the future colonisation of the planet. The rover marks the next major step in fulfilling President Obama's challenge of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. The European Space Agency intends to launch its own rover, ExoMars, in 2018 and it will face the same problems. 'We are looking at the next critical mission, which will be Mars Sample Return,' said Dr Elie Allouis, a robotics systems engineer at Airbus Defence and Space who has been helping to develop the scout rover. 'This calls for a lightweight rover that will cover about 20km [12 miles] in about six months. To put things in perspective, the American MER Rover did the same in about six years. 'We need to go as fast as possible so we need to make sure the safety of the platform is maintained throughout this long traverse. 'With the past rovers they have been bogged down in a very fine sanddune and they got so stuck that it actually killed that particular platform. 'The purpose of the scout is to go ahead and find these sand traps before the primary rover actually reaches them.' It is hoped that with the scout, which has been nicknamed Faster, scientists will be able to explore parts of Mars that have been inaccessible with previous rovers. Until now, Mars rovers have required relatively flat terrain with few rocks, which would pose a risk to the rover, trap it or even lead to them overturning. Current rovers on Mars are very slow. Curiosity, for example, moves at just 0.08mph (0.13km/h). 'We are looking at the next critical mission, which will be Mars Sample Return,' said Dr Elie Allouis, a robotics systems engineer at Airbus Defence and Space who has been helping to develop the scout rover . The scout (shown) would trundle ahead of the main rover to assess its route across the red planet for soft sand and hidden rocks that have damaged and even killed off previous rovers. Using a range of laser scanners and soil analysers, the scout is able to tell the main rover that its path is safe . In May 2009 Spirit became bogged down in deep sand, which eventually led to it breaking down completely at the end of its six year mission. The Mars Sample Return mission, which is scheduled for launch sometime before 2022, will use a rover to gather soil samples from several sites and then launch them from the Martian surface in a rocket back to Earth so they can be analysed by scientists. Under plans being drawn up by scientists from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, the University of Surrey and Airbus, this rover will also carry a smaller scout rover to assess the ground ahead. They have been testing the rover at Airbus's Mars Yard, in Stevenage - a warehouse that has been turned into a replica of the Martian surface. Equipped with a laser scanner, the scout works with the main navigation system on board the main rover to build up a picture of the surrounding landscape before plotting a route. The front wheels of the scout rover are shaped like a star to help it overcome obstacles and difficult terrain while its rear wheels are ridged with teeth to provide extra grip. Each front wheel has several 'feet' on the end of each star point to help provide information about the soil while cameras on the belly of scout also how firm the ground is. The European Space Agency intends to launch its own rover, ExoMars, in 2018 by the earliest and it will likely face the same speed issue problems as Nasa's various Mars rovers . Ground penetrating radar carried on the back of the scout can also help to spot hidden rocks and hollows. Dr William Lewinger, who is part of the team developing the soil sensors on the scout at the University of Surrey, said: 'The problem on Mars is that there is a thin crust on top of the surface, so with cameras it all looks the same and you can't see that there is nasty soft bits underneath. 'By having penetrating sensors we can look below the surface. The small rover can drive in places well beyond the main rover. 'So we have a rover, which is highly mobile and agile, that can go forward to test out the sand first. If it is okay, then the main rover can move. 'If it is not ok then Bridget [the nickname of the Exomars rover] plans a new path and sends the scout on that path to check that out first.'","British engineers are testing a new intelligent scout robot called Faster .

"A man who found a phone in a lake was amazed to discover it still worked - despite spending a quarter of a year submerged. Roger Nilsson contacted the Facebook page of Nokia Sweden to tell them about how he found his Lumia 800 - lost three months ago - wedged between two rocks in the lake. Intrigued, he took the phone, which was encrusted with mud, shells and other waste, back to his home and cleaned it up, took it apart and left it to dry on his radiator. Tough: This Nokia smartphone was found in a lake by Swede Roger Nilsson. Despite three months in the water, it still works . When he reassembled it he was stunned to discover it was able to make calls and even the camera still worked. The battery too had lost none of its potency, lasting two days from a full charge, reports the Times of India. What makes the discovery even more incredible is the phone is not designed to be any more water resistant than any other smartphone on the market. Even phones marketed as water-resistant are only rated to survive under water for a maximum of 30 minutes, let alone more than three months. Drowned: The Nokia Lumia 800 smartphone is not even designed to be water-resistant . He posted: '(I) took it home and started to clean as best I could, shells and muck on display, green goo around the entire phone and some other stuff.

"Bulletproof vests have offered protection for people's bodies for years, but they're of little use if an assailant aims at the wearer's head. While bulletproof helmets are typically heavy, conspicuous and expensive. Now, one designer claims to have found a solution. He has created a lightweight, 'stylish' baseball cap that can  repel a range of ammunition. Scroll down for video demonstration . A Michigan-based company has designed a bulletproof baseball cap (shown). Called BulletSafe its hard panel makes the cap bulletproof against all handguns up to a .45ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol). However, the protective panel is only located in the front of the cap, meaning the sides and the back are not protected . However, the protective panel is only located in the front of the cap, meaning the sides and the back of the head are not protected. The hard panel makes the cap bulletproof against all handguns up to a .45ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol). It is inserted behind the front third of the baseball cap, fits close to the wearer's forehead and is made of high-strength material usually used in ballistic plates to stop rifle fire. The cap's inventor, Tom Nardone from Birmingham, Michigan described it as 'a much friendlier form of protection than a helmet'. The 44-year-old said: 'In this case, the panel will be thinner than rifle plates and will be used to stop handgun rounds, which typically have about a quarter of the ballistic energy of a rifle round. 'When it is shot with a handgun it will stop the bullet with very little deformation. This will spread the energy of the bullet over the area of your forehead. 'A powerful handgun like a .45ACP has about twice the energy as a hockey shot, so being shot in the head wearing this hat will hurt as much as being hit in your hockey helmet by two hockey snapshots at once. 'It will hurt, but the difference between that and being shot in the head is immense.' The cap's inventor  described it as 'a much friendlier form of protection than a helmet'. A test of a prototype product is shown. The idea to create the bulletproof cap came about when Tom Nardone's company, BulletSafe Bulletproof Vests, was asked if it was going to introduce a line of ballistic helmets . While the cap  protects wearers at the front, the sides and back don't contain bulletproof panels so provide no protection. However, the inventor said the cap is 'a much friendlier form of protection than a helmet'. The exact distance at which the cap can repel a bullet has not been revealed . The idea to create the bulletproof cap came about when Mr Nardone's company, BulletSafe Bulletproof Vests, was asked if it was going to introduce a line of ballistic helmets. 'The plate material is not new, it is being used in rifle plates today, but that side of the project required some calculation,' continued Mr Nardone. The hard panel makes the cap bulletproof against all handguns up to a .45ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol). It is inserted behind the front third of the baseball cap, fits close to the wearer's forehead and is made of high-strength material usually used in ballistic plates to stop rifle fire. 'The amount of energy in a handgun round is high, but not as high as some people seem to believe,' the company wrote on its Kickstarter page. 'A .45ACP has about 450 Joules of energy. A hockey snapshot has about 240. 'So the amount of impact you would feel is on the order of twice the impact of being hit in the helmet with a hockey puck. 'Is that enough to give you a concussion? 'It is certainly in that range, but a concussion would be a welcome outcome when compared to the damage a bullet would do to the same area without protection.' 'We built a firing prototype from some existing materials and tested it to make sure the concept worked and that a panel of our size wouldn't fold or buckle. 'Then we started working on making such a panel fit in the baseball cap. We have been working on it for about 11 months.' He continued that the firm will spend the next  months building moulds and pressing the panels. They will then be tested to the current bulletproof standards before being put into production. The exact distance at which the cap can repel a bullet has not been revealed, and will depend on further development and testing. He said: 'Our vests sell mainly to security guards and I couldn't imagine walking into a bank and seeing a security guard wearing a ballistic helmet. 'It just seemed ridiculous. I could see the need for some bulletproof protection for the head, but not a helmet. 'In the US, some officers and guards wear baseball caps on duty. It is actually fairly common when they patrol outside as it keeps the sun out of their eyes. 'Most police departments try to dissuade officers from wearing sunglasses because they want them to be able to make eye contact with the public. 'Officers and guards usually wear neat looking, dark coloured hats. I decided to see what we could fit for ballistic protection inside one of those. 'The cap is meant for police officers, security guards, and anyone who wants protection without intimidation.' From left to right is a polymer mock-up of the panel, a paper pattern, and a shooting sample made from a helmet section. Mr Nardone's Kickstarter campaign for the headgear has already raised more than £4,800 ($7,500) of its initial £2,250 ($3,500) target . When bullets strike the cap (shown) they do not penetrate as far as the wearer's head, keeping them protected from shots that hit them straight on. The cap will be made publicly available near the end of 2015. A black version costs £83 ($129), but those backing the Kickstarter project can buy one for £64 ($99) Mr Nardone's Kickstarter campaign for the headgear has already raised more than £4,800 ($7,500) of its inital £2,250 ($3,500) target. A black version of the cap costs £83 ($129), but those backing the Kickstarter project are offered the hats at a discounted price of £64 ($99). Alternatively, Kickstarter backers can pay £96 ($149) for a custom hat in various colours and styles. The cap, which comes small, medium/large and extra large, is expected to be available in November this year. Mr Nardone said: 'When the caps are ready in late 2015 they will have been tested to stop most of the handguns people will see on the streets of the US. 'It will provide that level of protection over the front third of the baseball cap. The cap will save your life if you are shot in that area. 'It will be bulletproof for all handguns up to a .45 ACP. It is tested at a very short distance, but will work against further ones as well.; . However, he added that the cap won't stop a bullet from most rifles. 'The cap will be tested in an independent ballistics lab to a standard set forth by the US National Institute of Justice, who sets the standards for bulletproof vests and helmets, so everyone will be guaranteed that it works as promised.'","Michigan-based company has designed a bulletproof baseball cap .

"An immersive 3D booth could help engineers monitor the effects of earthquakes, or explore the most remote and inaccessible regions of the world. Using 12 HD screens, researchers have created the VuePod to allow users to fly over, wander through, or hover above 3D environments that are otherwise difficult to visit. And it could also be used to track the degradation of buildings and landscape over time. Engineers at Brigham Young University in Utah have created a giant virtual reality screen (shown) that allows users to view an area over a particular time period, letting them see changes in the environment otherwise invisible to the human eye.  It uses lidar (laser radar) data to track changes in a particular locale . The VR system was created by engineers at Brigham Young University in Utah, led by civil engineering professor Dan Ames. On the giant display, which measures 108ft (33 metres) across when the 12 screens are combined, images are controlled by a Wii remote that interacts with a Kinect-like Bluetooth device called SmartTrack. And 3D glasses worn by the user create dizzying added dimensions. 'This is gold,' said fellow BYU civil engineering professor Dr Kevin Franke. 'This technology has the ability to revolutionise my job as an earthquake engineer.' Earlier this week Samsung unveiled a video content app that will compliment its Gear VR virtual reality headset. Milk VR will provide free, immersive, 360° content to users and will offer sports, music and even action videos. The launch follows the release of Milk Video and Milk Music. To use Samsung's Gear VR, users slip a Note 4 tablet into the headset to create a screen. The concept was developed with Oculus, the VR firm bought by Facebook. The VuePod creates images using point data from aircraft equipped with lidar (laser-based radar). The lidar scans the landscape and records millions of data points that are then viewed as an image on the VuePod. Point data can also be created from stitched-together photographs taken by low-cost drones. One set of data currently available for study in the VuePod captured a canyon area beneath a plateau in southern Idaho. With 3D glasses and the Wii controller, a user can virtually drop down into the canyon from above, and then fly from one end to the other. By combining two sets of data for the canyon, taken five years apart, the user can then spot changes in the natural landscape that are invisible to the human eye. This same system could be used to spot the before and after effects of an earthquake. The VuePod creates images using point data from aircraft equipped with lidar (laser-based radar). It could reveal the more 'invisible' effects of natural disasters like earthquakes. Pictured is a collapsed freeway in Oakland, California after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . On the massive screen, which measures 108ft (33 metres) with the 12 screens combined, images are controlled by a Wii remote that interacts with a Kinect-like Bluetooth device called SmartTrack. 3D glasses worn by the user (shown) create dizzying added dimensions . 'Our eyes and our brains are so amazing; we need to take full advantage of them,' Dr Ames said. 'That's the value of this project: we're presenting more information for the human eyes to detect changes.' In addition to natural change detection, the VuePod has the potential to assist in infrastructure monitoring, such as tracking how highways hold up - or slough and crack - over time and seeing the effect on buildings after severe weather or earthquakes. While the VuePod is not the first immersive visualisation system, it may be one of the more cost-efficient built to date. Some systems cost as much as £6.5 million ($10 million) to build and maintain, while BYU's VuePod just barely topped the £19,000 ($30,000) mark. Dr Ames details how BYU was able to build such a powerful system for so little in a new paper published by the Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering. The Lidar scans the landscape and records millions of data points that are then viewed as an image on the VuePod (shown). Point data can also be created from stitched-together photographs taken from low-cost drones. One set of data currently available for study in the VuePod captured a canyon area . In addition to natural change detection, the VuePod has the potential to assist in infrastructure monitoring - such as tracking how highways hold up - or slough and crack - over time and seeing the effect on buildings after severe weather or earthquakes . 'Our question has been: How can we make this technology accessible?' Dr Ames said. 'We're trying to determine the threshold for getting the most function at the most affordable cost. 'Ultimately, the goal is to take an expensive tool and make it cheaper for an everyday engineering firm to use.' And although Dr Ames and his students have achieved that, they believe much more can be done. 'We want whoever reads this paper to be able to build a better system than we built,' he said.","Engineers from Utah have created a virtual reality screen called VuePod .
It uses 12 separate 55-inch HD TVs to give an immersive experience .
Using a Wii remote and 3D glasses, users can explore a particular area .
And it uses lidar (laser radar) data to track changes in these regions .
For example it can see how a canyon has changed over five years, or reveal the damage caused by earthquakes and other natural disasters .

"The top word of 2013 is '404' - the internet code for failure, commonly seen when a webpage doesn’t load. The result was announced by the Global Language Monitor  which ranks words according to their usage. Positions are based on word usage across the internet, print and online media, blogs and  social media in the English-speaking world across five continents. Number one spot: The top word of 2013 is '404' - the internet code for failure, commonly seen when a webpage doesn¿t load . Following closely behind is the word 'fail,' 'hashtag, '@pontifex' (Pope Francis’ Twitter handle), and 'optic,' the new term for 'narrative.' '404 has gained enormous attention the world over this year as systems in place since World War II, which many see as the beginning of the contemporary era, are in distress or even failure,' said Paul JJ Payack, President and Chief Word Analyst of the Global Language Monitor. Rankings: The result was announced by the Global Language Monitor which ranks words according to their usage . 'The recent ObamaCare launch debacle in . the US is only a representative example of a much wider system fail, . from the political deadlock in the US Government, to the decline of the . dollar, to the global web of intrigue and surveillance by the NSA, to . the uncertainty regarding the European Union, and the on-going . integration of China and other rising powers, such as India and Brazil . into the global economic system.' Other high-ranking words from the list indicate a focus on an especially difficult year in US politics: 'surveillance,' 'deficit,' 'filibuster,' 'deadlock,' and 'stalemate,' reported QZ. 'Toxic politics,' 'federal shutdown,' and 'global warming/climate change' are the top three phrases of the year. 404  –  The near-universal numeric code for failure on the global Internet. Fail — The single word fail, often used as a complete sentence (Fail!) to signify failure of an effort, project, or endeavor. Hashtag  – The ‘number sign' and ‘pound sign’ reborn as the all-powerful Twitter hashtag. @Pontifex — The Hashage of the ever-more popular Pope Franciscus (Francis). The Optic — The ‘optic’ is threatening to overtake ‘the narrative’ as the Narrative overtook rational discourse. Does not bode well for an informed political discussion. Surveillance — The revelation of the unprecedented extent of spying by the NSA into lives of ordinary citizens to the leaders of the closest allies of the US. Drones  – Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) that are piloted remotely or by on-board computers used for killing scores or even hundreds of those considered enemy combatants of the US. Deficit — Looks like deficit-spending will plague Western democracies for at least the next decade.  Note to economists of all stripes:  reducing the rate of increase of deficit spending still  increases the deficit. Sequestration – Middle English sequestren, from Old French, from Latin sequestrare, to hide away or isolate or to give up for safekeeping.

"Politicians make good liars because they manage to convince themselves they are telling the truth, a study has revealed. And this has also made it easier to hoodwink the public because the best liars are the ones who do not realise they are lying, said the study. From Watergate to weapons of mass destruction (WMD), world leaders have been guilty of untruths whether it is blatant lies or honest mistakes, it claims. Politicians make good liars because they convince themselves they are telling the truth, new research suggests. The researchers say examples include Bill Clinton (left) lying about his affair with Monica Lewinsky and Richard Nixon claiming innocence over the Watergate scandal which brought him down . But they may have fooled themselves into believing, for instance, that Iraq had WMD because it is what they wanted to believe, said political professor Dr Anna Galeotti. Other examples include President Bill Clinton denying his affair with Monica Lewinsky and Richard Nixon claiming his innocence over the Watergate scandal that brought him down. In each case, politicians may have been guilty of self-deception, Dr Galeotti, of the University of Eastern Piedmont, Italy, told the journal Political Studies. Everyone has their own in-built lie detector but it is easier to spot someone who is lying deliberately than someone who is lying without, perhaps, realising it, she added. Silvio Berlusconi has been found guilty of paying for sex with an under-age dancer, called Ruby. He denies the charges . Because of this, politicians not only . lie convincingly, but are still convinced they are telling the truth . even after they have proved to have lied, the report added. And it may be more common in politics that many realised. Dr Galeotti said: ‘Self-deception is a type of motivated irrationality - the art of believing something simply because it is desired to be true when evidence points to the very opposite. ‘The more convinced is a political leader, the more convincing he or she appears. ‘A charismatic leader is persuasive in proportion to his convictions and faith; a cynical, self-interested liar is more easily detected and can hardly become a charismatic leader.’ However, it may be that those who go on to become the most successful politicians are those who have most developed the ability to deceive themselves and to believe their own lies. She said: ‘In order to sustain deception over time, one needs to be very alert, clever and consistent. ‘Some evolutionary psychologists maintain that humans have evolved sophisticated abilities of lie detector in order to counter the possibility of others' deception; hence the most efficient way of deceiving others is to believe one's lies.’","It's easier for them to convince the public as they don't realise they're lying .

"Challenger: Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger is set to contest the rules, which prevent a foreign-born citizen from holding the nation's top job . Action star Arnold Schwarzenegger is lobbying for support to change the law to allow him to join the race for the White House in 2016. The former governor of California, who was born in Austria, is said to be ready to file the paperwork needed to challenge the rules, which prevents a foreign-born citizen from holding the nation's top job. However, any amendment to the Constitution must be approved by a two-thirds majority in the House and the Senate. A source told Page Six the Terminator star has been talking openly about his political ambitions while he is in New York to promote his new film with Sylvester Stallone, Escape Plan. The source said: 'Schwarzenegger has been talking openly . about working on getting the constitutional rules changed so he can run . for president in 2016. 'He is ready to file legal paperwork to challenge . the rules.' The 66-year-old, who became a US citizen in 1983, has previously declared interest in running for President, were the rules to be changed. In 2010 he appeared on the 'Tonight Show', and when asked by host Jay Leno if he would make a White House run, if the rules were altered, the star replied: 'Without any doubt.' And in 2008 he told 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley he would 'absolutely' like to be US President. 'I think that I am always a person that looks for the next big goal,' he said. 'And I love challenges. 'I always set goals that are so high, that are almost impossible to achieve. 'Because then, you're always hungry for climbing and climbing. Because it's always interesting. 'The climb is always interesting. When you get there you just have to pick another goal.' Columbia University Law School . professor Michael Dorf, an expert in constitutional law, said about the former Governor's case in 2007: 'The law is very clear, but it’s not 100 . percent clear that the courts would enforce that law rather than leave . it to the political process.' New home: Former Californian Governor Schwarzenegger aims to join the campaign trial in 2016 and make the White House, pictured, home . New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg has previously joked about forming a presidential ticket with Schwarzenegger. A few years ago he said: 'There . would be a fight to see who would be the presidential candidate and who . would be the vice presidential candidate.

"Scotland international Sean Maitland has shocked Glasgow Warriors ahead of their European Rugby Champions Cup match against Bath by announcing he will be joining London Irish next season. Maitland has spent just three years at the Scotstoun club since moving from New Zealand where he had played for the Crusaders but failed to break into the All Blacks set-up. He was immediately fast-tracked into the Scotland national team, which he qualified to play for through his grandfather, and was also picked for the British and Irish Lions at the end of his first season with Glasgow. The 26-year-old winger, who has 15 caps and has scored two tries for Scotland, said: 'I've really enjoyed my time in Glasgow and it's been great being part of the club over the last three years. Since moving to Glasgow I've been selected to play for Scotland and the British & Irish Lions, so I'm grateful to Scottish Rugby for the opportunity to come over here. Sean Maitland will leave Glasgow Warriors in the summer to join London Irish . 'I'm looking forward to my new challenge in London next season, but all my focus will be on the Warriors until then, starting with a massive game against Bath this weekend. 'Having spoken to Bob Casey and Glenn Delaney at London Irish and knowing how Tom Coventry operates as a coach, helped with my decision making. The structure off the field is exceptional and with the appointments that have been made, the Club is clearly striving to get back to the top of the European game and I'm looking forward to being involved in that process.' Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend said: 'Sean has played a big role at the club over the last three years and we wish him all the best when he leaves at the end of the season. There is still a lot of rugby to be played between now and then and I'm sure he'll want to leave the club on a high in the summer. Maitland scores a try for the British and Irish Lions during their tour of Australia in 2013 . London Irish operations Director Bob Casey said he was delighted to sign such a proven try-scorer as Maitland who will join his fellow Scotland internationalists Geoff Cross, Blair Cowan and Kieran Low at the club. Casey said: 'Sean is a British and Irish Lion back three player and proven on the International stage. He is the right age, a great character and wants to be a big part of our long term plan. He is another significant signing and further indication that we want to compete with the best in the Aviva Premiership and Europe.'","Sean Maitland will leave Glasgow Warriors in the summer .

"The largest mass extinction in the history of animal life occurred in just 60,000 years, scientists have revealed. The Permian extinction 252 million years ago wiped out more than 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of life on land - including the largest insects known to have inhabited the Earth. However, researchers admit they are still baffled by what caused it. Multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what¿s now known as the end-Permian extinction, including massive volcanic eruptions. The Permian extinction 252 million years ago, wiped out more than 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of life on land — including the largest insects known to have inhabited the Earth. The leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread, long-lasting volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps, a region of Russia whose steplike hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma. The new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps that released volatile chemicals, including carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and oceans. Multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what is known as the end-Permian extinction, including an asteroid impact, massive volcanic eruptions, or a cataclysmic cascade of environmental events. Now researchers at MIT have determined that the end-Permian extinction occurred over 60,000 years, give or take 48,000 years which they say is 'practically instantaneous, from a geologic perspective'. The new timescale is based on more precise dating techniques, and indicates that the most severe extinction in history may have happened more than 10 times faster than scientists had previously thought. 'We’ve got the extinction nailed in absolute time and duration,' says Sam Bowring, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. 'How do you kill 96 percent of everything that lived in the oceans in tens of thousands of years? It could be that an exceptional extinction requires an exceptional explanation.' In addition to establishing the extinction’s duration, Bowring, graduate student Seth Burgess, and a colleague from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology also found that, 10,000 years before the die-off, the oceans experienced a pulse of light carbon, which likely reflects a massive addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. An asteroid impact may also have caused the extinction event, researchers say . This dramatic change may have led to widespread ocean acidification and increased sea temperatures by 10 degrees Celsius or more, killing the majority of sea life. The leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread, long-lasting volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps, a region of Russia whose steplike hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma. To determine whether eruptions from the Siberian Traps triggered a massive increase in oceanic carbon dioxide, Burgess and Bowring are using similar dating techniques to establish a timescale for the Permian period’s volcanic eruptions that are estimated to have covered over five million cubic kilometers. Two nearly complete, articulated, mature specimens of the amphibian Seymouria, named the ""Tambach courting couple"", from central Germany in the Permian period . 'It is clear that whatever triggered extinction must have acted very quickly,' says Burgess, the lead author of a paper that reports the results in this week’s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 'fast enough to destabilize the biosphere before the majority of plant and animal life had time to adapt in an effort to survive.' The new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps that released volatile chemicals, including carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and oceans. With such a short extinction timeline, Bowring says it is possible that a single, catastrophic pulse of magmatic activity triggered an almost instantaneous collapse of all global ecosystems. Meganeuropsis, which lived during the Permian period, had a 72cm wingspan. It belongs to the extinct order of griffinflies (Protodonata), related to dragonflies. Meganeuropsis grew to a wingspan of at least 2.5 feet, and could have weighed upwards of a pound. The largest modern relative of Meganeuropsis is the dragonfly Megaloprepus caerulatus, which can attain a comparatively meager wingspan of 7.5 inches, or 19 cm.","The Permian extinction occurred 252 million years ago .

"Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was today indicted on 30 counts, including 17 that carry the death penalty, by a federal grand jury for the horrific April 15 attack. The 19-year-old is charged with killing four people - three who died in the two bomb blasts and an MIT police officer who was shot dead three days later - and 'maiming, burning and wounding scores of others', U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon. Other charges include using a weapon of mass destruction, carjacking, engaging in a fierce shootout with police and causing serious injuries to a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer. The indictment also revealed a chilling confession Tsarnaev allegedly wrote inside a boat where he was found hiding four days after the bombings, reading: 'I don't like killing innocent people.' But in the message, he justified his actions by adding: 'The US Government is killing our innocent civilians. I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body, you hurt one, you hurt us all. Stop killing our innocent people, we will stop.' Scroll down for video . Indictment: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, (left) has been . indicted on 30 counts after allegedly carrying out the Boston bombings with his brother Tamerlan (right), who later died following a shootout with police . Found: Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat parked in a yard in Watertown. Inside, he wrote that he 'didn't like killing innocent people' but explained it was revenge for the U.S. killing Muslims . Three people were killed and more than . 260 injured near the finish line of the marathon on April 15 when . Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan allegedly detonated two . home-made devices. The 56-page . indictment alleges that the brothers started preparing for the attack . more than two months before, purchasing weapons, explosives and visiting . shooting ranges. The . court documents suggest the internet played a central role in the . suspects' radicalization. They allege the brothers referred to websites . for jihad propaganda and bomb-making instructions. The . indictment claimed that Tsarnaev had downloaded material from extremist . jihad sites including Defense of the Muslim Lands, the First Obligation . After Imam, by Abdullah Azzam, who is also known as 'the Father of . Global Jihad'. 'This . publication advocates violence designed to terrorize the perceived . enemies of Islam, among other things,' the indictment said. Authorities . said the brothers made shrapnel-packed pressure cooker bombs to inflict . maximum devastation and put them in knapsacks near the finish line.

Devastation: Medical workers rush to help the injured at the finish line of the Boston Marathon after two pressure cooker bombs were detonated near the finish line on April 15 . The bombs went off within seconds of . one another, killing three people: Restaurant manager Krystle Marie . Campbell, 29; a Boston University graduate student from China, Lu . Lingzi, 23; and an eight-year-old boy, Martin William Richard. Hundreds more were wounded and many had to have limbs amputated. After images of the Tsarnaev brothers were released two days later by law enforcement, the brothers killed MIT officer Sean Collier and attempted to steal his service weapon, according to the indictment. At . the time, they were already armed with five improvised explosive . devices, a Ruger P95 semi-automatic pistol, ammunition, a machete, and a . hunting knife, according to the indictment. They . also allegedly carjacked a man, identified in the papers as 'D.M.', and . forced him to take out $800 from an ATM to give them. The man managed . to escape and call 911. Victims: Eight-year-old Martin Richard and restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, were killed by the bombs . Loss: Lu Lingzi, 23, (left) also died when the bombs detonated by the finish line of the marathon, while MIT officer Sean Collier, 26, (right) was allegedly shot dead by the brothers three days after the bombings . A shootout in a quiet Watertown neighborhood ensued and Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, was killed following the gunfire. The indictment alleges that the younger brother contributed to the death when he drove over Tamerlan while . escaping police officers during the shootout. It claims a police . officer was trying to drag Tamerlan to safety when he was hit by the . car. The indictment also notes that Tsarnaev . caused 'serious bodily injury' to Massachusetts Bay Transportation . Authority officer Richard Donohue in the course of his escape. Dzhokhar was arrested after he was found hiding in a boat parked in a backyard later that day. He . was injured during a shoot out with officers and was taken to hospital . with a gunshot wound to the throat. He has been held in a Massachusetts . prison hospital since. Seeking justice: U.S. Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz announces the indictment against Tsarnaev on Thursday . Staying strong: A makeshift memorial was set up for victims of the bombings near the marathon finish line . The . Tsarnaev brothers had roots in the turbulent Russian regions of . Dagestan and Chechnya, which have become recruiting grounds for Islamic . extremists. They had been living in the United States for about a decade . and it is believed they had been inspired by Al Qaeda publications. The U.S. attorney's office says 17 of the charges against 19-year-old Tsarnaev could bring life in prison or the death penalty. 'I have met several of those that were injured on April 15, as well as members of the deceased's families,' Ortiz said at the press conference on Thursday.

"Martin Keown believes his old side Arsenal have always been liable to a suckerpunch during big games, but the former England international was hugely encouraged by the recent victory against Manchester City. Arsenal produced an impressive away performance at the Etihad earlier this month as goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud earned a rare victory on the road against one of the Premier League's big teams. Arsene Wenger's side delivered an effective defensive display against the champions, the likes of which Arsenal fans haven't seen in recent years. Olivier Giroud celebrates after scoring his side's second goal against Manchester City this month . Santi Cazorla gave Arsenal the lead in the first half from the penalty spot . And Keown, who likened his former team to a boxer that was susceptible to a knockout, was full of praise for the way the Gunners midfield protected a defence that has looked vulnerable all to often. 'Sometimes Arsenal can be like a boxer. Yes they throw punches but it might not be long before they’re dropped to the canvas.

The injuries continue to mount for England ahead of the Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff on February 6 and Lancaster admitted he does not yet know how long his absentees will remain sidelined. Christian Day had originally beeb selected for England Saxons to face Ireland on Friday . He said: 'The players will be fully assessed once they get into camp this evening and it's too early to give any definitive news on their status. 'Tom's ankle and Owen's knee has been scanned. Owen will see a specialist this evening and we will be able to provide an update on him and the other injured players tomorrow, along with any other potential additions to the squad.' Croft and Day have been originally called up to the England Saxons squad for Friday's game against Ireland Wolfhounds in Cork. Their Saxons places will be filled by Wasps lock James Gaskell and Bath back-row forward Carl Fearns. England coach, Stuart Lancaster faces an anxious wait to discover extent of the players' injuries . Croft made his England debut against France during the 2008 Six Nations campaign and has 38 caps to date. The 29-year-old was an IRB player of the year nominee in 2009 and was part of the British and Irish Lions squad that toured Australia in 2013. Day, 31, has represented England at Under-19 and Under-21 level and joined Northampton from Stade Francais in 2008.","England medical team assessing injuries to Geoff Parling and Tom Wood .

"Barcelona are set to review their commercial sponsorship relationship with Qatar after the worsening 'social and political' situation in the Gulf State. The Catalans signed a lucrative  deal worth around £123.4m with Qatar Sports Investments in 2010, which expires next year with president Josep Maria Bartomeu confirming the club are considering their future kit sponsorship options. Speaking to RAC1, Bartomeu admitted that a change in the 'social and political' situation in Qatar has caused the club to reconsider.

"Fifteen-year-old Zainab Haider should be sitting her end-of-term exams today. She once dreamed of becoming a doctor. Now, as she stares listlessly from her hospital bed, that dream seems impossible. Zainab’s tragedy is that her family home is in northern Iraq, close to the Syrian border. Their city, Tal Afar, was over-run by militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria – ISIS – last week. Beside vigil: Mohamed looks after his daughter Zainab, 15,  who lost both her legs in a bomb attack . In a rocket attack on the house where she was sleeping with her parents and five siblings, Zainab suffered crushing injuries to her legs, and was hit by shrapnel. On Wednesday, she had both legs amputated. Her ten-year-old sister, Fadak, was killed, while her mother Amsha also lost both legs. Her 18-year-old brother Haider is in shock and has not spoken since the attack. In the cluttered orthopaedic ward at Baghdad’s Al-Yarmouk Hospital, where the family were flown because of the severity of their injuries, Zainab’s father Mohamed reveals how he woke his six children and brother’s family at 2.30am last Monday after hearing shelling in his neighbourhood. ‘We are Shia Turkmen and we’ve lived in peace here all our lives,’  he said. ‘Suddenly there were two days of complete war and we had no way to escape from it. ‘I knew I had to do something, to move us all somewhere. I knew about the jihadist criminals and their cruelty. I knew they’d boasted of beheading people and capturing soldiers and executing them. I was in a panic, very afraid. All I knew is we could not stay to be slaughtered. Escaped: A number of children were forced to flee Tal Afar after it was seized by ISIS militants. But the Haider family fear many other civilians have been killed . ‘But when I brought us all into the courtyard, a rocket came in, hitting us all and demolishing my house. ‘My little daughter Fadak died in my arms. All around me, my wife and children were screaming.’ He added: ‘Nothing will ever be the same. ‘We have lost a child, our home and suffered injuries which will last a lifetime. I don’t know what we’re going to do. We want the world to help us stop the fighting.’ The Haider family believes many other civilians have been attacked in Tal Afar. Some 60 Turkmen prisoners in the city jail are said to have been slaughtered, while the UN has reported 150,000 people fleeing to other towns as refugees. Aydm Beyath, Secretary-General of the Federation of Turkmeneli Associations, which represents  the ethnic group, has called on Turkmen to take up arms against ISIS. If Mohamed Haider had remained in Tal Afar, he may have considered that call. But here in a strange city far from home, he can only hope for aid to rescue him and his family.","Zainab Haider had both legs amputated after attack close to Syrian border .

"Flowers will no longer be airlifted to loved ones after the Federal Aviation Administration began cracking down on commercial drone use. The FAA told FlowerDeliveryExpress.com that drone use is only permitted on a case-by-case basis and that any drone use must be pre-authorized. Regardless, one drone delivery did successfully occur on February 8. 2014 in Detroit. Scroll down for video . If allowed, the flower company would encourage customers to call the office and place an order for delivery . An employee would then take down the client's coordinates for delivery . The company's CEO, Wesley Berry, said that the FAA may have told them to quit using to use commercial drones but that they asked the company to 'quit it' in a polite and professional way. 'Cupid’s wings have been clipped,' said Wesley Berry to CBS. He added, 'The FAA was extremely professional and polite,' he said. 'I couldn’t have been chastised in a nicer way.' The FAA said that drone deliveries need to be closely monitored to insure safety should something happen to occur. The company uses traditional methods of delivery to customers all over the United States year round but planned to deliver free bouquets of roses to a beta test group of customers on Valentines Day. Workers would then prepare bouquets to be shipped off for delivery by drone or other method . An employee would then prepare the drone for its airborne journey . The FAA did not say when they would devise regulations for drone delivery but did say that there is a plan underway. Berry employes other methods of rapid delivery such as using trucks with pre-made bouqets that travel around for speedy delivery. In order to test more types of delivery methods, the website has launched a consumer beta test program to experiment with other types of delivery. Customers can sign up on line. Earlier this year, a beer company called Lakemaid successfully attempted to use drones for delivery to ice fisherman but they were ultimately barred by the FAA as well. Drone use will not be permitted unless they are strictly regulated. The drone would lift up over the company parking lot . It would fly high over the road and the trees . It would zero in on a client's instructed coordinates . It would then land right on a person's doorstep for them to open and enjoy .","FlowerDeliveryExpress.com attempted to send roses by air drone on Valentines Day but the FAA disallowed it .

"If you appear in Coronation Street, sooner or later you take a trip to the Lake District. For some characters, the plot decrees that it is the final journey from which there can be no return - as they are written out. About the only other place that exists for the people of Weatherfield is Blackpool - and there have been spectacular fatalities there too! Happily, when I made my exit from the Street, I was shown heading to Milan rather than up the M6. So the door may still be open for me to go back. Scroll down for video . Spirit-lifting: Waterhead Bay on Lake Windermere in Ambleside . Given the tumultuous Corrie connections with the Lakes, I could have been feeling nervous at the prospect of a short break in Ambleside. But on the contrary, the prospect of a trip to the highly rated Best Western Ambleside Salutation lifted my spirits. My partner Adam and I had been to the Lake District before, to visit Grasmere. We liked it so much that this time we decided to explore further south, into Ambleside, and we had a fabulous time. Recharging their batteries: Tina with her partner Adam Crofts and, right, the hotel's pool . The weather wasn't terribly brilliant. In fact, it was as bad as it can be in the Lakes, with the rain coming down in stair rods, so we spent most of our time warm and snug at the hotel. We spent a morning in the beautiful spa attached to the hotel. I had a head massage and Adam had a sport massage. Indulging ourselves like this was just what we needed to recharge our batteries as the day before our trip we'd moved house. Highly rated: Tina's stay at the Best Western Ambleside Salutation lifted her spirits . Getting back to nature: Ambleside is the perfect place for fell walking - if the weather holds out . I began to think it was lucky that it rained. If it had been sunny, we'd have felt the need to do a bit of Wainwright and climb a couple of fells. Instead we just relaxed… and ate. There is a great restaurant at the Salutation and you can also dine well in the bar. I can especially recommend the afternoon tea, during which we had more scones, clotted cream and jam than was probably good for us. The rooms at the hotel are great. We were lucky enough to have one with a balcony deck area that overlooked Ambleside. From the balcony we could see all the beautiful countryside and hills and mountains. Pregnant pause: The former Coronation Street actress is expecting a baby with her partner Adam . An added bonus was the hot tub on our balcony. We were able to sit in there and watch the sun go down. Actually, given the weather, it was more like watching the light disappearing, but it was lovely nonetheless. The Lake District may be a place where bad things happen to Coronation Street characters but I can definitely say that for me and Adam, it was all glorious. But then that's the difference between soap operas and real life. In soap operas you can usually rely on an unhappy ending...

'When I finally laid down to make the snow angel for the question mark, I could barely even move,' he said. 'I didn't have thick enough socks on and I was in an incredible amount of pain, but all I was thinking about was our relationship and I wasn't going to stop until it was finished.'

When Maschmeier saw what he'd done she started crying, Morrick told the newspaper. 'I just always want to surprise her. I want to be out of the ordinary, do something that she'll never forget, and do something that money can't pay for, most importantly,' he said. 'She's my angel sent from above.'

In fact, he said he was about to fall asleep when he 'randomly got up, got dressed and went outside.' 'I had zero preparation. I had no thought of how long it was going to take or how I was going to do it,' he said. But he was certainly thrilled with how it turned out.

"As I took a vaporetto from Venice Marco Polo airport, I was stunned to see a huge grey submarine emerging from the lagoon. When the two vessels drew closer, I saw the unmistakable figure of Denzel Washington on board, waving frantically at me, surrounded by Italian naval officers. Momentarily, I thought I might have to rescue Denzel from his captors - then realised it was a stunt to promote his film Crimson Tide, a thriller set on a submarine. Stars: George Clooney, Sandra Bullock and Jack Nicholson have all made recent appearances at the festival . It was 1995, and I was on my first visit to the Venice Film Festival, held annually at the end of August on the sybaritic island of the Lido, with the lagoon on one side and the lapping waters of the Adriatic on the other. The film festival is the oldest, and arguably the most glamorous, in the world. It celebrated its 70th edition last year. Remarkably, it makes little attempt to promote itself to the hordes of tourists who descend on Venice each summer. At the airport and on the mainland, in the vicinity of St Mark's Square and as far as the Rialto Bridge, there are no posters for the festival and absolutely nothing to indicate that some of the planet's biggest movie stars are in town. It is as if the city fathers have taken a vow of omerta, to allow the Italian cognoscenti to enjoy the pleasures of the festival to the exclusion of sweaty foreigners. Boats and beauty: The Venice Film Festival coincides with the colourful pageantry of the city's Regatta Storica . Yet, unlike the Cannes Film Festival, where it is virtually impossible for ordinary mortals to attend the red--carpet screenings, anyone can buy tickets to the premieres and galas at Venice. They go on sale at the ticket booth on the Lido (easily accessible by water-bus from the mainland). I have rarely seen queues, as the booth is hidden away in the leafy shadows of the Casino building. At Venice the actors walk the red carpet, sign autographs and take photos with the fans. So even if you fail to get a ticket, a selfie with a movie star is a fair consolation prize. Last year, the festival opened with the world premiere of sci-fi thriller Gravity. Stars cannot arrive by limo at the Lido. Instead George Clooney arrived by water-taxi, accompanied by his co-star Sandra Bullock and director Alfonso Cuaron. At the press conference, when asked how he prepared for the role of an astronaut, he joked: 'Sandy and I did a lot of Bikram yoga together.' Afterwards, the gala dinner was in the magnificent setting of the sea-front Excelsior Hotel, in two large marquees on the beach. This hotel - a favourite of Quentin Tarantino when he served as jury president, the head of the panel judging the films - is the main hub of the festival, and the terrace is a wonderful place to enjoy a sundowner. Light and shade: George Clooney (left; second left in shot, white shirt) arrives in Venice by water-taxi during the 2013 festival; Julie Christie (right), experiencing a darker side of Venice - as the setting for Don't Look Now . Many of the stars choose to stay in the more secluded Cipriani Hotel, located in the verdant Giudecca island. Set primarily in a 15th century pastel-coloured building, it was opened in 1958 by Giuseppe Cipriani. The story goes that Giuseppe was inspired by the light of the late evening sun setting on the lagoon to create a cocktail that captured the colour of the sunset. And so the bellini was born, with its mixture of prosecco and peach puree. No visitor to the hotel would dream of ordering anything else in Harry's Bar, named after Giuseppe's son. Like the Excelsior, the Cipriani Hotel has its own private moorings, free water-boat shuttle service and a lovely restaurant, Cips, which faces the Grand Canal. It also has an Olympic-size pool and delightful gardens. The notorious Venetian lover Giacomo Casanova is said to have enjoyed many trysts there. It was here in this same garden, as the evening sunshine rippled through the trees, that I attended a dinner for that modern-day lothario, Jack Nicholson. He was starring in the Sean Penn-directed movie The Crossing Guard. Penn, producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Spike Lee and The Exorcist director William Friedkin were guests, and it was a relaxed affair, with Nicholson wearing his trademark shades through-out dinner. Towards the end of the evening our host, an Italian media mogul, got up to toast Nicholson. Big names: Angelina Jolie puts in an appearance at the 2004 festival; Denzel Washington has also attended . But he was so tipsy that he stumbled, barely managing to stay upright. As he stared blankly at Nicholson, it was clear he had momentarily forgotten Jack's name, so - flashing that famous grin - the actor came to his rescue by shouting: 'Jack!' Every-one burst out laughing, and the media man looked relieved to have escaped a 'Here's Johnny!' scene. British films were well represented last year with the world premiere of Philomena, attended by Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. They stayed at the 14th century palace in the gilded splendour of the Hotel Danieli (which also incorporates a 19th and 20th Century palace) a few gondola-lengths from the Bridge of Sighs. It is a hotel steeped in celluloid heritage, with Moonraker, Casino Royale and The Tourist, which starred Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp, being filmed there. The Restaurant Terrazza Danieli, with its breathtaking views of the lagoon, is probably the most popular spot in Venice for marriage proposals. Last year, the hotel terrace played host to a lavish party thrown in honour of that year's jury president, Bernardo Bertolucci, the Oscar-winning director of The Last Emperor. The theme was Bertolucci's greatest hits so, showing a strange sense of humour, the hotel's chef had arranged for the butter to be sculpted in homage to Marlon Brando's famous sex scene in Last Tango In Paris. One enormous film set: Daniel Craig and Eva Green (right of shot) filmed the climax of Casino Royale in Venice . If cinema does not float your boat, the festival coincides with two spectacular events - the Regatta Storica and the unmissable arts and architecture extravaganza, the Biennale. Venice has hosted the Regatta Storica, the historic ceremonial pageant and gondola race down the Grand Canal, since 1315. On the first Sunday of September, thousands congregate to catch a glimpse of the beautiful boats and the brightly coloured participants who compete in traditional Venetian costumes for hotly contested prizes of pennants and the title King Of The Oar. Little has changed since Canaletto painted the scene in 1740 - apart from pollution. Pity any gondolier who falls into the water. When filming David Lean's Summertime, Katharine Hepburn had to fall into the canal backwards. She suffered a chronic eye infection for the rest of her life which she blamed on the Venetian waters. One of the best places to watch all the regatta action is the terrace of the Hotel Bauer Palazzo, where Madonna threw her party to celebrate the premiere of her film about Wallis Simpson, W.E. Above the terrace, the love scenes from the iconic Venetian thriller Don't Look Now, starring Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, were shot. Worth exploring is the 13th century church of San Nicolo dei Mendicoli (St Nicholas of the Beggars), which Sutherland's character is restoring in the film. Stars of a different kind: Characters from the big hit Despicable Me pose in a water taxi at the Excelsior Hotel . It is situated in the tranquil quarter of Dorsoduro - and its shady courtyard, overlooking a little canal, provides a welcome respite from the tourists and the scorching sun. The success of the movie helped the church raise the funds necessary to restore it. A popular restaurant with festival-goers is Locanda Cipriani on the romantic island of Torcello, the first Venetian island to be inhabited, and still blissfully peaceful, with sheep often wandering around its pretty town square. The island features in Betrayal, Harold Pinter's play about marital infidelity (inspired by his own real-life affair with Joan Bakewell). The restaurant garden is the scene of many marriage proposals - but if the big question fails to materialise over a meal there, in the nearby cathedral courtyard is a stone throne, supposedly built by Atilla the Hun. Legend has it that whoever sits on it will be married within a year. Casanova would have run a mile. This year's festival opens on August 27 with the world premiere of Birdman, starring Michael Keaton and Naomi Watts. In this era of perpetual change, there is something life-affirming about the old-world glamour of the Venice Film Festival. With its selection of cinema from all over the world, it is following in the best traditions of Venice's favourite son, the renowned adventurer Marco Polo. If he were alive today, it is surely a festival he would want to explore. Frank Mannion is a film producer whose movie The Quispe Girls won Best Cinematography at Venice 2013.

"I've been lucky enough to have travelled quite a lot in the Caribbean, thanks to stints as a reporter for various TV holiday shows, including Wish You Were Here...? and Rough Guide. On one of my first reporting trips, I flew to Mustique and sailed through the islands on an 80ft monohull boat. There's something magical about the Caribbean: being in a boat, pootling around and getting from one island to the next gives you a real sense of adventure. In peak condition: Julia finds her feet during a stay at the sophisticated Ladera resort in St Lucia . But now that I have a baby son, Zephyr, my adventuring days are over for a while. And for my latest holiday I was looking for relaxation. So in St Lucia, we stayed first at the Cap Maison Hotel, a lovely resort with a very friendly atmosphere. Its great facilities made it perfect for a family break. Just glorious: Ladera sits on the south-west shore of St Lucia, within sight of the famous pitons . Then we visited the Ladera Hotel, which is situated in a World Heritage Site overlooking the island's famous peaks, the Pitons. Some of the Ladera's rooms are completely open to the elements. You can feel the wind moving through the rooms in the evening. Simply sensational: The second part of Julia's holiday took her to the remote enclave of Scrub Island . You sleep in a very comfortable four-poster with a mosquito net - it's impossibly glamorous camping. And in the morning, you wake up to that extraordinary view. After St Lucia we headed to Scrub Island, a new private island resort a mile off Tortola, the largest of the British Virgin Islands. It is stunning. One of our highlights was a day-trip sail to Cooper Island, an eco-resort famous for its scuba-diving. A home from home: Julia found high luxury on Scrub Island - perfect for her first holiday with Zephyr . It brought home to me just what variety you can enjoy in the Caribbean. On St Lucia, there is so much to do. If you want to hike, you can hike up the volcanoes; if you want watersports, you can enjoy all sorts. A week on Scrub Island, however, is all about staying put and enjoying the quiet. It was just wonderful being surrounded by that beautiful sea and taking in those views. I'd become convinced in recent years that the Indian Ocean is the smart place to go these days. I'd forgotten the unique charm of the Caribbean experience.

"An amateur photographer on holiday in Argentina captured this breathtaking picture of the moment an enormous ice bridge ruptured and plunged into a lake below. Christian Grosso was visiting the Perito Moreno Glacier in Argentina's Patagonia region and had his camera trained on the ice bridge at the opportune moment. Another holidaymaker had a camcorder to capture a video of the dramatic collapse. Collapse: Christian Grosso captured this breathtaking image of an ice bridge collapsing at the southern tip of the Perito Moreno glacier in Patagonia, Argentina, last month . Splash: The collapse sent a huge wave surging through the waters of Lake Argentino, which the bridge spanned . The dramatic collapse sends thousands of tons of ice plummeting into the waters, sending a massive wave surging through the lake below. At nearly 20 miles long, the Perito Moreno is one of the largest in Patagonia, a region at South America's chilly southern tip. Extending down from the Southern Patagonian Icefield, high in the Andes, the glacier's tip periodically cuts off Lake Argentino's major southern arm, which is known as Brazo Rico, according to Nasa's Earth Observatory. This tip slices right across a narrow section of the lake, meeting the opposite shoreline to form a natural dam which prevents lake water circulating from one side to the other. Nasa scientist Jim Foster told OurAmazingPlanet: 'This glacier is somewhat unique in that its path takes it across an arm of a large lake. 'Most glaciers don't have such trajectories, so bridging and tunnelling, at least at this scale, is rather rare.' This is how the icy span looked moments before the collapse: The tip of the glacier periodically grows to dam the waters of Lake Argentino, until huge pressures blow it in a cataclysmic display of natural power . Dr Foster curates the Earth Science . Picture of the Day, which featured Mr Grosso's photo, taken on January . 19, at the height of the southern hemisphere's summer. The . photographer told the site: 'I was one of perhaps 20 privileged people . in Los Glaciares National Park this midsummer day to witness the . spectacle.' But the rupture, . although dramatic, was just relatively minor compared to how big they . can become. Because of the natural ice dam, meltwater raises Brazo Rico . by as much as 30m above the level of the water in Lago Argentino. Natural dam: The Perito Moreno Glacier extends from the Southern Patagonia Icefield high in the Andes into the waters of Lake Argentino where every few years it grows to cut one portion of the lake from the rest . Every four or five years, the immense pressure created by these unequal water levels smashes through the ice tongue in a cataclysmic display of the power of nature. The last time this happened was in March last year. The latest burst, as pictured by Mr Grosso, was a result of the collapse of the ice bridge lest over from that burst, which had hollowed out an enormous hole beneath it. The repeated ruptures have made the glacier and lake a major tourist attraction in the region, Nasa said.","Dramatic collapse seen by tourists at Argentina's Perito Moreno Glacier .

"Holborn is well and truly on the London map. The Hoxton Group has opened its second hotel there – a definite seal of approval, as their other London offering is in fashionable Hoxton, seconds from Hoxton Square and the White Cube Gallery. The new property sits in a Grade II-listed building - at 199-206 High Holborn - which was once occupied by BT. How times change. It is seconds from Holborn Tube station, and five minutes from another lovely accommodation newcomer to the area, the Rosewood, which launched last October. New boy in town: The Hoxton, Holborn is the second London hotel opened by the chic accommodation brand . Heart of the matter: The new hotel brings a dash of east London style to the centre of the British capital . If you are making a weekend of it, there is plenty to see in the area – the Sir John Soane's museum, which is piled high with ancient archaeological artefacts; the elegant enclave of Lincoln’s Inn, where barristers toil day and night; the little boutique stores of Lamb's Conduit Street. The theatre district is also nearby, so it is perhaps unsurprising that hotel has an arty edge. It will be hosting events with a cultural theme, including a reading by Kate Mosse of her new novel The Taxidermist’s Daughter. The entrance is an open-plan space, with a welcoming bar area and a cluster of squashy sofas. Upstairs, the ambience is a little more industrial, with steel-grey painted corridors and moody lighting. Antique telephones, school desks and anatomical sculptures of human heads are also dotted about. Come in, take a seat, grab a drink: The hotel's reception area has a warm, welcoming vibe . A little brush-up: Guests can enjoy a spot of pampering at the hotel's funky nail bar . The rooms are modest but refined. There are 174 of them, and they come in four categories – Shoebox, Snug, Comfy and Roomy. Mine is Snug in every sense. But with prices from £119 (or from just £69 for the Shoebox) - astonishing for central London – you can’t really complain. The hotel is recommended for solo travellers, and I can see why. There are no wardrobes, and you would be hard pushed to store a suitcase. However, my room is cleverly designed, with a corner shower tiled in black Deco-style, an enormous circular mirror and a fold-out desk with a kettle, plus a matte black Roberts Radio. I also like the contemporary Toile du Jouy wallpaper. And when I open the beside-table-slash-mini-bar, I find that rarest of hotel extras, fresh milk. Hurrah! You'll fit right in: The hotel boasts four sizes of room - in this case, Cosy (pretty accurately named, all told) The bed is supremely comfy, and even on a murky morning, the view - which stretches all the way to the London Eye - is uplifting. I wander down for breakfast in the Hubbard and Bell restaurant - where the crowd could be described as 'normcore'. The waiters and waitresses are dressed in matching blue shirts, navy trousers and black trainers. People are working at laptops; many are sipping at 'cold-pressed' juices. The menu is described as 'Brooklyn style', and features spelt pancakes, avocado on toast and (somewhat incongruously) a Full English. Milk is in miniature glass bottles, and the coffee will put a spring in your step. If you want to simply get up and go, the hotel will provide a takeaway breakfast of granola, banana and orange juice, delivered to your room in a paper bag. Handy if you are in a rush. Swinging a cat, just: Other room sizes include the Snug - where Jenny burrowed down for the night . Great location, surprising prices: The hotel's room rates are unusually low for a property in central London . There is the Hoxton Grind, too - a café next door where you can grab a coffee. This, and their Chicken Shop, located in the basement, will no doubt be popular local additions. The latter is a classier take on Nando's, with Norfolk rotisserie chicken cooked on a spit - doled out with crinkle-cut chips, butter lettuce and avocado salad, and served at wooden tables on enamel plates with lashings of spicy sauce. The service is swift and the place is buzzing. There’s no lingering here. Better to head upstairs and park yourself in the main bar for the rest of the evening.

"Hacking their way through an eerie twinkling landscape of cascading ice, these climbers dangled over some of the remotest landscapes in the world. The glacial scenes in Iceland have been sculpted over the years by fierce winds and captured in these beautiful images during an expedition by British and American adventurers. Photographer Keith Ladzinski, 37, from Colorado, travelled with 38-year-old Dawn Glanc from Ohio and British Tim Emmett, 40, as the trio were dwarfed by the huge structures with roofs as large as 15ft across. Scroll down for video . Dwarfed: Dawn Glanc, one of three ice climbers from Britain and the U.S., leads the way in a precipitous climb of the Northern Fjords, a wall of frozen water, in Iceland . Tim Emmett, pictured, said: 'The wind in Iceland is profound - it sculpts the ice like nowhere I have seen before. Huge mushroom and cauliflower-like features are sometimes so vast they form horizontal roofs 15ft across, like an ice umbrella. The only way past them was to carve a hole or teeter around hoping it didn't collapse' Frozen in time: A mixture of volcanic ash and cascades of ice, the eerily blue landscapes are so vast that they are difficult to comprehend - or even depict on camera . Precipitous: Dangling over the void, British climber Tim Emmett lowers himself slowly down the side of an Icelandic fjord in a sport which can claim climbers' lives . Mr Emmett said: 'The wind in Iceland is profound - it sculpts the ice like nowhere I have seen before. 'Huge mushroom and cauliflower-like features sometimes so vast they form horizontal roofs 15ft across, like an ice umbrella. 'The only way past them was to carve a hole through or teeter around hoping it didn't collapse. 'It was a hidden playground for frozen enthusiasts, patterned with a network of ice capillaries waiting to be climbed.' After scaling the walls of a fjord in February last year, the team headed south-east to the five mile long Sslheimajvkull glacier and dangled from its side using their ice axes. Mr Emmett added: 'We drove across the south coast past lava fields and looming cliffs. Venturing into the mist-filled darkness, I felt like we were driving across the moon.' Flowing: While some of the landscapes are spiky and jagged, others, like the Solheimajokull glacier pictured, look almost like they have been held in a liquid state . Huge: The glacier is five miles long, not far from the Atlantic ocean and popular with the tourists who visit Iceland to see the loneliest reaches of the planet . Touching the void: As Tim Emmett edges his way along a wall of ice using an axe, chilly waters flow beneath him reflecting back the strange blue glow . Nation of ice: Glaciers cover around 11 per cent of the entire surface area of Iceland, with ice caps up to a kilometre thick in the most mountainous areas . Precious landscape: Iceland is still mostly untouched by man, though its largest ice cap, Vatnajokull, shrank in size by around 5 per cent between 1958 and 2000 . The formation of the 250-metre thick glacier, five miles from the Atlantic Ocean, provided a new test for the adventurers. High winds in the region have carved huge chasms out of the ice, allowing the climbers to venture underneath it. He added: 'Climbing on this transfusion of frozen water with ash was bizarre - like no other ice climbing I had ever done.' No matter how many precautions the group take, ice climing can be a dangerous business. In February a German tourist in his 50s died after falling into an ice cave on Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier, despite venturing there with a guide. Up to 40 rescuers had to wade in dangerously cold waters up to their waists to retrieve the man, but he was later pronounced dead. Strange angle: An unusual view of Dawn Glanc climbing on Iceland's Northern Fjords during the expedition, which took place in February 2013 . Hacking his way through: Tim Emmett works to conquer the ice. He said: 'This transfusion of frozen water with ash was bizarre, like no other ice climbing I had done' Return to terra firma: Dawn Glanc after her climb, left, and scaling the high ice sculpted by fierce winds of Iceland's Northern Fjords, right .

"An epidemic of the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa is now 'out of control' with more than 60 outbreak hotspots, Doctors Without Borders has said. 'The scale of the current Ebola epidemic is unprecedented in terms of geographical distribution, people infected and deaths,' the medical charity, which is also known as Médecins Sans Frontières, said in a statement. The rapid spread of the disease, which is deadly in up to 90 per cent of cases, has overwhelmed aid agencies and health workers and terrified local communities after already killing hundreds of people. Scroll down for video . Victims: Empty hospital beds at Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia after nurses and patients fled the hospital due to a number of deaths. At least 337 people have died since the outbreak started in January . Anger: The rapid spread of the disease, which is deadly in up to 90 per cent of cases, has overwhelmed health workers in West Africa. Here dozens of people protest outside a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia . 'The epidemic is now out of control,' said Bart Janssens, MSF director of operations. 'With the appearance of new sites in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, there is a real risk of it spreading to other areas,' he added. After the first reported cases in Guinea at the start of the year, at least 337 people have died from Ebola in the three countries in 2014, according to data released last week by the World Health Organization. The incurable disease is spread by contact with bodily fluids including sweat, meaning just touching an infected person is enough to spread the virus. MSF called for a 'massive deployment' of medical resources by governments in the region to curb the epidemic. 'We have reached our limits,' Janssens said. 'We are no longer able to send teams to the new outbreak sites,' he added. Ebola can fell its victims within days, causing severe fever and muscle pain, weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea - in some cases shutting down organs and causing unstoppable bleeding. A nurse at the Redemption Hospital in Monrovia, Liberia where a health worker reportedly died of Ebola virus . This is the first time the disease has spread through the region and MSF said it had identified more than 60 separate locations with confirmed cases of the virus. 'Ebola is no longer a public health issue limited to Guinea: it is affecting the whole of West Africa,' Janssens said. One resident from the Kailahun district in Sierra Leone, who gave his name as Amara Babawo, said normal life had come to a standstill as people take pains to avoid physical contact with each other. The situation is 'very serious' in the town, added Babawo. A school headteacher in Kailahun, Momodu Momoh, said 'all social gatherings have put stopped' and said his school and others in the district had been closed as a precautionary measure.","Ebola outbreak in West Africa is now 'totally out of control', medics say .

"A strategically-placed GoPro camera captured the sweet moment that an excitable dog bounded down the ski slopes in pursuit of her owner. The video, filmed at Mt. Hood in Oregon, perfectly shows the delight and freedom Rosie experiences as she dashes after her skiing owners in a feverish frenzy. The camera, which is attached to the dog's collar, captures the playful pup taking in the views - before taking off down the slope. An adorable, excitable dog called Rosie loves to spend time on the ski slopes with her owners . Skiing enthusiast Nathan Siegal, rescued Rosie, a two-year-old Golden Retriever-Labrador cross in their hometown of Salt Lake City. Nathan, 30, said: 'Rosie has skied with us three times before this one, she absolutely loves it.' 'You can hear on the video when she descends that she is going wild with excitement.' The video of her playing with them in the snow was captured by a GoPro camera attached to her collar .

Rosie is no stranger to the slopes, as she's been to the mountain with her family three times before . And two-year-old Golden Retriever-Labrador cross 'absolutely loves it,' according to her owners (pictured) Despite her young age, Rosie is rapidly becoming a pro at beating her owners, often waiting at the bottom barking for them to hurry up. And when she isn't sprinting through the snow, the hilarious hound can be seen rolling in the powder, sending the camera into a dizzying spin. Nathan added: 'We take Rosie out as long as conditions permit.' Rosie is quick too - in fact, she often makes it to the bottom of the hill first and waits for her owners to arrive . When she isn't bounding down the hill, Rosie can be often be found rolling around in the fresh powder . Owner Nathan Siegal says that while Rosie does love the snow, he only takes her out in very safe conditions . 'When skiing in the backcountry it's critical to be aware of avalanche danger, and we would only take Rosie out with us during very safe conditions. 'One question I get a lot from non-skiing friends is, how does the dog ride the chairlift? 'But she doesn't, all of the skiing we do with the pup is human powered, skin up, ski down.'","A camera fixed to the dog's collar captured her excitement on the slopes .

"A space-age chain-mail structure stands . tall in Raval, Barcelona's rough-and-ready arts quarter. The statuesque Hotel Barcelo . Raval makes its own mark on a city skyline which boasts the Sagrada Familia, the Villa Olímpica Towers, the Arts Hotel and the Tibidabo mountain with its faded carousels. It opened in September 2008, taking up a site . on La Rambla del Raval that was once a housing estate. Fast forward six years, and this ultra-modern four-star retreat attracts a cool crowd in what is increasingly the alternative centre of the city. Striking: Interior designer Jordi Gali was the man responsible for creating the hotel's chic B-Lounge area . Renowned interior designer Jordi Galí was the man responsible for creating an interior so flash that - the receptionist says - people often wonder if they have walked into a nightclub. So it is fitting that, in the summer, when the city's music festivals Sonar and Primavera come to town, this is where all the DJs want to stay. But don't let that put you off. This is not one of those image-obsessed hotels where the dolled-up flaunt their money and their flesh (although you might gain that impression if the glamourous rooftop pool is your first port of call). The vibe is relaxed. Everyone fits in, and staff treat every guest with grace. Drinks at dusk: The panoramic terrace bar affords magnificent widescreen views of Barcelona . Modern comforts: The 182 rooms have iphone docking stations, nespresso coffee makers and fabulous views . The B-Lounge - the dramatic pink and purple reception which you encounter as you walk into the hotel - is a multifunctional space, cafe by day; cocktail and tapas bar by night. The tapas, incidentally, is glorious stuff - the very idea of small sharing plates taken to dizzy heights by beautifully sculpted (and tasty) patatas bravas and manchego lollipops. Meanwhile, inside the rooms, it is all about ergonomics. Things are so touchable. Each of the 182 rooms is like a futuristic pod, with iPhone docking stations, motorised curtains, Nespresso cofffee makers and enormous fluffy beds. A flair for design: Rooms at the hotel look as good on the inside as the view is impressive on the outside . The rooms have large, wide windows, sound-proofed doors and what the hotel calls an 'integrated bathroom' - which, simply put, means it is best if you are travelling with someone you know well. A glass panel in the shower pod leaves very little to the imagination - as my partner found out the hard way, when room service arrived unexpectedly. When you leave the hotel, you have a decision to make. One direction takes you towards a host of cafes, bars and galleries; the other leads to the . city's red light district. Unless you are interested in that kind of 'entertainment', it is advisable to double check with the hotel staff about the best way to go. Find the right path, and you will be spoiled for choice. The Raval area is at the heart of the city, five minutes . from the Barrio Gotico - where boutique shops tempt on every street. The hotel is also a short distance from the Ramblas - Barcelona's (rather tacky) main avenue - as well as the Plaza de Catalunya and Liceu metro stations, which provide access to the rest of the metropolis. Space-age: The hotel stands tall in Raval, Barcelona's rough-and-ready (but increasingly chic) arts quarter . The surrounding streets bulge with achingly cool bookshops and trinket stores. And the nearby Monroe cafe serves up delicious gazpacho in a hip post-industrial setting. The main attraction is the 360-degree view from the hotel's terrace bar - best accompanied by a cocktail or a glass of cava. The uninhibited can also fling off their outerwear for a splash in the pool. It is perhaps worth noting that, while anyone is welcome at Barcelo Raval, it is not a place for the aurally sensitive. The night air is hung with neighbourhood noises of all varieties, from revellers making merry to dogs yapping and horns beeping. But if you have been partying yourself, you will find, once your head hits pillow, that you don't notice. Double rooms at the Hotel Barcelo Raval (Rambla del Raval 17-21; 0034 9 3320 1490; www.barceloraval.com) start at €110 (£92) per room per night.

"Since The Bridge disappeared from our screens in February in a flurry of betrayal, dead bodies and elaborate plot twists, it's been a frustrating time for fans of Scandi Noir. What was in the files that Danish detective Martin Rohde saw that related to the childhood of his blunt-speaking Swedish colleague Saga Noren? Is Martin himself guilty of murder? Scandinavian suspense: Sofia Helin stars as Saga Noren in the brilliant cross-border drama The Bridge . And does the temperature ever rise above freezing in this corner of Scandinavia? The good news is that we won't have to wait too much longer to find out. Filming for a third series of the BBC4 hit is under way, so there was only one thing to do - head to the scene of the crime. The drama takes its name from the five-mile bridge across the Oresund, linking Copenhagen and Malmo. In the first series, a body is found at the point on the bridge where Denmark and Sweden meet, which is why detectives from both countries are brought together to solve the case. Our base for the night is a 1960s motel, the Scandic Segevang, just outside Malmo - it's where Martin stays when his wife kicks him out after discovering he has been unfaithful. In The Bridge, it's a symphony of misery, augmented by depressing decor, despair and Martin's haunting visions in the subterranean swimming pool. In reality, it's a clever, chic budget hotel, filled with thoughtful Scandi furniture and views of the forest. In the morning, happy families tuck into a generous breakfast buffet before heading out into the sunshine. Scene of the crime: The series is pinned to the finding of a body on the bridge that crosses the Oresund strait . By and large, there's a lot of rain, snow and sleet in The Bridge, and the drama certainly doesn't showcase the architecture of the two cities. This is mostly by design, according to scriptwriter Hans Rosenfeldt, when I track him down in Malmo. We meet in the Ribersborg, a cafe at the end of a pier which is the site of a pivotal scene in the first series when Martin realises just who might be responsible for a series of murders. Over coffee and cinnamon buns, I subject Hans to a police-style interrogation. What's happened to cuddly Martin? Will Saga, his glamorous but decidedly non-cuddly colleague, ever get a boyfriend, or even master the art of small talk? Will we be seeing more of Saga's vintage mustard-coloured Porsche and leather trousers? The next series will apparently be about responsibility and notions of family while also delving into Saga's childhood. I hoover up the dramatic crumbs as eagerly as I've been devouring the tasty cinnamon buns. Then it's time for a tour designed for Bridge obsessives. We start in Malmo, a powerhouse during medieval times, when its wealth was built on the herring trade. The gorgeous city centre includes Lilla Torg, a square filled with half-timbered houses, bars and happy Swedes celebrating the weekend in the early autumn sun. Malmo is Sweden's most multi-cultural city, a legacy of its ship-building days. A rather brighter side of Scandinavia: Copenhagen is famous for its colourful dock area Nyhavn . That industry may have dwindled away, but now it's also a showcase of cutting-edge, sustainable architecture, especially the Western Harbour. It's apparently where Saga lives (alone). Our bus takes us past some of the buildings that feature in the second series, including the site of the Malmo police station that is actually part of a hospital, and has a exterior that's dark grey/blue. 'The designer is very into this colour,' says our guide, as we head off to a street in the same muted palette. Then it's time for the highlight - a trip across the bridge itself. There's a slow incline as we head out from Malmo, and before we reach the central area we pick up a key bit of information with which we can share with less informed devotees at home: the actual border is a few hundred yards further along, and a simple sign denotes we have now reached Denmark. Once in Copenhagen, we eschew such commonplace tourist sights as the Royal Palace and colourful harbour of Nyhavn in favour of the modernist architecture of the Copenhagen police headquarters and the trendy harbourside building that serves as the home of IT entrepreneur Julian Christensen in series two. Most of The Bridge is actually filmed along the Swedish coast in Ystad. This cute town - population around 20,000 - regularly sees some of the darkest fictional deeds unfold in its streets. The real police investigate one murder a year here on average, but thanks to Henning Mankell, the creator of local detective Kurt Wallander, dozens of fictional ones have taken place in its cobbled streets. Dusting down his weariest expression: Kenneth Branagh is filming a new series of Wallander in Copenhagen . The tourist board has a handy map with blood splashes to denote the area. And the body count is set to rise alarmingly. From this month, Kenneth Branagh will be dusting down his weariest expression to film Wallander in one studio, with Saga striding around in The Bridge in the next one, while both will make regular forays into the Ystad and Malmo and nearby countryside for location shoots. The locals are pretty blasé about these incursions - many of them have acted as extras and don't bat an eye at one of the full-scale Bollywood film productions that regularly turn up here either. The Wallander industry is kept low-key, largely because Henning Mankell has refused to allow commercialism. A Ystad cafe that features as the diabetic detective's favourite tried to introduce a Wallander cake. Mankell refused, but you can find it today - a family called Wallander gave the cafe permission to name it after them. A conspiracy of sugar, cream and Scandinavian baking excellence, it would have been a crime not to experience it. Double rooms at the Scandic Segevang (www.scandichotels.com) start at £75 per night. The Bridge Tour costs around £33pp. For more information, go to www.visitskane.com/en.

"He still has the power to excite, exhilarate — and court controversy. Picasso’s long-awaited, vastly over-budget museum reopens today after five years of renovation. Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — it’s an enormous, elegant space, and Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters. The man behind the magic: Some of Pablo Picasso's finest works are found in the Paris museum of his art . I had a sneak preview. There are 5,000 pieces, illustrating the breadth of his repertoire, from early paintings to found-object sculptures, collages and shocking nudes. The collection was given to Paris in 1979 — in lieu of inheritance tax — by Picasso’s heirs. A visitor stands in front of the painting 'Woman Throwing a Stone' and the sculptures (L-R) 'Head of a Woman', 'Bust of a Woman' and 'Bust of a Woman' by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) Picasso's painting 'Gustave Coquiot' was one of 400 pieces open for viewing at the museum re-opening . Housed in the Marais’s 17th-century Hotel Sale — the former home of a salt-tax collector — the museum is an enormous, elegant space. Picasso’s work fills it to the rafters . Of his masterpieces, there are studies for Les Demoiselles D’Avignon (the finished work is in New York’s Museum of Modern Art) and a series of photos by his lover Dora Maar showing the artist working on Guernica. Bull’s Head, made from a bicycle seat, casts an eerie shadow, and Two Women Running On A Beach is sheer joy. The quietly shattering cubist rendering of the Sacre Coeur is here. I particularly like the striking portrait of Dora Maar in lurid greens, yellows and streaks of coral. A leafy place to escape: Pavillon de la Reine is an excellent Parisian base for a visit to the Musee Picasso . An old-fashioned sort of refinement: The hotel revels in a classic style of glamour . The attic is given over to masters, including Renoir and Cezanne, as well as Picasso’s contemporaries, such as his rival Matisse. You get a lot for your money — entry is just £8 — and there’s something for everyone. The museum should inspire you to delve further into Picasso’s Parisian life. He arrived here, aged 19, in 1900, for the World’s Fair, where his painting of a deathbed scene was on show. You can now dine in the Mini Palais in the Beaux Arts Grand Palais, built for the event. Picasso first settled in Montmartre — as seedy and provocative now as it was then. His studio in the Bateau Lavoir (‘Laundry Boat’) was destroyed by fire in 1970, but you can visit the site on Place Emile Goudeau. It doesn’t look much and it was squalid in Picasso’s day, which suited him in his scruffy overalls. The simplistically-titled sculpture 'The Goat' is one of Picasso's more intriguing works . Bleak and brutally to the point: Picasso's 'Massacre in Korea' pulls no punches . Back with a bang after five long years of renovation: Visitors look at the painting 'Seated Nude' Here he painted Les Demoiselles D’Avignon and held a party for the artist Henri Rousseau, at which the critic Andre Salmon reportedly ate a hat and a box of matches. Below and above the Bateau Lavoir are the theatres where Picasso and Georges Braque spent their evenings — Picasso was apparently ejected from the Theatre Montmartre for throwing sausages. The Moulin Rouge, that diminutive red windmill on the Boulevard de Clichy, continues to put on a show outside and in. The Moulin de la Galette, painted by Renoir and Picasso, is now a starched-looking restaurant on Rue Lepic. In focus: The sculpture 'Little Girl Skipping' offers a glimpse of this often abrasive artist at his most touching . Come in and take a look: 'The Woman with an Orange' sculpture is a shard of Picasso in minimalist form . The museum's collection - including the 'Death's Head' sculpture - was given to Paris in lieu of inheritance tax . Directly opposite is Le Coq Rico, a warming little place that serves rotisserie chicken, chips and salad for £12, a glass of riesling for £5.50 and L’ile Flottante (floating island, one of Picasso’s favourite desserts) for £8. Behind the thronging Place du Tertre, busy with tourists day and night, is the Musee de Montmartre on attractive Rue Corot. The paintings 'Large Nude in a Red Armchair' and 'Three Women at the Fountain' are key parts of the collection . A tribute: 'The Death of Casagemas' acknowledges Picasso's solid friendship with the titular Catalan artist . Picasso at his most playful: 'Women in the Bathroom' is an example of the great artist in lighter form . A welcome: Paris's timeless buzz of Paris will a little extra pep thanks to the reopening of the Musee Picasso . The museum’s building, a mid-17th-century house, is the oldest in Montmartre. It overlooks the sole remaining vineyard and the Lapin Agile cabaret, where Picasso’s gang caroused. It was originally a hunting lodge for King Henry IV, then a tavern frequented by gangsters. You can sip absinthe, and the show begins at 9pm. The museum gives an impression of what Montmartre looked like at the turn of the 20th century, with landscapes and photos showing the building of the Sacre Coeur. There are also photos of local artists — Kees van Dongen, Juan Gris, Modigliani and Picasso, in his Bateau Lavoir studio. The ivy-clad hotel Le Pavillon de la Reine is a ten-minute walk away from the Picasso Museum. Just off Place des Vosges, it’s convenient for wassailing in the Marais and recovering from a day on your feet. Paris is proud of Picasso — and rightly so. The city was the scene of some of his greatest work, and his life there was as colourful as his most daring palettes. Pavillon de la Reine, (0033 1 40 291 919, www.pavillon-de-la-reine.com) offers two-night breaks on a bed-and-breakfast basis - with two tickets for the Musee Picasso and a self-guided city walking tour - for £700 (based on two sharing) excluding city tax.

"Whether I am taking a mini-break, flying long-haul or heading to a business meeting, my way of getting through the trauma of 21st century travel is to put on my safari suit and retro sunglasses and act as if this is still the heyday of BOAC. Istanbul lends itself to my peculiar fantasies perfectly - a seamless blend of old world and new world, European and Asian, with a Dionysian social life. All of my fashion friends have been raving about it for years, so I jumped on a three-hour flight to discover it for myself. Even after being met by traffic worse than New York at rush hour en route to my hotel (brace yourself and double any estimated journey times you may have read about), the heat, bustle and chaos of this city of more than 14million bodies will have anyone's sense of adventure stirred. Turkey, but not as you know it: The serious party-goer can find clubs in fine locations in burgeoning Istanbul . In an effort to stay off the beaten track, I started in Cukucurma, the antiques area. The quiet streets are filled with mix of adorable bric-a-brac shops alongside serious dealers. Vintage fashion shops also pepper the neighbourhood, alongside the bizarre rather than the bazaar. If textiles and linens are your thing catch a cab, as I did, to Dervis - designer Rifat Ozbek's bath store in the Grand Bazaar, which sells antique kaftans and waffle dressing gowns. The Bazaar is both overwhelming and incredible - a very different shopping experience from the souks of Marrakech. But unless you are after the traditional, don't spend too much time here. Rather than being sucked into buying fake Louis Vuitton slippers, seek out the Turkish carpet slipper sellers and haggle like a demon. My base for the long weekend was the Shangri-La. This new hotel is the first in a procession of pleasure palaces trickling along the Bosphorus. It stands next to the prime minister's house, meaning the environs are crawling with police at all times. Cutting a dash: Henry spent a long weekend soaking up the sights and shops of the former Constantinople . At first I was alarmed by the level of airport-style security in the big hotels, but it's standard here. The Shangri-La's large rooms are decorated with typical five-star global good taste, and the staff are beyond helpful. This is the hotel to stay in if you're getting out to see Istanbul every day - there is no outside space, or resort-style pool for lounging, but it does have a great spa, with hammam treatments for those too exhausted, or not brave enough, to try one in the old town. Making an effort to get up early each day, I scoffed my menemen - traditional Turkish scrambled eggs with green peppers and tomatoes - before venturing out. If brunch is more your thing, head to Galata, particularly the terrace of the Georges Hotel on Sundays. Galata used to be a fairly run-down area but it has been transformed over recent years. Its ancient, hilltop streets now form the beating heart of the city. If you are staying in Istanbul for only a few days, Galata should be your base, because it has excellent bars, clubs and restaurants as well as some of best shops. Head to the Arzu Kaprol boutique, whose collection is worn by the cream of Istanbul (lace was dominant on my visit - beautifully structured shift dresses, and chic contemporary separates), then work your way through the surrounding streets, discovering pop-up shops and designer outlets (I loved Old Sandal, a sweet independent shoe store). Don't forget to haggle: You can find bargains, if you know where and how to look, in Istanbul's historic markets . Exhausted from shopping, I later stopped at the airy Nikol for a tasty pistachio Turkish pastry and a cappuccino. Nestled directly below is Karakoy, the district intent on stealing Galata's crown in becoming the coolest part of the city. On the banks of the Bosphorus, this former industrial area, with its fabulous restaurants and galleries, is book-ended by the bridge to the old town and Istanbul Modern. This is a brilliantly curated contemporary museum, and you can whip around it in 30 minutes. That's just as well, as contemporary art can leave me quite weary. After my whistlestop tour, I headed for the museum's terrace restaurant, recommended to me by the former fashion editor of Vogue Turkey as the place where the Vogue girls lunch. Simple salads and mezze proved an ideal recovery tactic. I would also recommend the pideli kofte - grilled meatballs in yogurt and tomato sauce. Karakoy is definitely the place for foodies. The Karabatak cafe kicked off the area's food revolution - it's an adorable place with a great selection of world coffees and pastries, with vines overhead and little outside tables. Meeting up with some London friends for dinner, we tried Karakoy MaNa. Between us we managed to order most things on the menu, with the succulent griddled lamb the pick of the bunch. Going up in the world: The Galata district of Istanbul is increasingly hip, and enjoys a lovely riverside location . With our bellies full, it was time to sample Istanbul's bustling nightlife. This really is a party city, and I love a party. A quick taxi ride to Beyoglu, just past the Ortakoy Mosque, you will find a cluster of outdoor clubs that have as good a summer party vibe as any in St Tropez. We made for the biggest of them, Reina. Walking down the steps in the club to the tables, all eyes are on you, so put on your best show. For me, that meant a showgirl high kick on the last step (we had enjoyed a lot of cocktails by this point), that nearly took out the first table. The music is hilarious, but give in to it - every big European and US club track has a Turkish beat mixed over it. I will never be able to listen to Miley Cyrus's Wrecking Ball in quite the same way again. Despite the political troubles associated with Taksim Square, here you'll find the best late-night kebabs to soak up the booze. I couldn't tell you which chic shop we visited - perhaps that's a sign of how hard we had partied. Of course, you cannot come to a city like Istanbul and not visit the big attractions. We took a private boat to see the Hagia Sofia and Blue Mosque - the bigger hotels will be happy to organise this. The Hagia Sofia's influence on European ecclesiastical architecture cannot be overstated enough, so for an architectural enthusiast like me it was an essential trip. A blaze of noise and colour: Istanbul's Grand Bazaar can be a fun, merrily chaotic, shopping experience . The Blue Mosque is impressive, though less relevant to the European architectural enthusiast. Due to the heat, I was wearing seersucker shorts, and thus was given an ankle-length blue skirt with a Velcro split to wear inside the building. I had to muster all my strength not to do an Angelina Jolie side-leg pose at every photo opportunity. Most impressive for me was the vast Topkapi Palace, the main residence of the Ottoman sultans for 400 years. The palace is the perfect metaphor for old Istanbul - a blend of Islamic imperialism and European influence, so beautifully preserved that wandering around, you feel like Aladdin. Naturally, I burst into songs from the Disney classic at regular intervals. Walking through the vast Harem (a separate ticket, but worth adding), you can almost hear the giggles of the concubines, and the squealing of the eunuchs. The palace is huge, so don't attempt to do it all in a day. I headed straight for the jewels. Having watched Melina Mercouri and Peter Ustinov's Oscar-winning 1964 film Topkapi with my grandparents as a child, I made a beeline for the Topkapi dagger - its enormous emeralds would make anyone want to break the glass and cart it off. The gaudiness of the endless rooms of the Imperial Treasury make our own Crown Jewels look almost demure: baskets of emeralds, gold thrones studded with diamonds, intricate treasure boxes and the 85-carat pear-shaped Spoonmaker's Diamond the Sultan wore as a ring. Don't go there before visiting the Grand Bazaar or you may come back decked out like Elizabeth Taylor. Istanbul is a burgeoning, lively and deliciously contemporary city, set to a backdrop of thousands of years of history. This cultural blend has been its appeal for hundreds of years, and there is no better time to dip into its fashionable society.

"Fancy travelling back to 16th century Italy? Then follow these instructions. First, visit the Royal Academy’s gripping exhibition of paintings by the forgotten Renaissance master Giovanni Battista Moroni, which opens in London on 25 October. This done, spend a few days in Bergamo, the wonderfully preserved city in northern Italy where Moroni did much of his best work. A northern star: Bergamo sits close to Milan, but is often unfairly caught in the shadow of its giant neighbour . Let’s deal with the artist first. It is hardly surprising that his name has been eclipsed by such titanic near-contemporaries as Titian and Caravaggio. Yet his gifts, particularly as a portraitist, would have shone in any time or place. Neither meanly realist nor rollickingly mannerist, his paintings of aristocrats and artisans are truly magnificent. After a glance, for instance, at the portrait of Gabriel de la Cueva (1560), you’ll want to know more about the subject. But you’ll feel you know quite a bit already. A short man, to judge by his head-body ratio, he glares pugnaciously out at posterity. You get a similar feeling from the picture of Giovanni Gerolamo Grumelli, aka The Man in Pink, who is another angry nobleman. His sword’s at a tilt. His hand’s on its hilt. His cheeks match the blush of his doublet and hose, as if to say: 'That’s right, they’re pink. You want to make something out of it?' Wander the streets of Bergamo today, and you feel you might meet these characters on any cobbled corner. The town is a time capsule, all the more so because it hasn’t been over run by tourists. The Città Alta (the higher, older part) floats above the rest like Arthur Conan Doyle’s plateau in The Lost World, protected from modernity by its thick defensive walls. The town has money from the textiles and mechanical parts factories that surround the suburbs. It doesn’t need your dog-eared tourist euro. What this means is that you will have a more authentic Italian experience than you could conceivably hope for among the touts of Florence, or the rapacious gondoliers who patrol the Venetian canals. Brushstrokes: Giovanni Moroni produced masterpieces such as Il Tagliapanni (The Tailor) If you are staying in the lower town – as I did, in the friendly Best Western Cappello d’Oro hotel – you rise to the higher part in a funicular, and emerge into another age. Nor are the Moronis, of which the town has many, the limit of Bergamo’s artistic repertoire. Other highlights, as well as religious works by Moretto and Romanino, include an impeccable technicolour altarpiece by Lorenzo Lotto in the church of San Bernardino, and the same artist’s exquisite marquetry panels in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, which glow as if in amber. While you’re there, pay your respects to the tomb of Donizetti, a Bergamask native. If his operas are your thing, the nearby Teatro Donizetti stages them regularly. Just one cornetto, though, won’t be enough for afters – particularly if you are indulging in the stracciatella at La Marianna restaurant, where the delicious ice-cream, flecked with splinters of dark chocolate, was invented. The foodies among you (and the greedies, such as myself) won’t be disappointed by Bergamo. Local specialities include fine cheeses (try the creamy taleggio) and casoncelli pasta, a kind of ravioli filled with meat and raisins, glazed with sage butter and draped with bacon. Round off this excess with a glass or two of fortified moscato di scanzo. To sum up, Bergamo is, as it were, the Moroni among Italian towns: overlooked, undervalued, its treasures small but perfectly formed. But with Ryanair flights from several UK airports to Milan Bergamo airport, a mere three miles or so from the town centre, there is no reason not to go. Ryanair (www.ryanair.com) flies to Milan Bergamo from London Stansted, from £40 return.

"I’m in the middle of a beautiful dream. In this vision, I am lying on a wide, deserted beach. The Velvet Underground is ringing through my headphones (‘Oh, sweet nothing!’) and the afternoon sun is warming the backs of my arms and legs. ‘Perhaps I'll swim in the ocean, I think to myself. Or fish around in my bag for a book. Or maybe I should go inside and fetch a cold beer from the fridge.’ I smile inwardly with a sort of zen-like smugness. I have come to an important decision: I'm going to do nothing. Nothing seems by far the best option. And then we can play Batman: Palm Beach is a splendid spot for a family holiday . I am rudely awoken by a four-year-old boy pulling violently on my thumb. ‘Can we play Batman now?’ he asks me. I glance at my phone. It is 2.37am. Suddenly, I cannot seem to remember: a) who I am b) where I am or c) why I’m here. After some soul-searching, I come up with: a) a middle-aged man from South London b) Palm Beach, Florida c) on a family holiday with my wife and two kids. After I have grasped these three salient facts, things begin to fall into place again, and I’m able to distract my youngest son with a box of apple juice. Within a minute or two of playing Robin to his Bruce Wayne, we both fall asleep again - and I’m back on my fantasy sun lounger. If you are planning on doing nothing - or at least trying to - Palm Beach could well be your dream destination. In this sleepy, prosperous corner of southern Florida, nothing is on the menu every day - and it is invariably delicious. This is where Rod Stewart comes to do nothing. Where Donald Trump comes to do nothing. Where John Lennon and Yoko Ono came to do nothing. It is where infamous stockbroker and conman Bernie Madoff convinced his victims to part with their life savings. And in return, he offered them, well, nothing, as it turns out. A place for relaxation: Palm Beach offers white sands and sunshine 70 miles north of Miami . It is also extremely expensive. Palm Beach is one of the richest towns in the United States, which goes some way to explaining why the guests at our hotel (we’re staying at The Four Seasons) don’t seem in the slightest bit phased by the $25 (£15) cost of the cocktails. Still, there really is no arguing with the beauty of the hotel’s private beach. On our first morning, I am gripped with a giddy euphoria. It is as though all this white sand were a drug entering my system through the pores of my pallid, city-dweller's skin. The sky is perfect, the sand is perfect, the temperature of the sea, perfect. My shoulders drop about three inches from their default, hunched-up, hassled parent position, and any trace of angst seems to wash away in the broad, clean waves of the Atlantic. The kids are having a ball, too. We spend hours switching from ocean to pool, then pool to ocean. There is a wonderful, lolling rhythm to it all, and as smiling hostesses unfurl umbrellas and serve ice-cold lemonade to our ocean-view table, I feel no pain. To top it all, there is hot and cold running childcare. The boys fall instantly in love with our 19-year-old babysitter Lisa. And as my wife and I head out of the door later that evening, they seem positively delighted to see the back of us. We take a taxi along eight miles of winding coastal road, spotting John Lennon’s ex-pad and Donald Trump’s private club along the way. I wonder if Trump is familiar with Groucho Marx’s old adage: 'I don’t care to belong to any club that would have me as a member.' A magnet for celebrities through the ages: Former American president John F Kennedy (left) used to bring his young family to Palm Beach for holidays; John Lennon and Yoko Ono (right) also had a holiday home in the area . Arriving in the centre of town, we feast on fire-roasted pizza at the posh but relaxed Buccan, then head out onto the street in search of adventure. Presumably the real parties happen behind the high walls of celebrity mansions, because the place is dead by 10pm. Not that I’m complaining. It’s a beautiful, balmy evening, and we take a stroll through the wide streets, wandering into a restaurant-bar called Café L’Europe. In the corner, a pianist is murdering Whitney Houston (not literally), while the immaculately dressed clientele sits in virtual silence. It feels like a Beverly Hills retirement home. We are on the verge of giving up when a smiley lady approaches us. She introduces herself as Danielle and begins to talk animatedly about turtles. ‘You must visit the sanctuary,’ she insists. ‘Your boys will love it!’ Danielle introduces us to her husband, Bill, an eyewear mogul from Minnesota. We make small talk for a while as they settle down at the bar to eat dinner. ‘You’re not in Wall Street, right?’ Bill asks, suddenly suspicious. ‘God forbid,’ I reply. He seems somewhat placated and very nearly smiles at me. ‘Those hedge fund guys keep coming down here,’ he offers, and returns to his smoked salmon without further comment. On the money: Palm Beach exudes an affluent vibe, with sports cars and palatial homes . The following morning, the four of us manage to tear ourselves away from the beach for a few hours to explore the local area. After a stop-off at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center (Danielle was right. It’s fantastic) we take a short drive to the marina for a dolphin-spotting trip on a catamaran. The kids are overjoyed - it’s their first time on a boat. And as if on cue, a group of five or six dolphins pop up from the waves directly in front of us. 'They’re a little late,' says Larry, our captain for the day. 'We’re gonna have to dock their wages.' When the dolphins have disappeared into the deep, Larry fills us in on some local history. ‘See that?’ he says, pointing to a creamy white mansion house by the water. ‘That’s the old Kennedy estate. JFK would come down here twice a year with the whole family.’ ‘I remember once when I was just out of college, they closed up the roads and he came tearing through town with his motorcade. They must’ve been doing eighty miles an hour. I mean he was hauling ass!’ ‘As a matter of fact,’ says Larry ‘he spent his last weekend down here in Palm Beach. Just before he was assassinated in Dallas.” I feel a sudden stab of pity for Kennedy – and also for his kids. Millions of Americans may have mourned the death of their president, but only two children mourned the death of their dad. Tempting: Palm Beach's monied vibe is visible in the boutique shops of Worth Avenue . Watching my own boys kicking their feet in the surf, I’m acutely aware of how lucky I am. I don’t mean that I’m lucky to be in sunny Florida, or even to be staying in a fancy hotel - although I’m grateful for both those things. No. More than anything, I feel lucky to be right here in this moment with the people I love the most. I don’t go with all that rubbish about the devil and idle hands. Do nothing, I say.

"What is it about islands? Small inhabited lumps of rock are inevitably associated with strange goings on. Think Dr Moreau and the Wicker Man, the Famous Five and, er, Pitcairn. Islands are home to mysteries, buried treasure and dark secrets. I have never been to an island I’ve disliked. Jersey, the Anglo-Norman statelet in the Bay of Mont St Michel is no different. A few years ago there were hysterical stories about satanic cults – fantasies which evaporated under scrutiny. A place of poise and majesty: Jersey's grand history is visible in structures such as Mount Orgueil Castle . Sniffy writers tiresomely refer to the island’s ‘sinister Nazi Past’. They rarely point out that with a ratio of about one German soldier per every two inhabitants during the WW2 occupation, resistance would have been worse than useless. Since the war, Jersey has acquired another reputation, like Somerset’s Maugham’s Monaco, a ‘sunny place for shady people’. The decision, made in the 1960s, to turn the island into a tax haven, has certainly had a host of unintended consequences - and I think, on balance, that it was a mistake. But the popular belief that Jersey is no more than a colony of perma-tanned, gin-swilling tax-dodgers is a misconception. I have family on Jersey, and have been visiting since the 1960s. This little place, which I love for all its eccentricities, is perhaps one of the most surreal anomalies in Europe. British yet not-British, a fiscal loophole incarnate. Jersey has a land area of just 45 square miles – less than a quarter of the size of the New Forest. Despite this there are thirteen police forces. The island’s roads labour under one of the highest concentrations of high-powered supercars and off-roaders anywhere in the world. Yet the island speed limit is 40mph, so few of the Ferraris ever get out of second gear, and 4x4s regularly get stuck in the narrow lanes. Casting the net: Jersey is a glorious location for a family holiday . Everywhere here has a French name. Jersey Law, was until quite recently, codified in a dialect of Norman French - and French civil law, to this day, underpins much of the island’s legal codes. Some of the older inhabitants still speak Jerriais, the old Norman-French dialect, and yet this is a patriotic British island (albeit one that is not in the UK). There cannot be a more child-friendly destination in the British Isles. The sheltered bays of the south and east offer safe paddling and swimming, and Jersey must have more rock pools than the entire south coast of England. Older children will like the War Tunnels, a series of underground bunkers excavated by the Nazis (or rather their unfortunate Soviet POWs), there are two splendid castles (Mont Orgueil and Elizabeth Castle) and the bizarre and rather wonderful aMazein, an adventure park run by a farmer that is the diametric opposite to the Disney experience. The hotels are pretty good too. There are some beauties right on the sea. One of the best is L’Horizon on St Brelade’s Bay, probably the finest all-round beach on the island (lots of sand at all tides, calm sea, safe, warm). Then there is the food. Jersey may, in many ways, be more British than Britain itself - but the island’s cuisine is superb. Back in the early 1970s, when the mainland laboured under the appalling tyranny of salad cream, frozen fish and tinned fruit, Jersey was awash with fresh seafood, extraordinary cream, sublime fruit and, of course, the finest potatoes on Earth – grown traditionally in seaweed-fertilised soil. I remember, as a small boy, being introduced to things like fresh pasta and gourmet burgers – years before such things were known back home. A special form of tranquility: Jersey is blessed with pristine beaches, such as Portelet Bay, on the south coast . Today it is almost impossible to eat badly on Jersey. Take your pick, but my favourites are El Tico, on the magnificent St Ouen’s Bay, an epic sweep of sand on the island’s West Coast. This informal place serves brilliant local fish and shellfish, and tender meats. And it is on one of the best beaches in Europe. Round the corner, on lovely St Brelade’s Bay, is the CrabShack – which does serve crab, is not a shack and is again, right on the beach. There are no fewer than four Michelin-starred places on the island (nine miles by five, remember). This is not a place to come on a diet. At least you can swim it all off afterwards. Jersey has long prided itself on its turquoise, unpolluted seas. The beaches are, if anything, best in the west and north, but all have their fans. My favourite is Plemont on the island’s northwest tip, with caves, rockpools and ice-cream yellow sands at low tide. The water never gets truly cold, and plenty of locals swim all year round. Yes, there is too much traffic, and yes, Jersey would do well to go back to earning its living from fishing, farming and tourism rather than managing other people’s money - but this is an exquisite place. And autumn is a good time to come. Jersey is about 100 miles south of the UK mainland, often just enough to push it into the warmth and dryness of France.

"Manchester United will not be renaming Old Trafford. Earlier this week it emerged La Liga giants Real Madrid were set to sell naming rights to their iconic Santiago Bernabeu home to energy firm Cepsa. Reports in Spain, which the club declined to comment on, suggested the stadium would become the Abu Dhabi Bernabeu, named after the homeland of the company’s owners as part of a wider 500m euros deal. Manchester United are not prepared to sell the naming rights to Old Trafford, despite their rivals' plans . The club believe there would be little appetite to rename the stadium as people will always call it Old Trafford . And with United’s cross-town rivals raking in a reported £400m over 10 years after they sold the Eastlands naming rights along with a host of other sponsorship rights to Etihad Airways, some believed it was only a matter of time until the club’s 115-year-old home was next on the list. Sportsmail, however, understands United officials have no plans to follow suit. They believe there would be little commercial appetite for such a proposal given that few would refer to the stadium as anything other than Old Trafford. Added to an undoubtedly furious backlash from supporters, the feeling is that such a move would make little sense. Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium is set to be renamed Abu Dhabi Bernabeu . The Bernabeu was opened in 1947 and is one of the most iconic venues in world football . The stadium was named after former Real chairman Santiago Bernabeu Yeste . A source said: ‘It’s been made clear before - Old Trafford is Old Trafford and there are no plans to change that. What does or does not happen in Madrid makes absolutely no difference to us.’ Down the road from United’s home, Lancashire County Cricket Club play at Emirates Old Trafford while a host of clubs across the world are cashing in from lucrative deals. At City, the agreement with Etihad was key as they attempted to meet Uefa’s Financial Fair Play criteria. However, they only moved to the stadium in 2003 and there was little affinity among supporters with its existing name.","Real Madrid are reportedly set to sell the naming rights to their stadium .

"With its pristine slopes, spectacular views and seemingly endless supply of glühwein, it's no surprise that St. Moritz has been pulling in the tourists for more than 150 years. But what do you do if skiing isn't your thing? Not everyone likes wobbling through the snow at a 90 degree angle and coming to a chilly stop in a snowdrift. That, however, doesn't mean there isn't anything for non-skiers to do in the Graubünden mountain town. As I discovered over a sisters-only weekend in the mountains, there's plenty of choice - provided you don't mind getting cold. Celebrations: St. Moritz is celebrating its 150th year as a winter sports destination this year . One of the loveliest parts of a holiday in St. Moritz is the journey there on the Glacier Express; a beauteous trip that takes in soaring peaks, plunging gorges and some of the brightest blue water this side of the Mediterranean. As the town draws nearer, the peaks get snowier - this year included. While the lake on which St. Moritz sits remains resolutely liquid, the peaks are as starkly white as ever. We were staying at the Hotel Schweizerhof, a central pile a stone's throw from the station, although the efficient reception desk sent down a car rather than making us drag our suitcases through the snow. Inside, it was beautifully warm and decked out in aristocratic style, with draped curtains, acres of gold gilding and luxuriously thick red carpets. Upstairs, corridors painted a plain cream and enlivened with antique paintings spread out in every direction, including the one that led to my room - a spacious twin with a little ensuite bathroom encased in what looked like a colossal walnut cupboard. Spectacular: The tiny town sits on the shores of Lake St. Moritz and is flanked by Alpine peaks . Travel in style: Arriving in St. Moritz means a journey through the mountains on the Glacier Express . From the window, I could see the towering peaks that rear up behind the town, including the magnificent Corviglia - home to some of St Moritz' best ski slopes. I headed up there the next day just to make sure that I definitely wasn't in the mood to ski and found myself enchanted by the stunning views, if less so by the vast Audi branded cafe plonked next to the lifts. With us was Australian ski instructor John, a man of endless bons mots and inexhaustible patience, even when faced with sisters demanding a hot chocolate break at regular intervals. During one of these, he revealed his top tips for skiing success, among them leaning forward ('it stops you falling over'), and the intricacies of the snowplough slowing technique. He also had some wisdom on the subject of choosing ski instructors to share - the older, the better being his mantra. 'It's because they understand why beginners are scared,' he added. Peering over the edge of a steep (for me) blue run slope, I couldn't help but agree. Perfect conditions: St. Moritz' Corviglia ski slopes have escaped the warm weather and kept their snow . Base: Travelmail's team stayed at the beautiful Hotel Schweizerhof in the centre of St. Moritz . One blistered shin and a tumble later, I was ready to head down the mountain and get to grips with the real purpose of the exercise - the apres ski. First though, I had an appointment with local chocolatier Hauser to discover the secrets of another Swiss tradition - chocolate. Upstairs a classic Swiss cafe complete with a cheerful counter and a mind-boggling array of chocolates and pastries, downstairs was a warren of tiny kitchens, each of which contained a culinary whizz painstakingly producing a series of toothsome creations. Not all were small, however, among them a chocolate version of the Glacier Express emerging for a tunnel which was due to go on display in the shop, although not for sale. Chocolate bubbled in vats all around, carefully kept at 32 degrees - the perfect temperature for successful sweet making apparently - while piles of nuts could be seen slowly being transformed into Engadin's traditional (and utterly delicious) caramel nut cake. Interesting though the process was, the real excitement came when we got to eat some of the wares, including a gorgeous white chocolate and vodka creation and a gin version that was a little like slurping a chocolate-encased shot. That the most unlikely of chocolate and alcohol combinations proved tasty is no surprise in St. Moritz, a town where fondue is this dish du jour and glühwein is practically served on tap. But you don't always have to have the cheese variety. At the Schweizerhof's Restaurant Acla, we tried the Fondue Chinoise which swaps bread for meat and cheese for broth. It was delicious - as was the red Valais wine served to wash it down and the Chateaubriand ordered by my (very hungry) sister. Yet for all that, nothing tastes like Switzerland quite so much as a real cheese fondue and luckily for us, the very next day, we found the perfect place to eat it. Having decided not to go skiing and ruled out the painful cross-country skiing alternative, we opted instead for a gentle ride through the Fex Valley in a horse-drawn carriage. Bundled up in layers of rugs, we huddled up on the cushioned seats and watched as the steep-sided valley and its diminutive stone houses slid past. Stunning: A horsedrawn carriage through the Fex Valley lets you enjoy the gorgeous surroundings in peace . Isolated: The Valley, which stretches towards the Italian border, is home to just 700 people . Alternative: If you don't fancy riding, cross-country skiing is fun for the very fit . Close to the village of Sils Maria, the Valley stretches towards the Italian border and is flanked by craggy peaks. In the summer, it is a riot of alpine flowers and gently munching cows but winter brings thick snow and a total ban on cars. Based on what we saw, they'd only get stuck anyway. There is, nonetheless, a tiny village in the middle - Fex - which even boasts its own little hotel, the unimaginatively named Hotel Fex. What was not unimaginative was the menu, which along with Swiss classics such as schnitzel and rösti, also included one of the tastiest cheese fondues I've ever had and a crisp local white wine to go with it. Back in St. Moritz and still not quite ready for serious exercise, we took a leisurely walk to the Segantini Museum which is perched on a hill overlooking the lake. Built in 1908, it is dedicated to Italian painter Giovanni Segantini who lived locally during the later years of his life and took inspiration from the craggy Engadin region as well at St Moritz itself. Inspiration: The Segantini Museum was built in 1908 and houses works by painter Giovanni Segantini .

Home to more than 20 paintings, the most famous is his vast Life, Nature, Death triptych which is hung in the Museum's upper room. Featuring striking Alpine scenes, plenty of Segantini's trademark cows and farmers and a spectacular view of St Moritz, it remains one of his most popular works. Fascinating though the Museum was, not everyone wants to spend a winter holiday updating their knowledge of art and so, it was finally time for something more high octane. At 250 Swiss Francs (£162), a trip on the St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun doesn't come cheap but if it doesn't put a smile on your face, nothing will. The 75 second journey sees you hurtle along an Alpine road, through several tunnels and round a corner of eye-watering sharpness. It's fascinating afterwards too. Built in 1903 for guests from the UK, the track has played host to everyone from royals to sporting stars, among them participants in not one but two Winter Olympic Games. Some of the trophies and medals can still be seen in the bobsleigh bar where, for the price of a drink or two, locals will happily regale you with stories of daring bobsledders past. And if you don't fancy that, there's always ice skating on the lake. With spectacular views of the surrounding slopes and the departing Glacier Express, it gives skiing a serious run for its money.","St. Moritz is celebrating the 150th anniversary of winter tourism this year .

"Being greeted with a litany of abuse on a first date isn't usually a recipe for romance but when Brent Zillwood called Challis Orme a 's***head' while they sat at the bar she wasn't deterred. Model Challis, 26, and Brent, 23, who has Tourette's Syndrome, were watched by millions as they met in an Exeter pub on the Channel 4 show, The Undateables. And a year on, the couple, who live in Hertfordshire, have tied the knot in a dream Las Vegas ceremony - and become the first pair to marry from the programme about people with disabilities attempting to find love. Scroll down for video . Brent Zillwood and Challis Orme married before Christmas a year after meeting on TV's The Undateables . Challis, from Teignmouth, Devon, knew about Brent's condition when they met and was too concerned about the butterflies in her stomach to worry about his disorder, which makes him swear and twitch uncontrollably. Millions watched Brent's search for a soulmate including a romance with a 19-year-old barmaid which fizzled out. Not only was Challis unfazed by the filmmaker's condition, she actually helps keep it under control. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'If I did twitch she just laughed.' he said. She said: 'I didn't know much about it and it was a bit shocking at first but once he explained it to me I realised there was nothing he could do about it,' she says. 'But I fancied him straight away and I've never been self-conscious about it. I love him for lots of reasons.' Brent and Challis first met in front of TV cameras in an Exeter pub where six months later he proposed . The newlyweds smile for the camera after their Las Vegas 'I do's' just before Christmas, a year after meeting . After six months together, Brent, from Plymouth, took her back to the pub where they met and proposed with a platinum and amethyst crystal ring and a scrapbook of their relationship together. On the last page he'd written, 'What happens next depends on how you answer my next question.' He then proposed and Challis immediately said yes. The couple married in Las Vegas before Christmas, and spent five days in the Nevada city. Brent said his Tourette's was well behaved except when he picked up their marriage license. But before the ceremony itself, he gave himself 'a talking to' and made it through the ceremony without incident. While starting a family is on the cards, for now they want to start working with children with Tourette's to show that it needn't rule your life. Brent said: 'I'm the happiest I've ever been and I want to share that.' Brent appeared on The Undateables, above. He had given up on finding love, then  he met Challis on the show .","Show follows people with medical conditions' search for soulmates .

"British holidaymakers have been named and shamed as the worst nationality for grabbing sunloungers – by Germans. An investigation carried out in Spain found it was mainly people from the UK who were queuing up to reserve their spot for a day's sunbathing by the pool. Christian Voss, 39, was standing in line at the Royal Star in Lloret de Mar at 7.30am when the line started to form. Early birds: Apparently Brits are worse than German holidaymakers when it comes to reserving sunloungers . Working for German newspaper Bild, the investigations reporter said although the hotel had a wide variety of foreign tourists, it was the Brits who were standing in the queue for the sun loungers. And he said that when the masses rushed inside to put towels down on the sun loungers and reserve them for the rest of the day, it was the British who were in the majority. And that meant that while German guests were left standing when they turned up after breakfast, the British with their beach towels had already managed to nab the best places. Voss spoke to dozens of British tourists about why they had been in such a rush to get the sun loungers and to stop others using them. These included Manchester United fan Korban, 12, his mother Julie, 40, and her niece Danni, 19, from Malvern in Worcestershire. And relax ... The investigation by a German newspaper found Brits queue up early to get hotel sunloungers . Julie said: 'I know there was some trouble yesterday after some of these people had their towels moved allegedly by Germans. 'But I was there and they weren't Germans, they were Frenchmen.' English mechanic Darren, 43, from Exmouth, was on holiday at the hotel with his daughters Elouise, nine, and Daisy, seven. He said: 'I was in the queue at the start. If you don't reserve a place you don't get a place. There are not enough to go around.' Another family Carolina, 52, and husband Mark, 51, with their son Josh, 41, from Farnborough, were also spotted grabbing sun loungers and she said: 'I found out pretty quickly that the pool is only officially open at 9am but unofficially the door opens sooner than that. 'So you can get in if you join the queue and reserve a space. But there's no chance otherwise. Everyone else is doing it as well.' Linda, 55, was photographed turning up with seven beach towels which she said were for her extended family. Her daughter-in-law Eve, 28, who turned up a short while later said: 'If we want to sit together it's the only way to make sure we get a place.'","Reporter found Brits were first in line in morning to reserve a space .

"English county cricket clubs have seen their salary cap slashed by 10 per cent with immediate effect, giving them just three months’ notice before the new season starts. The ECB informed the 18 first-class counties this week that their wages limit — plus cricket-related travel and hotel costs — was being reduced from £2.19million to £1.97m. And the cutback, that will severely limit major counties’ spending power on overseas stars, comes when England’s T20 tournament is suffering so badly in comparison with Australia’s Big Bash and the Indian Premier League. English county cricket clubs will now find it harder to compete with the money of foreign money . ECB say move benefits home-grown talent, of which Yorkshire, bankrolled by Colin Graves, have the most . Surrey, who recruited Graeme Smith, Kevin Pietersen and Ricky Ponting for the 2013 T20 campaign, will be one of the counties worst affected, along with Warwicks and Lancashire. Surrey chief executive Richard Gould said: ‘We are not at all pleased by the cuts or the short notice given. Budgets were set for 2015 last September. It is artificially dampening down investment in cricket and how can we compete with other T20 competitions around the world with these restrictions? At the same time England players’ salaries have gone up and up.’ The ECB say the move is to encourage home-grown talent, of which Yorkshire, bankrolled by ECB chairman elect Colin Graves, have the most. BT Sport Pundit and former Liverpool striker Michael Owen in a bizarre new advert for Spey whisky . Owen signed a three-year deal last June to become a global brand ambassador for Spey . Forget the awfulness of the BT Sport promotion ‘The Cool People To Watch Football With’, topped by the Michael Owen thumbs-up which has inspired Brighton to make their own version. Even worse is Owen’s awkward monotone online advert for Spey Whisky, panned as one of the worst commercials ever. Owen signed a three-year deal last June to become a global brand ambassador for Spey but even BT Sport colleagues are giving him stick. Another sign The Open is heading to Sky is the involvement of agents IMG in negotiations. IMG, who represent the R&A, also produce Sky’s golf coverage in partnership with the European Tour. And The Open, notable for the BBC’s far inferior camera work, is the only major golf event in Europe not brought to screens by European Tour Productions. Another sign The Open is heading to Sky is the involvement of agents IMG in negotiations . The R&A, who receive around £7m a year for the Open rights from the BBC, want a minimum £10m a year. Ideally, they would like to keep the BBC involved in a share agreement for the live contract, but Sky are highly unlikely to pay premium price without exclusivity. Certainly the R&A will want Sky to be host broadcaster. The billboard wars continue after Leicester put up a poster outside Wasps’ new home, Ricoh Arena in Coventry, promoting Tigers’ long history.

Wasps expect another 20,000-plus crowd against Leinster on Saturday. David Gill will face just one opponent in the election for the British vice-presidency seat on FIFA’s ExCo . COAST IS CLEAR FOR GILL . Manchester United director David Gill will face just one opponent in the election for the British vice-presidency seat on FIFA’s ExCo. Scottish FA president Campbell Ogilvie has decided not to stand, leaving a straight choice for the UEFA Congress vote in March between England representative Gill and FA of Wales president Trefor Lloyd Hughes. Gill, who sits on UEFA’s ExCo and is seen by many inside the game as the next FA chairman, is sure to emerge victorious. But Lloyd Hughes feels aggrieved that the other home nations have reneged on a 2011 deal that the BVP role should rotate, with Wales never having had a FIFA ExCo representative. The FA say reforms that have resulted in a full UEFA vote, rather than just the home nations, rule out previous agreements. Marketing agency FutureProof are responsible for the FA’s advertising promotion around the Euro 2016 qualifying games, with ‘Together for England’ featuring split pictures of players and fans, and tag lines such as pride-passion. The same agency have been hired to do something similar by the ECB for the Ashes next summer. Yet it seems odd the ECB are investing in an expensive campaign having just cut county cricket spending as well as rapidly culling staff aged over 50.","ECB have slashed wage limits for county cricket clubs .

"The Premier League are keeping on a fast track with their expected £5billion TV rights auction despite attempts by broadcasting regulator Ofcom to derail the process. Ofcom are investigating how the Premier League sell their domestic rights following Virgin Media’s complaint that not enough matches are made available for live screening, leading to the sky-high cost of buying TV matches. An interim report by Ofcom is expected by the end of March, by which time the League would have completed their sales tender. The bid deadline is next Friday for the highlights package and a week later for the seven lots of live games. Ofcom will investigate how the Premier League sell their rights following a complaint by Virgin Media . The Premier League do not want to wait for Ofcom’s deliberations as it is not known whether the decision in March will be definitive or merely a progress update. And if the PL are told by Ofcom to unravel their sale and start again, a mighty legal battle will ensue. Graham Bean, the former FA compliance chief accused of fraud after allegedly obtaining £100,000 of unauthorised payments from a family pension scheme, had his case committed to Manchester Crown Court.

Former FA compliance chief Graham Bean has had his case committed to Manchester Crown Court . Jose Mourinho’s decision to rest captain John Terry  for the FA Cup tie against Bradford will be a blow for midfielder Billy Knott. The former Chelsea junior had taken the premature swapping of shirts to a new level by attempting to book Terry’s shirt to exchange before the fourth-round clash. Knott has contacted former team-mate Josh McEachran to help out. He said before Terry was left out of the line-up: ‘I put my request in early and hope Josh can sort it.’ Bradford midfielder Billy Knott was keen on getting hold of Chelsea defender John Terry's shirt . RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie has tried to justify his rampantly commercial organisation bringing out six England shirts within 15 months by saying: ‘We have to have two shirts per season so we have to change kit.’ No they don’t. The RFU chose to sign the lucrative deal with kit suppliers Canterbury that stipulates two new shirts per season — even in a World Cup year when two non-branded shirts have to be worn as well. Meanwhile the RFU, who used to have a firm agreement with Ticketmaster that their secondary market site Get Me In did not trade seats for England rugby at Twickenham, have seemingly let that deal slip. They confirmed there is now nothing to stop GMI selling England tickets. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie has defended his organisation's decision to bring out multiple England shirts . MCC vote ‘not cricket’ The beleaguered MCC management committee — described by the Financial Times as starting to make Sepp Blatter look saintly — are now facing demands from members for the 2015 committee election process to be ruled invalid. This follows MCC, who have seven candidates for four committee vacancies, putting stars on the ballot paper next to the four people they want elected. Those snubbed include Mark Williams, nominated by Mike Atherton and Sir John Major, who opposes the committee stance on Lord’s redevelopment. Campaign leader Laurence Dillamore called it a ‘rigged election and an insult to MCC’s spirit of cricket’. MCC say no rules are being broken. The FIFA presidential election is becoming yet more of a circus, with volatile Italian agent Mino Raiola, who represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Mario Balotelli, considering joining bookmaker-funded David Ginola on the hustings.

"ITV’s shock axing of Adrian Chiles allows the network to introduce Mark Pougatch as their new lead football presenter ahead of a fiercely fought TV auction for Premier League highlights. ITV Sport will bid strongly against BBC’s Match of the Day for TV rights to be awarded in around a week’s time and the commercial channel wanted to complete their reshuffle of on-screen football talent before then. It is expected that the price of the highlights package, for which the BBC paid £183million for their current three-year deal, could rise to as much as £300m and ITV have the deeper pockets. Adrian Chiles, who has been replaced as ITV's lead football host, pictured in west London on Friday . Chiles appeared in good spirits despite the news, as he walked near his home in west London . THIS SEASON . ITV - England internationals, Champions League, Europa League . Sky Sports - Premier League, Champions League, other home nations internationals .

Sky Sports - Premier League, other home nations internationals . BBC - Premier League highlights, FA Cup . BT Sport - Premier League, FA Cup, Champions League, Europa League . But this is one flagship contract that the BBC — faced with losing golf’s Open Championship to Sky — are desperate to keep more than any other apart from Wimbledon. Unpopular with viewers, Chiles was the subject of a Facebook campaign — attracting more than 37,000 ‘likes’ — to have him removed from hosting ITV football after the last World Cup. He was told this week his contract was being terminated. Chiles signed a £500,000 one-year renewal last April that expires at the end of the season. At the time he took a whopping £1m salary cut because the extension just covered his dwindling football presenting duties. He joined ITV from the BBC on a £6m four-year contract in 2010 which included hosting breakfast show Daybreak. Since the demise of that programme and ITV losing live rights to the FA Cup, Champions League and Europa League, Chiles was increasingly seen as a luxury who did little for the ratings. The 47-year-old Brummie was trying to negotiate new terms when ITV started their football revamp by announcing earlier this month that second-choice presenter Matt Smith’s contract would not be renewed at the end of the season and pundit Andy Townsend would be leaving by mutual consent.

Former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane (centre) left ITV prior to last summer's World Cup in Brazil . Chiles presented ITV's Champions League coverage but the channel will not show live games next season . Instead of a new agreement, Chiles has been shown the door. He leaves immediately with ITV’s unusual ‘no comment’ about anything to do with his exit suggesting there is a legal fight brewing over the size of his pay-off. Pougatch will be in the hot seat for ITV’s next live match on February 17, the first leg of Chelsea’s Champions League tie with Paris Saint-Germain but will continue to work for BBC Radio 5 Live. He will reduce his football involvement on 5 Live to avoid conflict with his ITV role. Highly regarded at the BBC, Pougatch would not have moved if not for the potential promise of a lot more football work than Champions League highlights and England matches after this season — if ITV win rights to Premier League highlights .

Pundit and co-commentator Andy Townsend (right) left ITV by mutual consent earlier this month . Chiles’s departure brought a hugely positive reaction on social media. So it is ironic that it was Chiles who won the presenter shootout against Pougatch when the BBC launched their Sunday Premier League highlights show, Match of the Day 2 in 2004. Pougatch was strong favourite before a late change of mind by the Beeb executive who felt Chiles’s Brummie vowels would go down better than Pougatch’s public school accent honed at Malvern College. Eleven years on it is posh ‘Poogs’ who finally has the upper hand. Pougatch said: ‘I am delighted to be given this great opportunity. I’m looking forward to working with ITV’s talented pool of commentators and pundits.’ Niall Sloane, ITV director of sport, said: ‘Mark is a highly respected sports journalist and outstanding broadcaster. We’re delighted to welcome him.’ Chiles chats with England boss Roy Hodgson before the Three Lions' game against Switzerland in September .

Mark joins the ITV Sport team as the Champions League and Europa League enter their knockout rounds and England's Euro 16 qualifying stages are set to resume. He will appear alongside ITV's panel of pundits, commentary and reporting team for the live England international and European football programmes from February. He brings with him a wealth of experience in sports broadcasting over 20 years, including presenting major events such as World Cups, European Championships and the Olympics. Mark said: 'I am absolutely delighted to be joining ITV and to be given this great opportunity. I'm looking forward to working with ITV's talented pool of commentators and pundits on some of the very best football there is.' ITV Director of Sport, Niall Sloane, said: 'Mark is a highly-respected sports journalist and an outstanding broadcaster. We're delighted to welcome Mark to the ITV Sport team.' ITV will show exclusive live coverage of all England's European Championship and World Cup qualifying matches and friendlies, both home and away fixtures, until 2018. ITV also holds the rights to show Champions League and Europa League matches and highlights until the end of the 2014/2015 season, after which it will show Champions League and Europa League highlights.

"The secret FA files on the doomed 2018 World Cup bid that were not shared with FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia are to be shown to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Select Committee. Former Minister for Sport Gerry Sutcliffe revealed the FA would ‘reluctantly’ allow some MPs to view the dossier on the voting FIFA executive members, which British intelligence services helped to compile. Sutcliffe was speaking at the pressure group New FIFA Now’s summit at the European Parliament in Brussels. FIFA President Sepp Blatter announces Russia as the host country of the 2018 World Cup . England 2018 personnel did not hand over the files to Garcia because a lot of the fine details garnered during the bid from all quarters were based on rumour, hearsay and innuendo and the FA were only comfortable providing evidence supported by hard facts to specific questions. Sutcliffe said: ‘We will see what was held at that time. The FA have been very cagey about it all. They were reluctant at first and said we could not see it, that it was restricted — clearly it’s not. Government was asked to give guarantees so we need to know about this.’ Sutcliffe’s news surprised former FA chairman Lord Triesman, who made the FA making these documents available part of his wishlist for New FIFA Now, who are campaigning for the establishment of a FIFA reform commission. Triesman, who predictably did not waste the opportunity the Brussels platform gave him to lay into an ‘absurd (Sepp) Blatter presiding over a deeply flawed set of people’, said the select committee would now be the rightful judges of this hidden FA cache of World Cup material. Summit organiser MP Damian Collins said the FA sitting on evidence all this time made a ‘sham’ of their whitewash probe into Triesman’s allegations, made under Parliamentary privilege, of bidding corruption by named FIFA Exco members. Fifa presidential hopeful David Ginola is being paid by bookmaker Paddy Power to run for top job . The circus that is the FIFA presidential candidature of three no-hopers on Wednesday saw Chilean Harold Mayne-Nicholls claim he had five national associations waiting to back him if he decides to stand and former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne insist he had between one and four unnamed supporters. David Ginola, who is stunt-funded by bookmaker Paddy Power, called off a meeting in Brussels, having first swerved the FIFA reform summit held there. Horseracing specialist Clare Balding’s surprising decision to present BBC’s men’s and women’s Boat Race coverage on April 11 rather than the flagship Grand National on Channel 4, might have something to do with the rowing event being sponsored by American investment giants the Mellon Corporation. Clare Balding will present BBC’s men’s and women’s Boat Race coverage instead of the Grand National . The late Paul Mellon owned legendary racehorse Mill Reef, which was trained by Clare’s father, Ian. Mellon rewarded Balding for his Mill Reef triumphs with a trust fund that paid for the entire education of his children Clare and Andrew at top private schools. ‘Mr Mellon, as we called him, paid for it, the whole lot,’ said Clare in an interview. Roy thinks P8 is Gr8 . The P8 gatherings — loosely named after G8 political summits — that England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster surprisingly broke ranks to talk about this week, are the brainchild of sports conference organiser James Worrall, who owns the successful Leaders in Sport brand. England rugby head coach Stuart Lancaster swaps ideas with other high-performance leaders . The meetings, first revealed by Sports Agenda last November when the last such forum took place at England’s rugby base at Pennyhill Park in the build-up to the Australia game, are strictly private affairs where high-performance leaders swap ideas and experiences in confidence. Lancaster, England manager Roy Hodgson and England cricket head coach Peter Moores are all enthusiastic about the P8 initiative, as are Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley and top cycling coach Sir Dave Brailsford. Roy Hodgson’s stated preference for England’s training base at Euro 2016 to be somewhere his players can cycle to from the hotel — as opposed to the hour-plus bus commute in Rio — is no longer the priority it first seemed. Hodgson, administrator Michelle Farrer and performance services chief Dave Reddin are still considering locations in France.","FA have 'reluctantly' allowed some MPs to view the dossier on the voting FIFA executive member .

"Tourists to Churchill, Manitoba, in northern Canada are getting nose-to-nose with fearsome polar bears thanks to a massive hand-built machine that is dubbed a 'cruise liner on wheels'. Tundra Buggies, which tower 13ft over the Arctic tundra, bring holidaymakers within touching distance of the world's largest land predators. Churchill, Manitoba, a town on the western shore of Hudson Bay that has been nicknamed the Polar Bear Capital of the World. The area is currently deciding whether to lift restrictions on eco-tourism as it prepares to designate a new polar bear provincial park on Hudson Bay. Scroll down for video . Tourists get up close and personal with a polar bear on a Tundra Buggy in Churchill, Manitoba . There are currently 18 permits for the vehicles and some are concerned that more permits might attract tour operators who would not safely navigate around the animals. Canada is home to two-thirds of the world's polar bears, but environmental experts say climate change could make the Hudson Bay population extinct within a few decades. The Tundra Buggy towers 13ft over the Arctic tundra and brings holidaymakers within touching distance of the bears . Cute: A polar bear and cub are photographed from a Tundra Buggy in northern Manitoba . The Tundra Buggies, owned and operated by Frontiers North Adventures, who are working with the charity Polar Bears International researching how to save polar bears from extinction, are capable of hauling a mobile lodge with a length of more than 200ft. The modular lodges contain a cafe, lounge and sleeping quarters in addition to a large observation deck that allows tourists to get close-up photos of polar bears that are eight feet tall on their hind legs and can weigh 1,500 pounds. Frontiers North Adventures spokeswoman Brandi Hayberg said: 'Bears are often interested in the Tundra Buggy and will approach it. Sometimes they will stand on their hind legs and put their paws on the side of the vehicle. Guides are dwarfed by the Tundra Buggy, which is 13ft tall and 11ft wide, and has tyres with a diameter of five feet . Thousands of tourists flock to Churchill every year to see the bears and spend nights under the Northern Lights . Sightseeing: Tourists observe and photograph wildlife from the observation deck on a Tundra Buggy . 'Depending on the height of the bear, our guests can easily get their faces within a few feet of a polar bear.' Tour operators bill it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience as the excursions range from a one-off day trip at £250 per person to a fully-catered eight-night stay in the Tundra Buggy lodge, which costs over £6,000. But visitors are almost guaranteed to have a closer encounter with the polar bears and learn about their lives and conservation efforts. Polar bears are listed as a threatened species, but the population along the Tundra Buggy's route was last recorded as a stable 1,013. The Tundra Buggy Lodge regularly crosses the harsh Canadian tundra in search of polar bears . Frontiers North Adventures' Tundra Buggies are capable of hauling a mobile lodge with a length of more than 200ft . Entertainment: Guests look out at a polar bear while having dinner in the Tundra Buggy Lodge . The buggy was designed and built by Churchill resident Leonard Smith, who sold his business to Frontiers North Adventures, which has Tundra Buggies that can accommodate up to 40 passengers. Guests are assured that the buggies are perfectly sense as long as they use common sense. Ms Hayberg said: 'Our Tundra Buggies are too tall for the bears to reach the railing of the observation decks or the bottoms of the windows.

'But getting the chance to see these incredible creatures in real life and then to learn about their lives and habitat from our guides really does seem to drive home the importance of living sustainably.

"The Premier League's chances of sealing a staggering £10million-per-game agreement - and £5 billion overall - from the next three-year domestic rights deal are even stronger now two foreign TV giants are involved. The battle between Sky Sports and BT Sport in the auction for the seven packages was already such that £10m for each of 168 live games was an achievable target. But the Premier League also have America's massively-funded Discovery Channel looking closely at the tender document while Qatar-based beIN Sports are discussing whether to bid before the February 6 deadline. Premier League matches could soon be sold for the equivalent for £10million per game in a new rights deal . Discovery, famous for their documentaries, look the more interested of the two potential new challengers. They own Eurosport so have an established platform on which to screen matches. Even one of the two mini 14-game packages might be seen as a way of establishing the Discovery-Eurosport partnership in the UK. Sports rights specialist Peter Hutton has been appointed Eurosport CEO to build content. As for beIN Sports, they have the financial muscle to outbid all rivals and it seems a matter of when, rather than if, they will enter England's domestic football market. Doha executives say they will give serious consideration as to whether now is the right time to move. The competition will delight the Premier League, who sell each of the seven packages to the highest bidder, and it might be that three different networks share content from 2016-17. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore will help arrange the next three-year broadcast deal . The remarkable culling of the over-50s at the England Cricket Board continues with the departure of communications chief Colin Gibson. Replacements already in the frame are 40-somethings Will Chignell — who survived the 2011 Rugby World Cup debacle so well that England cricket chief Paul Downton went to Twickenham to study the RFU PR operation — and Chris Haynes, the robotic former Sky Sports spokesman who never went off Isleworth message in 20 years. Colin Gibson has left his role as the ECB's head of communications after nearly a decade . The minutes of the last FA protocol committee meeting show once again how this preposterous gathering seems far more interested in feeding their faces than discussing serious issues. The main topic at the meeting was about the Norwegian FA delegation running slightly late before the friendly international last September, meaning the start of the VIP-match meal in the Wembley Suite had to be delayed. Wayne Rooney scores England's only goal from the penalty spot in a 1-0 win against Norway in September . Greedy blazers were so agitated about having to wait for their food that it was agreed that in future a member of the FA's international relations team will be sent to the opposition's hotel to ensure they set off for Wembley on schedule. Protocol members decided that from now on they will tuck in at the designated time even if their opposition guests have not yet arrived. This rush to the trough follows the full council actually taking a vote on whether dessert should be served before the match or at half-time — to the exasperation of FA chairman Greg Dyke. Alex Mawer, Lawn Tennis Association's director of communications and marketing, arrived at Roehampton from Visit England last September. Four months later, he has still to communicate properly with specialist tennis writers despite the LTA's chronic need to improve media relations. Mawer said he has had other priorities. It's win-win for Ginola . All that needs to be said about the publicity stunt that is David Ginola's candidature for the FIFA presidency is that the Frenchman is keeping his £250,000 fee from bookmakers Paddy Power — who dreamed up the idea — irrespective of whether he gains the necessary support from five national associations by January 29. David Ginola will keep his £250,000 fee from Paddy Power even if he fails in his bid to become FIFA president . The former Tottenham and Newcastle winger, who seemed more clued up about the 2018 Ryder Cup in France — having been on the bid team — admits his knowledge of FIFA politics is slim. When asked at the Team Ginola Reboot FIFA launch how many members of FIFA ExCo he could name, he replied: 'That's a good question, I need to know more about FIFA.' Quite. Paddy Power, bless 'em, insisted this was a genuine campaign but admitted it will be over in two weeks if Ginola does not win the required nominations. Ginola, all Gallic charm, said nothing much relevant to unseating 78-year-old Sepp Blatter next May.","The Premier League could make the equivalent of £10million per game .

"The FA have promoted Dan Ashworth to technical director with little or no fanfare considering the importance of the role within the structure of English football’s ruling body. There was no official announcement of Ashworth’s step up from director of elite development - his title since arriving from West Bromwich Albion in 2012. Instead, Ashworth was first named technical director on the FA website in the report on Gareth Southgate extending his England Under 21 contract. It is understood the FA did not feel it necessary to promote the change of title as Ashworth has effectively been carrying out the technical director brief since the World Cup. Dan Ashworth has been promoted to technical director of the FA with very little fanfare or furore . Ashworth (left), pictured with England manager Roy Hodgson at St George's Park in August 2013 . And the FA board had unanimously bought into his blueprint for the future organisation of England teams following his presentation as part of the postmortem into the England debacle in Brazil . Also FA chairman Greg Dyke had publicly anointed Ashworth as the technical director when outlining his second England commission report last October. English rugby’s dysfunctional approach to fighting the secondary ticket market has resulted in ER 2015 employing Ticketmaster as their official ticket supply partner only on condition their secondary sites Seatwave and GetMeIn! do not sell World Cup tickets. Yet GetMeIn! are trading Six Nations tickets for England games despite the RFU having had an agreement for them not to in previous years. England Rugby 2015 have employed Ticketmaster as their official ticket supply partner for the World Cup . Joao Havelange, godfather of FIFA corruption who took bribes from former marketing partners ISL, could reach his 100th birthday in May 2016 before Rio host the Olympics. But after Havelange’s long fall from grace, Games organisers hope the stadium named after him, which will host the athletics, will henceforth be known as the Olympic Stadium — even if Havelange’s discredited name remains on the signage. Meanwhile, the relatively calm build-up to the Rio Olympics compared to the Brazil World Cup is being helped by the close relationship between the IOC and the local organising committee. FIFA in contrast was regarded as an unwelcome foreign power. Joao Havelange, the godfather of FIFA corruption, could reach his 100th birthday before Rio host the Olympics . FIFA secretary-general Jerome Valcke caused a furore when he said preparations needed a ‘kick up the backside’, while Rio 2016 communications director Mario Andrada says: ‘I don’t think the IOC need to say so.’ The major problem with Rio 2016 venues remains the troublesome £15million golf course, which is built on ecologically sensitive land. After years of planning difficulties, grass has finally been sown. But 50 protesters are camped outside complaining about damage to the fragile environment. They want the course lay-out changed to protect endangered species but water systems are already in place. RYDER CUP BUS REBATE . Credit to Ryder Cup Europe. They have reacted to horror stories — highlighted by Sports Agenda — about the official bus transport from Glasgow to Gleneagles during the tournament last September by refunding media visitors £50 per night of their hotel stay as a goodwill gesture. Ryder Cup Europe have refunded media visitors £50 per night of their hotel stay after horror travel stories . Europe retained the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in September, but some had problems travelling to the course . The local drivers frequently got lost on the single road route and one even stopped his coach for half an hour on the way to the course because he had completed his allotted hours. Sports Agenda will be using Ryder Cup Europe’s unprecedented action as a benchmark as to how event organisers should respond after poor service. Ryder Cup chief Richard Hills said: ‘If we get something wrong, we will put our hands up.’ The New FIFA Now summit in Brussels on Wednesday has attracted a number of the usual go-to suspects when it comes to needing a soundbite bashing FIFA. Unfortunately this wholly worthwhile initiative of Tory MP Damian Collins is not being attended by any representative of a FIFA national football association — all fearful, no doubt, like the FA, of giving the event extra credence by their presence. Collins said: ‘We would like them to be there, and a lot of people in football support change, but do not have the courage of their convictions to speak out when it is vital to do so.’","Dan Ashworth was promoted to technical director of FA with no fanfare .

"That's no costume, those are the polar bears that caused the small town of Cape Churchill in Manitoba, Canada, to cancel Halloween. After polar bears were spotted lumbering across the frozen tundra, children were banned from going outdoors to trick or treat on Halloween night due to fears that the bears could attack. The small town of Churchill has a population of just over 800, and is known as the 'polar bear capital of the world.' Scroll down for video . After polar bears were spotted near Churchill, Manitoba, in Canada, children banned from going outside . Town children weren't able to go trick or treating on Halloween night for fear of bear attacks . Believe it or not, this isn't the first Canadian town that's been forced to cancel trick or treating because of these furry visitors. Though in the summer polar bears remain inland to hibernate, when autumn wanes, they are known to assemble on the shores of Hudson Bay to prepare for the water to freeze over. And sure enough - further along the western shore of the bay, about 260 km north of Churchill, the remote village of Arviat, Nunavut, was likewise forced to host an alternative, indoor Halloween celebration in order to 'prevent tragedy.' This is the second Canadian town forced to cancel Halloween activities due to polar bear activity . In Arviat, Nunavut, the village hosted an indoor Halloween at the community centre after bears were sighted . Arviat Senior Administrative Officer Steve England told CBC News that, being in the middle of polar bear season, it was their only real option. 'We're just trying to safeguard the younger population by offering an alternative,' he said. There are about 2,300 people in the town and 1,300 are children.","After polar bears spotted near town, children banned from going outside .

"The RFU are cashing in on a Rugby World Cup on home soil by bringing out six different England shirts in little more than 15 months. The rampant commercialism prevalent at Twickenham saw England kit suppliers Canterbury launch two shirts, which featured the controversial Victoria Cross motif, last September. These will be followed on to the market by another two World Cup shirts before the start of the tournament in September. And then there will be another double kit launch by England ahead of the 2016 Six Nations. England players wear an England rugby home kit released last year, which caused controversy over its design . Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford said last night: ‘Merchandising is an important part of sport but governing bodies must be responsible and help fans and parents by showing restraint.’ The RFU say the extra shirts, which start at £50 and go up to £90.99 for an exact replica, are being brought out because England cannot have sponsors 02 on their jersey during the World Cup — and the Canterbury deal is for two new strips per season. But there was public unrest when Nike brought out four England football kits in less than a year to take advantage of the 2014 World Cup. And rugby fans are being asked to fork out for even more changes of strip in a similar period. England's players model an alternative red kit they wore last year, with a Victoria Cross design on the top half . An RFU spokesman said: ‘We have brought out one new home and alternate strip each season for the last five years, as is normal across the sports industry. The prices have remained unchanged for three years and every penny made is invested back into the game.’ The RFU signed a four-year kit deal with Canterbury, understood to be worth more than £5million a year, in March 2012 when England’s rugby stock was at rock bottom after the 2011 World Cup debacle in New Zealand. The surprisingly big Canterbury offer allowed the RFU to reject Nike’s reduced renewal terms. The RFU signed a four-year kit deal with Canterbury in 2012, producing a succession of kits for the England . Headhunters Odgers are understood to be arranging the recruitment of the FA’s new chief executive at a significantly reduced fee. This is because the FA board’s nominations panel are prepared to do some of the work themselves, with chairman Greg Dyke making it known at the start of the process that he couldn’t see the need to hire a recruitment agency as the directors themselves could come up with a strong short-list to replace Alex Horne. FA concerns about any perceived cronyism in the appointment led to Odgers belatedly coming on board. Former England hooker Mark ‘Ronnie’ Regan’s obscene speech at last year’s rugby writers’ awards dinner — described as an all-time low in the organisation’s 55-year history — has also sadly sounded the death knell for guest speakers at the bash. The revamped, sanitised version at the Marriott Grosvenor Square had a brief gushing question and answer session with Jonny Wilkinson instead. But that was no replacement for an after-dinner speaker — indeed, part of the event’s charm was anticipating how awful the speech might be. Bring back Ronnie. England manager Roy Hodgson was at Upton Park on Tuesday night to watch the FA Cup action . The dinner Roy Hodgson sought to arrange with his England players during the long gap between internationals was due to be held at St George’s Park. But as there were no gaps in the crowded football calendar, the date has been scrapped and the senior England side have once again side-stepped attending a venue that is meant to be their headquarters. Sajid Javid, who has shown little or no interest in sport since becoming Culture Secretary, is nonetheless said to have been influential in the Government turning down House of Lords amendments to the Consumer Act that would have greatly helped regulate ticket touts in time for the Rugby World Cup. Javid has spoken previously about his enthusiastic support for the secondary ticket market. Lord Moynihan, who led the Lords campaign, said: ‘Every day the list of victims of crime grows as a result of inadequate regulation of the secondary market. ‘We will explore every way of protecting sports fans over the action of touts when the bill comes back to the House of Lords.’ Giles Clarke, looking over Lords Cricket Ground, is set to become president of the ECB . Any opposition to dictatorial Giles Clarke becoming president of the ECB evaporated at a meeting of the first-class counties who unanimously recommended a change of statute that will allow Clarke to deal with ICC issues in this new role. Yorkshire’s Colin Graves is certain to take over as chairman with an extended five-year term. But still to be worked out is how long Clarke can stay on as president without becoming a loose cannon. London Wasps’ move to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry looks to have got under the skin of Leicester, the best supported rugby club in the Midlands. The Tigers have been so exercised that they have booked giant billboard space at the entrance to Wasps’ new home to promote their long established history at the other end of the M69. Wasps have settled into their new home, the Ricoh Arena in Coventry , with two consecutive wins . The exodus of British rugby players across the Channel is at least balanced by legendary France flanker Serge Betsen’s decision to settle in Ealing, west London. The 40-year-old, who won 63 caps during a stellar 16-year career with Biarritz and Wasps, is gaining his training badges and intends to set up a rugby academy in his name.","The Rugby World Cup is hosted on home soil this year from September .

"England will be bidding to host a football tournament in 2018 after all — despite the ignominy that still surrounds their doomed World Cup campaign. The FA board agreed at their last meeting that England would apply to stage the European Under 17 Championship, with the decision due to be made by the UEFA executive committee in Nyon at the end of this month. FA relations with FIFA remain at rock bottom, ruling out any ambition of hosting a global competition for the foreseeable future. St George's Park would be the hub for the European Under 17 championship in 2018 - if the bid is successful . But there are no such problems with UEFA, with whom the FA have been bridge-building since the vote debacle in Zurich in 2010. And that despite three of the UEFA executive — Senes Erzik, Marios Lefkaritis and Angel Maria Villar Llona — taking part in the flawed World Cup election. The European Under 17 tournament, in which Germany’s World Cup-winning goalscorer Mario Gotze made his name, will feature 16 nations in 2018. The FA plan is for St George’s Park, outside Burton, to be the hub of the event, with other matches at nearby grounds. There is little or no job security in professional football, so the social media app Network90, designed to connect football people and help them find a role in the game, is starting to make an impression. This has been helped by the involvement in the burgeoning business of founder and double World Player of the Year Luis Figo. His hands-on approach included offering Network90 membership to Holland midfielder Demy de Zeeuw, who had advertised himself for work anywhere in the world on business recruitment site LinkedIn. Portugal legend Luis Figo hopes Network90 will help people connect together and find a role in the game . The remarkable crowds at Coventry’s Ricoh Arena to watch relocated Wasps point to a healthy Midlands appetite for rugby. Yet the only World Cup 2015 venue that still has tickets available for all three of its matches is Leicester City’s King Power Stadium. Nearby Welford Road, home to Leicester Tigers, is a rugby stronghold that would surely have sold out by now, but tournament organisers deemed its off-field facilities unsuitable for a World Cup. Meanwhile, ER2015 sold 200,000 tickets between November and Christmas Day, suggesting a campaign promoting buying tickets as Christmas presents proved successful. Over 15,000 people were in attendance to see Wasps win 41-16 at the Ricoh Arena on Sunday . Sky Sports have predictably taken up their option to extend their TV rights contract with the ECB until 2019. But this monopoly of live Test cricket comes when two county chief executives, Surrey’s Richard Gould and Yorkshire’s Mark Arthur, have gone public about the need for terrestrial TV exposure to arrest falling participation numbers and dwindling interest in domestic Twenty20. Gould has expressed the need for Test cricket cricket to receive more exposure on terrestrial TV . ITV drop Townsend . ITV Sport, having lost their FA Cup and live Champions League and Europa League rights, will not be renewing the contracts of pundit Andy Townsend and presenter Matt Smith at the end of the season. The decision was mutual with Townsend, one of the best operators in the difficult role of co-commentator. He wants to work on live football and has offers from international broadcasters. However, shedding football personnel doesn’t say much about ITV’s ambitions to take Match of the Day highlights off the BBC in the Premier League TV rights auction next month. Andy Townsend (right) will be leaving his role as co-commentator at ITV at the end of the season . David Gill, Manchester United director and England candidate for FIFA’s British vice-presidency, prefers to conduct his football business away from the spotlight. So it’s surprising Gill has agreed to talk about the contentious subject of third-party football ownership at a conference in Lisbon next week. Manchester United director David Gill will be talking about third-party football ownership in Lisbon next week .

"Chelsea’s proposed £25m-a-year shirt sponsorship with Turkish Airlines, reportedly close to agreement before Christmas, is understood to have stalled. Turkish Airlines, who have a major individual deal with Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, are still at the table but are believed to be cautious about paying that sky-high price. It would propel Chelsea above Liverpool and Arsenal in the PL shirt sponsorship table and into second place behind Manchester United. Chelsea's current shirt deal with Samsung began in 2005 but is up for renewal next season . Turkish Airlines have spread their wings and have linked up with Manchester United . Other companies remain in Chelsea talks but demanding owner Roman Abramovich wants his club to be the No 1 commercially, even though Old Trafford are in a different league. Their shirt sponsorship with Chevrolet is worth £53m annually. Chelsea say chief executive Ron Gourlay’s surprise departure last October was unconnected to no shirt sponsor having been secured to replace Samsung next season. But Gourlay’s exit was followed by a commercial revamp, with former Liverpool CEO Christian Purslow brought in to find that elusive backer. The ECB are considering producing their own TV highlights of next summer’s domestic T20 Blast to broadcast on YouTube and other social-media outlets. The radical plan is seen as a way of promoting the game to a younger audience when falling participation and dwindling T20 attendances are being blamed on Sky Sports’ monopoly of the live action until 2019. However, the ECB’s £67million-a-year deal with Sky — which bankrolls the game — allows for a separate T20 highlights agreement with terrestrial TV. The inaugural T20 Blast was won by Birmingham Bears last year . Andrew Flintoff made his return to the game in last year's competition after quitting the game in 2010 . None of the free-to-air stations has shown much interest in the deal because of the big production costs and cricket’s dependence on weather. So, influential voices in the ECB are looking at the governing body using their Sky-funded cash reserves to set up their own TV station. This would film the T20 competition in-house for wide distribution, such is the belief that cricket needs to find new followers. This urgency is demonstrated by the desire to have a developed ECB TV — there is already an England cricket video news service on the internet — to cover T20 this summer. The BBC, accused  of treating its employees like ‘the enemy’ after it emerged 37 staff email accounts had been monitored as part of leak investigations, have long conducted internal inquiries to find moles — even for relatively innocuous stories. After Sportsmail reported comments by former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson  from a BBC forum attended by 400 people, the BBC investigations unit examined mobile phone records of those suspected of talking to Sports Agenda. Adidas replace Nike as the £750m Manchester United kit supplier next season. And the first signs of the swoosh shift in emphasis to the noisy neighbours comes with City manager Manuel Pellegrini holding a question-and-answer session in the Nike store in Abu Dhabi next week, during a winter training break. Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson is said to have become a lot less co-operative about Nike promotions after the US company ceased their individual deal with him. FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who said he would wait until the New Year celebrations were over before confirming he will stand for a fifth term, is now planning a low-key election campaign with a short mission statement next month. The challenge from Prince Ali of Jordan is not causing much anxiety. FIFA insiders reckon only 10 territories in UEFA will oppose Blatter — one being the FA. 78-year-old Sepp Blatter is set to stand for a fifth term as FIFA president since taking over in 1998 . There was sensitivity around Liverpool over the Christmas period about the sale of Warrior-supplied replica kit, because parent company New Balance will be on rebranded Liverpool shirts next season. The American sports manufacturers have a heavy presence in Asia, where Liverpool want to make inroads. The need to stay in the Premier League whatever the cost is demonstrated by the five clubs interested in bringing striker Jermain Defoe back from Major League Soccer — Sunderland, who won the chase, Hull, QPR, Crystal Palace and Leicester are all in the bottom six.","Chelsea's current deal with Samsung expires at the end of the season .

"Each night, when the floodlights are switched on at the Hale End academy in Walthamstow, the next generation of Arsenal hopefuls rush out of various meeting rooms and head for the playing surfaces. Sometimes David Beckham is there, or his mum Sandra, smiling at Brooklyn, Romeo or Cruz as they rush past to join in with the various age groups. Frank Lampard Snr’s grandson, a nifty little midfielder, is also making his way through the academy in Arsenal’s colours. But this is not about celebrity and no-one is at Hale End to make up the numbers. Arsenal academy manager Andries Jonker (left) watching a pre-season friendly with Steve Morrow . Jonker (left) was at Bayern Munich with Louis van Gaal, where he served as his compatriot's assistant (right) Under the club’s new academy manager Andries Jonker, who was recruited last season to replace Liam Brady after his retirement, Arsenal believe they can shape the future of English football. Standards are high and the target is to develop players who will one day take the place of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez or Danny Welbeck. If they do, it will be done at a fraction of the cost. Suddenly there is a determination about the place to produce some special players, technically and physically proficient enough to bring them through the system with some modern coaching methods. Jonker was introduced to Arsenal supporters last night, interviewed in the matchday programme after settling in to his new role. ‘I have come into another culture, another society in England and another football society, which is typical here and different to other countries,’ was one of his first observations. It is Jonker’s job to realign Arsenal’s youth teams with the best teams on the continent. When Brady left at the end of last season, Jonker was invited to the former academy director’s farewell BBQ with staff from the club. He said just two words: ‘Improve it.’ That is the ambition around the place, with a new voice dedicating to bringing through the next generation of players who can fit in to the Arsenal way. When the young players arrive for the start of their three-hour long training session, they are taken aside and told what will be expected of them that evening. Game intelligence is key. Jonker, a Dutch coach with experience of working alongside Louis van Gaal at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, is driving this project home. There was a time when the academy system in English football was ruled by the biggest boys. Arsenal want their players to have the biggest brains, cultivating them with first class coaching and encouraging to pick up the habits that can lead to a career in the game. On the continent, as Jonker conceded in his interview, they are streets ahead in terms of developing players at youth level. Arsenal are doing their bit to change it, taking the responsibility of bringing English players through. Good on them for that. Arsenal have brought through some greats, such as Tony Adams, Brady, Ashley Cole and Paul Merson as well as Jack Wilshere in the current side, but the sport has changed, with tactics, systems and emotional intelligence playing an increasing part in the modern game. Tony Adams (right) was Arsenal captain for more than a decade after coming through the ranks . Ashley Cole is hated by Gooners now but was loved for being a London lad and academy graduate . Jack Wilshere, the latest high-profile graduate of the academy, in League Cup action against Southampton . Arsenal, under the guidance of Jonker and his Dutch assistants Frans de Kat and Jan van Loon, are adapting to the demands. They know the kids watch YouTube or play FIFA on their PlayStations, picking up the skills refined by Ronaldinho, Lionel Messi, or even Thierry Henry during his time as an Arsenal player. The biggest problem is converting the ability, teaching players when to lay off the ball and when to pull out Zidane’s La Roulette trick, Cruyff’s legendary turn or Maradona’s twisting runs. Most players can learn these skills over time, but working out when to use them, at the very highest levels in youth football, is a lot tougher. At Arsenal, they want it ingrained. This is a new philosophy, a new approach. The squads are streamlined and some of the groups have as few as 10 kids. The young players, those who have yet to hit their teens, spend more time practising one-on-one drills, two-on-one or three-on-two to give them more time working with the ball and learning how to win it back. Centre half Isaac Hayden comes away with the ball against the Saints at the Emirates . Ospina, Bellerin, (Akpom) Chambers, Hayden, Coquelin, Rosicky, Diaby (Cazorla), Campbell (Oxlade-Chamberlain), Wilshere, Podolski, Sanchez. (Arsenal academy graduates in bold) They are too young to absorb too much information about game intelligence, particularly after a long day at school. The older kids can soak up a bit more, listening intently and learning how to play the game. Every position on the field has minimum expectations and Arsenal’s young players must adapt to these principles. Most of the kids have come straight from school, sometimes an hour long journey away and ferried to east London by their parents. On the sidelines, they have to keep the peace. Shouting is not tolerated at Hale End. The guidance and instruction is for the coaches, explaining each session to the kids before it is delivered in a series of pre-planned exercises. The FA, who are watching closely, hope Arsenal can crack it. Like our Arsenal Facebook page.","Arsenal trying to bring through young talent at Hale End Academy .

"The terms and conditions on tickets for the PDC World Darts Championships at Alexandra Palace said the wearing of football shirts was forbidden in order not to stir up club rivalry. However, the nearest to a crowd disturbance after the final last Sunday involved two Crystal Palace players Jason Puncheon and Barry Bannan, who went to the event following the club’s FA Cup third-round win at Dover Athletic. Witnesses report that a highly-agitated Puncheon had to be restrained by Bannan after being taunted by football fans as he left the venue following Gary Anderson’s victory. Crystal Palace winger Jason Puncheon had to be restrained by team-mate Barry Bannan (right) Puncheon, pictured with Manchester City player Samir Nasri, attended the darts final on Sunday . Puncheon, whose high and wide penalty miss against Tottenham a year ago has been described as the worst ever, was said to have been eager to confront his hecklers head-on but he was sensibly bundled into a car by Bannan and other friends. A PDC darts spokesman said: ‘The two Palace players had paid for VIP seats and they left the venue without incident.’ A spokesman for Crystal Palace did not dispute what happened but did not comment. The unusual kick-off time of 7.55pm for BBC’s coverage of the AFC Wimbledon vs Liverpool FA Cup tie on Monday has prompted conspiracy theories about the Beeb wanting to start the second half before the return of acclaimed series Broadchurch on ITV. Host Gary Lineker urged viewers at the interval to stay with the Cup drama. However, the Beeb insist the start time was planned to give them the required build-up period and that live games in previous rounds had the same schedule. Liverpool's FA Cup match against AFC Wimbledon kicked off at the unusual time of 7:55 . Geoff Boycott, blocked from a knighthood by the Cabinet Office because of his disputed conviction in France 16 years ago for an alleged attack on former girlfriend Margaret Moore, would not have had his worthy cause helped by his choice of PR advisor in his legal fight against the French justice system. It was disgraced celebrity publicist Max Clifford, jailed for eight years last May for a string of indecent assaults. Geoff Boycott chose to employ Max Clifford as his PR advisor during fight against the French justice system . Uefa chief Michel Platini was seen deep in conversation with Prince Ali in the gardens of the Mamounia Hotel during last month’s FIFA summit in Marrakech, but there is no UEFA deal in place to support the Jordanian’s candidature against Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency. Prince Ali, who will struggle for votes even from within his own Asian confederation, will discover that UEFA is split over Blatter, who enjoys considerable support in Eastern Europe. Not having all UEFA behind him was the reason Holland’s Michael van Praag did not stand. FIFA vice president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan will run for football's top job against Sepp Blatter . MCC goes star crazy . The endless internal warfare within MCC now sees Lord’s members irate that the management committee have given a preferential star to four candidates — including Mike Gatting — that they would most like to see elected from the seven standing for election. Those snubbed include Mark Williams, nominated by Mike Atherton and Sir John Major. Williams is standing for re-election and supports the aborted Lord’s Vision redevelopment. Vocal member Paddy Briggs, in a letter to chairman Oliver Stocken, describes the star system as ‘authoritarian and secretive cronyism’, adding: ‘Any candidate who disagrees with the party line receives no starring. It is undemocratic, elitist and self-aggrandising.’ Mike Gatting, pictured at Wimbledon, is among a list of four preferential candidates . The England footballers’ code of conduct, introduced in 2012 following a series of indiscretions, has been mothballed. But it will surely have to be dusted down for a decision on Saido Berahino’s immediate international future if he is found guilty of drink driving. The West Brom striker was stopped by police on the M6 in October but the FA knew nothing about the arrest when he was called up in November. Berahino was charged and will appear at North Cheshire magistrates on January 19. West Brom ace Saido Berahino could be left out of future England squads if he is found guilty of drink driving .

"FIFA executives were seriously divided at their meeting in Morocco over Michael Garcia’s World Cup corruption report, despite their later pretence that there was unanimous support for publication of the document. Some ExCo members were upset Garcia mentioned in his resignation statement that the 25-strong committee had reported him to the FIFA disciplinary committee for breaking ethics rules after he spoke out in favour of transparency around his findings. Then Spain’s Angel Maria Villar Llona, one of three ExCo members under investigation over World Cup bid conduct, astonished colleagues in Marrakech by admitting he alone had made the complaint about Garcia and wanted the minutes altered accordingly. Michael Garcia's report into the World Cup bidding process has divided FIFA . Whatever the findings of the report, the 2022 World Cup will go ahead in Qatar . Only Sepp Blatter's health can prevent the FIFA president from running for another term . American Sunil Gulati, one of the FIFA modernisers, also ensured previous ExCo meeting minutes were changed to reflect that a number of the committee had wanted full publication from the start — which he felt president Sepp Blatter had not made clear. Meanwhile, Blatter’s health is now the only factor likely to stop him standing for a ludicrous fifth term. And Blatter, 79 in March, is said to be ‘invigorated’ by persuading the FIFA ExCo to accept full publication of the Garcia report. A split ExCo on this issue would have made life very difficult for him before the election in May. Certainly the relentless global travel to prop up his support does not seem to be weakening him. Blatter told Sports Agenda that his entourage feel the pace more than him. Sky Sports presenter Jeff Stelling has been approached about becoming president of Hartlepoolm United . Hartlepool's new Midlands-based ownership consortium have approached Soccer Saturday presenter Jeff Stelling, who promotes his team at every opportunity, to become president. And the Sky man’s acceptance of the ambassador role is sure to go down better with supporters than convicted rapist Ched Evans being linked with the Football League’s bottom club. The FIFA ExCo may have agreed to publish — where possible — the full Michael Garcia report into World Cup bid corruption but the governing body are braced for the American lawyer, who has resigned from his FIFA ethics role, to have plenty to say. His explosive missives, which could derail FIFA at any time, come via his Kirkland & Ellis law firm in Chicago without warning. There is obviously something very wrong with the way the Lawn Tennis Association nurture talent when friends say 21-year-old Oliver Golding, who was the US Open boys’ champion just three years ago, now intends to quit the sport. Oliver Golding, a former US Open boys' singles champion, is considering leaving the sport . RACING'S QATAR LOVE IN . Goodwood's racecourse’s extraordinary, decade-long festival sponsorship with the Qatar Equestrian Federation, worth at least £2.5million a year, highlights the contrast between football’s suspicion about Qatar’s World Cup bid and the way British racing has embraced the country’s massive patronage. British Horseracing Authority chairman Steve Harman said the Goodwood deal transcended racing and was great for British sport and trade. But Harman also summed up racing’s insular culture when he said football’s difficulties in accepting the wholly unsuitable Qatar as a World Cup stage was a ‘bit like a sideshow’. Goodwood launched their Qatar association at the top of London’s Shard, which is also owned by the money-no-object Qataris. Goodwood has struck up a lucrative festival deal in association with the money no object Qataris . David Kogan, the TV rights wizard behind the last five Premier League auctions, has left Wasserman Media Group to set up another company — Exile Enterprises — having previously sold Reel Enterprises to WMG three years ago.

"Click here to read Martin Samuel's full column on Radamel Falcao. 'They hate the way you walk,’ begins the latest stupid adidas advert, ‘they hate the way you talk...’ It’s Luis Suarez time again, folks. Oh, sure, the rest of the adidas roster is there, Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez, Karim Benzema — but by focusing on the hatred top footballers receive, the spiel is plainly inspired by one man. Shamelessly, adidas’s posters at the World Cup showed Suarez, teeth bared, like a ferocious beast, and tried to make a selling point of his previous poor behaviour. They were hastily taken down when he bit an opponent for the third time in his career, and fans took to posing with the pictures as if putting their heads in a lion’s mouth. Suarez and adidas were mocked mercilessly, but deservedly. Luis Suarez (centre) is no stranger to controversy and has invited fans to ‘bring on the hate’ in a new advert . Suarez, surrounded by negative headlines, is portrayed as the ‘Target Man’ as he poses and smiles here . Suarez was caught up in another moment of infamy when he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini last summer . Gareth Bale stars in the advert as the Real Madrid star poses with the words: 'There will be haters' ‘There will be haters,’ is the latest campaign message. And indeed there will. But not when Suarez (below) just plays his football. Last season, on the back of a brilliant and unsullied Premier League season, Suarez’s fellow professionals made him their player of the year and the football writers did the same. He was universally praised for the performance that knocked England out of the World Cup, too. Then he bit Giorgio Chiellini, got banned, and Uruguay were soundly beaten and eliminated in their next game by Colombia. So, in fact, people don’t hate the way Suarez walks and they don’t hate the way he talks. They hate that he keeps biting people. And that adidas tries to sell its football boots off the back of this. They really hate that. adidas are launching their latest set of f50, predator, nitrocharge and 11pro boots with the advert .","Barcelona's Luis Suarez has invited his so-called haters to bring it on .

"Sports ethics campaigner Jaimie Fuller is hoping to shame FIFA sponsors into backing calls for reform after turning his guns on football’s tarnished world governing body. Fuller, chairman and owner of compression sportswear market leaders SKINS, played a part in changing cycling’s governance and in the battle against doping. His focus is now on changing FIFA after meeting fellow Australian Bonita Mersiades, who blew the whistle on World Cup corruption. The sports industry leader, who will attend the Brussels summit next week organised by Tory MP Damian Collins to debate a new FIFA, will write to all FIFA sponsors and related football companies urging them to join the reform bandwagon. Australian entrepreneur and sports ethics campaigner Jaimie Fuller is intent on bringing FIFA into line . Fuller accepts it's unlikely that president Sepp Blatter (right), pictured with Cristiano Ronaldo, will be usurped . Fuller said: ‘I feel it is my duty as part of the industry to call the sports governing bodies to account for their conduct. It’s a disgrace how many influential voices prefer to keep quiet. ‘I know it is highly unlikely that Sepp Blatter will be usurped, but it’s worth the effort and I’m in this for the long haul to try to improve football’s leadership, as we did with cycling.’ Sceptics will see Fuller’s involvement as a platform to promote the aims of SKINS, who will be launching their own anti-Blatter campaign. He doesn’t deny those opportunities exist but says any publicity will be far from cheap, given the personal funding involved in the reform projects. Bookmakers Paddy Power have endorsed David Ginola to challenge Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency . Rampant self-publicists Paddy Power will be parading former Spurs and Newcastle star David Ginola as their endorsed candidate for the FIFA presidency on Friday morning in partnership with another Blatter-bashing pressure group, ChangeFIFA. The bookmakers claim it is not a stunt — fat chance! — but whether their candidate receives the required five nominations from national associations is another matter . England manager Roy Hodgson, who had to abort a player get-together because no date could be agreed, should have held it at the O2 Arena on Thursday night, where 60 Premier League players were on the guest list for the NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Milwaukee Bucks. Cesc Fabregas (right) and Didier Drogba were two of around 60 Premier League stars invited to watch the NBA Game between New York Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks . Arsenal legend Thiery Henry looked less than impressed by the antics of Bucks mascot Bango . Meanwhile the full house at the O2 — and BT Sport’s decision to extend their NBA coverage — makes a mockery of UK Sport’s withdrawal of funding for elite British basketball because it lacks Olympic medal potential. One hopes UK Sport’s review of their strict criteria will accommodate worthy team sports in future. The RFU defend having six different England kits in 15 months by saying that every penny made is reinvested in the game. The proceeds made from England's ever-changing kits won't necessarily benefit all fans . So what is the latest renovation taking place at Twickenham? A complete refurbishment ahead of the World Cup of that hub of grass-roots rugby — the royal box. THIS GIRL'S GONE VIRAL . Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign has exceeded 5,000,000 plays on Facebook since it was launched last Monday — strong evidence of the immediate impact of the £10million project to give women of all shapes, sizes and abilities the confidence to do more sport and exercise. The bold 90-second video aimed at taking away the fear of sport — with lines such as ‘sweating like a pig, feeling like a fox’ — is targeting women between 14 and 40, a demographic which has 2,000,000 fewer participants in regular sport than its male counterpart. The This Girl Can campaign is giving women confidence to exercise, with over half a million plays on Facebook . There has been criticism from national governing bodies that the TV advertising blitz over the next five weeks, and then again in May and June, will not effect enough change to justify the cost. Indeed, some have called it a vanity project for Sport England CEO Jennie Price and Minister for Sport Helen Grant, who approved the funding. But Price said: ‘We have had fantastic feedback and the cost is minimal compared to what we hand out to sport. This is a much-needed campaign which I’ve wanted to do for some time but needed Government backing for the spend.’ It has caused some consternation in the shires that Yorkshire’s Colin Graves is giving interviews as if he were already in situ as the new chairman of the ECB. That is likely to happen but nominations for the post don’t close until the end of the month and any appointment needs to be ratified by the 41 ECB stakeholders.","Jamie Fuller will write to all FIFA sponsors asking them to back a reform .

"Santi Cazorla looked dead on his feet. The first Arsenal substitution had been made and more than a few were surprised it had not been his number called. Not that he was playing badly. He had been quite, quite brilliant, but had run himself into the ground keeping the champions quiet. All of Arsenal’s midfield were relentless in their commitment to this cause. Still, there was a free-kick to be taken and Cazorla is Arsenal’s free-kick taker. He chipped a curling ball into the Manchester City area, where Olivier Giroud outran, outthought and outmuscled Fernando to apply a delightfully weighted glancing header. Joe Hart was nowhere. Two goals clear, the game was won. Olivier Giroud (right) nods the ball past Joe Hart in the Manchester City goal to double Arsenal's advantage . Hart can only look back in anger as the ball nestles in his net and Arsenal head off in celebration at scoring a second goal .

CLICK HERE for our amazing MATCH ZONE feature where you can see goal graphics, heat maps and more. The best Arsenal performance of recent years? Quite possibly. Certainly it is hard to recall a more effective one. Cazorla was magnificent, the man of the match. Close behind him was Francis Coquelin, a wonderfully effective destroyer in central midfield. Laurent Koscielny was outstanding in the heart of defence, but a back four that included Nacho Monreal and Hector Bellerin barely wavered. Before the game all the talk was of Alexis Sanchez, the one that got away, considering he shares his Chilean nationality with City manager Manuel Pellegrini. Yet it was Arsenal’s humble foot soldiers who were the heroes here. Sergio Aguero was smothered, so too David Silva. The supply line was cut and City looked insipid. There was no-one with the drive of Yaya Toure, reduced to tweeting good luck messages from Equatorial Guinea, and even Frank Lampard had no impact from the bench. While the second-half performance was an improvement on the first, by the end City were reduced to pumping high balls to Edin Dzeko. By then, Arsenal were too practised at containment to be worried. They cantered towards the conclusion, deserved winners. Manchester United and fourth place are very much in their sights. Santi Cazorla fired home the opening goal from the penalty spot as he sent the ball past the outstretched arms of keeper Hart . Nacho Monreal hits the brick wall of Vincent Kompany as he attempts to get on the end of a ball into the Manchester City box . Monreal was caught by Kompany with the contact sending the left back crashing to the ground inside the penalty box . Monreal's fall handed Arsenal the perfect opportunity to go in front at the Etihad and Cazorla did not waste his opportunity . Manchester City captain argues his case with referee Mike Dean after conceding the first-half penalty at the Etihad . Cazorla leads the Arsenal celebrations after the Spaniard kept his cool to fire home from the penalty spot . Cazorla is joined in his celebration by striker Giroud who would go on to double the visitors' advantage in the second half . This was a huge result, not just for Arsenal, but for English football. Chelsea have not just gained an extra three points, but seven goals at the top of the table. Add their 5-0 win at Swansea City to Manchester City’s 2-0 defeat and this is the biggest weekend of the season so far. Chelsea face City at home on January 31, their next league game. Win that and they can begin planning the parade. If City do not bounce back speedily from this, or find a way to cover Toure’s stint with Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations, the title race could be over sooner than many imagined. That Jose Mourinho has been aided by Arsenal’s ‘specialist in failure’ Arsene Wenger is an irony that should not be lost on him. This was a Wenger team few expect to see, an Arsenal with guts and resilience. So many of the qualities it has been felt Arsenal lack were present in this game. This was an Arsenal that stuck at it, that grafted, that played City on the counter-attack, that soaked it up, that were tenacious, determined, superb without the ball. And yet they had the best chances, too. Arsenal in possession were quick and had purpose. City were ponderous, hesitant. A first-timer, told that one of these teams was chasing the league leaders would have instantly plumped for the band in yellow. They may not have seen as much of the ball but, when they did get it, they knew what to do. Kompany fouls Giroud and is then shown the yellow card as Manchester City fought to get back into the game at the Etihad . Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain clashes with Manchester City's Sergio Aguero as they vie for possession during the . If the criticism is that Arsenal cannot play a clever, containing game on the break, here was Wenger’s eloquent response. At times in the first half Arsenal’s possession statistic dropped as low as 21 per cent, yet they look dangerous with the ball, goalkeeper David Ospina did not have a save of consequence to make until the 47th minute, and the midfield worked devilishly hard at making City’s forwards look pedestrian. It was a performance that left the locals noisily frustrated. By half-time they were in a snit with their team, and Mike Dean the referee, news clearly having reached the Etihad of the contentious nature of Arsenal’s lead. It was a minute from hell for Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany. He brought the ball out from the back, seemed uncertain what to do with it, kicked the floor as he made his mind up, then fell over. (This is perhaps why you don’t give your Ballon D’Or votes to tenacious, robust defensive types.) Soon after he was shaping up to Arsenal’s Monreal, who slipped the ball inside and ran for the one-two. Kompany didn’t stick a foot out, but he didn’t entirely avoid contact either. He stood his ground — as is his right — but with the tiniest movement to slow Monreal’s path. The pair made minimal contact but it was enough for Monreal to throw himself to the ground, and Dean bought it. He pointed to the spot to Kompany’s astonishment, and Cazorla planted the ball to Hart’s left, leaving him no chance. Sergio Aguero, Steven Jovetic and Frank Lampard look dejected as Manchester City head for a crushing defeat by Arsenal . Cazorla crashes into Argentine striker Aguero and concedes the foul, earning himself a booking in the process . Arsene Wenger appeals to the officials during a 2-0 win at Manchester City as his Arsenal side prevailed at the Etihad . Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey evades the attention of Manchester City pair Jesus Navas (right) and Fernando (left) Aguero watches on as he narrowly misses out on connecting with a cross in front of Arsenal's goal during the 2-0 defeat . David Silva was well marked all match by a resilient Arsenal midfield, as Francis Coquelin slides in to stop the Spaniard on this occasion . City’s initial response was innocuous. Indeed, the only chance worth a shout before Pellegrini regrouped at half-time fell to Arsenal. An Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain cross after 19 minutes was deflected wide by Kompany after Giroud’s header. Of course, they couldn’t be as poor in the second half and so it proved. Having not had a shot inside 36 minutes, they applied real pressure after the restart. Ospina — again included ahead of Wojciech Szczesny but hardly inspiring greater confidence — tipped round from Aguero, perhaps unnecessarily, and a fierce effort from Jesus Navas was parried moments later. But Arsenal always looked more likely to score, thanks to resolute defending and the uncertainty of a City back line that has now conceded more league goals than Manchester United this season. The visitors could have been two clear even earlier after a fine move involving Sanchez and Giroud ended with Aaron Ramsey spare on the left but shooting over. Soon after, a quite brilliant touch by Koscielny denied Aguero again, following a cross from Navas, but this was Arsenal at their finest this season. Not always beautiful, but intelligent and efficient, with a strength that had been presumed beyond them. No one was jeering Wenger as he made his way back to London this time.

"My colleague Martin Keown was right. Marko Arnautovic’s push on Mathieu Debuchy when Stoke City played Arsenal was cowardly and dangerous, and should have been dealt with more harshly.

I am surprised that more was not made of Marko Arnautovic’s cowardly push on Mathieu Debuchy. The Stoke man shoved Debuchy while he was in mid-air and now Arsenal’s right back is out for three months with a dislocated shoulder after he crashed into an advertising hoarding.

"The loss of Match of the Day highlights rights in the Premier League auction could trigger the departure of star football presenter Gary Lineker from the BBC. BT Sport have coveted Lineker as their Champions League host since they won the rights from Sky in November 2013 in a three-year agreement with UEFA that starts next season. And initial approaches were said to have been made to Lineker last summer. But BT are waiting until the outcome of the PL rights tender next month before making their big move for the former Tottenham Hotspur and England striker, who has established himself as the BBC’s top sports anchor. Losing Match of the Day would leave the corporation with too little football to justify Lineker’s seven-figure salary. MOTD presenter Gary Lineker could leave the BBC if they lose the rights to Premier League highlights . Lineker, who also works for American network NBC, is contracted exclusively to the BBC for one more season in the UK in a deal that runs concurrently with their MOTD rights.

BT, having spent an astonishing £897million on capturing the Champions League want to make some big signings - and Lineker fits the bill. Prince Ali of Jordan can at least count on some family advice about the murky world of sports politics in his uphill battle to usurp Sepp Blatter as FIFA President.

Sky Sports’ high command are said to be incandescent about county cricket chiefs campaigning for the return of the sport to terrestrial TV to arrest declining participation and poor Twenty20 crowds when there is no appetite among free-to-air networks for live cricket. Sky spend £67million each year bankrolling the game which allowed the ECB to lavish hundreds of thousands of pounds on the bizarre #RISE marketing campaign during the Ashes series in 2013. They have also brought in another agency, FutureProof, to look at fresh ways of branding the England team for this summer’s Ashes. England coach Peter Moores is understood to have been enthusiastic about the re-branding investment. And the counties were behind an elongated domestic T20 competition that hasn’t worked compared with an exciting, and shorter, Big Bash, or IPL involving the world’s best players. Sky Sports are incandescent about county cricket chiefs campaigning to have the sport back on terrestrial TV . BT Sport say their latest promo - ‘the cool people to watch football with’ - featuring a swaggering Reservoir Dogs-style Jake Humphrey, Owen Hargreaves, Robbie Savage and Michael Owen, is meant to be tongue-in-cheek.

"Three cheers for Jose... the only manager who sees festive fixtures like a fan . Whoever grants Christmas wishes is really on the ball this year. It was December 20, following defeat by Manchester City, when Neil Warnock again voiced his desire to return to media work, so he could properly let loose on the failings of referees. And now he can. Just nine days after blaming the officials for losing 3-0 to a team with no striker, Warnock is gone. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish heard one excuse too many, considered the direction of the club after a fall into the bottom three and Warnock became the Premier League’s first managerial casualty of the season. He can now rail against referees to his heart’s content — although whether BT Sport want an expert with Warnock’s record telling Arsene Wenger where he’s going wrong is another matter. Neil Warnock was sacked as Crystal Palace manager after a Boxing Day defeat by Southampton . Steve Parish (left, pictured with Mark Bright at Loftus Road on Sunday) is now looking for a replacement . Warnock’s statistics as a manager in the Premier League or the old First Division read played 118, won 27. He has taken 110 points from a possible 354, at an average of 0.93 per game. That is a history of relegation form — an aggregate of 35.3 points a season. Queens Park Rangers sacked him for fear of getting relegated, Sheffield United and Notts County stayed loyal and went down. Palace are not prepared to wait around to find out. Perhaps the final straw came with Warnock’s comments after the Boxing Day defeat at home to Southampton. He blamed misfortune. ‘I thought they had a lot of luck last year,’ he said of Palace. ‘I don’t see us having the same luck this year.’ Neil Warnock claimed that Tony Pulis' (pictured) Palace were afforded a lot of luck last season . In reality, Palace had defensive organisation to gather them points, rather than a sprinkling of fairy dust . Parish said he slept on it before making the decision to jettison Warnock, and it may have been that comment swirling around in his head. Luck? If it was just about luck, it wouldn’t matter who the manager was. If all Palace had to do was wait for fortune to intervene then they wouldn’t need a manager at all. Tony Pulis got lucky, poor old Neil Warnock didn’t. It is as if the two were interchangeable, as if all managers are without talent and merely blown by the wind. And Warnock would like this to be true, because then his aggregate of 0.93 points per game would be a random event, and in no way his responsibility. It would be like those other times — Carlos Tevez and Rafael Benitez’s weakened Liverpool team, and another round of faceless, incompetent officials, who always seem to gang up on him at this level. ‘Quite a lot of luck went with them last year,’ Warnock added. ‘We must be due some now.’ Warnock has an average of 0.93 points per game in the Premier League - it is a history of relegation form . Pulis and Parish speak at a press conference announcing the former's appointment on August 25, 2013 . Of course, if Warnock wants to believe his failures are in the hands of fate, that is his delusion — but to deny what Pulis achieved at Palace last season is plain wrong. He took over a club joint bottom with seven points from 12 games and propelled them to 11th in the table. Yes, there were occasions when matches were won on the break or against the run of play, but that was more down to defensive organisation than a sprinkling of fairy dust. The fact is Palace averaged 0.58 points per game when Pulis arrived and 1.46 points during his reign. At that rate, had he been in charge for the season, the club would have finished ninth. The incredible comeback to help deprive Liverpool of the league title stands out, but before that Palace went on a five-game winning run, defeating Chelsea, Cardiff City, Aston Villa, Everton and West Ham United. That isn’t luck. Pulis’s defence wasn’t constructed by accident, either. Under him, Palace were tight. He lost 10 league games, but five by single-goal margins, and four by two-goal deficits to Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. Palace finished 12th in the Premier League last season, their highlight a 3-3 draw against Liverpool . Dwight Gayle (right) slots the ball past Simon Mignolet to level the scores at 3-3 on May 5, 2014 . Only Newcastle United gave Pulis’s Palace what might be termed a hiding — 3-0 on December 21. Pulis ruled himself out of a return on Saturday, which is a pity as he is exactly what Palace need right now. His great strength is that he does not care what people think of him, or his football teams. He is unapologetic, unconcerned by his reviews. If nobody likes him, he doesn’t care. Warnock likes to give that impression, but it isn’t true. Nobody who makes that many excuses has a thick skin. Warnock doesn’t like criticism. That’s why it is always the referee’s fault. That’s why it is all random, a matter of luck. He did not do a particularly rotten job at Crystal Palace. They had lost two games before he took over — including one to a last-minute Aaron Ramsey goal away at Arsenal — and managed to secure wins at Everton and at home to Liverpool. Parish slept on his decision to sack Warnock, but woke up in the morning convinced he needed better . Yannick Bolasie (left) has been a shining light this season, but is set to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations . Captain Mile Jedinak (left) is also a Palace stalwart, but is leaving to represent Australia in the Asia Cup . They were not adrift like Leicester City and only one win short of 15th place on the day he was sacked. Yet the squad had improved from Pulis’s time but in defence, Palace looked increasingly poor. They had won a single game against teams in the bottom eight, and two vital players, Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, will be missing for the best part of January, on international duty for Australia and DR Congo at the Asia Cup and the Africa Cup of Nations. Warnock was staking his hopes on the January transfer window, but Palace did not wish to spend extravagantly to survive. So Parish turned the bedside light out, and awoke convinced he needed more. He will be painted as a trigger-happy chairman, the first to crack — and nobody would say Palace’s path since the end of last season has been stable — but to judge Parish too harshly would be a mistake. Perhaps, by sacking Warnock, he was merely trying to make his own luck.","Neil Warnock claimed Palace had a lot of luck with Tony Pulis last season .

"Martin Atkinson is the most experienced international referee in the Premier League and well aware of time-wasting tactics. After a revelatory and most welcome post-match interview for Match Of The Day following Chelsea’s first defeat of the season at Newcastle, Jose Mourinho was gracious in defeat. Then, when speaking to the written media, he changed. VIDEO Scroll down to see Mourinho blame Newcastle ball boys . Jose Mourinho blamed the ball boys for time-wasting towards the end of Chelsea's loss to Newcastle . John Terry can only watch on as Papiss Cisse sends the ball into the Chelsea net at St James' Park . Rather than a consistent story, Mourinho bemoaned the time taken by the ball boys at St James’ Park to return the ball — which was rich coming from a ‘master of the dark arts’ who knows and has used every trick in the book. Somehow he tried to blame them for the defeat. Atkinson, like all referees, is briefed to watch for such tactics and add time to allow for that lost in the ball being returned. On Saturday he added six minutes at the end of the second half. Mourinho's side lost for the first time in the league this season, and at first he was gracious in defeat . The Newcastle team celebrate at the full-time whistle after beating Chelsea in the Premier League . It does not have to stop there. If he feels that the ball boys are deliberately acting in an unsporting way he can dispense with their services, as he can if he feels they are acting differently for the two teams involved. Clearly, he did not feel this was the case and from what I saw I felt he was right — just like Mourinho did after the match and before his mischievous side got the better of him.","Chelsea suffered their first defeat of the season against Newcastle .

"It is becoming hard to sustain, all this outrage. Every week, new anger. Nought to lunacy in a tweet, a misplaced word, or a thought that hasn’t been properly processed by the standards committee. Charlie Nicholas could not quickly distinguish between Fernando and Fernandinho of Manchester City in a live update. His apology came fast enough, though. Terrified at being thought racist, and cowed by the usual nonsense on social media, Sky Sports told senior broadcaster Jeff Stelling to take the lead. He apologised on Nicholas’ behalf, and his colleague offered further words of contrition. Charlie Nicholas apologised for the comments on Sky Sports News . Nicholas couldn't tell the difference between Fernandinho (left) and Fernando (right) in a split second . Fernandinho celebrates after opening the scoring for Manchester City against Everton . ‘Jeff, they both physically look the same and sometimes you don’t catch the number, so you actually don’t quite know what one is what,’ Nicholas said. It was a decent gesture, at least, but unnecessary. In his error, Nicholas wasn’t saying that all black men look the same to him; he was saying that, at a glance, Fernando and Fernandinho do. And they do, the same way some white footballers look like other white footballers in full flow, the way that, bizarrely, Wayne Rooney must have looked like Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain the night Clive Tyldesley momentarily confused them when England played Scotland. It happens. In the press box after a goal has been scored there will often be questions, uncertainty - about the scorer, the provider, did it take a deflection, who was the last defender. Not because people aren’t paying attention but because a melee of guys challenging for the ball in a small space can be hard to distinguish - and because one player can look like another, black or white. Nicky Barmby and Craig Hignett were known as The Midget Gems during their time at Middlesbrough. A comparison between Manchester City's two midfielders - Fernandinho and Fernando . Fernandinho, celebrating with Sergio Aguero, put Manchester City in front at Goodison Park n Saturday . The Brazilian midfielder was unmarked in the six-yard box to flick a header into the bottom corner . It was a running joke how many times the stadium announcer got their identities mixed up when announcing the scorer’s name. Sometimes, for fun, they would sign as each other for autograph hunters. They marvelled at how infrequently this was picked up, too. Thomas Gravesen and Lee Carsley were the heart of a hard-working midfield under David Moyes at Everton. When Gravesen landed a move to Real Madrid it was speculated - only half in jest - that the Spaniards rated him so highly because credit for half of Carsley’s work went his way, too. Racist? Hardly. Two stocky, pale, white guys with shaved heads, powering around the midfield can look like twins; and two black guys, too. Fernando and Fernandinho have similar skin, similar hair, a similar slender build, play a similar position and wear the same shirt, shorts and socks. Fernandinho (fifth right) and Fernando (fourth right) jump to block Leighton Baines' free-kick . Fernando (right) congratulates team-mate Fernandinho following his goal . There is a way of telling them apart, beyond the extra syllable, because Fernando is three inches taller - although it is unlikely it will have looked that way on Nicholas’ monitor. So, given seconds to call the scorer of Manchester City’s goal, he confessed they looked alike to him. Perhaps he could have chosen his words more wisely but he meant no insult. Jonathan Pearce described the same event for Match of the Day. With 30 years’ experience behind the microphone he waited to give the name of the scorer until he could be absolutely sure. The pair embrace on the field following Fernandinho's (left) goal . Nicholas, by contrast, was Arsenal’s centre forward in his previous life; he blundered through like a well-meaning amateur and fell foul of the professionally offended. The rest is up to us. Do we see sense in these moments and accept an honest mistake, or continue to indulge the ever-present faux-controversy? Do we steel ourselves for genuine fights against prejudice, or waste time on trivialities? Nicholas did the polite thing by apologising but not the right thing. Sadly, saying sorry only encourages some people. Steven Naismith beat Joe Hart to the ball to head in Leighton Baines' free-kick . The equaliser from forward Naismith on Saturday saw Manchester City lose ground on league leaders Chelsea .","Charlie Nicholas confused Manchester City midfielders Fernandinho and Fernando after the former scored against Everton on Saturday .

"How bad does a tackle have to be to earn a red card in the Premier League these days? Watching the closing stages of Manchester United’s win at Southampton, I was disappointed but not surprised to see Sadio Mane escape with just a booking from Kevin Friend after wiping out Robin van Persie with a tackle that could have hurt the striker. Select group officials are refereeing with so much leniency we cannot be surprised when dangerous tackles are not punished strongly. Sadio Mane's ugly lunge on Robin van Persie could, and should, have earned him a red card on Monday . Both Fernando (left) and Eliaquim Mangala (right) should have been dismissed for high and dangerous tackles . A different type of foul also escaped censure at St Mary’s on Monday night when Marouane Fellaini fouled Victor Wanyama with his feet and followed through with his arm. Dangerous play but not even a yellow card was given. Friend is not alone - there were at least four other red-card challenges at the weekend where the guilty players stayed on the pitch. Manchester City had a double let-off from Andre Marriner, who failed to dismiss Eliaquim Mangala for what can only be described as a flying karate kick on Everton’s Samuel Eto’o. There can be no excuse in this case – it should have been a straight red. Mangala’s team-mate Fernando later challenged Gareth Barry with his boot at head height and despite appearing to catch his fellow midfielder, he escaped with a yellow card. If there was any contact then he too should have been dismissed for serious foul play. Andre Marriner and his fellow officials are doing their best to keep 22 players on the pitch this season . Victor Wanyama complains about a Marouane Fellaini tackle, where the Belgian followed through with his arm . Down at Loftus Road, Charlie Austin was given a short reprieve when Jon Moss pulled out the yellow card after the striker dived in on Burnley’s Kieran Trippier. It was a poor challenge with studs leading and landing on Trippier’s ankle. Austin did get a second yellow shortly after but he shouldn’t have been on the pitch following that tackle on Trippier. In Sunday’s game between Aston Villa and Leicester, Jamie Vardy’s challenge on Ashley Westwood ticked all the boxes for a red card as it was made at pace with a scissors-type action and he showed no regard for his opponent’s safety. Westwood went off on a stretcher but Vardy stayed on. Charlie Austin's tackle on Kieran Trippier was studs up and caught the Burnley defender on the ankle . Referee Jon Moss only produced a yellow card for Austin, despite his dangerous tackle on Trippier . Austin was eventually dismissed for two yellow cards, but should have been off for his first challenge . It is clear that referees are trying to officiate in a low-key way this season and are letting a lot more go, which fans enjoy. No-one pays money to watch a ref and it’s always disappointing to see a player sent off early in a game that you have spent a lot of money going to. However, these tackles are dangerous and if referees continue to only dish out yellow cards they will become more prevalent and players will be hurt. The referees’ top priority in a game is the players’ safety and too many are not keeping this in the forefront of their minds. Jamie Vardy showed no regards for Ashley Westwood's safety with his hard and dangerous lunge . Westwood played no further part after being stretchered off, but Vardy escaped a red card .","Four Premier League players were booked for terrible tackles this week .

"The first-half performance against Slovenia on Saturday does not mean England should ditch their diamond formation — they just need to use it better. Roy Hodgson’s side struggled in the opening 45 minutes, which led some to suggest that the solution is a return to using wingers. But I think to get a diamond system to prosper, you need to get your best players on the ball in between the lines, in the most dangerous parts of the pitch. Raheem Sterling struggled to get into the game during the first half of England's 3-1 win against Slovenia . Sterling's touch map proves he was unable to get on the ball in key areas against Slovenia . That’s where England failed. Look at the touch map of Raheem Sterling’s night: he barely touched the ball in the danger zone just outside the Slovenian penalty area. England need to get him on the ball more. This system is all about having an extra man in the middle of the park and England need to use whoever is best for that. They also need to play with a lot more purpose and pace from the off. They only did that once they had conceded. I can’t remember many England debuts as good as Nathaniel Clyne’s. He deserves to keep the shirt. Kieran Gibbs did well but needs to go forward with the same conviction. Southampton right back Nathaniel Clyne impressed on his senior England debut against Slovenia .

"Louis van Gaal has Manchester United doing something that none of the other top teams are - playing long balls. Time and time again his central defenders will bypass the midfield and aim straight for the front and I applaud it. Van Gaal is playing to his strengths. His best outfield players are Angel di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata and he needs to get them on the ball as much as possible. There is no real need to pass through the compartments, especially when Michael Carrick is the only conventional midfielder in his team. Robin van Persie (right) of Manchester United challenges Tottenham Hotspur's Federico Fazio for the ball . Louis van Gaal (left) has his Manchester United side playing the ball long to get it to his strikers quickly . Manchester United have played the second-highest number of long balls in the Premier League this season . Being direct gets his danger men on the ball in danger areas. It happened time after time against Tottenham Hotspur so it is no surprise that only Burnley have played more long balls this season. What is interesting is that United are not even that worried about whether Van Persie or Falcao win the initial header from the ball upfield - they just make sure that Rooney or Mata are there to pick up the knockdown, ready to cause problems in the final third. They can suffocate you with so much quality. It suits United’s defenders too. Paddy McNair, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans are happier playing long balls as they are not confident enough to pick out more intricate passes. 1) Burnley (1,485) 2) Manchester United (1,437) 3) Queens Park Rangers (1,401) 4) West Bromwich Albion (1,349) 5) Leicester City (1,348) 1) Southampton (2,395) 2) Aston Villa (2,299) 3) Everton (2,239) 4) Fulham (2,180) 10) Manchester United (2,077) Wayne Rooney and United's other attacking players have benefitted from receiving the ball quickly . Michael Carrick (left) is United's best technical midfielder but they sometimes bypass him . There is a lot to be said for a more direct approach at times. People talk about long balls and short balls but football is about playing the right ball. Too often the obsession with playing the ball through each compartment of the team again and again slows teams down. Aston Villa and Everton are two of the most guilty. Christian Benteke is one of the best strikers in the Barclays Premier League but he often leaves the pitch looking like he’s in a strop. You can’t blame him because he’s more or less ignored for 90 minutes as his team-mates fail to get the ball to him early. I’ve lost count of the number of times Tom Cleverley has a forward, diagonal pass available but turns round and plays it square because that is what he has been told to do. Romelu Lukaku is being similarly starved at Everton - he only had four touches in the opposition box at home to Stoke City last week. United's defenders such as Paddy McNair (left) are better suited to playing the ball forward quickly and long . Aston Villa's Tom Cleverley (right) often chooses to pass short and sideways instead of long and forward . Villa and Everton need to vary their approach like they did last season, when both sides were in the top three in terms of the most direct passes played. The aim of the game is to climb a ladder through the team - it doesn’t matter how you get to the top of it as long as you do. And as a defender you are far happier when teams are passing the ball round and round in front of you as it is not testing you. Look how Southampton’s direct approach with Sadio Mane caused John Terry problems on Sunday. Burnley’s attacking pair Ashley Barnes and Danny Ings are doing really well but that is because Burnley get the ball forward to them a lot so they have opportunities to affect the match. Burnley's Ashley Barnes (centre) has benefited from his side getting the ball forward quickly . Romelu Lukaku is struggling in an Everton side who are intent on passing the ball too short . Even under Arsene Wenger I played the occasional long ball to mix things up, the most notable being the pass that set up Marc Overmars for the winning goal at Old Trafford in 1998. If you build up too slowly, the opposition has time to get 11 men behind the ball. I watched the Real Madrid youth team recently and they adopted a similar approach to Van Gaal. Their centre halves played the ball up to the front men quickly and they weren’t obsessed with passing through the compartments for the sake of it. When you watch youth football in England, defenders seem to be programmed to play the same passes all the time, sideways or slightly forward in a horseshoe shape. It became the trend after all of Barcelona’s success but we need to train the next generation to feel comfortable playing both ways. Marc Overmars scored at Old Trafford for Arsenal in 1998 after a long through-ball from Martin Keown . It’s the same with defending: we have a generation of centre backs who are only used to facing one striker. So when United or other teams use two up front, defenders look confused. Van Gaal has clearly spotted this and it is reaping dividends - now it’s time for others to follow suit.","Manchester United have played the second-highest number of long balls in the Premier League so far this season behind Burnley .

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report as a Sergio Aguero goal was enough to hand the home side victory . Manchester City made hard work of it after they scored. They looked to limp over the line and it was a far from convincing performance as they beat United 1-0. Perhaps the CSKA Moscow result in the Champions League last month was playing on their minds, during which they shipped two goals to draw 2-2. Like that game, they lost momentum when they went ahead against United but this time they got away with it. They need to learn to finish teams off when they dominate. Manchester City lost momentum after Sergio Aguero (right) put his side 1-0 ahead . The young lad Paddy McNair switched off for the goal. When I was growing up, I was always told to get touch-tight to my man in the box and to always be slightly in front of the striker so I could match his movement. It’s important McNair works on that. Manchester United youngster Paddy McNair must learn to get touch-tight on his opponent . They may have lost but I can see improvement in United. Louis van Gaal is seen as an innovator, and his tactics were interesting in the first half. Daley Blind dropped into defence while Wayne Rooney came very deep to receive the ball. Angel di Maria tucked in and Marouane Fellaini occupied the right. City did not know how to deal with United when they had the ball. But the visitors were exposed on the flanks when they lost possession. The second half saw a gallant effort from United — going down to 10 men forced them to give more, especially Rooney. However, it will be a worry for Van Gaal that Robin van Persie’s work-rate did not match the rest of the team. Wayne Rooney played well in a more withdrawn role upon his return from suspension . Robin van Persie's (right) work-rate did not match the rest of the team around him . People seem to be divided on Fellaini. His former manager David Moyes is right when he says he carries a threat and he had a good all-round game against City. But you have to take your chances and he fluffed his lines by missing that header. Belgian midfielder Marouane Fellaini should have done better with his header . It was vital City won this match, otherwise Chelsea could have had the title almost sewn up before Christmas. City might be the champions, but they are not playing like it at the moment. Manager Manuel Pellegrini will hope they can get their swagger back sooner rather than later.

"Juventus are due to hold talks with Arturo Vidal and his representatives over where his future lies but it is unlikely to be at Manchester United. The 27-year-old stated last week that he would not be going to Manchester and that was echoed by director general Beppe Marotta. More pertinently United have not opened talks with Juventus over a deal for the Chile international. VIDEO Scroll down to watch transfer targets Arturo Vidal and Stefan de Vrij in action . Money talks: Juventus don't want to let Arturo Vidal go but will find it hard to refuse a high price . Asset: Although linked to Old Trafford, there haven't been talks with Juventus about signing Vidal . Juventus have financial difficulties and need to raise funds and, despite claims that they want Vidal to stay along with Paul Pogba, there are suspicions they would welcome substantial offers. United though are looking elsewhere with Louis van Gaal confirming an interest in Roma's Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman while talks are ongoing over a possible deal for Thomas Vermaelen at Arsenal. Edinson Cavani has again been proposed to United after productive talks were held in February and March. The Uruguay striker has been left out of PSG's pre-season tour to Hong Kong officially owing to a virus. The 27-year-old was receptive to joining United when David Moyes was manager and regardless of their qualification for the Champions League. Talks had been hindered slightly by his change of agent. United's players meanwhile have reported back favourably about Van Gaal's training so far. Even those who have suffered a rebuke, remark that he has been fair. There are however likely departures. Javier Hernandez has yet to be fully assessed by Van Gaal but he is a target for several clubs home and abroad with Inter Milan in particular going back and forth on their wishlist. They are due to hold talks with Southampton about Dani Osvaldo on Tuesday but Hernandez is still in their thoughts. United midfielder Davide Petrucci, meanwhile, is wanted on loan by League One Sheffield United. The 22-year-old Italian was one of a number of young United players left behind from the tour of the USA. Seagulls ramp up move for Stockdale . Brighton manager Sami Hyypia is stepping up his pursuit of Fulham goalkeeper David Stockdale. Sportsmail reported Brighton's interest in the 28-year-old earlier this month and Hyypia wants to close a deal to give his side a stronger foundation for promotion next season. Talks are advancing as of Monday and Fulham are looking for more than the initial £1million that was proposed. Highly regarded: Fulham's David Stockdale is a target for Sami Hyypia at Championship rivals Brighton . Stockdale, despite his undoubted talents, has made only 39 appearances for Fulham since arriving from Darlington in 2008 and has been out on loan six times. He has had to compete with Mark Schwarzer and Maarten Stekelenburg but was still seen as a reliable component of Fulham's squad. The sale to Championship rivals will raise eyebrows among some at Craven Cottage but Brighton manager Hyypia is eager to make a breakthrough in his search for new recruits. He is also maintaining an interest in Manchester United's Jesse Lingaard but will have to wait until mid-August for a decision on a loan. Spurs want Lopes as right-back cover . Tottenham are holding talks with representatives of Miguel Lopes on Tuesday. The Sporting Lisbon right-back was on loan at Lyon last season and will be allowed to leave.

Kyle Walker is getting back to full fitness but Tottenham want quality competition also for the 24-year-old. Lopes can play left-back also to add to his versatility but Tottenham are planning a new contract for Danny Rose to go with the arrival of Ben Davies. Tottenham lost out to Atletico Madrid for Antoine Griezmann but had not pushed too hard for the deal and maintain a passing interest in PSV Eindhoven's Memphis Depay and Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar. They have yet to firm up interest in Wilfried Bony and have no plan to move for Loic Remy. Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin remains a priority. VIDEO Pochettino impressed with Spurs' stint stateside and discusses team . Off to Rome: Holland defender Stefan de Vrij was linked to Man United but Lazio will land him instead . De Vrij move to Lazio imminent . Lazio expect to sign Stefan de Vrij in the next 48 hours. The 22-year-old Holland international has been linked with Manchester United consistently throughout the summer while Southampton and Borussia Dortmund have shown an interest in the Feyenoord centre-back also. However, Lazio have been the constant presence and their bid of £6.7million looks like being successful as he heads to Italy tomorrow for further talks over a five year contract and an expected medical. Feyenoord remain interested in signing Manchester City striker John Guidetti. The Swede is also in the thinking of Ronald Koeman at Southampton who will press on this week with his rebuilding. Celtic's Fraser Forster and centre-back Virgil Van Dijk are targets although there are reservations about Van Dijk's pace for the Premier League. Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar is a target but not easy to do with Paul Lambert keen to keep him. Villa and Baggies vie for Moses loan . Aston Villa will rival neighbours West Bromwich Albion in a bid to take Victor Moses on loan. Paul Lambert has an interest in Chelsea's Christian Atsu also but Moses represents a ready-made Premier League player. Borrower: Chelsea's Victor Moses is wanted by Aston Villa and West Brom on loan this season after last year's stint at Liverpool . Although his loan spell at Liverpool failed to inspire last season, the 23-year-old is eager to make amends and would benefit from greater time on the pitch which Liverpool did not afford him. Villa have Charles N'Zogbia returning from injury who played alongside Moses at Wigan while Lambert will revive his move for Swansea midfielder Ki Sung Yeung also this week.

"Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp reflects on England's 3-1 victory over Scotland at Celtic Park on Tuesday. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain opened the scoring for Roy Hodgson's side before captain Wayne Rooney struck twice in the second half to seal victory over their closest rivals. England beat Scotland 3-1 at Celtic Park in an international friendly on Tuesday . The pass from Jack Wilshere for the opening goal was as good a long pass as you will see. That’s what happens when you give somebody like him time on the ball. It was a beautiful pass and matched by a wonderful finish. Wilshere  floated it effortlessly, and the flight of the ball made it almost impossible to defend. It was a fantastic piece of play. Jack Wilshere provided a superb assist for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's first-half goal . Wilshere picked out his Arsenal team-mate with a long-range pass for Ox to glance home . Wilshere produced a laser pass which was nodded in by Oxlade-Chamberlain. It was a goal  made at Arsenal . It's good to see England have got two excellent young talents at right back. Nathaniel Clyne has settled quickly with England. He was tested by Ikechi Anya but he handled him well. He is assured on the ball, takes up good positions and he’s not afraid to go forward. Calum Chambers didn’t play but he is another option, though I think his long-term future lies in defensive midfield. England right back Nathaniel Clyne executes a sliding challenge on Scotland's Johnny Russell . The thing I like about this England team is the pace running through it. At the World Cup we were so reliant on Raheem Sterling to get us moving but now there is a threat from all over the park. Danny Welbeck and Oxlade-Chamberlain are so quick up front and both full backs were good going forward against Scotland. It used to be that without Sterling we would not be much of a threat, but that couldn’t be further from the truth on Tuesday. The only thing I would have liked to see is Ross Barkley get more of a game. Danny Welbeck was a constant threat to the Scotland back line with his pace .","England beat Scotland 3-1 at Celtic Park on Tuesday .

Porto 1 Real Madrid 3 (October 2003) Jose's Champions League campaign with Porto could not have got off to a worse start. But, despite a heavy group stage defeat to Real Madrid, it was Porto’s only loss in that season’s competition as Mourinho’s side went on an incredible run to beat Monaco in the final. Porto begun their Champions League campaign in 2003/04 with a defeat to Real Madrid . But Jose Mourinho's side went on to lift the trophy in Schalke after defeating Monaco . Middlesbrough 3 Chelsea 0 (February 2006) After winning the title in his first season at Chelsea, Jose’s side had only lost once in 25 games the following season before losing at Middlesbrough. Three straight wins followed, ensuring they stayed at the top of the table where they remained until the end of the season. Middlesbrough shocked Chelsea with a 3-0 victory at Riverside in February, 2006) Chelsea won three straight games following the defeat and still ended up top of the Premier League . Barcelona 5 Real Madrid 0 (November 2010) A Barcelona masterclass gave Mourinho his first defeat as Real Madrid boss and remains the biggest loss of his career. But Jose’s side responded with six consecutive wins in all competitions and 21 goals, including an 8-0 thrashing of Levante in the Copa del Rey. Barcelona thrashed Real Madrid 5-0 at the Nou Camp in El Clasico in 2010 . Pep Guardiola (right) got the better of Jose Mourinho (left), who still recovered well after the defeat . Borussia Dortmund 4 Real Madrid 1 (April 2013) Robert Lewandowski stunned Madrid with four goals in an astonishing first leg of the Champions League semi-final. Despite winning their next four games, including the return leg at the Bernabeu, it ruined Jose’s chances of winning Madrid a 10th European title and he was gone at the end of the season. Robert Lewandowski celebrates during Borussia Dortmund's 4-1 demolition of Real Madrid in 2013 . Jose Mourinho obviously wasn't happy with the officials as his Champions League dream all-but-ended . Tottenham 5 Chelsea 3 (January 2015) Chelsea had only conceded five goals in their previous 12 games before Tottenham shredded their defence at White Hart Lane. But Jose’s side recovered with three straight wins, scoring 10 goals and conceding none. They beat Watford 3-0 in the FA Cup and defeated Newcastle 2-0 and Swansea 5-0.

"Filippo Inzaghi still has the full backing of the AC Milan dressing room despite a poor Serie A campaign, according to striker Jeremy Menez. Milan lost 3-1 to Lazio on Saturday, with Menez scoring the Rossoneri's only goal, and the two sides are now preparing to meet again on Tuesday night, in the Coppa Italia. 'In the dressing room we're fine, the players are always with Inzaghi,' French international Menez said ahead of the tie. Filippo Inzaghi, under severe pressure as manager of AC Milan, barks instructions at the San Siro . Jeremy Menez, AC Milan striker, has told press that the AC Milan dressing room are fully behind their manager . 'It is true we are going through a difficult time. We have to stand up and get back to working hard for a good result because we all want this.' Some claim that Inzaghi's future as Milan manager rests solely on Tuesday's cup clash. With the team sitting 11th in Serie A, the Coppa Italia is their only hope of salvaging a disastrous season. 'It is true that the match against Lazio is very important for us,' Menez continued, 'for the coach and for the fans, but we should not put extra pressure on ourselves.' Inzaghi's side currently sit 11th in Serie A after a poor first half of the season, but are still in the Coppa Italia . AC Milan lost 3-1 to Lazio on Saturday (pictured) but they face them again on Tuesday night in the cup . Milan beat Sassuolo 2-1 in the previous round, a team just one point behind them in the league, but now face a much tougher clash in the form of fourth-placed Lazio. There are still concerns over Milan's strike force, with most of Tuesday's Italian papers listing the candidates that Inzaghi is looking at. Roma's Mattia Destro remains top of their wanted list, but Sassuolo striker Simone Zaza is also on their radar.","AC Milan are currently 11th in Serie A after a bad first half of the season .

"It all comes down to silverware. When everything is said and done, progress at Anfield is gauged by how many trophies a manager can collect. It always will be. As someone who grew up in a family of Liverpool supporters during the club’s most successful period, Brendan Rodgers - who celebrated his 42nd birthday on Monday - is fully aware of what is expected when this side get to a semi-final: they have to finish the job. So it was interesting to hear the message Rodgers relayed at Liverpool’s Melwood training ground. Chelsea might currently be the best team in the country but there was no sign of concern as Rodgers explained how he intends to navigate a path to Wembley. Brendan Rodgers insists Liverpool can go to Chelsea and beat them in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday . The Liverpool players celebrate after Raheem Sterling's equaliser last week at Anfield . Rodgers has impressed with the work he has done since arriving in June 2012 but now, with his philosophies in place, the moment is approaching where Liverpool have to press on. An opportunity awaits at Stamford Bridge and Rodgers does not intend to let it pass. ‘We respect the opponent, of course, because they’re a very good team,’ said Rodgers. ‘But we’ve got nothing to fear in the game. We’re a team that’s in a good moment. 'We’re playing well, we’re working well and we know we can go there and win — that’s key.’ That has been the mantra since the first leg of this Capital One Cup semi-final ended in a 1-1 draw last week. The team Rodgers played then had an average age of 24½, which suggests their best years are in the future, but collecting a trophy now would be huge for its development. ‘The manager spoke to us before the first game and said it is always the first trophy that helps you start something,’ explained Lucas Leiva, the in-form Brazil midfielder. ‘He is looking for that first medal to put a mark on the group. ‘We were fantastic in the Premier League last season but at the end we didn’t win. This group deserves something good and a medal to show how hard it works, and for the fans as well. We have a good history with Chelsea, back to the Champions League when Rafa Benitez was here.’ Since the Benitez era, Liverpool have inflicted some heavy blows on Chelsea — they knocked them out in the quarter-finals of this competition in November 2011 — but the really decisive matches (the 2012 FA Cup final and the pivotal Premier League meeting at Anfield last April) have ended with Blue being the colour. Jordan Henderson (second right) and Chelsea striker Diego Costa (right) came to blows in the first leg . Chelsea midfielders Cesc Fabregas (left) and Ramires (right) tussle for the ball during a training session . ‘Of course Chelsea will always be in the way of what we want to achieve because they are a big club,’ said Lucas, who has become something of a talisman, with the club being unbeaten in the last 14 games in which he has started. ‘They are the same as Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City. When you get towards finals, you have to play them. Hopefully this time it will go our way.’ Mention of that League Cup quarter-final evokes strong emotions for Lucas. He was in the best form of his career then but a ruptured cruciate ligament inflicted more damage than he could have envisaged, as it took what seemed an eternity to recapture his confidence and the belief of Rodgers. Recently Inter Milan expressed interest in him but no bid materialised and Rodgers, having restored Lucas to the team, maintained he did not want to lose a player who, in his youth, won the Bola de Ouro, Brazil’s Player of the Year award. ‘I just have to focus on what I can control and see what happens,’ said Lucas. ‘I would be lying if I said I never thought about something new but I can’t tell you what is going to happen. I just focus on the day and leave the future to take care of itself.’ Jose Mourinho and Brendan Rodgers greet before the semi-final first leg at Anfield . The Liverpool faithful are keen to get Steven Gerrard to Wembley ahead of his departure in the summer . Lucas Leiva hasn't committed his future to Liverpool but says it will be special to get to Wembley . The focus on Tuesday is helping Liverpool reach their 12th League Cup final. Although injured, he was in the party that travelled for the 11th, which ended with a penalty shootout victory over Cardiff City in February 2012, but felt on the periphery of the celebrations. This time he wants to experience it for real. ‘It was hard for me,’ said Lucas. ‘When we were on our way to the stadium of course I was a bit down because I wanted to be part of it on the pitch and I remember Stevie Gerrard sending me a text which said, “Don’t worry, we will get here again”. It is something I always remember and hopefully we will make that come true. That would be special.’","Chelsea host Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg .

"Arsenal appear to have received a boost in the race to sign Gabriel Paulista in January as Villarreal have left the £15million-rated defender out of their squad to face Levante at the weekend. Villarreal announced the 18-man squad to face Levante at El Madrigal and listed the players who would miss the match through injury or suspension. However Paulista's name was left off the official club announcement altogether, which suggests he has moved a step closer to leaving the Spanish outfit. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is keen on bringing in Gabrial Paulista from Villarreal this month . Arsenal may find it difficult in obtaining a work permit for the Brazilian defender . The Gunners are in talks with Villarreal over a move for the Brazilian although he will face problems in obtaining a work permit as he hasn't played international football. Work permit rules change in the summer, allowing players who cost £10m and over an automatic permit. But as Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday, Arsenal will appeal any decision not to give Paulista - who has a £15m buy-out clause - a permit this month in an attempt to land him now. And Wenger confirmed: 'The talks are progressing quite well with Villarreal for Paulista. We are talking at the moment and slowly progressing. We are ready to pay the price for a good player. 'We want the player and if he needs a work permit we will defend it now.'

Giroud celebrates after scoring against Manchester City in a victory that Wenger says gave his side belief . The Gunners travel to Brighton in the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday, but will be without forward Danny Welbeck, who is not yet back in full training and will be missing for a further two weeks. Wenger confirmed that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (groin) and Hector Bellerin (ankle) are both uncertainties, while Serge Gnabry is nearing a return to first-team action after resuming full training. Arsenal this week confirmed the signing of 17-year-old Polish defensive midfielder Krystian Bielik, but he will not play any part for at least three weeks. Francis Coquelin (bottom right) marked David Silva out of the game in Arsenal's 2-0 win at Manchester City . At the end of last year Coquelin was on loan at Charlton, with his Arsenal career seemingly over . 'He’s only just come from Poland. He has just turned 17, is not fit because they had a winter break in Poland and that is quite long,' Wenger admitted. 'He’s at the start of getting back to full fitness. He won’t be ready before three weeks. One player that is likely to play, and has done in every match since mid-December, is Francis Coquelin, who Wenger admitted has been offered a new deal at the Emirates. The midfielder’s contract expires at the end of the season, but as revealed by Sportsmail this week, talks over a new deal are now underway and the Gunners are confident of securing the Frenchman to a long-term agreement in the coming weeks. Wenger will give his midfield a shake-up ahead of next season and Coquelin will be part of a new-look engine room. For now though, Wenger is fully focused on what he is sure will be a tough trip to Brighton on Sunday. 'Chris Hughton will give them his experience and his competence of course,' Wenger continued. 'He knows how to prepare a team for a challenge like that. For us the challenge is to turn up with the same spirit and show that we can be consistent with our attitude game by game. 'In the FA Cup, god knows that is needed. We know that it will be another big challenge for us to go there and come home with a positive result.'","Talks with Villarreal over a £15m move for Gabriel Paulista are going well .

"Despite a miserable year on the pitch Manchester United have rocketed into second place on a list of the world's richest football teams with a revenue of £423.8million. So what will they spend the money on? Firstly, it is worth noting that United may not fare as well on next year's Deloitte Football Money League thanks to missing out on Champions League football. Manchester United brought in more revenue for 2013-14 than any other club in the Premier League . Louis van Gaal's side have moved up to second on the list despite not being in the Champions League . The club itself forecasts a drop from £423.8m to between £385m and £395m. But with the first instalment from their world-record £750m kit deal with adidas due in the summer and their trailblazing commercial operation showing no signs of slowing, experts say they could overtake Real Madrid within two years. One could be forgiven for imagining that a chunk of the cash could go on wiping out the debt that still remains from the Glazer family's controversial 2005 takeover. At the last count that stood at £362.2m, which was actually a rise of £1.2m on the same period in the previous year. A major plan for United is to return to the glory days of the Champions League, like their win in 2008-09 . Real Madrid were top of the tree in world football for revenue in the 2013-14 season, with £459.5million . 1. Real Madrid - £459.5m . 2. Manchester United - £433.2m . 3. Bayern Munich - £407.7m . 4. Barcelona - £405.2m . 5. Paris Saint-Germain - £396.5m . 6. Manchester City - £346.5m . 7. Chelsea - £324.4m . 8. Arsenal - £300.5m . 9. Liverpool - £255.8m . 10. Juventus - £233.6m . 11. Borussia Dortmund - £218.7m . 12. AC Milan - £208.8m . 13. Tottenham - £180.5m . 14. Schalke 04 - £178.9m . 15. Atletico Madrid - £142.1m . 16. Napoli £137.8m . 17. Inter Milan - £137.1m . 18. Galatasaray - £135.4m . 19. Newcastle United - £129.7m . 20. Everton £120.5m . 21. West Ham United - £105.3m . 22. Aston Villa - £101.9m . 23. Marseille - £100m . 24. Roma - £97.7m . 25. Southampton - £97.3 . 26. Benfica - £96.6 . 27. Sunderland - £95.7m . 28. Hamburg - £92.2m . 29. Swansea City - £90.5m . 30. Stoke City - £90.1m . That indicates that the US-based bean counters are not looking to pay it off any time soon. And while Sportsmail understands that United's ownership are at ease with the situation the fact that money spent on servicing the debt is tax deductable is notable. As for new players, not too much attention should be paid to a relatively quiet (so far) January transfer window. Manager Louis van Gaal recently said that the lack of activity was due to the traditional problem that very few players who could improve an elite side are available at the turn of the year. In a call to investors when the club's latest financial figures were released in November, Ed Woodward struck a similar chord. Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman is high on Manchester United's list of summer targets . Nathaniel Clyne (left) has caught United's attention with his progress while Mats Hummels remains a target . However, the executive vice-chairman did point to the summer and say the club were already monitoring targets. With a number of players set to depart it would not be a surprise if the Dutch boss was handed a similar amount to last summer, when £156m was spent on the likes of Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind. Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman, Southampton full back Nathaniel Clyne and Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels are all thought to be on the radar. United broke the British transfer record to sign Angel di Maria from Real Madrid during the summer . An audacious swoop for Barcelona star Lionel Messi has also been reported, but he is unlikely to leave . An unliklely £200m swoop for Lionel Messi has also been reported but the Argentine is unlikely to leave Barcelona - although a new striker could be on the cards should Falcao continue to frustrate. Further down the line, qualifying for next season's Champions League is essential with a new TV deal due later this year. United will also benefit from the auctioning of the next Premier League broadcast rights. Old Trafford officials are also known to be keen on turning the club's remarkable social media following into cash. If revenues continue to grow as expected, there is a chance that United will look at making Old Trafford bigger . Van Gaal (second left, pictured at QPR) is hoping to oversee a period of huge success for Manchester United . According to United, they attract 380,000 tweets a day and 12m social media posts each month and the club are known to be keen on stepping up its mobile operation. With regards to matchday revenues, a long-term aim has been to extend the existing South Stand which is dwarfed by the other three structures. This would be a complex, costly operation given the train line that runs behind it. However, if revenues continue to grow as expected do not rule out England's largest domestic football stadium getting even bigger.","Manchester United could overtake Real Madrid in the next two years .

"Brendan Rodgers has revealed that Liverpool star Raheem Sterling is extremely close to signing a new deal with the club. Negotiations with the 20-year-old, whose current contract expires in June 2017, have been ongoing for much of the season. And with rumours of Real Madrid circling, supporters will be pleased to hear Sterling is finally ready to commit his future to the Anfield club. Raheem Sterling in action against Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield . Liverpool have been in contract negotiations with Sterling, whose current deal expires in 2017, for months . 'It (his contract) is something the club are speaking with his representatives on and I would think that would be concluded very imminently,' said Rodgers. 'The player is very happy. It (the delay) is nothing to do with Raheem, he wants to be here so hopefully we get the solution on that very soon.' The former QPR youth team winger joined the club for just £500,000 plus add-ons in 2010 but has experienced a meteoric rise to prominence in the last 18 months.

"Rio Ferdinand is said to be ‘furious’, ‘seething’ and ‘very angry’ at his latest Football Association fine and ban. He is also said, by ‘a close source’, to feel victimised, picked upon and singled out for special punishment by the people who control the English game. He is therefore, we are told, considering withdrawing his support for future FA initiatives. Outrage, resentment, revenge: it was an average week in the life of QPR’s occasional central defender. Rio Ferdinand was banned for three games and fined £25,000 for controversial 'sket' tweet . His offence was to post a deeply offensive message on Twitter, the spiritual home of deeply offensive messages. Replying to a Manchester United fan, who suggested that QPR needed to sign a new centre-back, Ferdinand wrote: ‘Get ya mum in, plays the field well son! #sket’. The world now knows that ‘sket’ is Jamaican slang for a loose woman. The world has yet to comprehend the mind which can blurt out that vile response to a daft little jibe. The FA have not always coped impressively with questions of discipline but this time they seem to have struck precisely the correct balance. Aware that football has genuine problems with sexism issues, and aware that Ferdinand has a Twitter following of almost six million, they handed down an exemplary sentence of a three-game ban, a £25,000 fine and an order to attend an education programme. It was a timely expression of disapproval and an important statement of principle. Ferdinand poses with Champions League trophy alongside  Ryan Giggs (left) with the Premier League in 2008 . Here we might remember just what an extraordinary player Ferdinand has been. He captained his country, won 81 caps and proved himself one of the finest footballing central defenders English football has known. He played in six Premier League-winning sides at Manchester United, with whom he won the Champions League. In short, he was a marvellous player and the English game has yet to discover his successor. But in Ferdinand’s case, the past tense is inevitable. On Friday, he will be 36 years old and his future at the top level is clearly limited. It had seemed likely that he would move on to an important administrative role, especially when he was chosen to serve on Greg Dyke’s commission into the future of English football. Yet always there was a disturbing unpredictability. In 2003 he served an eight-month suspension for missing a drugs test. Then there was his despicable Twitter outburst in 2012, when he appeared to endorse a tweet which referred to Ashley Cole as a ‘choc ice’ after Cole had given evidence in a high-profile trial. Former Chelsea left back Ashley Cole has also been fined in the past for inappropriate comments on Twitter . Cole may not be everyone’s idea of a model citizen, but he did not deserve such a wicked racial slur. Ferdinand was fined £45,000 for that transgression and while his own sense of self-importance seemed resolutely undaunted, even his erstwhile admirers were becoming increasingly critical. His most recent offence seems miserably typical, despite the efforts of his fawning chums to search out helpful precedents. We are told, for instance, that the FA allowed the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore to go unpunished for his tawdry email exchanges. In Scudamore’s case, it was argued that these were private communications which were never intended for public viewing. More recently, we had the attention-seeking irritant Joey Barton, a QPR colleague of Ferdinand, tweeting a moronic sexual slur on the Barcelona players Neymar and Messi. No measures have yet been instigated against Barton and the FA may well decide that by far the most wounding course of action would be to ignore him. The FA allowed Premier League chief Richard Scudamore to go unpunished for his email exchanges . All of which leaves Ferdinand with a decision. He can opt for arrogant indignation: nursing his grievances, witholding whatever useful influence he possesses and seeking to settle scores with his interminable tweeting. Or he can choose the difficult alternative, which involves ignoring the sycophants and taking a hard look at himself. I have no idea which course he will adopt, although his initial laddish truculence seems faintly ominous: ‘Is humour even allowed … I’m baffled. Ludicrous…’ But I do hope he does not cast himself adrift. For all his mistakes and fumbling misdeeds, Rio Ferdinand may yet have a good deal to offer English football. Sure, he has bridges to mend and a reputation to restore but memories are short and his potential is considerable. Accepting the FA punishment without comment or complaint might be a good place to start. Northern Dave has found his voice again . Welcome back, Dave Whelan, distinguished chairman of Wigan Athletic. For too long, the parody of the professional Northerner has seemed reluctant to address the nation. At last, his silence has been broken. We used to hear a lot from Dave; too much, some thought. You will recall his enlightened views on football and race: ‘I just think we should forget colour and, you know, it doesn’t bother anybody, I’m sure. When they’re playing at such a level, the stress is there. And if they call somebody white, if they call somebody black, you’ve just got to get on with it.’ There was his contentious, though ultimately unheeded, request for the whole of English football to observe a minute’s silence to mark the demise of Margaret Thatcher. Wigan Atlhetic chairman Dave Whelan has been involved in a long-running feud with Mike Ashley . Then his suggestion that the England national team be coached by a combination of Paul Jewell and Stuart Pearce. He always had grave doubts about foreigners, did Dave: ‘You need four or five British players in any [club] squad to give it some heart and depth,’ he said. ‘They also give you leadership and they fight to the death.’ But of one thing Dave was quite certain: he did not like Mike Ashley, the owner of Newcastle United and a man once seen as a threat to Dave’s authority in the northern sports goods business. Whelan is famously reported to have told Ashley: ‘There’s a club in the North, son. And you’re not part of it.’ The warning went unheeded as Ashley prompted a series of investigations into the way the industry was conducted. Whelan’s company incurred an £8million fine. Dave never forgave that expensive affront. Some time later, after Ashley had bought Newcastle, Whelan remarked: ‘He [Ashley] turned up in the boardroom in a pair of jeans, a pair of trainers and a replica shirt. He’s got no class whatsoever.’ Having built his own fortune upon trainers and replica shirts, it seemed a curious complaint. Newcastle owner Ashley acquired a 10 per cent stake in Glasgow Rangers last week . Hostilities were resumed last week, following news that Ashley had acquired a 10 per cent stake in Glasgow Rangers. Dave was suspicious. ‘If I was [a Rangers fan] and a stranger from England started buying my club, I’d be worried,’ he said. ‘I’d ask myself, “Has he got Rangers Football Club at heart?” It’s like me and Wigan Athletic, I am Wigan through and through and I’ll do anything I can for them. It’s that kind of owner that supporters want.’ Then, without a word of warning, he played his joker and astounded us all. Aware of idle speculation that Ashley hopes one day to move the club into England’s Premier League, Whelan declared: ‘It would great for the Premier League if they extended the league, don’t put anybody out, and bring Celtic and Rangers in.’ So there! According to Whelan, the richest league in Europe would somehow be enhanced by the addition of a desperately ordinary Celtic team and a Rangers side currently second in the Scottish Championship. Some would dismiss that as a piece of addled absurdity. They do well to remember that a wise man was speaking. And we are richer for Dave’s wisdom. Getting to grips with evil at last . A good week for the football authorities. Not only did the Football Association deal decisively with Rio Ferdinand but the Scottish FA imposed a seven-match ban upon Celtic’s Aleksandar Tonev for racially abusing the Aberdeen defender Shay Logan. Tonev has lodged an appeal against the verdict but, as things stand, it seems a salutary sentence for an unacceptable offence. Aleksandar Tonev was banned for seven games for racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan (left) In the past, the various powers-that-be have tended to deflect such issues by mumbling trite platitudes about ‘harmless banter’ and ‘what happens on the field, stays on the field’. No longer. These days, the evil is confronted and punished. And we all become slightly more civilised as a result. PS . The hucksters who run Formula One are concerned that their championship is losing its appeal. They have therefore decided to spice things up by introducing a game-show gimmick: double points will be awarded for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the final race of the season, on November 23. This is rather like announcing that all goals will count double in the final week of the football season, or that the value of runs will be doubled for the final Test of a series. Rather like motor racing itself, it has everything to do with commercial calculation and little to do with sport. This tacky wheeze is apparently the brainchild of Bernie Ecclestone.

"Head of Sport Lee Clayton gives his view on  whether some of England's younger players should represent the Under 21s next summer in the Czech Republic . There has been plenty of talk of full internationals joining the Under 21s in the summer after Gareth Southgate and his squad qualified for the European Championship. Arsene Wenger and Roberto Martinez have already come out and stated it wouldn’t be beneficial to their players to play and that’s no surprise as they will always look after their clubs’ interests rather than the national team’s. That is a big problem in this country. My view is it’s not a black-and-white case. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Watch Gareth Southgate's post-match dressing room speech . Ross Barkley (left) and Jack Wilshere (right) are two senior England players who still qualify for the Under 21s . Gareth Southgate has led his England Under 21 side to the European Championship in the Czech Republic . Angel Di Maria is following the greats like Thierry Henry and Didier Drogba in taking England by storm so early... but can Mesut Ozil recover from his teething problems?

"Robbie Fowler has been holding court, discussing the past, the present and the future when Emile Heskey’s name enters the conversation. Liverpool’s FA Cup tie with Bolton on Saturday evokes memories for Fowler, not least the night 22 years ago when Graeme Souness’ side were dumped out in a replay at Anfield by opponents who were then in the old second division. That was the first time Fowler had been in a Liverpool squad. He will be in the stands on Saturday when Neil Lennon’s squad come to town but when he looks on to the pitch Fowler will see Heskey – a player with whom he shared a number of big successes at the turn of the century – and not be able to believe his eyes. Robbie Fowler admitted he was surprised that Bolton Wanderers had decided to sign Emile Heskey . Heskey trains with his Bolton team-mates, including Eidur Gudjohnsen (second from the left) ‘I didn’t even know (he’d signed for them),’ says Fowler, his eyes wide in amazement. ‘I’ve been in Australia. When did he sign?! I played in a charity game in Singapore with Emile not long ago and, I’ll be honest with you, I’m actually surprised they’ve signed him. ‘I don’t mean that in a bad way. I love Emile. I think he’s a great lad but I think if any of the Bolton scouts had seen him in that game they would have left the contract at home I think! We won but Emile got caught offside about 20 times. ‘Seriously, though, I’m really pleased for him. Obviously, like myself he’s wanted to carry on for as long as he can. Have I retired? You never retire from football. Good luck to Emile. He deserves it, he’s been a fantastic player.’ Lennon has been happy to give Heskey one last chance in the game he adores and that is something Fowler can understand. He has unveiled plans to open an education and football Academy on Merseyside, with the aim of helping young players who have been released by clubs. Heskey and Fowler train together during their days at Premier League giants Liverpool . Heskey playing for current club Bolton (left) and during his days as a Liverpool striker (right) Heskey enjoys himself during a recent press conference ahead of his return to Anfield . Fowler has teamed up with Brian McGorry, who became an education specialist after having a journeyman career in the lower leagues following his release from Liverpool in the 1980s, and the ambition is to get 60 youngsters on a Football and Sports Science course, starting in September. ‘I’ve had a good career and it is a clichéd answer but it is me giving back,’ said Fowler, explaining the idea behind the venture. ‘I’m not in it for medals. It was an idea put together and it sounded good. I know many have tried it but I just thought let’s give it a go again, get involved with Brian. ‘I’m not in it for any accolades, I just hope it works for the kids in Liverpool. I am passionate about it. I’ll be honest, I’m not going to be there every hour God sends. I will be there if and when needed. I will be there as much as I can. I want it to work. ‘This Academy gives kids the chance to get back into the education side. If we are not going to be professional footballers it gives everyone else a start in life, to go to University, get jobs and further education and possibly play football again. 'The stats are there to see. Four per cent go on to play football, but only one per cent have an excellent career. Brian knows more than I will ever know about education so it’s great to have him on board.’ The former Liverpool striker shakes hands with Arsenal legend Thierry Henry back in 2000 . The powerful forward celebrates scoring a goal for Liverpool back in 2001 . Given the staggering rate Fowler scored goals when he was a schoolboy, there was never any question he would make a living out of the game and he remains one of Liverpool’s most revered former players. The journey to the top, though, started inauspiciously. It often gets recalled that Fowler was launched on the route to stardom in a League Cup tie away at Fulham in September 1993 but Souness actually had ambitions of playing him much sooner. He considered Fowler to be progressive enough to name him on the bench as a 16-year-old for a game that Liverpool were expected to breeze through. They had come from two goals behind at the old Burnden Park and it was envisaged the replay would be a formality. It was anything but. ‘At that time Liverpool were going through a massive transitional period,’ Fowler recalls. ‘Maybe it wasn’t a bad thing because it gave everyone a little bit of a chance to see that we needed to change and we saw over the next couple of years that there was a lot of change at Liverpool. ‘I was lucky because I made it. I suppose it’s a case if you want something really bad you can get it, but the same applies in education. There was nothing I thought about but football. This offers an avenue to kids that was not there when I was younger.’ Fowler celebrates scoring for Liverpool against Newcastle United during the 1996-97 season .

"Radamel Falcao was left stunned by Louis van Gaal’s decision to drop him at the weekend and fears he faces an uphill struggle to persuade Manchester United to keep him at the end of the season. United manager Van Gaal shocked the 29-year-old by leaving him out of the 18 that lost at home to Southampton and watched the game at Old Trafford having received no explanation. It is understood that Falcao and Van Gaal did talk at training at Carrington on Monday, with the Dutch coach telling the striker that the decision was made purely for tactical reasons. Radamel Falcao is worried Manchester United won't offer him a permanent deal in the summer . Louis van Gaal (left) told Falcao his omission against Southampton on Sunday was due to tactical reasons . Falcao (left) has scored only three times for the club this season during his loan spell from Monaco . 604 - Minutes played for United so far . 3 - Goals scored and three assists in all competitions . 201.3 - Minutes per goal. Papiss Cisse leads the league on 70.33 . £40,000 - Falcao’s daily wages . £1.77m - Cost of each of his United goals in wages, not including bonuses (Each of Alexis Sanchez’s 18 goals has cost Arsenal £210,000 in wages) However, Sportsmail understands that Falcao increasingly wonders if he will ever manage to truly impress Van Gaal as he looks to persuade United to turn a one-year loan deal in to a permanent £43million transfer from Monaco in the summer. Falcao has been doing voluntary extra training at United after recovering from a calf injury that interrupted his progress in late autumn and is trying to turn himself in to a more rounded forward in the mould of captain Wayne Rooney. Despite this, the Colombian international believes that he sometimes has to do twice as much as other players to convince Van Gaal of his worth and was particularly bemused in late November to hear his manager say repeatedly that he had to get fully match fit before he could return to the team. In Falcao's absence, Wayne Rooney (left) and Juan Mata both failed to provide an attacking threat on Sunday . Falcao is likely to replace Robin van Persie (left) up front against QPR after the Dutchman's injury on Sunday . As far as Falcao was concerned, he was fit and the fact that another of Van Gaal’s summer signings Daley Blind was returned straight to the starting line-up against Southampton after almost two months out with a knee injury has not escaped his attention. United are currently paying Falcao in excess of £280,000-a-week on loan from Monaco and must decide at the end of the season if they wish to make that move permanent. So far the former Porto and Atletico Madrid star has scored three goals in the Barclays Premier League. Falcao is likely to return to the team at QPR this weekend after news that the muscle injury suffered by Robin van Persie on Sunday prevented him from travelling to the Ballon D’Or ceremony on Monday. ‘On the advice of club medical staff I am unable to fly,’ said Van Persie on Twitter.

"On this weekend 12 months ago, Manchester City were the subject of this column. They had endured a shaky start to the campaign and, though they had just beaten Newcastle in the Capital One Cup, I asked whether City supporters, if they were given the option, would take Roberto Mancini back over Manuel Pellegrini. Pellegrini, of course, went on to enjoy a dream first season in English football, leading City to the Barclays Premier League title, as well as the League Cup. He also took the club into the Champions League knockout stages for the first time. This time last year Manchester City were celebrating beating Newcastle in the Capital One Cup fourth round . Twelve months on, Manuel Pellegrini's side crashed out to the Magpies in the same competition . But here we are again on the first weekend of November, after another League Cup tie against Newcastle, and another question needs asking: what is different about Pellegrini’s City and the one of his predecessor? The players who helped Mancini capture the title in 2012 are the ones who Pellegrini relied on and they even became champions in similarly dramatic circumstances, capitalising when the team that seemed destined for first place capsized on the run-in. Some would argue Pellegrini’s team are more expansive but how important was that? City’s goal difference in 2012 was +64, when they finished with 89 points. Last year it was +65 but their tally had dropped to 86 points. When you consider that, ‘not much’ would be your answer. This is not an attack on City’s quality, by any means. When everything clicks, they are a fantastic side with some wonderful players and the patchy start they have endured to this campaign should not detract from what Pellegrini has achieved over the past 12 months. City, though, look like a team which must be changed and refreshed if it is going to carry on moving forward. Whether they successfully defend the title or fail to contain Chelsea, Pellegrini’s squad needs to be broken up. Has much changed at Manchester City since Manuel Pellegrini (left) took over from Roberto Mancini (right)? With an average age of 28.5, City’s first-choice team — Hart; Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Kolarov; Nasri, Toure, Fernandinho, Silva; Dzeko, Aguero — is the oldest in the Premier League. It is also older than the first-choices of Real Madrid (26.2) and Bayern Munich (27). Those two clubs are the ones City want to eventually rival but the thing that should provide most concern for Pellegrini is the fact that for all the money that has been invested, there is no exciting youngster ready to explode on to the scene like Adnan Januzaj or Raheem Sterling. A lot has been made about the huge investment that has gone into revamping the club’s academy but it is going to take time for the results of the work that goes on there to be seen, and the immediate concern is how much it will cost to keep them towards the head of the pack. It was clear they had a policy in the summer and were certain about who they wanted to bring in — Eliaquim Mangala, for instance, came into a position they needed to fill. They also made sure they tied down a number of their key performers to long contracts. But it is looking like a mistake not to bring in a replacement after Alvaro Negredo was allowed to join Valencia, as with the system that Pellegrini plays, he needs four strikers at his disposal. Martin Demichelis (centre) and Pablo Zabaleta (right) are in an ageing squad at 33 and 29 respectively . Yaya Toure (centre) is also on the wrong side of 30 and has had a disappointing season so far . City do not have a promising first-team youngster like Raheem Sterling (left) or Adnan Januzaj . City need to make big changes to their squad, even if they retain their Premier League title . He likes using two up front and he could have done with another body to ease the pressure on Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. Could they have done more to take Radamel Falcao on loan? Expectation now follows City, so when they have a run of three games without a win, as is the case now, they are scrutinised and sections of their supporters, who have got used to success, have been unnerved by the start to the campaign Pellegrini has overseen. For Pellegrini, a man who does not make bold statements, to say after the 2-0 defeat by Newcastle in midweek that ‘we are not the team we used to be’ shows how difficult things have been. Why did he name such a strong side in that match? Was it a sign that he feels the league title and Champions League are out of reach? The defeat was bad enough, the injuries to David Silva and Yaya Toure were even worse. Now they are facing two matches they simply cannot lose. David Silva will be a major loss for City as they host Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . First comes the Manchester derby — a fixture that has been good for City in recent years, as five wins in the past six league meetings with United shows — then a fight for survival in the Champions League against CSKA Moscow. Europe is where City want to be making an impact. Chief executive Ferran Soriano and director of football Txiki Begiristain, who arrived from Barcelona to run the club, won’t accept failure readily and Pellegrini will face serious questions if he fails to get his team out of the group. Soriano and Begiristain stood by Pep Guardiola when they were at Barcelona but that was because he was unbelievably successful and they won’t shy away from making changes if they feel that is what is required to keep building. We should not forget that after a World Cup, it is notoriously difficult for teams to find their rhythm early on. Only Chelsea have come flying out of the blocks, building up a six-point advantage over City during a period in which they have faced matches at Old Trafford and the Etihad Stadium. Should the gap reach nine points this weekend, City will not pull that back. Whether they win or not, the squad needs some big changes in the summer. Chelsea have established themselves as the team to beat in the Premier League this season . Strikers grapple too! It has been interesting to read all the views on shirt-pulling this week after Sportsmail began its campaign for a clampdown. I’m relieved, though, that the campaign has started now, rather than when I was playing, as I dare say I would have featured in some of the images that have been used on these pages! It is difficult to mark at a corner when you are trying to keep your eye on both the ball and your man, so you invariably want to feel where your opponent is — and stop him getting away from you — while you follow the flight of the ball. From a defender’s point of view, I will say this: if you can stop your opponent and not get penalised by the referee, you are going to do it to gain an advantage. The issue, however, has become rife, so it is right that we try to stop it. But if the campaign is successful, I think you will find defenders wanting a new one to be launched to stop them being blocked by forwards! Ryan Shawcross highlighted the problem of grappling in the box during Stoke's defeat to Southampton . This week I'm looking forward to... Watching Newcastle's young stars progress . Given the passion for football in the area, it has been a mystery to me that Newcastle’s teams have gone without home-grown talent for so long. We might have had a glimpse of the future, though, at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday night when a youthful and inexperienced team knocked the holders out of the Capital One Cup. It would be naive to think those who helped defeat Manchester City — such as 17-year-old Adam Armstrong and 18-year-old Rolando Aarons — will all become fixtures in the team in the coming weeks on the back of one excellent result. But they have given themselves a great chance of having a long-term future at the club and I’m sure Alan Pardew will look to reward them with more opportunities going forward. Newcastle’s fans are desperate for a local hero to emerge. It is about time that they had one. Rolando Aarons announced his arrival with the opening goal for Newcastle against City in midweek . I visited St George’s Park last week to take part in a question-and-answer session for aspiring coaches who were working towards getting their ‘B’ licence. I had a good look around before my talk and I was deeply impressed by the set-up. It is no exaggeration to say it is a world-class facility. Our task now is to produce the players and coaches to match it.","Manchester City are a team which must be changed and refreshed .

"Stoke manager Mark Hughes has sent a simple message to any clubs looking to snatch Bojan Krkic: 'Don't bother.' Liverpool are being increasingly strongly linked with a move for the former Barcelona youngster after his recent run of form. Rumours of their interest were initially flaky but talk of an approach for the 24-year-old has gathered steam this week, with Reds boss Brendan Rodgers perhaps looking to bolster his sometimes meagre forward line. Bojan screams in celebration after scoring the winning goal against Leicester last weekend . Former Barcelona forward has impressed for Stoke in recent weeks after a slow start in the Premier League . However, Hughes was quick to dismiss such talk ahead of Monday's FA Cup fourth-round trip to Rochdale. 'Don't bother,' he said. 'He's done exceptionally well. We knew it would take a little bit of time for him to get to grips with the Premier League and he's done that. 'He's playing well. He's a talented football player and I think he's proving that in the Premier League. 'At this stage of his career that he's had disappointments such as being sent out on loan by Barcelona, the disappointments he had in terms of his game time and maybe how he was treated in certain situations. Bojan is joined by team-mates as they celebrate during the 1-0 win against Leicester . 'So he's come here and really embraced what we're doing and I think he's enjoying the environment that we can give him. 'I think he's very happy. We have no intention of encouraging any interest in him. He's a big part of what we want to do, moving forward, so it's a non-story.' Hughes took his players for warm-weather training in Dubai this week before returning on Friday. 'It was very good,' he said. 'We got there at just the right time, given the weather we left behind here. Mark Hughes has warned any potential suitors off making a January move for Bojan . 'We enjoyed it and got some good work done.' Potters captain Ryan Shawcross is a major doubt for Monday's game due to a groin injury. The centre-half has not trained so far this week and while he is likely to do so this weekend, Hughes is unlikely to risk him. Forward Jonathan Walters is Hughes' only other doubt, with a minor back problem.","Bojan joined Stoke on a permanent deal from Barcelona last summer .

"Aston Villa haven’t scored for four games, and they have scored only one goal in their last six outings in the Premier League. Their tally of just 11 goals in 21 games so far this season is pathetic – it’s comfortably the lowest total in the Premier League and it’s less than half the number Queens Park Rangers have managed. Losing 1-0 at Leicester City on Saturday was as bad as it gets for Villa. They created virtually nothing, the fans booed them at half-time and full-time, chanted for Paul Lambert to go and told the manager he didn’t know what he was doing. Aston Villa and Leicester City players clash in Saturday's Premier League match at the King Power Stadium . Paul Lambert is under pressure as his Aston Villa side continue to slide down the Premier League table . Aston Villa is one of England’s finest football clubs. The leading representative of England’s second city, they have reigned supreme at home and in Europe in the past and have a stadium that is the envy of many. But on the pitch right now they’re useless. If the fans are expecting a return to the Martin O’Neill days when Villa challenged (albeit in vain) for a top-four place, then that’s optimism gone mad. O’Neill left because he didn’t want to work within financial restrictions imposed by owner Randy Lerner. Lambert has taken the job on, occasionally he has got Villa playing some decent stuff but those games have been too infrequent, and right now they are non-existent. Gabriel Agbonlahor, battling with Dean Hammond, has everything a top striker needs... other than his finishing . Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke looks like a player who doesn't want to be at the club . Aston Villa shouldn’t be contenders at the top, but they shouldn’t be this bad. Fans fear a relegation fight and with good reason. I believe Lambert is a good manager who has lost his way. Fielding a midfield three of Ashley Westwood, Carlos Sanchez and Tom Cleverley against a team bottom of the table with only one home win all season is shameful. I’m a fan of Westwood as a holding midfielder, there’s a hint of Michael Carrick about him. But in terms of invention and creation there is nothing. Further forward, Joe Cole looks like he’s retired already, Andreas Weimann’s progress has halted, Christian Benteke looks like he wants to be at another club while Gabriel Agbonlahor has everything a top striker needs – except that he’s a terrible finisher. Aston Villa fans will be expecting a return to the Martin O'Neill days where they challenged the top four . Elsewhere, contracts for top players are running out. Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar will both have to leave in this window if Aston Villa want to make any money from them. Take those two out of this squad and Villa are staring down the barrel of the Championship. Lambert is working within the confines of the financial equivalent of a gastric band set to its tightest, so I have some sympathy. Fat chance of Villa returning to glory in these circumstances. But he isn’t helping himself at all. His teams have no enterprise, and are definitely not exciting to watch. There doesn’t even seem to be an intention to entertain the fans. Losing is never good, but fans would be more willing to forgive if you were trying to do something positive. But losing while stinking the place out is harder to accept so that’s why Lambert is getting relentless grief from the fans. Ron Vlaar is being courted by Arsenal and Aston Villa may be tempted to cash in on the defender this month . The Villa story should be so different. From the ownership of the club downwards, Aston Villa should be forward-thinking, progressive and successful. Villa need an owner who can grab hold of the club and drag it back to where it should be. For a bright owner and for a dynamic manager there is the chance to achieve something special and memorable at a big club like Aston Villa. But nobody wants to seize that opportunity it seems. Villa fans should be mixing it with Munich and Madrid just like they used to. Right now they’re looking more likely to be slumming it with Swindon in the second tier of English football. Sad times at Villa Park.","Aston Villa have failed to score in their last four outings .

"Stuart Pearce doesn't need me to defend him, but I'm not writing this specifically for him. Some people have a grudge against others because of events in the past. Clearly when Danny Mills launched his verbal assault on under-pressure Pearce before the derby at Derby there was more to it than a well-thought-out football observation. Pearce revealed all after his Forest side beat Derby. He'd dropped Mills when manager at Manchester City – hence the revenge. Stuart Pearce was under  pressure after a poor run of results that had seen them slip to 13th in the table . Pearce celebrates as Britt Assombalonga equalises for Nottingham Forest in the second half . Pearce celebrates wildly after Ben Osborn's late winning goal as Forest beat rivals Derby County 2-1 . Stuart Pearce isn't the only person who didn't rate Danny Mills, believe me. I've always judged Pearce on the football: as a player, he was everything a fan, a manager and a team-mate would want: passionate, talented and ready to go to war for his colleagues and friends. Before last summer I'd interviewed Pearce but never met him properly. He worked with us for talkSPORT out in Brazil at the World Cup. I'd heard that he didn't suffer fools gladly, so I was behind the eight ball form the start. Danny Mills said Nottingham Forest manager Pearce is 'not a great coach' and 'not a great tactician' Mills claims people say 'wow, it's Stuart Pearce, legend' but players quickly suss out the former left back . On his first evening we finished work and a group of us went out for a meal. I'd said a lot of things on air about Pearce and I wanted to tackle him off air. To my delight he was right up for it, so after a brief bit of small-talk about our shared love of The Stranglers (he thinks Rattus is the best album, I'm more of a Black and White fan myself), we launched into it head-on. Why did you think putting David James up front when Manchester City needed a goal was a good idea? Is your football too route one? Why did so many players pull out of your Under 21 squads? I was on a roll, but so was Pearce, and as pizza went cold we batted our views back and forth. It was one of my most enjoyable evenings of a brilliant and memorable trip. Goalkeeper David James came on as a forward during a Manchester City match in 2005 . Manchester City goalkeeper James was used as a forward in the final minutes against Middlesbrough . I think he was surprised that someone had actually had the bottle to say these things to his face – so many have written them, and conveniently forgotten them when confronted with Pearce himself. His mistrust of the press came up early during the conversation in the pizzeria. Overall I got some decent answers to my questions and he passionately defended himself as you'd expect. And I think he was pleased to get the chance to state his case. We agreed to disagree on many issues. Pearce then travelled around Brazil for a few days commentating on games for talkSPORT while I was based at the Maracana and the Copacabana. Pearce and Adrian Durham chat in Brazil during the 2014 World Cup for talkSPORT . On his return I was intrigued to see how he would react after our verbal sparring. The ice was broken after I caught him singing 'The Magnificent Seven' by The Clash. It's one of those songs where I know all the words as well, another shared musical love of ours. Pearce then sat down and gave me an interview of which I am very proud. It was in response to yet another England failure at a World Cup and listeners later told me they hung on his every word, even if they didn't agree with all of them. That might have been part of his job, so the true test was when I turned up at a Forest game this season. I wasn't expecting Pearce to join me for a post-match interview up in the press box – he was certainly under no obligation to make the trip up to the back of the stand. But he did, and it was good to see him again. Pearce joined Durham for a post-match interview in the press box aftrer a Nottingham Forest match . We're not best buddies or anything as unprofessional and cosy as that. And I still think he's got a lot to prove as a manager. But he's without doubt a man of integrity, and an honest, passionate guy. He doesn't need or deserve individuals with a grudge blasting him. If he fails, it should be because of things he gets wrong rather than something  Mills has held against him for years. I do like Pearce and I hope he takes Forest back to the Premier League. But I'm still not having David James up front. Pearce doesn't need defending as, if he fails, it should be for football reasons and not for a grudge . Pearce is 'not a great coach, not a great tactician and not a great motivator', according to Mills .","Danny Mills said Stuart Pearce is 'not a great coach, not a great tactician'

"While Ligue 1 and La Liga held a minute’s silence at every game after the terror attacks on Paris last week, English football wrapped itself up in its cosy blanket of arrogance, ignorance, insularity and insensitivity and carried on doing the appalling things with which it is now sadly synonymous. A footballer convicted of rape, still serving his sentence and on the sex offenders’ register expected sympathy when he moaned about ‘mob rule’ stopping him having a career (he could flip burgers under the golden arches if he is so keen to work rather than live off the money he takes from the family of the girlfriend he showed no respect to when he raped another woman). A Premier League manager turned into one of the country’s finest legal minds when he declared he’s done what he claims few others have, and studied the Ched Evans case in detail and he’s decided the rape conviction isn’t safe. The Barcelona team held a minute's silence in memory of the victims of the terror attacks in Paris ahead of Sunday's La Liga match with Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp . Toulouse players form a huddle to remember the 17 victims of the Paris attacks before their match in Lyon . Fans of Nice display a 'Nous sommes Charlie' banner in solidarity with the victims of the shooting at satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, ahead of their Ligue 1 match with Lorient on Saturday . He concluded Evans has a good chance with his ‘appeal.’ Except it’s not an appeal because the court decided not to give him leave to appeal. It’s a case review. But then Steve Bruce actually doesn’t have a clue what he’s talking about. He’s just got a special 'football friend' who he wants to support (Bruce and the Oldham chairman Simon Corney are pals apparently) and so Bruce has taken his size 11 feet, put some massive heavy hobnailed boots on them and trampled all over the sensitivities and feelings of the rape victim, the rape victim’s friends and family, all women across the world and all decent, right-thinking men by talking utter garbage. Meantime, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, Gordon Taylor, who has been in his job for 35 years, decided he’d make a comparison between Ched Evans and the Hillsborough victims. It’s not just the fact that Taylor thinks he can pre-empt the outcome of the Criminal Case Review (Taylor & Bruce Legal Services – remind me never to use these two if ever I’m in need of legal representation), no it’s worse than that. Ched Evans, seen here with girlfriend Natasha Massey, was unable to secure a move to Oldham Athletic . Hull City manager Steve Bruce, claiming he'd studied the Ched Evans case in detail, came to the conclusion that the convicted rapist had a good chance with his 'appeal'  (which is actually a case review) PFA chairman Gordon Taylor compared the Evans case with the 1989 Hillsborough Disaster . How the Daily Mail reported Taylor's comments . To lump the Liverpool fans at Hillsborough that fateful day in with Ched Evans, someone who it has been established beyond doubt cheated on his girlfriend by having oral sex with a girl who was completely drunk (part of Evans’ failed defence was that the victim was so drunk she had forgotten she’d consented and ergo consent was given, rather than not been in any fit state to consent - he really did try to argue that in court) who he had never met before he entered the hotel room, then had sex with her (watched by one friend who was also in the room and filmed by others who were outside) and left via the fire escape. Appalling from Taylor, and what a class act Margaret Aspinall CBE, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, is to accept Taylor’s apology. This is one very special woman. Worse to follow: the Football Association decided it didn’t need to intervene in the Ched Evans situation. That’s right, the governors of our beautiful game had absolutely nothing to say about a convicted rapist, out under licence, still claiming his innocence and because of that showing no remorse for his crime, and not apologising for his crime, potentially playing for a professional football club under its governance. The FA, who champion equality, who are promoting women’s football massively, who do so many good things for so many good causes in this country, had nothing to say about the Ched Evans situation. How is that possible? Oldham Athletic chief executive Neil Joy reads the statement confirming the club won't be signing Evans . Oldham fans make a protest about the 70,000 plus people who signed a petition against them signing Evans . Oldham boss Lee Johnson (right) was left to get on with preparing his team as the Evans affair rumbled on . The worrying outcome is that clubs are left rudderless, unable to guide themselves, and so you’ll get a manager claiming he’s a legal expert, you’ll have a chairman thinking it’s fine to employ someone on the sex offenders’ register at a football club which positions itself at the very heart of a diverse community and actively encourages families, women and children to go to see what is on offer at Boundary Park, and you’ll end up with a PFA chairman who really should know better, talking so thoughtlessly that he insults thousands of still grieving people on Merseyside. Football in England is still a sickening mess of racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and ignorance. 'Don’t sign too many black players because they’ll form a clique and get you the sack,' a former manager told me. 'When can the lads take a sh*t on your face?' a professional footballer who has played in the Premier League once said to a female reporter as she prepared to interview him. The club effectively swept it under the carpet, her male bosses did the same. 'What’s Anelka done wrong?' so many people screamed after his quenelle gesture. Those who were so ignorant they had to ask such a crass question must now be looking at the Jewish community fleeing Paris like the Jews did in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and feel ashamed of themselves. Nicolas Anelka's anti-Semitic 'quenelle' gesture caused controversy back in February last year . I’m generalising here of course, and it’s worth saying that so many people within the game are wonderful people who give up their time and money for the good of football, charitable causes and the community. But the bigger picture is that football in England is a whole bowl of wrong. And events last week showed just how backward the game is in this country when it comes to a question of what is right and decent. A thoroughly sickening time for English football ended with nobody at the FA, the Premier League, the Football League or any individual clubs giving a second thought to the horrors in Paris. Arsene Wenger spoke eloquently on the subject in his press conference while the Arsenal and Stoke players all wore black armbands. Bafetimbi Gomis, who’s from Toulon, held up a Tricolore after Swansea scored and AFC Bournemouth tweeted a photo of their French player Yann Kermorgant holding a poster which read 'Je Suis Charlie' in support of those who suffered in Paris. There may have been other individual marks of respect, but no directive was sent down from the football authorities and no game held a minute’s silence. Swansea City's French player Bafetimbi Gomis holds up a Tricolore after scoring against West Ham . Bournemouth's French midfielder Yann Kermorgrant holds a 'Je Suis Charlie' sign in support of the victims . With more than 40 French players here, that is a disgraceful fact that does not reflect well on English football. Common decency seems to be impossible for some people who hold responsible positions in football in this country. That needs to change and some proper leadership is required to make that change happen throughout our game. Is it wrong for me as a lover of football to want the game to be decent? No, actually I want more than that – I want the national game to be one of the beacons of what is good about England. To show the way, to set an example, to be pure and wholesome. Not to spit-roast girls and treat them like pieces of meat. Not to show ignorance or indifference to political and religious hate. Not to be totally insensitive towards people who have suffered the most appalling tragedies and horrors. So while Spain, France and others across Europe showed respect, England didn’t. In a country that will hold a minute’s silence for people who haven’t even died, no decision-makers thought the tragedies in France warranted any kind of collective respect from English football. To paraphrase Morgan Freeman in Bonfire of the Vanities, a film about a man who unexpectedly has to suffer the consequences of his appalling actions: 'Be decent football, be decent.'","There was a minute's silence at Ligue 1 and La Liga games after Paris .

"I love my job but without doubt the best part of it comes every Saturday afternoon, presenting the football extravaganza that is Matchday Live on talkSPORT from one of the top games of the day. This Saturday topped the lot. At a cramped but cosy Croft Park, restricted by the most limited and challenging resources, I hosted the show while watching Blyth Spartans take on Birmingham City in one of the best FA Cup ties I've ever seen. As I said on air, it was 'thud and blunder' - a classic third-round tie which had everything - a bad pitch, tiny dressing rooms, a non-League minnow against a big club, but also the possibility of an upset. Blyth Spartans players celebrate taking the lead against Birmingham City as they looked for an FA Cup upset . Robbie Dale salutes Blyth fans after he got the side on their way to a giant killing, before Birmingham hit back . Wes Thomas celebrates as Blyth lost their two-goal cushion and Birmingham went 3-2 up on Saturday . Somehow this wasn't regarded as fit for live TV. Incredible. So many people just do not understand the FA Cup, including some who should know better. Take John Carver: he's had more than 30 years in the game, he's from Newcastle, he's a Newcastle United fan, he's been around the club for years as apprentice through to caretaker manager. And yet not even Carver understands how much the fans want to do well in the FA Cup. If he did, there is no way he would have picked that team who disgraced the great name of Newcastle United at Leicester City on Saturday. Newcastle United fans shout abuse at their team at the end of the FA Cup third-round match . John Carver's Newcastle team selection disrespected the Toon Army who had travelled to watch the game . Some have suggested the team selection wasn't down to Carver, but if that is the case I'm sure he wouldn't be interested in the manager's job permanently. Let's be clear here: I have no problem with managers picking what some would consider a weakened side. If that manager believes it's a team that can win the game, then there is no issue. Swansea City are a good example from this weekend. Garry Monk knew he could win the tie at Tranmere Rovers with the 'weakened' team he selected - and he was proved right. But for Newcastle to risk a below-strength team against Premier League opposition who picked up points over Christmas and New Year, was pure folly and totally disrespectful to the Newcastle fans. As for the TV execs who pick the games, some of the criticism aimed at them has been harsh. If it was easy to predict what's going to happen we'd all be millionaires. But the gulf between non-League and Premier League these days means Dover Athletic were always unlikely to beat Crystal Palace. Newcastle's stand-in boss Carver reacts on the touchline during the game against Leicester . Toon goalkeeper Jak Alnwick is helpless to stop the first goal of the game at the King Power Stadium . Everton against West Ham United might turn out to be brilliant, but there is nothing prior to the game suggesting it could be a classic. An educated guess could have told anyone Blyth Spartans would be more likely to push Birmingham City close. No guarantee, but most genuine football fans were surprised the Spartans game wasn't on TV. Blyth are run by a chairman who's a genuine philanthropist, a local businessman who puts his money back into the community to help local people. If ever a chairman deserved live football at his ground it's Tony Platten. He's even got views on the future of football which make interesting listening. I was grateful for the chance to spend some time with him live on talkSPORT on Saturday before the match. Dale applauds fans after Blyth were knocked out of the FA Cup despite their courageous effort . Blyth players look gutted after letting their two-goal lead slip in the FA Cup third round . The Blyth captain Robbie Dale has been at the club 10 years, is a barman at a local pub, and he scored both of Blyth's goals on the day. The manager Tom Wade has supported the club since he was eight, his son plays for them, he lives two doors away from the chairman. The stories were there, it had the makings of the classic it turned out to be, but TV seems obsessed with the Premier League these days. Blyth did themselves proud against Birmingham but ultimately could not get beyond the FA Cup third round . Blyth Spartans fans get in the mood ahead of the match as they entered Croft Park ready for the FA Cup tie . It was a fantastic occasion at Blyth Spartans on Saturday, and a wonderfully dramatic game of football. TV missed out because someone making the decisions just doesn't 'get' the FA Cup. John Carver and Newcastle United Football Club don't 'get' the FA Cup either. Newcastle won't be going down or getting into the Champions League so why not go for it with a full-strength side in the Cup? The importance of the FA Cup has been questioned in the Premier League era. Newcastle players look dejected after the final whistle as Vurnon Anita applauds the travelling fans . David Nugent squares up to Newcastle's Massadio Haidara during a heated opening at the King Power . But I've yet to interview a footballer who doesn't want to win it or do well in it. Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick have won everything at club level - apart from the FA Cup. Talk to either of them about that blip on their football CV and you'll be left in no doubt they both desperately want to win the FA Cup. Supporters understand the FA Cup. Look how Arsenal fans celebrated last year. I love the FA Cup despite the fact my team Peterborough United have been useless in the competition for several decades. Players understand the FA Cup. I interviewed Aaron Ramsey recently and brought up his goal at Wembley last season against Hull. He admitted he had watched the goal back again that morning. It clearly meant the world to him to score the winner in the FA Cup final. Unfortunately managers, some owners, and TV executives don't understand the FA Cup. Sadly these people are the key decision-makers in football. Aaron Ramsey fondly remembers his FA Cup-winning strike against Hull City from last May .","Newcastle United's team selection at Leicester City disgraced the club .
John Carver's XI disrespected the travelling Toon Army .
Blyth Spartans' heroic loss to Birmingham City should have been televised .

"Newcastle United fans are all doing a jig by the Tyne right now. They have just been given a gift for Christmas and a Happy New Year all in one. I don't know one Newcastle fan who wanted Pardew to stay, so they are delighted Crystal Palace have obliged and taken him off their hands. But there is a downside to this that must surely hurt even the most passionate member of the anti-Alan Pardew brigade. Alan Pardew has left Newcastle United for relegation-threatened Crystal Palace . Pardew's decision to leave Tyneside will make the majority of Newcastle United fans happy . Newcastle United's stock is low. As a football club its standing is tumbling down to what could be an all-time low. I'm not talking about league position – I'm talking about how the club is viewed globally. It's clear they are not one of the big boys. It's clear that under Mike Ashley's guardianship Newcastle United are also-rans at best, and certainly not a club that's likely to attract a top manager. Tyneside times are so hard right now, that a third-rate manager has chosen to extricate himself from the remaining six years of his contract, despite the fact that atrocious results and a truly appalling record in the FA and League Cups suggested there was no imminent indication he was likely to get the sack. To make it even worse, Pardew hasn't been tempted by Chelsea or Inter Milan. He's chosen Crystal Palace. Newcastle United under owner Mike Ashley (pictured) are also-rans at best . The stadium is one of the worst in the Premier League, the budget was so bad even Tony Pulis chose unemployment rather than stay there, and there's far more likelihood Palace will be heading down to the Championship rather than Newcastle. And yet Pardew would rather be in Croydon than the north east. Of course there may be other reasons for this switch. Reasons which have yet to emerge. But from the information we have it is a move from Pardew which shows that Newcastle United is not an attractive proposition. Around a year ago he enjoyed a run of seven wins in nine at Newcastle. They were flying, and playing some great football. But then Yohan Cabaye was sold against the manager's wishes, he wasn't replaced and Newcastle United's season fell apart. Yohan Cabaye was sold against Pardew's wishes as Newcastle were enjoying a purple patch . Cabaye was sold to French giants Paris Saint-Germain in a deal worth £19million . And the truth is this: unless you have something special as a manager (in his 10 years of management Pardew hasn't shown us anything yet – he's been decent and no more), there is little chance of success at Newcastle United. The 'buy cheap – sell big' policy at Newcastle works from a business point of view, but leaves success-starved fans frustrated. And there are plenty of them: 52,000 crazed Geordies packing the stadium out every home game, and a passionate away following. Pardew applauds the fans after Newcastle beat Everton  3-2 on December 28, his last game in charge . They must be overjoyed Pardew has left. But at the same time it's confirmation of what some of us have believed for a little while now – the only thing big about Newcastle United Football Club is the support of the fans. Fairplay to Crystal Palace for getting the man they wanted. But to see that manager choose Palace rather than stay at St James' Park shows just how far Newcastle United have sunk as a club under the current regime.","Alan Pardew leaving is a Christmas gift for Newcastle supporters .
Newcastle's image globally means they won't attract a top manager .
Under Mike Ashley's guardianship Toon are seen as also-rans at best ."
"After he played well against a severely weakened Hull City in the FA Cup, I heard calls for Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez to be named player of the year. This is utter nonsense. Put any decent player in this Arsenal side and they'll look good. He's been excellent of course, but only in patches. Look at the Hull game - there was a good half-hour period with the score still at 1-0 when most Arsenal players went missing - including Sanchez. Has he made Arsenal better than last season? Not really, no. And where was he at Stoke City? And Southampton? He looks better than he actually is because he lines up next to a load of shirkers. He's been the best Arsenal player - by far. But not the best player in the Premier League. Alexis Sanchez capped a fine performance with a late goal in Arsenal's 2-0 win against Hull City . The Chilean forward smiles after seeing his inventive chip sail over the crossbar in the first half . Although Sanchez (left) has played well, any decent player would look good in this Arsenal side . Who else stakes a claim? Eden Hazard is a joy to watch, David Silva the same. Maybe Sergio Aguero's injuries will cost him votes but his brilliance cannot be denied. The statistic freaks will be swooning over Cesc Fabregas's assists of course, so he's in with a shout, deservedly so. These are the names most likely. But if Manchester United maintain their league position, it would be criminal to ignore their spectacular return to the top four. Sure they've spent a load of money, but it's not a computer game. It actually needs to be put into place on the pitch and games need to be won. Cesc Fabregas (right) has contributed an abundance of assists for Chelsea so far this season . Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea has played brilliantly but has also conceded a lot of goals . But the big-money signings at Manchester United have been injured for chunks of the season – Angel di Maria, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw for example. Radamel Falcao's wages are sky high, but he's not been fully fit this season. So those who expect big money to automatically lead to success are ignoring the facts. So if a Manchester United player should be given the award at the end of the season, which one is it? David de Gea springs to mind, and he's been brilliant of course, although we shouldn't forget he was in goal at Milton Keynes Dons and Leicester City earlier this season. Michael Carrick brings an assured quality to the team not many players can deliver, but again injury has kept him out of action for the early part of the season so that would make it hard to give him the gong. Wayne Rooney must be awarded player of the year if he leads Man United into the top four this season . Rooney holds off a challenge from Yeovil's Joe Edward's during the FA Cup third-round victory . It has to be Wayne Rooney. So far this season he has been asked to take on the captaincy at Manchester United, take on the captaincy with England, adapt to a new and crucial position in the team, and still deliver goals. He's handled everything thrown at him. On top of that he has had to play a true captain's role by helping blend youngsters into the Manchester United first team - the likes of Paddy McNair, Tyler Blackett and James Wilson will all have needed Rooney's arm around them at some point this season. Rooney has captained both Man United and England brilliantly well so far this season . The Man United captain walks out on to the field at Huish Park on Sunday in the FA Cup . He's had to do what a good skipper does and make the new arrivals feel welcome and comfortable. All of this with the pressure of leading the team back into the top four. No other player has been asked to do all this at their club. And so far Rooney has been a success. England even have a 100 per cent record with him as captain. Forget Sanchez and Fabregas. Rooney has delivered far more. In my view, he's the one on course for player of the year. The pressure that has been on Rooney to integrate new players and youngsters means he deserves an award .","Alexis Sanchez has been brilliant for Arsenal this season but if you put any decent player in that side they will look good .
Calls for Sanchez or Cesc Fabregas to get player of the year are nonsense .
Wayne Rooney has performed brilliantly under pressure so far this season .
He must be given award after captaining England and Manchester United .
Rooney has helped youngsters bed in and could lead United into top four ."
"Several times at Goodison Park on Saturday I was left gasping at the quality of David Silva, he’s a joy to watch. And he’s not the only one. I’ve been out of my seat at some of the quality in the Premier League this season – Cesc Fabregas’ range of passing, Wayne Rooney’s quality, Eden Hazard’s running with the ball, Sergio Aguero’s breathtaking goals, Alexis Sanchez’s twists and turns, even Alex Song at West Ham has shown some class in midfield, while Andy Carroll’s goal at Swansea made light work of all the clowns who see him solely as a big lump up front. Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick reflect on a disappointing day for Manchester United at Old Trafford . Dusan Tadic rips off his shirt as he celebrates scoring the only goal of the game in Southampton's shock win . There is some real quality in the Premier League. So why has Southampton’s dour display of dire defensive doggedness at Old Trafford on Sunday been widely applauded? It’s three points, it’s a win, for Saints fans it’s brilliant. But as a neutral football observer it was awful to see two top-four teams go head to head, yet only one of them trying to play football reflecting their position in the league. Manchester United should have scored – twice they carved Saints open but Juan Mata failed to finish both chances. So the away side got lucky at one end. Juan Mata failed to convert two chances against Southampton during Manchester United's 1-0 defeat . The Spain international reflects on a missed opportunity at Old Trafford . And then at the other end Graziano Pelle fired in a shot that hit the post and could have gone anywhere. It fell to Dusan Tadic and Southampton scored. That’s another stroke of luck. So, in the same way Saints were unlucky to lose at Arsenal earlier this season - in a very similar game, they created next to nothing, were organised, but played very little football and the Gunners only broke through when Saints went down to 10 men because of injury - they got extremely lucky at Old Trafford by getting a break at one end, and seeing United miss two sitters. Maybe luck balances itself out, but Southampton in my view are too good to be relying on luck that may or may not go their way. I’ll stress that if you’re a Southampton fan it doesn’t matter how your team wins – good luck to them, they can enjoy it. Ronald Koeman would have been delighted with his side's performance at the home of Manchester United . Former Chelsea midfielder Mata looks to the sky after missing an opportunity to score for Manchester United . But let’s not fool ourselves here, Southampton didn’t go up there to play. And that’s a shame. I was at St Mary’s when Ronald Koeman’s side reduced Sunderland to a gibbering wreck earlier this season with a stunning display of brilliant passing football played at a tempo few teams can sustain. Saints were sensational. I want to see more of that. At Old Trafford though, they had 11 Victor Wanyamas on the pitch. Only with a dollop of luck will that win you the game, and that’s exactly what happened. I can hear the stat-monsters screaming about United failing to get a shot on target: . 1) It’s not true. A Robin van Persie effort was on target in the first half but was blocked by a defender. For some reason the official statistics don’t count a shot blocked by an opposition player, which is weird. Louis van Gaal's side failed to find a way past Southampton who arrived at United with a defensive gameplan . 2) One shot on target doesn’t mean that United didn’t play good football and create chances. It only means their finishing on the day was wayward. Before the weekend only the top two had scored more than United in the Premier League this season so it was just one of those off days in front of goal for United, and in particular  Mata. In the final analysis, Southampton won the game, picked up three points and everyone connected with the club is happy. For them, that’s all that matters – a win is a win. For the many United-haters across the football world, it will be right up there with their disastrous displays at Leicester and MK Dons. Eden Hazard has been superb for Chelsea, taking on opposition defenders at pace with the ball at his feet . Alex Sanchez has lit up the Premier League with his goals and creative play for Arsenal . But for lovers of the beautiful game, there is an acceptance that defending is part of the 90 minutes, but there is also a desire to see expansive football. Knowing that Southampton are capable of so much more leaves the neutral frustrated that they didn’t go to Old Trafford to show us all what they can do. Pressing the opposition and pressing them high up the pitch is admirable – Barcelona have enjoyed stunning success doing that. But Barca played sparkling special football at the same time and that’s what I thought we’d see from Southampton on Sunday. Unfortunately it didn’t happen. Historically, the Premier League’s most admired teams have a bit of everything. Not just an ability to stop the opposition. If Southampton produce an end-of-season DVD entitled '101 Great Moments Closing Down the Opposition' expect the victory at Manchester United to feature highly.","In Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez there is real quality in England .
So, it's a shock that a dour Southampton display was so well received .
Manchester United were the only team wanting to play football on Sunday .
All that mattered for Southampton is the victory and the three points ."
"All eyes are on Merseyside right now - as two English youngsters are being asked to be the talisman for their team. Ross Barkley is seen as the man to rescue a sub-standard season at Everton and Raheem Sterling is expected to take over from Steven Gerrard as Liverpool's big hope. Hang on, isn't it a bit unfair to be asking so much of these players? Raheem Sterling should look to move to Europe and become England's first real superstar . Ross Barkley should head to Manchester United and be nurtured into a top talent . In my view it might be best for both if they leave for pastures new. They've both shown flashes of brilliance - you have to be in football denial to not recognise how talented these two are. Saying they have the ability to shine at the top level in the future is one thing, making unreasonable demands on them on the pitch prematurely is something very different. Everton and Liverpool are both giants, and to place so much expectation on their shoulders at this stage of their careers is plain wrong. Both had their breakthrough seasons in 2013-14, and both have been patchy with their form this campaign - that's to be expected given their inexperience. Everton have failed this season due to defensive weaknesses and because Romelu Lukaku hasn't delivered value for money so far. But this highlights some major issues with the Everton squad: the defence is ageing, while the players they seem to be relying on to spark up their season are too young for that responsibility - both Lukaku and Barkley are still only 21. In Barkley's case I suspect that Roberto Martinez will seriously consider trading him in for a fee of £30-£40million in the summer so he can rebuild his squad. Having splurged £28m on Lukaku with limited return so far, I can't see the board making much cash available unless the manager sells first. That price tag will bring its own pressures but as Wayne Rooney showed 10 years ago, if you're good enough you'll be able to handle it. And let's keep the theme going: Manchester United is exactly the right club for Barkley. The fans tend to back the youngsters there, and under Louis van Gaal his education would be ideal. Sure there are expectations at United, but he'll be surrounded by better players who can take that pressure off him. That isn't happening at Goodison. Wayne Rooney moved to Man United from Everton and has developed well - Barkley should follow that path . Raheem Sterling seems set to sign a new deal at Liverpool but I can't help thinking he's missing a great opportunity to do something very special. He could be the first young English football superstar to move to a European giant and make his mark. Liverpool might not make the Champions League next year, and they're already out of it this season. Get that move to Real Madrid or Bayern Munich, do your thing abroad and become one of the greats. See what Gareth Bale has done in a short space of time over there - why wouldn't Sterling want some of that? Do what Steve McManaman did – it is not a crime to leave Liverpool and go elsewhere to win the Champions League. At Anfield, Sterling saw Luis Suarez leave last year, and he'll lose Steven Gerrard this summer. Suarez wasn't replaced, and it seems Brendan Rodgers is talking up Jordan Henderson as Gerrard's successor. I like Henderson, but Liverpool need big players, stellar names, if they are to get back to where they were. Gareth Bale (left) has matured brilliantly at Real and there is no reason why Sterling could not do the same . All the pressure to provide the magic will be on Sterling. Does he need that pressure? He's destined for bigger things than being the great hope at Liverpool, a club that might make it back to the big time every season, or might not. Sterling should be one of several top players at a club firmly established as one of the most competitive in Europe. He's that good. I know Liverpool and Everton are giants, but right now those clubs are putting too much pressure on the shoulders of young superstars. They've done great work developing these players, but that is being put at risk with the demands placed on them. Sterling dribbles with the ball for Liverpool during their Premier League draw with Leicester City . Neither club will make the top four this season, and unless one of them wins the Europa League they won't be playing Champions League football next term. Sterling and Barkley aren't bigger than the clubs they currently play for - they never will be. But right now they are too good for them. And that's why they need to move away. Barkley advances with the ball for Everton as Newcastle United's Cheick Tiote looks on .

"Passionate Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony is regarded by many as the kind of guy they want running their football club. Well here’s some breaking news – he could be coming to your place soon. In an exclusive interview, MacAnthony has told Sportsmail that if he loses the Peterborough fans, the time will be right to sell up, and he added that he ‘100 per cent’ wants to be back and owning another club in the future. Worryingly for fans of League One Peterborough, the chairman also expressed disappointment in the interview that sometimes owning Posh now ‘p***** me off.’ Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony says he will sell the club if he loses the fans . ‘I try to do things right, ask for patience in advance of doing things right, and then get hammered on the first dodgy spell we go through. I get p***** off when accused of not spending money. Posh have spent more in the last two seasons than every League One and League Two club, and a lot of Championship clubs so it’s a nonsense accusation. Millions have been spent on young talent and facilities.’ And that is money the club has earned through MacAnthony’s policy of bringing talent through the club, and scouring the lower leagues and non-Leagues for future stars. Dwight Gayle is the best example, signed from Dagenham and Redbridge for £500,000 in January 2013, sold to the Premier League for £6million six months later. I’m a lifelong Peterborough fan – a season ticket holder - and I sometimes despair at my fellow Posh supporters who seem to have lost a grip on the size of the club (small), the size of the crowds (poor) and by contrast the size of the job our energetic chairman is doing (enormous). These are golden times to be a Posh fan, yet two months of poor results and performances have taken some fans into meltdown, as if they think Peterborough United have some sort of divine right to be in the Championship. Peterborough's Aaron McLean celebrates scoring against Leyton Orient at the weekend . Earlier this year Posh won the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy at Wembley, that counts as success. A few months on and the chairman has got fans tweeting him that they are boycotting the club until Darren Ferguson is sacked. No wonder MacAnthony is annoyed. The fans should be grateful to have this guy running the club. ‘I love the game, I love owning a club. I honestly feel I’ve made a footprint in the game in a good way and as a younger chairman, if allowed, I could make even bigger and better ones. I want to have a club defying all odds, reaching for the stars and making waves, growing on and off the pitch and owning its own stadium, debt free with 70 per cent of the first-team squad home grown, playing good football, week in week out.’ Posh boss Darren Ferguson has had a tough time in recent months with the side struggling for results . Fans up and down the country will be reading that, eyes lighting up at the prospect of having a chairman with such vision and drive at their club. After winning their first league game for almost two months on Saturday, MacAnthony told me he felt ‘relief, ecstasy, happiness and satisfaction. More importantly I really enjoyed the game and the way we played.’ This man is passionate about football. Good news for Posh fans is that MacAnthony insists he wants to leave them in the Championship or higher, and in the hands of a billionaire, but adds: ‘Fans are the ones who will decide when my time is up and if I lose them and their support then it will be time to sell up for sure.’ Dwight Gayle was signed by Peterborough for £500,000 and sold to Palace six months later for £6million . And as his workload away from football has recently increased, MacAnthony’s outlook and maybe even priorities have changed.

"Back in the summer I wrote in this column that Bojan was one of the best and most exciting signings of the transfer window and if he could recapture his teenage magic, then Stoke City would have a wonderful player. They'd also have more proof for the sceptics that they're no longer a rugby team and are changing their style. Well on Saturday I was at the Britannia Stadium to see the former Barcelona man run the show against Arsenal. He wanted the ball all the time, even in tight situations, rarely wasted a pass, treasured possession and created. He scored, he even tracked back and worked hard. He was head, shoulders and torso ahead of everyone else on the pitch. It was a joy to watch. I interviewed Stoke's Geoff Cameron this week who said that it took Bojan a little while to settle in and adapt to the Premier League, but that he has been brilliant in recent weeks. Cameron told me: 'He's making players better around him, he's starting to get comfortable, he's going to be known as our main guy, the one who makes us tick.' Stoke City's Bojan Krkic has started to show why he was seen as a teenage prodigy . Bojan slips an effort beyond Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez as Stoke raced into a two-goal lead . And it got me thinking. Is it possible that Bojan is on his way to becoming Stoke City's greatest ever player? They've had some amazing names down the years – some legends of football like Gordon Banks, Sir Stanley Matthews, Peter Shilton and Sir Geoff Hurst. Other players are true legends who will forever be in the hearts of Stoke City fans – the likes of Mike Pejic, Terry Conroy, George Eastham and Denis Smith, who all played with the Potters when they won their only major honour to date, the League Cup in 1972. Matthews is probably the No 1. He was starring for the club when they enjoyed their highest ever league placing of fourth, and was still with them when they matched it a few years later. He trebled the crowd when he returned to Stoke in 1961 and played for the club at the age of 50 – incredible. Sir Stanley Matthews (pictured playing in his testimonial match in 1965) is Stoke's greatest player ever . The winger (beating Chelsea's Eddie McCreadie in 1963) dazzled for the Potters over two spells . George Eastham (centre) and Jimmy Greenhoff parade the League Cup at Wembley back in 1972 . There will be few players who have worn the Stoke City shirt and had more technical ability than Bojan but he needs to show that ability and apply it in matches successfully over a period of time. It doesn't have to be a very long time – Mark Stein is considered a Stoke legend by many fans despite only spending just over two years at the club. To be the greatest Stoke player ever, Bojan also has to make a major contribution to them winning a trophy. They came close in 2011 when they lost 1-0 to Manchester City in the FA Cup final. But that 1972 Wembley win over Chelsea remains their greatest day. England's World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks played at Stoke for five years . At 24, Bojan has time to make himself a Stoke City legend. But he is also young enough to catch the eye of clubs around Europe and re-establish himself on the big stage. Make no mistake, the Spanish international has had Stoke fans on the edge of their seats in recent weeks. As his impact grows, he will be man-marked and kicked. If he can cope with all that, he will be one of the stars of the Premier League this season. If he takes the club to another level, and a major trophy, then he could become Stoke's greatest ever player. And if Matthews were alive to watch Bojan's style and class at the Britannia Stadium, I'm sure he'd give his blessing.","Bojan was the standout as Stoke humbled Arsenal in the Premier League .

"It took an uncomfortable motivational speech from a few unknown fans at Stoke railway station to knock Arsenal into some kind of shape. It was horribly personal towards Arsene Wenger and I have huge sympathy with the Gunners manager for the abuse he had to suffer in those circumstances after the 3-2 defeat. But it did the job Wenger seems incapable of. It got the players playing for him, and it even got the Emirates crowd singing his name after Saturday’s win over Newcastle. Arsene Wenger looks dejected after Arsenal lost to Stoke earlier this month . Of course, Arsenal have a habit of smashing inferior opponents and then failing badly when it matters, so let’s see how the revival against Galatasaray and then Newcastle works out going forward. And what a stroke of good fortune when the Gunners picked out Monaco in the Champions League draw. If they don’t get through that Wenger should resign on the spot and hang his head in shame. But against a backdrop of embarrassing defending, lack of leadership, strange tactics, fans arguing and even fighting among themselves, and a manager being abused by the club’s own supporters, one player has stood out with his quality, his attitude and his demeanour. I’ve seen Arsenal several times this season and on each occasion the Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has played well, I’ve never seen his shoulders slump when things were going wrong, I’ve never seen him abandon the sinking ship. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been one of Arsenal's star performers this season . Oxlade-Chamberlain never lets his head drop when playing for Arsenal . What I love about the way he plays is that he is so dynamic: every time he gets the ball I sense that something exciting is going to happen. And he’s not a one-trick Ox either. He can run with the ball, he can spot and execute a pass – and a killer pass to - he can cross, and he can finish. He played the full 90 minutes in Turkey and then produced a man-of-the-match performance against Newcastle. In the Premier League or the Champions League the Ox has proved he can play in different positions and still produce quality. And he can change a game – I was in Rio in 2013 when he came on as sub and transformed England from a side being overrun by Brazil, to a team dominating the game. He also scored a wondergoal in the Maracana that day. Oxlade-Chamberlain seems to have the ability to perform at whatever level and on whatever stage you ask him and it was England’s misfortune he was injured for the World Cup – I believe he could have made a difference. So did Roy Hodgson, that’s why he took the gamble and took the Ox to Brazil in the summer. Sadly it didn’t work out. Oxlade-Chamberlain scored an excellent goal for England in the Maracana against Brazil last year . In my view he should be playing regularly for Arsenal – he’s been in and out of the line-up this season but has started the last four games – and should be a permanent fixture for England. He rarely has a bad game, is usually a threat and so far in his career he has conducted himself impeccably. Future captaincy material? I’d say so. One final thought on Arsenal’s win over Newcastle: a decent display from Santi Cazorla, and some have given him credit for staying on his feet in the box instead of going down screaming for a penalty. But what I didn’t like from Cazorla was the dinked penalty at the end. Some call it cheeky, I call it disrespectful and unprofessional. Santi Cazorla chips the ball over Newcastle keeper Jak Alnwick to score his penalty . Cazorla should have shown more respect when taking his penalty . Jak Alnwick is a rookie keeper, Newcastle United’s third choice, on his full debut he’s already had to pick the ball out of the net three times, and knows he’s likely to have to do it again as he sets himself for Cazorla’s penalty. I’ve no problem with the Spaniard scoring the penalty – of course not. But why is he so keen to humiliate and embarrass a young fellow professional? It lacked class and there was simply no need for it. Cazorla could learn from the Germans who chose to take their foot off the gas against Brazil in the World Cup semi-final – that could have been double figures easily. The Spaniard is a good player – he doesn’t need to resort to such nonsense.","Arsenal fans gave their side a wake up call at Stoke station .

"The only complaint Jose Mourinho could possibly have after this astonishingly one-sided contest was the fact that there was so little to complain about. Not a hint of controversy. Not a booking he could blame on a referee. Barely a misplaced pass that might have given him an excuse to criticise one of his players. It was, Mourinho was moved to declare, a perfect performance from his Chelsea side; a ‘perfect game’ with no possible reason to cry conspiracy or point to an ongoing campaign against his team. He could not even moan about Wilfried Bony’s transfer to Manchester City when the absence of the Ivorian striker was clearly to Chelsea’s advantage.

Instead, a stunned Liberty Stadium witnessed Chelsea returning to the campaign that remains Mourinho’s true focus beyond the diversionary tactics of his recent outbursts; the campaign to propel his side back to the summit of the English game. However strong Manchester City might be, Chelsea will be hard to stop on this evidence. This time two first-half goals apiece for Oscar and Diego Costa and a further second-half strike from Andre Schurrle secured three more points, with some quite extraordinary defensive errors contributing to Swansea’s demise. But to suggest simply that Swansea were the architects of their own downfall would be to seriously undervalue just how wonderful a performance this was from the Premier League leaders. Swansea were awful. ‘Horrible’ was how Garry Monk described a first 45 minutes he rated their worst of the season.

Mourinho has assembled the Chelsea side we are enjoying this season and right now they are playing as well — and as attractively — as any team in Europe. The manager was invited to praise Costa and Oscar afterwards but he quite rightly pointed to the fact that every player in the side deserved praise. He mentioned John Terry, Filipe Luis and Branislav Ivanovic in response but he could just have easily pointed to the commanding midfield display of Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic. The finishing of Oscar and Costa was nevertheless superb. The opening Chelsea goal, scored after just 49 seconds, might have owed much to Gylfi Sigurdsson’s wayward pass — one seemingly intended for Ashley Williams but one that was diverted into the path of Oscar when it struck Tom Carroll — but it remained a marvellous strike. There was the briefest glimpse of a riposte when Sigurdsson sent a shot crashing against the angle of post and crossbar in the second minute but after that Swansea pretty much folded. When Fabregas, so composed and confident alongside the marvellous Matic, executed a delightful one-two with Willian before feeding the ball into Costa, goal number two arrived in the 20th minute. Costa, much like Oscar, produced a fierce, low finish Lukasz Fabianski was powerless to stop. Chelsea were so in control, with Willian seeing one shot bounce off a post and another rebound off the crossbar. But when Federico Fernandez contrived in the 34th minute to knock a back-pass into the path of Costa, the Spaniard extended Chelsea’s lead with another deadly strike.

For Monk it was clearly proving very painful, Swansea’s manager watching in despair as another goal arrived within two minutes. This time Willian sparked the move with a burst from midfield and a delightful pass out to Costa on the right flank, with Costa then delivering to the ball into the path of a rapidly advancing Oscar and so inviting the Brazilian to smash it home. He did so with ease. It enabled Chelsea to stroll through the second half, even if there was a moment when Costa and Williams threatened to become embroiled in an ugly exchange. But it remained a game without controversy and without much of a fight from the hosts. With one eye on Tuesday’s League Cup encounter at Liverpool, Mourinho eventually made changes. But a fifth Chelsea goal, scored in the 79th minute, still came, with Eden Hazard and Ivanovic inviting Schurrle to compound Swansea’s misery from close range.

But the Liverpool manager admits that while he has ‘total respect’ for Mourinho, they no longer talk as frequently as they once did. He said: ‘I have a huge respect for him. He is a wonderful man and coach. But you are so engrossed in your own work, you don’t communicate as much, you don’t have the conversations you had before and, ultimately, you could be a rival.

"Stuart Lancaster cut to the chase in summing up exactly why he and his England management team have gone back to Nick Easter, a blast from the distant, tainted past. ‘I think the cycle of the team has reached a point where the development bit stops,’ said the head coach. ‘It’s about the winning.’ His remark, after announcing a squad to prepare for the Six Nations opener against Wales that also includes the mercurial Danny Cipriani, will delight those who have bemoaned the frequent talk of lessons and journeys. Harlequins' 36-year-old forward Nick Easter was handed a recall to the England set-up . The pragmatic quest for results has become the first and overwhelming focus, and the inclusion of Cipriani and 36-year-old Harlequins No 8 Easter, who has been in international exile since the last World Cup, symbolises that. After the painstaking creation of a new culture, collective spirit and sense of national pride, Lancaster and his assistants have recognised the profound need to choose the best available men to win matches, even if that means altering entrenched perceptions. So Easter, who was part of the ill-fated 2011 campaign, has been given a chance. ‘The last time I spoke to him face to face was 2011 and a fair amount of water has passed under the bridge since then,’ said Lancaster. ‘He was aware that his name was coming back into the frame and he was also aware through my conversations with Conor (O’Shea, his director of rugby) that with Ben Morgan’s injury, he could get a chance. Easter has been in out of the international picture for some time and was part of the ill-fated 2011 team . England head coach Stuart Lancaster announced his training squad at Twickenham on Wednesday . ‘Who was to say in 2011 that he was still going to be playing as well as he is now? It’s a great credit to him for doing that and now, in a World Cup year, with Ben Morgan injured, the opportunity has arisen. To me, he expressed his desire to not finish his England career on the 2011 World Cup and to come back and finish the story. ‘He has convinced me he will buy into us as a group and I think he’ll add real value. He’s got it all on to get into the team, as we know how well Billy Vunipola is playing, but you wouldn’t rule him out because of what he has done since 2011.’ Easter has been a colossal influence for Quins this season, as he has been in so many recent campaigns, and there is some justification in his assertion that he is playing better than ever before. Forwards coach Graham Rowntree  acknowledged how he has maintained his fitness, joking: ‘He’s quick for an old-timer and you can’t dispute how well he’s playing.’ Lancaster with his forwards coach Graham Rowntree (left) and backs coach Andy Farrell (right) Rowntree praised Easter's performances and added that he 'is quick for an old-timer' But more significant is the desire of Lancaster, Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt to revise their view of Easter the man, given his links to the previous regime. Lancaster was adamant that his cultural revolution will not be compromised. ‘What happened in 2011 is history but also we did draw a line under it pretty quickly in January 2012,’ he said. ‘We made 15 changes to the squad. There were some difficult decisions to be made at the time. I’m confident in the culture and the environment we’ve got now and the senior players who drive it. Someone like Nick can be a part of it and add to it.’ As ever, midfield selection will generate debate ahead of the opener in Cardiff on February 6, but despite high praise for the Bath’s Kyle Eastmond and the electric Jonathan Joseph, the coaches’ pragmatism will also be illustrated by their centre choices. Danny Cipriani was also recalled to the England set up by head coach Lancaster on Wednesday . Farrell said: ‘Luther Burrell played well against Leicester in a big game and you’ve got to look at how Brad Barritt played in the autumn series. Against Australia he was pretty immense really.’ So: Barritt at 12, Burrell at 13. Debate over. Meanwhile, Lancaster revealed that he will issue a further warning to hooker Dylan Hartley about his discipline after his recent three-week ban for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith. ‘I’m going to speak to him in camp,’ he said. ‘I’ll be making it crystal clear to Dylan one to one, but more so the team, that discipline has to be top notch. If we give away dumb penalties against Wales, Leigh Halfpenny can kick them from anywhere and it’s going to compromise our chances.’ That won’t be tolerated, not now the head coach has confirmed that results are the be-all and end-all. Midfield balance . The perennial thorny issue — who to play at centre. Calls for Bath fliers are set to be ignored, with Brad Barritt and Luther Burrell likely to join forces against Wales. Loosehead prop . England have an embarrassment of riches in this position. Alex Corbisiero and Mako Vunipola are Lions back from injury but Joe Marler deserves to be retained. Second lock . Absence of Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes has left a second-row void. George Kruis emerged well in the autumn but Geoff Parling is the front-runner to partner Dave Attwood. Scrum-half . Another area of supreme strength. Danny Care and Richard Wigglesworth are strong challengers but Ben Youngs is in great form and worthy of keeping his place for now. Tight or loose . England’s strategic plan is unclear.

"Sam Burgess remains on course for his first experience of national service in rugby union at the end of this month, despite being ruled out of Bath’s encounter with Toulouse on Sunday. The West Country club’s 25-year-old cross-code recruit from South Sydney Rabbitohs was absent from the line-up announced on Friday for the Champions Cup Pool 4 crunch at Stade Ernest Wallon. His place at No 12 has been taken by England centre Kyle Eastmond, who resumes his alliance with Jonathan Joseph. There was no official explanation, but Sportsmail understands that Burgess suffered a minor leg injury in the final minutes of the victory over Wasps a week ago. Sam Burgess (left) stretches his legs during his side's victory at The Rec last weekend . Burgess powers over for his first try for Bath as Mike Ford's men romped to a 39-26 victory . Burgess is mobbed by his Bath team-mates after he touched down against Wasps . He was named man of the match following his try-scoring contribution in that fixture, so demotion seems unlikely. Instead, it is thought that he has been rested by head coach Mike Ford, in order to be fit for the home clash with Glasgow next weekend. Both player and club are optimistic that this will be a one-week absence, and that will be welcome news for Stuart Lancaster. The England head coach had long since decided that Burgess will start at inside centre for the Saxons against Ireland Wolfhounds in Cork on January 30. Lancaster has acclaimed the newcomer for his ‘terrific’ impact since switching from league and is understood to be determined to bring him into the national set-up at the earliest opportunity. Kyle Eastmond (left) will resume his centre partnership with Jonathan Joseph against Toulouse . Stuart Lancaster was hoping to draft Burgess into the England squad for the November internationals until the rugby league convert 's severe facial injuries suffered in the NRL Grand Final delayed his start in union . The England management had hoped to invite Burgess into camp during the autumn campaign until his facial injuries in the NRL Grand Final delayed his start in union. Now, with the Saxons appearance as the next stage of his rapid transition, the Yorkshireman is likely to be involved in Test training before the end of the Six Nations. A place in the expanded pre-World Cup training squad is inevitable, if he stays in one piece. While Lancaster will be relieved that Burgess is not out for long, he will have growing concerns about Courtney Lawes. The Northampton lock hasn’t played since the East Midlands derby against Leicester on December 20 and is not in the side to face the Ospreys on Sunday. Courtney Lawes is still suffering with an ankle problem and will not feature against the Ospreys on Sunday . Saints have recalled captain Dylan Hartley after his latest ban but Lawes rolled his ankle in that showdown with the Tigers. His extended spell of inactivity is far from ideal for England, especially with Joe Launchbury already ruled out of the Six Nations. Harlequins and Wasps engage in an all-English duel at The Stoop this evening, with Pool Two coming down to a three-way tussle for qualification also involving Leinster, who visit the Ricoh Arena next weekend. Dai Young is encouraged that his Wasps team still have their destiny in their own hands. The director of rugby said: ‘You don’t need to be a mathematician to work out that if we win both, we’re through. But it’s not easy.’","Sam Burgess scored his first try for Bath against Waps last weekend .

"I really hope history shows that all the criticism England, and especially Stuart Lancaster, have faced over the past two weeks turns out to be a blessing in disguise. Every successful coach understands that no team progresses in straight lines. There are always tough lessons along the way. You don’t become a bad team overnight and England still have every ounce of potential they took into the autumn series. What is important now is how they respond. At times of success a head coach needs to look out of the window and praise those who have contributed. At times like this, you have to look in the mirror. It is important not to overreact, but after five losses on the bounce there needs to be some soul-searching. England captain Chris Robshaw can't fail but hide his disappointment after defeat to South Africa . It was a similar story against world champions New Zealand with England similarly outclassed . England have had a very loud wake-up call. They are a long way behind New Zealand and South Africa and possibly Australia — and it’s worth remembering those three teams are at the end of their season and will be fresher in mind and body in 10 months when the World Cup comes around. England got away with two narrow defeats that could have been a lot worse. England have been criticised not just because they have been losing but for the way they are playing, especially behind the pack. The autumn series started with 20 minutes of fast, expansive rugby which pinned the All Blacks behind their 22-metre line and Jonny May produced one of the finest tries scored at Twickenham. Since then it has been stop-start, lacking clear attacking purpose and strategy. I have always advocated two playmakers at 10 and 12 and I’m excited that Lancaster has belatedly opted to use that combination  with George Ford playing alongside Owen Farrell. I really hope Farrell goes well because this two ball-players concept is a lesson England and their fans need to understand if they want to be the best team on the planet, which must always be the goal. Farrell is top quality and his presence at 12 should add a different dimension to England’s attacking play. Owen Farrell (left) and George Ford get the nod to face Samoa with the latter at fly half . Ford (left) and Farrell go back years and their experience of playing together should be fruitful for England . Ford needs to play flat to the gainline and commit Samoa’s aggressive defence in tandem with Farrell in the way the great Australian partnership of Mark and Gary Ella operated in the 1980s. Farrell has been an easy target this week but suggestions he gets preferential treatment because his father is on the coaching staff are so wrong. Farrell alone is not to blame for a misfiring backline. He will know he could have lost his place but this kid is tough, and I’d back him to embrace the change. Moving from 10 to 12 doesn’t let him off the hook. He must go for broke: at 12 he is Ford’s eyes and the linchpin of the backline. If he continues to play deep, Ford will be exposed. Together, they need to move the Samoan defence around by putting width on the ball and bringing May and Anthony Watson into the game. They need to split England’s attack and create space for others. Lancaster’s bold move should make England more creative. Great sides down the years always had playmakers at inside centre — Australia’s Matt Giteau is probably the best around. I would have selected Danny Cipriani at 10 alongside Farrell for his pace, range of passing and experience. Don’t get me wrong, Ford is an excellent prospect but I’m surprised Cipriani keeps getting overlooked. Exeter’s Henry Slade is another option at inside centre. A gifted playmaker with pace, he might get his chance before the World Cup. The enigmatic Danny Cipriani (right) has enjoyed brief flirtations with England but is yet to fulfil his potential . The mercurial Matt Giteau goes over for Australia against Wales in the 2007 World Cup . I fear we lack real speed at outside centre. Brad Barritt never lets the side down but by picking two ball-players at 10 and 12 you need out-and-out gas at 13 as well as at full back and on the wings. Without this speed at 13, our potency could be limited. I call it a back four and I’d have preferred to have seen Luther Burrell or Jonathan Joseph selected as both players would give the side more pace than Barritt. If England stick with this 10-12 combination, they need an outside centre with searing pace. Manu Tuilagi has pace, but not searing pace, and if he’s not available then England look short of options . England need to move on from the last two defeats. This is a positive-looking team and I’m eager to see what James Haskell will add to the back row. I liked what I heard from him this week when he spoke about no-one remembering how good England’s culture is if they keep losing. He’s right. I like the individuality and personality Haskell brings. England’s players should not be afraid to make mistakes. They should be free to express themselves and excite the crowd. They need to mix it up. Samoa’s biggest threat is their unpredictability. They gave us a real fright in the group stages in 2003. One thing is certain, England will face some great athletes with enormous physicality. Discipline could be their downfall and I wouldn’t be surprised to see a couple sinbinned. England survived a scare in Australia, stuttering into the quarter-finals with an unconvincing win over Samoa . Census Johnston (second right) looks on as Samoa prepare to face England at Twickenham . Their build-up will have been affected by all the talk of going on strike. I have some sympathy on that front. I was in charge in 2000 when Martin Johnson and the players threatened to boycott the game against Argentina. It was an awful experience but when the dust settled I was actually very proud of the leadership Johnno and the players showed under difficult circumstances. It takes courage to challenge the authorities and while Samoa will have been disrupted, they will now have an even clearer understanding of what it means to pull on a Samoan jersey. I can’t see how England can lose this game, so let’s hope Ford and Farrell unpick Samoa’s defence and we get the sort of rugby we all want to see.","England have been dealt some harsh lessons in the Autumn internationals .

"Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao may be moving closer to agreeing terms for a long-awaited bout.

Sternburg denied that terms had already been agreed for a May showdown in Las Vegas, but added: 'There is still a long way to go. 'At least the movement has been in a positive direction.'

"My morning walk along the Thames on Sunday took me past a moored boat with the owner reading his paper. ‘We will be right for the 2019 World Cup,’ he shouted up. His wry comment sums up the type of thinking that has permeated England’s fans, players and coaching staff. It shouldn’t be like this. Let’s hear no talk about 2019 in the next 10 months from anyone within the England camp. This team have lost five matches in a row and need to get back to winning ways, starting with Samoa on Saturday. A large chunk of this squad will not even make it through to 2019 and this endless talk of development, learning, number of caps and the future is disrespectful to them. It is also disrespectful to the fans who pay a lot of money to go to Twickenham. They want to see results, not a development exercise. VIDEO Stuart Lancaster reviewing England's performance against South Africa . England captain Chris Robshaw looked devastated after the final whistle as England were beaten again . England coach Stuart Lancaster must focus on the here and now and get back to winning ways . England have just 10 games to get it right before their opening World Cup 2015 fixture against Fiji on September 18. Autumn internationals . Nov 22 England v Samoa Twickenham . Nov 29 England v Australia Twickenham . Six Nations 2015 . Feb 6 Wales v England Cardiff . Feb 14 England v Italy Twickenham . Mar 1 Ireland v England Dublin . Mar 14 England v Scotland Twickenham . Mar 21 England v France Twickenham . World Cup warm-ups 2015 . Aug 15 England v France Twickenham . Aug 22 France v England Paris . Sept 5 England v Ireland Twickenham . Their one chance at World Cup glory is 2015, that is their Holy Grail and it should be everyone’s. The way you get there is by making every match from now a knockout game. England can absolutely win the 2015 World Cup, I know they can based on the talent they have available, but they have got to start being deadly serious and ruthless, and it starts with Samoa and not Australia. Some will say that four of the five defeats were to New Zealand but if anyone at Twickenham thinks like that, they are in the wrong place. I agree with Stuart Lancaster that now is not the time to panic but I totally disagree with suggestions that England might use the Samoa game to experiment and to give starts to some of the reserves and bench players in the squad. We do not have that luxury any more. Doing that encourages totally the wrong mindset. What England need to do is approach Saturday’s game like any other Test and pick their strongest team. They need to unequivocally decide what that XV is and produce a superlative performance against Samoa to instil confidence and momentum. This will give the team the maximum chance of facing Australia with the right mindset and finishing the autumn internationals on a high. South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England . That first-choice XV will definitely involve changes because the team defeated by South Africa was not right, especially behind the scrum. But if now is not the time for wholesale changes, it is crunch time. I would love to see Lancaster make a really bold decision to set the scene and get some excitement in the team, do something to show that England mean business and that the last two performances are not acceptable. Lancaster needs to make it clear that he is picking his best team because it then spells out to players who are not included that they have been dropped, not rested. This is not the time for niceties, it’s time players are told that they are not performing at their best and somebody else is now rated above them. No player can think his is an automatic selection. I only ever told Martin Johnson or Lawrence Dallaglio they were my captain for one game at a time because they had to earn their place. I had a decent contract with the RFU but I knew I could be sacked if I had three or four bad results. England's dominance in the first quarter against New Zealand still saw them come up short . A spell of pressure for New Zealand saw Richie McCaw gather the ball and score for the All Blacks . The moment players think they are part of a long-term strategy, they consider themselves young players who don’t have to win every game. That attitude seeps into you and it is wrong. They should instead remember the old adage: you’re only as good as your last game. I dropped Dallaglio for what would have been his 50th cap. We had beaten New Zealand but I left him out of the next match against Australia because I thought Lewis Moody was a better option. I had to do what was best for the team but he still talks about it now! With regards to this team, the half-backs need to change, with Danny Care and Owen Farrell replaced by Ben Youngs and George Ford. I would still pick Danny Cipriani but he is not even in the squad so clearly this will not happen. I would have liked to see Farrell at 12 but the chance has gone because he is out of form. So England must find a ball-player at 12. England went in at half time with the lead but ultimately lost out to an impressive New Zealand team . Dylan Hartley's indiscipline cost England on Saturday and he could make way at hooker . I have no idea what England’s thinking at centre is at the moment, what their pecking order is, but if they decide to bring in Luther Burrell it must be spelled out to whoever makes way that he has been dropped. Billy Vunipola will know he didn’t have the best game but we need some more pace in the back row to supplement the excellent work of the front five. James Haskell can bring that pace and would take to the field like a man possessed, knowing the jersey is up for grabs. Ben Morgan had a brilliant spell when he came on but can he play the full 80 minutes? If not, do not pick him. I was disappointed by Dylan Hartley’s lack of discipline with his yellow card on Saturday which marred some good line-out throwing this autumn. So if England decide to start with Rob Webber, it should be because they think he is the best man for the job, not because he needs a run-out. The same applies if Haskell comes into the back row. England lost 24-21 against New Zealand at a rain-soaked Twickenham after an impressive second half from the All Blacks on Saturday . Lancaster has got to be completely blinkered now in his approach to every game. Watching Australia coach Michael Cheika ahead of the France match was fascinating. He was so animated, standing in the middle of his players. But his job, like any international coach is very simple: coach and select the team and let nothing and nobody distract you. Just win the next game. It is a very straightforward job description. Instead, England seem to be complicating things. The visit of 400metres legend Michael Johnson to Pennyhill Park last week raised a few eyebrows. In a summer fitness camp or an early season, that’s OK and has value and there is no one better than Johnson, who is a brilliant individual. But right in the middle of one of the most important weeks of the season before a must-win game against a team you haven’t beaten in the last 11 attempts? No way. I would prefer to think the England camp is an aggressive, hostile, uncompromising environment right now with some tough meetings being held. George Ford should replace Owen Farrell at fly half because the latter is suffering for form . Farrell has struggled for form and should make way at fly half for the match against Samoa . When a squad is properly in the zone some pretty harsh words can be spoken in training in the week before these huge internationals and it can all kick off behind closed doors. That’s a good thing as all top teams need some sulphur in the air at times. It’s not very nice sometimes but that is what true high-performance environments are like. It’s what happens when big characters are all straining at the leash trying to make something great happen for England. But that is never going to occur when you have celebrities or VIPs to contend with. Every meeting and every session must be held in private. England are trying to tick boxes that don’t need ticking. There is a danger of trying to be friends with everybody. Too much attention is going into stuff that just doesn’t matter in terms of winning the match on Saturday. The only thing that matters is what happens on the pitch and that is how you will be judged. I’m hoping the disappointment of the last two games especially can galvanise this team into producing something special in the next two matches. Then, when I walk past my friend reading his paper on the boat next week, he might say: ‘Wow, did you see England play yesterday? That was fantastic.’ James Haskell (centre) would add dynamism to England's play and he would get around the park well . Rob Webber has impressed and may come into the team at the expense of Hartley .","England lost their fifth match in a row against South Africa on Saturday .

"When the big fights don’t happen the public lose faith. That is happening with Floyd Mayweather. He is the king of the ring and the king of making money. But fight week seems particularly flat and I’m hearing from my people in America that there is not the buzz or even much interest in his fight with Marcos Maidana. He should be fighting Manny Pacquiao. That fight is credible again after he beat Timothy Bradley and it is ridiculous that they are not facing each other. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail exclusive: Khan on Mayweather and Collazo . Money bags: Floyd Mayweather arrives at the MGM Grand ahead of his fight against Marcos Maidana . Superstar: Mayweather may be king of the ring but fans are losing interest in his one-sided bouts . What fans want: Viewing figures suggest Mayweather's next bout could draw fewer than 1million buys . Eye on the throne: Maidana will be the massive underdog against Mayweather on May 3 in Las Vegas . Impressive: Manny Pacquiao showed he still has the goods in his dominant win over Timothy Bradley . Drawcard: It's ridiculous that Pacquiao isn't fighting Mayweather as that is the fight the fans really want . This fight with Maidana has gone right under the radar. People know what to expect – a masterclass from Mayweather and an easy night. I might be wrong but that’s how I see it. Many are talking about projected pay-per-view numbers of less than one million, which for Mayweather is weak. It shows that people are losing interest. Mayweather will continue to make huge money, but the only fight people want to see Mayweather take is Pacquiao. I think people have got bored of not getting what they want and if you are continuously asking people to put their hand in their pocket, you have to give them what they want. Kell Brook’s long wait for a world title shot is nearly over. Shawn Porter’s knockout win over Paulie Malignaggi this month has meant that Porter must now defend his IBF title against Brook, the mandatory challenger, by July 19 or vacate the belt. Plenty has been going on behind the scenes with this one and I can tell you more here. I have already spoken to Richard . Schaefer this week, the CEO of Golden Boy Promotions, who look after . Porter, and I have told him that I want to bring this fight to the UK. All being well, my offer would be to stage the fight in Sheffield, . possibly on July 12. Time has come: Kell Brook will finally get his shot at a world title now Shawn Porter is obligated to defend . Return: Brook could take on Porter in Sheffield, where Kell took down Ukranian Vyacheslav Senchenko . Richard is happy to listen to offers but there is a long way to go. Ultimately, they would like the fight in America and we have no problem with that, but I think it makes more sense for it to be in the UK. There is more interest for it here because Porter doesn’t yet put bums on seats in America and that fight doesn’t carry main event pull with the network. I suspect Richard Schaefer and . Porter’s adviser, Al Haymon, are worried about this fight. Porter was . good against Malignaggi, but he can’t afford to be as reckless as he was . against someone with the power and accuracy as Kell Brook - he can be . utterly devastating, an incredible talent, and they know that. Will it . put them off taking the fight and vacating? Maybe. Golden . Boy will be thinking that they are taking on a guy who can beat their . kid and also that they will have no future options on him. Their . alternative is to vacate, but that’s a big step. Oscar de la Hoya recently tweeted . about Keith Thurman, but I’m not sure that a fight between him and . Porter makes sense for anyone just yet. My personal feeling is that the . fight with Brook will happen - Porter is a fighter so he won’t want to . vacate - and I hope by the end of this week to have an indication of the . details. Mandatory: Porter's (right) knock-out win over Paulie Malignaggi (left) means he must take on Brook for his IBF title . Next challenge: After Porter's fourth round TKO he must take on a challenger by July 19 or vacate . I would love nothing more than for Kell to get this fight. He has had so many moments when for one reason or another his title shot has been cancelled. This will be his big fight and he will finally get the world title he has deserved for so long. It will be a very tough fight and I’m very confident  he will win. People think Brook won’t want the fight – no chance. He is already hard in camp having spent the last few weeks up the mountain in Big Bear in California. Porter looked brilliant in his last fight, he has never been renowned as concussive puncher and many of his knockouts came against quite weak opposition early in his career. Malignaggi is obviously a top-level fighter, but how much did he have left in that fight? I also remember Porter drawing against Julio Diaz, who is quite poor to be honest. So yes, the Americans might want to make Kell an underdog. But that is a huge mistake. I have spoken to the McGuigans and we are hoping to meet next week to start discussions for an enormous fight between Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg. I've talked about how I think the lack of interest in Mayweather's forthcoming fight with Maidana proves that people have got bored and frustrated of waiting for that Pacquiao meeting, and we will not make that mistake with Frampton and Quigg, the WBA super-bantamweight world champion who I promote. Frampton’s camp have been calling me out on Twitter, saying talk is cheap. No time wasting: Carl Frampton (left) versus Scott Quigg (right) is a fight that shouldn't be delayed . Well, I am the one who really wants to move this thing on and I am the one who has made the offers. I want Quigg and Frampton to fight each other next. No more waiting around. I have made substantial offers in the past. And I am not asking for any future options on Frampton – I said that in my last column. Let’s just make the world title fight that everyone wants to see. I will have a rematch clause in place but that is no penalty. If Frampton can beat Quigg like he thinks he can, then let’s have a rematch in Belfast and it will be another huge payday for everyone. I don’t see the downside of a rematch clause. The champ: Quigg defended his WBA World Super Bantamweight title knocking out Tshifhiwa Munyai . Bring it on: Quigg's camp wants the next fight to be against Frampton, no more waiting around . Every time both guys fight, they look impressive. Whenever Frampton fights, everyone says, ‘Wow, he would beat Quigg’. When Quigg fights, everyone says, ‘Wow, he would beat Frampton’. These are two warriors at the top of their game. Let’s not have any of this rubbish we have seen with Mayweather and Pacquiao. Let’s get this fight on. We are talking to Golden Boy about Leo Santa Cruz and we are also talking to Kiko Martinez’s people. Those are two unification fights. But we want Frampton. And the public want it, too. Amir Khan is also fighting against Luis Collazo this weekend and I think there could be trouble. It’s likely that he has been promised internally that this will be a springboard to Mayweather, but I worry about Khan here. I always worry about him at elite level and this fight especially. Collazo is not the greatest in this . division, but he is long in the tooth, a southpaw, dangerous and active. Khan is not active – he has not fought in a year and has fought only . twice since summer 2012. I can’t see how you go into a fight like this . after such an absence. It’s a massive risk. Big time: Amir Khan working out at Virgil Hunter's Gym in California ahead of his Vegas bout with Luis Collazo . Risk: Collazo could be a stepping stone to Mayweather but is dangerous, as shown against Victor Ortiz . I have to mention Anthony Crolla. His win against John Murray for the WBO intercontinental lightweight title was brutal and brilliant. He took his time, soaked up some punishment off a very good fighter and stopped him late on. In my opinion, he deserves a world title shot and I will deliver it as well. I am now in talks with the . representatives of Richar Abril, the WBA world champion, and I expect to . make that fight this summer. That will be a huge night in Manchester. Punishment: Anthony Crolla lands a heavy left on John Murray in his impressive victory . Ready for his shot: Crolla fought smart and deserves a tilt at a world title, which he should get . Crolla is one of the nicest blokes you will meet in boxing, but he is also extremely determined and extremely talented. He lost in Prizefighter not so long ago and look at him now. The arrival of his son recently has sharpened his mind and I would say he is not only ready for a title shot but also to win the belt. Special credit to Joe Gallagher who despite criticism in the build up to that fight works tirelessly for his fighters and constructed the perfect game plans for Crolla and Quigg. It is a new era for Matchroom as we will be holding our first show at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on May 21. We have been looking for an excuse to go to the arena and now we have one in the talented featherweight Josh Warrington, who is fresh off an impressive win over Rendall Munroe. He will defend his commonwealth title against Martin Lindsay while Stephen Smith is in the fight of his life against WBC silver champion  Fernando Saucedo in an official WBC World title eliminator.

"It wasn't until I moved to Australia, where league and union enjoy a far friendlier allegiance than in the UK, that I realised just how special rugby league players can be. Playing for Manly, we used to train closely with our league equivalent, the Manly Sea Eagles, and play a pretty physical version of touch rugby in the park on Sundays. Their basic skill-set is remarkable and the format of the sport amplifies the need for either standout speed or raw power — both of which make for outstanding athletes. I’m always intrigued to see how league converts adapt to union and Sam Burgess has every opportunity to be a blockbuster hit for Bath and England. Rugby league players often bring a remarkable and original skill-set when they move across to union . Burgess should be played at inside centre for England, alongside Manu Tuilagi . He has just been named the world’s best player in the league code and appears to have a remarkable effect on all those he works with. There is no question that we have a phenomenal athlete and strong character entering English rugby. If England can build their offensive game around Burgess, he has the potential to deliver on the biggest stage — and turn his country’s attack on its head. The big question is, where do you play him? Most of the successful converts have either played on the wing or at full back. But Burgess does not have the pace to play in the back three. Nor do I see him being any better than our current crop of forwards — so he must be played at inside centre. He cannot be involved in the autumn internationals because of injury, but Stuart Lancaster must bring him into the squad at the earliest opportunity. The midfield is the biggest question mark over the England starting XV. Its outcome after the autumn internationals and Six Nations will have a huge impact on the World Cup. Stuart Lancaster cannot afford to leave Burgess out of his squad for the World Cup . Burgess has earned his stripes playing rugby league and shouldn't have to prove himself all over again . Burgess must be encouraged to play his natural game, rather than try to mould himself overnight into a ‘textbook 12’. He will learn union in time, but it’s important it comes on top of what he already has. This is where Jason Robinson was so successful with England and Australia’s Israel Folau entered the sport in similar fashion. They backed their skill-set and continued doing what they did best in league, effectively forcing opponents to adapt to them — not the other way round. England already have a physical midfield. They have been playing big guys like Brad Barritt, Billy Twelvetrees and Manu Tuilagi; but no one comes bigger or more ferocious than Burgess. He’s not going to turn out like Mike Catt or Will Greenwood — both natural playmakers who relied on vision more than physicality — but he has the ability to draw in three or four players at a time. Burgess playing alongside Tuilagi would be interesting to watch! Burgess moved to Bath after helping the Rabbitohs win their first NRL title in 43 years . Jason Robinson proved a huge success after making the switch from league to union . South Africa or New Zealand won’t be afraid of his size, but they will be afraid of his passing and off-loading. Many underestimate just how good league players’ basic skills are. If England can work out a way of exploiting that then they could be on to something very special. England have some solid options at 12, but none of them make you go ‘wow’. That’s where Burgess is different. If Lancaster can slot him into that spot alongside a fly-half brave enough to stand flat, and with the footwork and touch to find him some clean air, then that 10-12 combination would ask a lot of any defence. Burgess could be used to release the entire back line; this was the most significant effect of Sonny Bill Williams for the All Blacks. Most players only get the chance to play in one World Cup and my concern is that he is held back until 2019. That would lead to a lot of ‘what ifs’ and ‘if onlys’ if England go on to lose in the semi-final or the final next year. You have to throw everything at next year’s World Cup. This guy could be what England are missing. I admire the culture Lancaster has created in the England camp, where you have to earn your stripes. But Burgess has earned his call-up with what he has already achieved in league. Would the other players want him there? Absolutely. When Robinson arrived he lifted the whole camp; he turned a very good team into a really scary team. You get no second chances at the World Cup.","Sam Burgess has made the switch from rugby league to union .

"There has been much talk in recent months of certain ‘faces that don’t fit’ in the England set-up; talented match-winners who don’t conform to the coaches’ template. Well, two of those faces, according to popular perception, will be at the national team’s training camp next week and possibly beyond. Maybe, just maybe, they can prove to the management that they fit the bill after all and are worthy of a role at the World Cup. Wednesday’s announcement of a training squad to prepare for the Six Nations opener against Wales is a diluted version of what was supposed to be unveiled. As recently as 10 days ago, Stuart Lancaster had been intending to name an elite group of 32 or so players for the entire campaign, but a sudden flurry of injuries have forced an abrupt change. Sale Sharks fly half Danny Cipriani (centre) looks to take on the Clermont defence at the AJ Bell Stadium . Cipriani impressed during his brief cameos for England against the All Blacks in the 2014 summer tour . Danny Cipriani is having a fantastic season at Sale — the fly-half is in the Aviva Premiership’s top five for total points scored and conversions scored. POINTS SCORED . 1- G Steenson (Exeter): 172 . 2- A Goode (Wasps): 144 . 3 - S Myler (Northampton): 127 . 4 - G Ford (Bath): 136 . 5 D - Cipriani (Sale): 112 . 5 C - Hodgson (Saracens): 112 . CONVERSIONS SCORED . 1 - S Myler (Northampton): 29 . 1 - G Ford (Bath): 29 . 3 - G Steenson (Exeter): 28 . 4 - A Goode (Wasps): 26 . 5 - D Cipriani (Sale): 21 . Instead, this will be a short-term selection, a quick fix in difficult circumstances. The coaches have had to hurriedly revise their outlook having lost Ben Morgan and Joe Launchbury for the whole championship, and Manu Tuilagi and Courtney Lawes for at least part of it. But while the RFU were at pains to clarify that the squad revealed on Wednesday would apply only to the Wales game on February 6, it is laden with significance. It represents the telling moment when Lancaster and Co have embraced pragmatism and buried preconceptions. The proof is provided by the inclusion of two men — Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter. The latter was presumed to have been consigned to history as a Test player. The Harlequins No 8 was jettisoned by Lancaster when he took over in the aftermath of the calamitous 2011 World Cup campaign overseen by Martin Johnson. Easter was indelibly linked to that grim period, having reportedly quipped ‘that’s £35,000 down the toilet’ when England lost their quarter-final against France in Auckland. At the age of 36, his return is a stunning development which suggests a willingness among the management to revise their views about certain players. Easter has been in consistently outstanding form for several years and believes he is at the peak of his powers. His tour de force in Quins’ victory over Leicester earlier this month led to a swelling call for England to reconsider him. Harlequins No 8 Nick Easter (left) chips a grubber kick past Wasps fly half Andy Goode last Satuday . Easter's last appearance in an England shirt was the 2011 World Cup quarter-final defeat to France . Nick Easter is in excellent form this season, and though he hasn’t played for England since 2011, Stuart Lancaster could use the 36-year-old’s experience. England matches: 47 . Points: 25 . Tries: 5 . Won: 26 . Lost: 20 . Draw: 1 . Win %: 55 . Last appearance: October 8, 2011 v France . The opening has been created by the unfortunate loss of Morgan for a minimum of six months with a broken leg. That started a search for specialist No 8 cover for Billy Vunipola and Easter has been preferred to Exeter’s Thomas Waldrom, fellow Chief Dave Ewers and others such as Northampton’s Sam Dickinson and Newcastle’s Mark Wilson. His selection will disprove the notion that Lancaster is fixed on youth, rather than paying heed to the clear evidence of weekly performances. Easter has clawed his way back into favour through the force of his exploits for Quins and because of his evident desperation to represent his country again. ‘There is massive unfinished business for me as far as England is concerned,’ he said last week. ‘My hunger to play for England is as strong as ever, probably stronger. I believe I am a much better player than when I was last capped.’ As for Cipriani, his prospects of a recall had appeared less remote, but his selection is significant nonetheless. The 27-year-old fly-half has been regularly superb for Sale but was overlooked for the autumn Tests despite having performed with distinction whenever the opportunity arose in New Zealand last June. Bath fly half George Ford (left) is set to start for England against Wales with Owen Farrell on the bench . England will welcome back a host of players for the Six Nations including Tom Youngs (left) and Mako Vunipola . That trip marked his breakthrough after a long international exile, but his recent struggle for recognition opened up the prospect of a summer move to Toulon. Now, however, as he finds himself in the mix to push for a World Cup place, Cipriani is seemingly destined to sign a new deal at Sale. He is likely to play for the Saxons against Ireland Wolfhounds in Cork next Friday before making a big push in training to install himself as third-choice No 10 behind George Ford and Owen Farrell and ahead of Stephen Myler of Northampton. Elsewhere, the most notable feature of the squad announced on Wednesday will be the return of several players missing from the November campaign — Alex Corbisiero, Tom Youngs, Mako Vunipola and Geoff Parling. Jonathan Joseph’s hot streak for Bath means he is retained in the squad with more chance of claiming a midfield berth than he had two months ago, while club-mate Kyle Eastmond will also be a starting contender. Exeter’s Jack Nowell is set to return at the expense of Marland Yarde. The squad is supposedly for one match only, but the home encounter with Italy is only eight days after the Cardiff collision, so those who excel there will have every chance of keeping their places.","Danny Cipriani has been rewarded for his superb form with Sale Sharks .

"Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter have been thrown World Cup lifelines after receiving surprise call-ups for Stuart Lancaster's England training squad ahead of next month's Six Nations tournament. The Sale fly-half and veteran Harlequins No 8 were not set to be included this weekend, but a change of thinking following a selection meeting on Monday has seen them named in a 34-man squad which will train together before the opening clash with Wales on February 6. Cipriani, 27, in outstanding form this season, is one of four fly-halves in the squad - which does not contain injured stars Manu Tuilagi (groin), Courtney Lawes (ankle), Joe Launchbury (neck) and Ben Morgan (ankle) - with George Ford, Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler also named. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Stuart Lancaster confirms Danny Cipriani and Nick Easter are in . England head coach Stuart Lancaster named his 34-man squad at Twickenham on Wednesday morning . Coaches Graham Rowntree, Lancaster and Andy Farrell (left to right) speak to the press . Following a good run of form Sale Sharks, Danny Cipriani was selected for Lancaster's training squad . Cipriani impressed during his brief cameos for England against the All Blacks in the 2014 summer tour . Forwards: D Attwood (Bath), C Clark (Northampton), D Cole (Leicester), A Corbisiero (Northampton), N Easter (Harlequins), D Hartley (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), G Kitchener (Leicester), G Kruis (Saracens), J Marler (Harlequins), G Parling (Leicester), C Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), B Vunipola, M Vunipola (both Saracens), D Wilson (Bath), T Wood (Northampton), T Youngs (Leicester) Backs: B Barritt (Saracens), M Brown (Harlequins), L Burrell (Northampton), D Care (Harlequins), D Cipriani (Sale), K Eastmond (Bath), O Farrell (Saracens), G Ford (Bath), A Goode (Saracens), J Joseph (Bath), J May (Gloucester,), S Myler (Northampton), J Nowell (Exeter), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester), A Watson (Bath), R Wigglesworth (Saracens), B Youngs (Leicester) The mercurial No 10 is still thought to be fourth in England's pecking order but his inclusion in the squad provides a huge boost after he'd resigned himself to being omitted. Easter, who will be 37 by the time the World Cup begins in September, has not played for England since the 2011 World Cup, but has also been rewarded for his excellent club form. 'Danny hasn't been far away at all since the New Zealand tour and he was in camp in August,' said Lancaster. 'He's improved his game and worked hard and we want to create an opportunity for him to come in and put a marker down alongside Stephen Myler. 'With Ben Morgan's injury we need two specialist No 8s and Nick has been outstanding this season. 'We base a lot of our decisions on training and we have a very competitive squad. We have a two-week period to prepare and we will use that time wisely.' Nick Easter's last appearance in an England shirt was the 2011 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France . Harlequins No 8 Easter (left) chips a grubber kick past Wasps fly half Andy Goode last Satuday . Forwards . K Brookes (Newcastle Falcons), T Croft (Leicester Tigers), C Day (Northampton Saints), L Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), D Ewers (Exeter Chiefs), M Garvey (Bath Rugby), R Harrison (Sale Sharks), M Itoje (Saracens), M Kvesic (Gloucester Rugby), M Mullan (Wasps), H Thomas (Bath Rugby), T Waldrom (Exeter Chiefs), A Waller (Northampton Saints), R Webber (Bath Rugby) Backs . C Ashton (Saracens), S Burgess (Bath Rugby), E Daly (Wasps), O Devoto (Bath Rugby), L Dickson (Northampton Saints, captain), C Pennell (Worcester Warriors), J Simpson (Wasps), H Slade (Exeter Chiefs), M Yarde (Harlequins), C Wade (Wasps) Commenting on his inclusion in the England Six Nations Squad, Danny Cipriani said, ' I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to join up with the squad next week and look forward to training with them and developing my game. 'It's a great chance for me to prove myself and hopefully get a chance to represent my country again. I would like to thank everyone at Sale Sharks for helping me make this happen.' Leicester's uncapped lock Graham Kitchener is included – in place of the injured Lawes - in a squad which also contains six returning British Lions – Alex Corbisero, Dan Cole, Geoff Parling, Tom Youngs and Mako Vunipola. Chris Robshaw will captain the side through the Six Nations despite concerns over a shoulder injury. 'Looking at both squads it's obvious there is a lot of depth and competition in every position, which is what we want. Many players are putting their hand up in the Aviva Premiership and Europe and they have a chance to impress in training as we build towards the games against Wales and the Wolfhounds. 'It's great to welcome back some of those players unavailable for the QBE Internationals in the autumn. They offer us a lot of quality and experience. So too Nick Easter, who has played well for Harlequins and, with the injury to Ben Morgan, both he and Tom Waldrom in the Saxons will provide us with specialist No 8 options alongside Billy Vunipola. That's something we feel we need going into the tournament. Bath fly half George Ford (left) is set to start for England against Wales with Owen Farrell on the bench . 'We have plenty of players to consider and with some players still being assessed from last weekend after suffering knocks we have kept our options open. 'It's a big European weekend ahead and there may be further changes once we assess the fitness of the players after round six and we will provide an update on Monday.' Rugby-league convert Sam Burgess is named in the Saxons squad to face the Irish Wolfhounds in Cork on January. 'We're really pleased with his progress,' said attack coach Andy Farrell. 'There will be a lot of ups and downs and it's a steep learning curve but for him to be involved with the Saxons is great for him.' England will welcome back a host of players for the Six Nations including Tom Youngs (left) and Mako Vunipola .","Danny Cipriani has been recalled for his superb form with Sale Sharks .

"CLICK HERE to read Sam Peters' full match report from Twickenham . I am a glass half-full person and 11 months out from the final stages of the World Cup there was a lot to like in that England performance. They will be disappointed not to have won, they had given themselves every chance at half time but ultimately the reality check of playing such a canny New Zealand side will pay dividends. New Zealand were not that impressive in the first half but responded, as you always knew they would, and played the conditions much better in the second half. In the end they outscored England three tries to one and that is a statistic we need to note yet again, because they didn’t actually create that many opportunities. Being New Zealand, though, they took them — their third try was clincal and particularly well executed. England lost 24-21 against New Zealand after an impressive second half from the All Blacks at Twickenham . VIDEO England 21-24 New Zealand highlights . New Zealand celebrate as they exposed England's weakness' on a rain soaked afternoon . England need to start taking the chances they make and start scoring three or four tries on a regular basis against the best sides. That is the ratio you need to win big matches these days. But let’s concentrate on the positives first. Over five months on from their last game, England could and maybe should have beaten the world champions, who are battle-hardened and in the groove after their Rugby Championship campaign and a warm-up match against USA last week. New Zealand have played eight Test matches since England last took the field in anger and that was a big factor. England’s pack were immense in all respects. The front five — minus Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes when he went off injured — dominated the line-out and scrum and that is so important, going forward. In the pack England can compete against any team in the world and they have the strength in depth to ensure such power up-front every time they take the field. That is a great position to be in. England's pack dominated the scrum and can compete against any rugby side in the world . Despite the defeat, England captain Chris Robshaw was immense and deserved to win man of the match . Chris Robshaw was outstanding for England for the whole 80 minutes and although it seems mandatory to give the man-of-the-match award to somebody from the winning team, I would have opted for the England skipper and not Richie McCaw. He outplayed the New Zealand skipper, not for the first time, in the first half and kept going strongly after the break when England found the going much tougher and McCaw, like all great players, raised his game. Robshaw is the first name on the England teamsheet for me but I still maintain he might be better suited to playing at six — not least because he is England’s best attacking forward, the most comfortable on the ball and with the best hands. At six, when you are not arriving at the contact area first all the time, you often get more opportunity to make go-forward yards as Jerome Kaino does for New Zealand. I am on record as saying my ideal back row at present would be Robshaw at blindside, Steffon Armitage at seven and James Haskell at eight but clearly that isn’t going to happen with the RFU decison to make Armitage ineligible. Now is probably not the time for change, anyway. Kyle Eastmond (L) did better than expected, despite being mismatched against Sonny Bill Williams . Jonny May scores a sensational solo try for England after only three minutes to send the crowd wild . The pack did very well and should be retained en bloc against a South Africa side that showed in the recent Rugby Championship they are possibly not the scrummaging force they once were, although their line-out is still top drawer. Next week will be brutal up front but this England pack are tough enough for the challenge. In the backs Kyle Eastmond had a fine first half at centre. I will admit to being concerned that perhaps he wouldn’t be able to match up physically with Sonny Bill Williams but he did well and the apparent mismatch in size wasn’t an issue. That cracking pass of his — left to right — should certainly have resulted in a try for Mike Brown during England’s purple patch in the first half. That would have been a peach of a score and would have helped build momentum for England. So far so good, but now let’s consider the things England need to work on. In the second half, with the weather closing in, against the wind and with New Zealand turning up the pressure, England got bogged down in their own half and suffered from not having a second or third kicking option to clear their lines. They simply could not get out of their own half. Brown, with his big left boot, did not seem to be offering himself and it was at this stage that Eastmond’s lack of a kicking game came to light. Ideally, I always prefer a ten and 12 who have a kicking and passing game and that third quarter — and indeed the rest of the game — emphasised that. Mike Brown's kicking struggled to clear the ball when England were put under pressure by New Zealand . New Zealand's Israel Dragg won possession and launched counter attacks all too frequently . Danny Care’s box kick was seen as an alternative but it was relied on too heavily and became predictable for Israel Dagg and Julian Savea. Too often they were grateful recipients of the ball and used the possession to launch another New Zealand attack. The big games comes at you thick and fast during these Autumn internationals and you have to embrace that. Stuart Lancaster and his management team — Graham Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt — earned a massive vote of confidence from the RFU recently with those six-year contracts through to 2020. It is in phases of the season like the next three weeks where they must all really earn their corn. Next up come South Africa — a side who beat New Zealand not so very long ago. That England coaching team need to really analyse exactly what went on at Twickenham and learn from it. My gut feeling is that continuity of selection is what is needed now and certainly my experience from my years in charge in these Autumn campaigns is not to overreact. England coach Stuart Lancaster (R) must start to earn his long contract in the next Test against South Africa . Prince Harry was pictured watching the  match between England and New Zealand on Saturday . Saturday saw a pretty good all-round performance and nobody produced an individual display which warrants dropping them. What I do think though is that with the power England showed in the tight, they should perhaps concentrate on playing a tighter game — a bit more like Saracens, if you like. If you are not going to pick a 12 who possesses world-class kicking options you probably need to play to your strength up front more. A busy week lies ahead but I remain optimistic.","England were beaten 24-21 by New Zealand in autumn Test at Twickenham .
England's pack was huge and Chris Robshaw deserved man-of-the-match .

"England showed yet again that they are competitive but they are still not unleashing the full potential of this group. Our traditional strengths are all there and in many ways we fronted up really well. The front five, the scrums, the lineout are going well. It’s outside that we have problems — we are not playing enough real footballers in the backs to take on Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, which has to be the goal. Stuart Lancaster's side have a host of problems with the backs lacking an X-factor to take on big teams . England captain Chris Robshaw shows his disappointment after their defeat by South Africa . The England team are not a development team. We can’t go on talking about our young inexperienced players at this level. It’s totally irrelevant, it’s a decision that England are making and they must not be putting caveats in place. Have we got players who can go head to head with the world’s best? Yes, absolutely. But in the back division we are not currently playing in a way that will consistently pose these big teams problems. We are either not picking the right players or not picking the right combination of players in the positions where they can cause the most damage. England's big men are helpless as Pat Lambie kicks a field goal late on to clinch victory for the Springboks . More experienced players - different options - are available all across the team: Danny Cipriani, Steffon Armitage and James Haskell, to name just three. There are a whole bunch of more experienced players out there. We keep getting close on the scoreboard but in the cold light of day there is still a gap. The England coaches have got to be more clear on how they see England playing the game. What to do now against Samoa? There is talk of changes but what I would do is pick the ‘Gun’ XV that England want to start against Australia, which has now become an absolutely must-win game. That might well involve a few changes but England should not make switches of personnel just for the sake of it. This is actually not the time to experiment or rest players by some pre-planned strategy. Now is the time to pick the team you expect to beat Australia. Stuart Lancaster should make those changes because he has a vision of the team he wants to run out against the Wallabies in two weeks’ time. Danny Cipriani, behind Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly half in the pecking order, has attacking flair . Toulon's Steffon Armitage and Wasps' James Haskell are among a host of experienced players available . If they pick the core of this team again I would tighten things up, kick for the corners more, turn teams with kicks and try to pin the opposition in their 22 for huge chunks of the game. Ruthlessly use the strength of the pack and their ability to control a game. Personally I would always go for a more attacking option because against the very best I have always felt you need that but there is not a right or a wrong selection, there is just the selection that works. At this level there is only one thing on which you are judged: did you win or not? But England have got to start being very clear in what they are looking for. Centre Brad Barritt crosses for a late try for England after they moved the ball wide . Danny Care had a tough day at the office in his 50th Test match . It was care's pass that gifted Jan Serfontein the only try of the first half . I am increasingly impressed with Joe Marler and David Wilson in the England front row and on this occasion I’m opting for Marler, who is developing very quickly indeed at loose head in the absence of the injured Alex Corbisiero. England’s scrum has been reassuringly rock solid so far this autumn against New Zealand and South Africa and that is a great base for a team to work off. England prop Joe Marler (left) impressed alongside David Wilson with the scrum rock solid . England have also done well in the line-outs - they lost just one I can remember on Saturday - so Marler is clearly supporting his jumpers well there. His all-round contribution has been excellent and what I particularly like about the Marler we are seeing this season is that he seems to have reined in what used to be a short fuse and his entire focus is going into the game. MY CHAMPAGNE MOMENT . There's only one real contender and that is Cobus Reinach’s wonderful try more or less straight after the second half began, which put the Boks in the box seat. The skill of Pat Lambie’s chip ahead off the outside of his right foot was exquisite while Willie le Roux is such a consummate player that you always fancied him to catch it on the full and make ground. And then it got even better. He waited and waited to draw the England defence, then released Reinach at exactly the right moment for a score that would grace any highlights reel. It was a breathtaking moment that demonstrated what South Africa can do and why they are the No2 team in the world. Referee Steve Walsh rightly sends Hartley to the bin . Steve Walsh had a mixed game when it came to the big calls, in my opinion. He got the yellow card absolutely right with Dylan Hartley after reviewing the big screen. Those sorts of yellow cards really annoy a coach - it was unnecessary. England were winning the ball anyway, routine ruck possession, but when you ruck these days the movement of the foot has to be backwards, not down. But Walsh and his team got the call against Bryan Habana soon after badly wrong when he clearly fielded the ball with one foot in touch. It should have been a lineout back in England’s half, Boks throwing in. Instead it was an attacking lineout for England in South Africa’s half and it led directly to England’s first try. It was a big momentum changer and I have no idea why Walsh did not ask for TMO adjudication on that one.","England lost  28-31 to South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday .

"If the Steffon Armitage deal to Bath does go through, I would applaud the RFU and Stuart Lancaster for any part they may have had in making this happen. It sends out a strong message that, in this World Cup season, England will not compromise. There will be no ‘what-ifs’ or excuses. England will do everything they can to win the World Cup. If you do that, and ultimately there is disappointment because it doesn’t quite work out, there can be no regrets. Everybody needs to be available and the coaches must select from maximum strength. Steffon Armitage will be allowed to represent England at the World Cup if he seals a move to Bath . England coach Stuart Lancaster refuses to pick overseas-based players because of RFU policy . Click here to read the latest on Steffon Armitage's proposed move to Bath . As this story has unfolded I found it totally unacceptable that potentially we could have been facing a situation in which Armitage was not only unavailable for England selection but could even line up against them for France in a big World Cup game! The truth is Armitage may not get picked as an England starter — he is going to find it very tough — but a player of his quality has to be in the squad pushing hard for selection, challenging all the others. The dynamic in a squad when you have two or three class players pushing for every spot is brilliant, everybody has to step up and find a new level. It also means that coaches and those selecting the team have to really sharpen their pencils and be ruthless. The England back row is very competitive, make no mistake, and is packed with a number of versatile players, not least the skipper Chris Robshaw. He can play right across the back row while Armitage can play openside or No 8, which is where Toulon often field him. All sorts of options could come into play. Armitage played in the Premiership for London Irish before upping sticks and moving to France with Toulon . The flanker, pictured here at Twickenham in 2013, wants to return to play for England at international level . Armitage is expected to play in Europe this weekend, meaning he will not move to Bath . Having made the effort to get Armitage back home I see no point in hanging around and insisting on some sort of probation period. This is not the time for niceties. If the deal goes through by the weekend, I would put him straight into the senior squad which is announced next Wednesday and make sure he gets a certain amount of game time this autumn. Equally, if Sam Burgess had been available I would have thrown him straight into the action this autumn. Although that can’t happen now I would get him involved with the squad as soon as he is permitted to travel back home after his surgery. I can only see one downside to Armitage’s return and it is more a matter of long-term principle than a short-term problem. There is absolutely no doubt that he has improved massively since he was last capped by England in 2010 when he was with playing with London Irish. He was a raw talent then, a more than useful player, but he didn’t look like a genuine England back-rower to me. We should never forget that playing for Toulon has been the making of Armitage. They have found a way of getting him fitter, developing his game and integrating him into the team, so much so that he became the European Cup player of the season. That is one of the reasons I remain convinced that the ‘free market’ should still be allowed. I see no reason why a player looking to better himself shouldn’t ply his trade an hour away in France and still be eligible for England. There will also be a certain amount of dislocation if and when Armitage returns, and that’s probably not ideal. But to make such a move shows that his motivation to contest for a World Cup spot must be very high.","The Toulon flanker has been linked with a move to Bath .

"My initial impression is that this 33-man squad errs slightly on the defensive, cautious side. It is nonetheless full of high-quality players who are well capable of enjoying a big November. England need to win at least three, ideally four, of their games against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia next month, with Australia the most important by far as we face them in the World Cup. As much as we heap praise on the Southern Hemisphere nations, already this England side will be nobody’s opposition of choice in a World Cup match. Teams would much rather face Ireland, Wales or France. Chris Robshaw is the right man to captain England but might be better used on the other side of the scrum . England will be aiming to win the Hilary Shield (left) and the Cook Cup vs New Zealand and Australia . Bath wing Semesa Rokoduguni has earned his England selection after scoring six tries in seven matches . Wasps captain James Haskell would be best deployed at No 8, rather than at flanker . Team A is the side I’d pick to play New Zealand from Stuart Lancaster’s squad. Team B is my line-up — excluding injuries – if I had picked the squad. Team C assumes everyone is fit.

Mike Brown, Semesa Rokoduguni, Luther Burrell, Owen Farrell, Marland Yarde, George Ford, Danny Care, Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley, David Wilson, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Chris Robshaw (captain), James Haskell . Team B: Exciting . Mike Brown, Semesa Rokoduguni, Luther Burrell, Owen Farrell, CHRISTIAN WADE, DANNY CIPRIANI, Danny Care, Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley, David Wilson, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, CHRIS ROBSHAW (c), STEFFON ARMITAGE, James Haskell .

With 12 Tests to go before England’s opening World Cup game against Fiji, there is still huge scope for fine-tuning in the camp. As I wrote earlier this week, a coach needs to wake up feeling excited and confident about the team he is putting out for a big match. Using that as my guide, I have selected three England XVs to demonstrate how I feel the team could and should develop in the next year or so. A successful autumn will send our Springbok, Kiwi and Wallaby friends home with a lot to think about, and leave us entering World Cup year with momentum. Momentum is everything in World Cup year. Team A (in the first green box, above) is the England team I would pick to play New Zealand on November 8 from the squad Stuart Lancaster named on Wednesday. Team B is the England side I would pick and includes three players not in the 33-man squad. I consider Steffon Armitage available! Team C takes into account those currently on the injured list and assumes they are fully fit. If I was an opposition coach, Team C would keep me awake at night. You could coach Team C to play an irresistible style of attacking rugby. Christian Wade should have been selected to add some magic on the wing for England . Steffon Armitage should also be included in spite of the fact he plays his club rugby in France . Danny Cipriani should be selected at No 10 with Owen Farrell playing outside him in the centres . November 8 vs New Zealand . November 15 v South Africa . November 22 v Samoa . November 29 v Australia . Team A features most of the best we saw in New Zealand with the addition of Semesa Rokoduguni, who is stepping up to the plate at Bath. I’d have George Ford at fly-half for his attacking skills while the pack is already a mighty unit. I would want both Chris Robshaw and James Haskell in my team so Haskell would play No 8. In Team B, I’d make four changes, three in personnel and one positional – all designed to up the attacking threat. I’d make a straight swap at fly-half and bring in Danny Cipriani for Ford. Attack is the big strength of both players and there is no question we needed to see Cipriani start against one of the big teams, to observe him under pressure but also to give him the chance to play behind that very strong go-forward England pack. I would also bring in that magician of a wing Christian Wade for the match-winning moments of brilliance he can conjure from nowhere. Don’t deny yourself his firepower because of any perceived defensive weakness. In the pack I would tinker with the back row. I want to see Armitage at openside in a match that matters but I love what captain Robshaw brings to the team, so I would ask him to play blindside. Finally Team C is my team that would give us the absolute best chance of winning the World Cup on home soil. I’d bring in a fit and injury-free Manu Tuilagi at outside centre, keeping the all-round skills and world-class goal-kicking of Farrell at 12. The passing, running and left foot/right foot kicking options of Cipriani and Farrell would give England the attacking options you need at the very highest level. In the pack, if fully fit, Alex Corbisiero and Dan Cole are as good as any props in the world and would complete a truly formidable England line-up. England will kick off their series against the All Blacks, who are captained by flanker Richie McCaw . Lancaster's side also face World Cup pool rivals Australia, who often turn to Israel Folau for inspiration . South Africa will also travel to Twickenham, with lock Eben Etzebeth hoping to make his presence felt .","Stuart Lancaster has made a conservative selection for the Test series .

"Cristiano Ronaldo has taken a dig at Atletico Madrid - labelling them as 'defensive' following Real Madrid's 4-2 aggregate loss to their rivals in the quarter-final of the Copa del Rey. The 29-year-old picked up his third Ballon d'Or on Monday but then saw his side eliminated from the cup by their Madrid rivals during the week. Fernando Torres netted twice during the 2-2 second-leg draw - with Ronaldo himself getting on the scoresheet - as the cup holders were knocked out at the last-eight stage. Cristiano Ronaldo points to the ground and smile during Real Madrid training on Saturday . Fernando Torres celebrates opening the scoring for Atletico Madrid after just 49 seconds against Real . But Ronaldo told AS: 'Atleti don’t play attractive football. They are very defensive. They wait for dead-balls, but it works well for them. Their coach and players should be respected. ... 'Atleti are a consistent team who have spent a long time together. Valencia are getting better and are a rival to watch out for. 'And then there are Madrid and Barcelona who are candidates for everything. This is good for La Liga.' Ronaldo and his team-mate trained at Valdebebas on Saturday and looked in good spirits. Manager Carlo Ancelotti says his side will not be lapse in defence when they look to preserve top spot in La Liga on Sunday. Ronaldo (right) walks past some hurdles at Valdebebas during Real training on Saturday . Torres (left) is congratulated by team-mates after scoring in the first minute against Real Madrid . Los Blancos head to mid-table Getafe in Sunday's morning kick-off on the back of losing their Copa del Rey crown. Real have found the going tough since the winter break and have seen their lead at the top of La Liga reduced to a point, but Ancelotti is confident they will be up to speed this weekend. 'We would be concerned if we did not have chances to score, but (against Atletico) we produced attractive play with quality, tempo and intensity,' the Italian told his club's official website. 'I'm not concerned about that, we scored two goals. The concern comes from the mistakes we made at the back in bringing the ball out, which I don't think we will make again.' Real goalkeeper Iker Casillas jumps and touches his boots during the session at Valdebebas . Carlo Ancelotti, Real's manager, looks across the training field as his players take part in a session . And rather than dwell too much on the loss, Ancelotti is looking to take lessons from it in order to help Real's chances for the rest of the season. 'You have to assess the match; we were made to pay a heavy price for our mistakes,' he said. 'But for the first 60 minutes we played very well. You can't play better. We now have three weeks to prepare for the Champions League and this is good for the team.' Defeat was a bitter pill to swallow for Ronaldo. The division's 26-goal leading scorer is of the same mindset as his coach, though. Real Madrid players warm up during a training session at Valdebebas on Saturday . Toni Kroos (left), Javier Hernandez (centre) and Alvaro Arbeloa (right) enjoy a joke during training . 'I apologise on behalf of the team, perhaps we could have done things better,' he said. 'However, we can also say that we have La Liga, the Champions League and lots of other things to win this year. 'Obviously it's never good to lose, however you have to think positively. The team will play at a higher level later in the season. We aim to win La Liga and the Champions League.' In Getafe Real will meet an opponent woefully out of form in the league but flying high in the Copa del Rey. Their last La Liga success came back on October 31 - a 2-1 win at Deportivo - but since then they have been winless in nine, with their three victories coming in the cup. A 1-0 success over Almeria on Wednesday booked them their place in a quarter-final with Villarreal.

"Stuart Lancaster selects his squad for the autumn internationals on Wednesday, a huge moment which will set the tone for next year’s World Cup. It’s his most important squad selection yet. Will he announce a squad geared to attack or stay true to his mantra and favour a more conservative approach? Selection is an art, not a science. As head coach it is the No 1 skill you require. You stand and fall by it. Selection reflects the coach’s mindset both to his own team and to the opposition. Do not underestimate how closely Lancaster’s opposite numbers will look at this announcement. Watching Australia v New Zealand at the weekend, you see that they’re so committed to running the ball and making their passes, even from deep. I believe attacking, high-speed rugby has its place more than ever. I really hope England go for it this autumn, put an emphasis on attack and produce a team sheet that inspires the nation and asks questions of the opposition. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lancaster: England will be ready for Rugby World Cup . England are looking to bounce back from their defeats to New Zealand over the summer . One of my litmus tests for selection was to imagine waking up on match day. Are you going to be really excited about your England team? Can you get 82,000 people on their feet going nuts? It must be based on playing at a pace as no team can live with that. It must be a team geared to scoring tries. This is not easy, but you only get one chance to be in the hot seat. Attack. Looking over my time with England there are selections I’m really proud of — the tough calls I got right. But there’s others I got wrong, and those ones still wind me up today. Here are the principles that guided my selections. 1 CAN THEY SHINE ON THE WORLD STAGE? Test match and World Cup rugby is way above European or Premiership rugby yet when naming squads you are often judging current form at club level. This takes real skill, and often it comes down to backing your gut, especially when introducing a player to the international scene if more obvious candidates exist. It’s tempting to pick players from winning teams but this can be too simplistic. There can be some absolute gems playing in losing teams. Dan Luger’s raw speed and execution in the final third stood out for me and he once started for England the week after he’d been dropped to the Harlequins second XV. Worcester’s Chris Pennell will be fascinating here. England have spotted something exceptional — will they continue to back Pennell now he is playing Championship rugby? Danny Cipriani was brilliant against Munster at the weekend even though Sale lost. Chris Pennell is now playing Championship rugby - will England still back him? 2 FOCUS ON ATTACK . You can always work hard to bring your defence up to scratch whereas if you pick strong defensive players first it’s not so easy to transform them into an attacking threat. For years people told me I had the balance wrong in my preferred England back row — Richard Hill, Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio. They said I was effectively playing three openside flankers. But I didn’t care. They were our three best ball-in-hand attacking options in the back row and they developed into an awesome defensive unit as well. To attack you must pick two real ball players at 10 and 12. I would love to see Cipriani play with Owen Farrell, that would be my choice if England really want to attack. Danny Cipriani could form an exciting partnership with Owen Farrell if England decide to attack . Giving debuts to Will Green, Will Greenwood, Andy Long, Matt Perry and David Rees in my first match in charge against Australia . Jason Robinson's debut at full back vs Australia in 2001, after talk that he was not up to the job. Bringing in Mike Catt for Mike Tindall for the World Cup semi-final against France in 2003. Dropping Lawrence Dallaglio for Lewis Moody vs Australia in 2002. 3 REACT TO MISTAKES . In elite sport you have few chances to make mistakes. I got some selections wrong. I wished I’d played a second fly-half at inside centre in Paris in 2002 to take the pressure off Jonny Wilkinson. I didn’t and Wilkinson could barely breathe that day with Serge Betsen all over him. In the following year’s Six Nations Charlie Hodgson started alongside Wilkinson at 12 and in the 2003 World Cup semi-final Mike Catt took Mike Tindall’s place. 4 KEEP GAME PLAN IN MIND . When playing two good kickers at 10 and 12, as I often did, it made sense to have wings like Ben Cohen, Luger and Josh Lewsey who were great in the air so they could get on the end of crossfield kicks. Good kicking out of hand is attacking rugby. England have a lot of talent at 10, but they don’t have any 12s who can kick. If Cipriani and Farrell played 10 and 12, you could have a back three of Mike Brown, Semesa Rokoduguni and Marland Yarde. Marland Yarde (shown here scoring a try for Harlequins against Castres) could be vital in the back three . Mike Brown (left) and Semesa Rokoduguni can also form part of England's back three this autumn . 5 USE WORLD-CLASS KICKERS . Playing with relentless pace will force the opposition into giving away penalties so you will always need what a world-class goal-kicker provides: touchline conversions, penalties under pressure and drop goals. You need back-up in this area. Could we have won the 2003 World Cup without Jonny? I would like to think so. Because we had Paul Grayson in the squad who, while not Jonny’s equal in goal-kicking, was certainly next in line. Farrell is a world-class goal-kicker, but who is the 85 per cent kicker if he is injured? England do not appear to have a back-up kicking option in the same class as Owen Farrell . Stuart Lancaster must make the big calls . 6 SOLID TIGHT FORWARDS . Your front five must be proven ball winners. You must have 100 per cent scrum possession on your ball and a minimum of 85 per cent on your own line-out throw. And you must be rock solid at restarts. New Zealand showed this at the weekend; their re-start play is phenomenal. Forwards who can guarantee you that get priority over others who might possess a more eye-catching all-round game. 7 THE COACH MUST DECIDE . The buck stops with the head coach. Of course you should canvass the opinion of your senior coaches but this has to be your squad, your moment in time. It will be the coach’s head on the line if it goes wrong. 8 NO COMPROMISE . Nothing should stop you fielding the team you want. I was very excited to see the wheels in motion for Steffon Armitage to move into the Premiership and make himself available for England selection. He should be eligible for selection regardless of where he plays. I applaud the RFU and Bath in bringing Sam Burgess into Union and I’d love to see Sam Tomkins change codes as well. In 2000 I decided to do everything I could to get Jason Robinson and Henry Paul. One of those punts came off spectacularly. 9 FIND YOUR GUN XV . Select your starting First XV, your ‘Gun’ XV and make sure everybody knows it. If the overall culture, spirit and ethos is good it will be win-win in terms of generating internal competition. Those with the shirt will be aware they are the players to be toppled; the ‘reserves’ will be hungry for selection. 10 WARRIOR TEST . Regardless of who and where we were playing, the ‘warrior test’ was a key criteria for me when it came to selecting my starting line-up. Could this player handle facing New Zealand in Auckland or South Africa in Johannesburg? They must be able to think correctly under pressure.

"Jermain Defoe admits he will be judged on his goals return after signing for Sunderland in time to make his debut at former club Spurs on Saturday. The 32-year-old has penned a three-and-a-half-year deal at the Stadium of Light having been convinced to head to the north-east by former Tottenham coach Gus Poyet, who he played under at White Hart Lane. Sunderland are the Premier League’s second-lowest scorers with just 18, and there is pressure on Defoe to hit the ground running given their struggles in front of goal. Jermain Defoe has been officially unveiled as a Sunderland player after agreeing terms on Wearside . Defoe will want to continue his record of scoring a goal on debut for each of his Premier League clubs . The striker has signed on a three-year deal from Toronto with Jozy Altidore moving in the other direction . ‘As a forward, you get judged on scoring goals,’ said the ex-England striker. ‘When you have set high standards of scoring goals over your career, people expect goals. Hopefully I can play as many games as I can and get the chances, and I believe if I get the chances I will score goals.’ Defoe, who has quit the MLS after one season with Toronto FC, added: ‘I’m happy to be here. I’m delighted. I’m just looking forward to the challenge. I remember a few years back, at some stage, I thought something was going to happen. ‘It’s a great club and I’ve always enjoyed coming up here and playing against Sunderland because of the stadium and the fans. It’s a great place to play football. I’m looking forward to it.’ He went on: ‘It was good over in Toronto, I enjoyed it. But for me, the Premier League is the best league in the world and when you step away from it, you realise how good it is. To be honest, I just missed it. I wanted to come back and be back in the Premier League scoring goals.’ As part of Defoe's deal  Jozy Altidore - who failed to score a goal this season - will move in the opposite direction. Poyet said: 'I am thrilled that Jermain is a Sunderland player. I know all about his attributes and his qualities first-hand and his exceptional goal-scoring record speaks for itself. He has something different, something special. 'We know each other very well - he was very young when we played together and I was coming to the end of my career, so I know him from inside the pitch. 'When I returned to Spurs as a coach, it was a great experience for me to work with him, so I am really looking forward to having him as my player now and for him to be part of our team. 'I would also like to thank Jozy as his begins his career at his new club. It is a fresh start for him and we wish him well.' Defoe said he is delighted to be at Sunderland and added he is looking forward to the challenge . Defoe said that he always enjoyed coming up to the Stadium of Light on opposing teams . The 32-year-old is keen to make an impression on the Sunderland supporters . Black Cats manager Gus Poyet said he was thrilled to have signed the former Tottenham striker . Defoe could play against his former side Spurs this weekend should Sunderland get international clearance . The Black Cats managed to beat off competition from a series of Barclays Premier League rivals, including Crystal Palace and QPR, to acquire Defoe's services, and sporting director Lee Congerton was thrilled to see his hard work finally come to fruition. Congerton said: 'Jermain is a player who has proven his quality in the Premier League. Naturally, with a player of his calibre, there was a lot of interest in him, not only in England but across Europe, so we are delighted that he has chosen to come to Sunderland.' Altidore, who joined the club from AZ Alkmaar during the summer of 2013, managed just three goals in 52 appearances in all competitions, and only one in 42 in the league.","Jermain Defoe could play against former club Tottenham this weekend .

"Alan Pardew has admitted he failed to convince Jermain Defoe to sign for Crystal Palace over Sunderland. Defoe is on the brink of rubber-stamping his move to Wearside from Toronto, with Pardew conceding Palace were forced out of the race for the former England striker. Palace have secured Arsenal forward Yaya Sanogo on loan with new Eagles boss Pardew aiming to sign another striker during the January transfer window. Jermain Defoe is on the verge of completing a move back to the Premier League to Sunderland . Defoe (left) signed for Toronto in MLS in January last year, but is set to return to England . The former Newcastle manager grudgingly admitted Defoe's goal scoring prowess could ease Sunderland out of the Barclays Premier League relegation battle. 'I think it's a good move for Sunderland to have secured Jermain, I think he's a goal scorer and Gus (Poyet) will be the first to tell you they need more goals,' said Pardew. 'So it's a good signing for them. 'We tried to get Defoe, but probably a bit late in the loop on that one. I wouldn't say we were that close, no. 'It never really got to the stage where I got to speak to Jermain, so I would say we were not that close.' Alan Pardew admitted he wanted to take Defoe to Crystal Palace but failed with a late attempt . Palace signed Yaya Sanogo from Arsenal on loan but Pardew is keen to add another striker in January . Pardew managed Defoe at West Ham before the prolific striker moved to Tottenham. The 32-year-old failed to warm to life in Toronto after leaving Spurs for MLS a year ago. Pardew was forced to admit the 55-cap forward could boost Sunderland's firepower, with the Black Cats one of Palace's main rivals in the battle to avoid the drop. The Eagles' new manager, however, warned that Defoe must first prove he is capable of playing week on week to fulfil his Sunderland brief. 'He's still got to step in, I don't know the last time Jermain had a run of three or four Premier League games,' said Pardew. Defoe scored 11 MLS goals for Toronto but is set to sign a three-and-a-half year deal at Sunderland . Defoe could face former club Tottenham on his debut on Saturday if he signs for Sunderland on Friday . 'He'll be asked to start every week at Sunderland, so I think he's going to have to grasp it quickly. 'But he's a goal scorer, he opens up the goal with both feet and gets goals that (make) you question your back four, he makes you think ""how did he get that?"" 'But that's his ability, you don't really know which side he's going to go, and he makes it difficult to stop him scoring goals. 'I think he'll do well for them, I think it's a good signing. 'But it's like anything, he'll need a goal early, all strikers need that for his confidence.'","Jermain Defoe is close to finalising a permanent move to Sunderland .

"Jermain Defoe should have been happy. He had just scored a match-winning double on his debut for Toronto FC. The MLS franchise had been so fixated on signing him that basketball star LeBron James and rapper Drake were employed as part of the charm offensive. But even then, on that March afternoon last year in Seattle, it was evident that all was not well with Defoe, at least to those who were in the post-match locker-room at Century Link Field.

Feb 2008 Portsmouth 1-1 Chelsea PL . Mar 2014 Seattle Sounders 1-2 Toronto MLS . Can Defoe continue his scoring spree when he takes on former club Tottenham on Saturday? Within 10 minutes of full-time, nearly 50 reporters had invaded the changing quarters, all demanding his time and attention. Defoe’s face, it is said, told its own story. ‘He had a look of, “What the hell is going on here?”,’ a source close to the club told Sportsmail. ‘Even then we thought he wasn’t happy and had not settled. But looking back, that game was the highlight of his time here and probably of the franchise’s history.’ Defoe had been sold a vision of Toronto by Tim Leiweke, the president of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE) — the company which owns the football team and the man who became so obsessed with bringing the England international to Canada that a deal which would ultimately cost $50million was sanctioned. Rapper Drake and NBA star LeBron James were tasked with wooing Defoe's mum, Sandra . Defoe poses with his mum  at his 23rd birthday in London back in 2005 . James was asked by Leiweke, when the NBA star was playing in Toronto, to woo Defoe’s mum Sandra as she attended a basketball game as a courtside guest of the club in November 2013. Drake, meanwhile, sent flowers to her hotel — the Ritz, no less — and later telephoned Defoe. It worked. In January, Defoe was unveiled as the poster-boy for the franchise. MLSE made sure his face was on every prominent billboard across town. What they failed to mention was that Toronto FC are the fourth, possibly fifth, most significant sports team in the city. ‘We don’t think he was prepared for that,’ added the source. ‘He was sold this idea that he was going to be like a rock star. But I don’t think he realised how small the club is. ‘In a city of nearly three-million people, there is a cult-like group of about 40,000 who care about Toronto FC and about 20,000 go to matches. The majority are ice-hockey fans. We think Jermain was brutally homesick from the start. After a few months he was pushing for a move back to England. In the end it was inevitable and everyone is relieved it’s finally all over.’ Defoe was the star attraction for Toronto following his big-money move to Canada . Defoe was unveiled alongside US international Michael Bradley in January 2014 . Although the relationship was on rocky ground from the start, he did score 11 times in the first 16 games of the campaign. But amid that scoring streak came his omission from Roy Hodgson’s England World Cup squad. Defoe was convinced he would be in Brazil and it is thought that snub marked the beginning of the end of his time in the MLS. He scored his last goal for Toronto in a 1-1 draw at home to Vancouver Whitecaps on July 16 before injuries — some disputed by the club and supporters — saw him miss 12 of the final 18 matches. He was hurt when his commitment was questioned. ‘There are a few fans who have said certain things and I’m like, “Well, that’s a bit harsh”,’ he said in October. Defoe received stick from some supporters, who questioned some of his injury problems . ‘If you want someone to stay at a football club, at least support them. At least show them that you want them to be here.’ Two months earlier, head coach Ryan Nelsen — Defoe’s former Spurs team-mate — had been sacked. Defoe’s own exit plan was in place and he came close to a move back to the Premier League in the summer. He eventually returned to the UK in November and has spent time training at St George’s Park and in France, as well as with Spurs’ development squad. The 32-year-old never had any intention of returning to the MLS and will today be confirmed as a Sunderland player, with American striker Jozy Altidore set to go in the other direction. Gus Poyet has given Defoe a way out from his sorry spell with Toronto . The North East, meanwhile, is also home to John Carver, the former Toronto FC boss now in caretaker charge of Newcastle. And he is surprised that Defoe quit after just one season. ‘I can’t believe he hasn’t settled in Toronto because it is a fantastic party city. I loved it,’ he said. ‘I know he did extremely well on the pitch but I also know he had a problem settling. But he could have been the big star of the MLS. If he had stayed fit, he might have got Toronto into the play-offs. Sunderland have got a good deal.’ Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew agrees. ‘We tried to get Defoe,’ he revealed. ‘But we were probably a bit late in the loop. He’ll do well for Sunderland. He’s a goalscorer.’ Now he’s at the Stadium of Light — earning a handsome £80,000 a week and under the care of friend Gus Poyet — perhaps Defoe will finally find happiness, as well as the back of the net.","Jermain Defoe's sorry spell in Canada has ended after just 12 months .

"Mikel Arteta will still sign a new 12-month contract with Arsenal despite being ruled out for a further three months following an ankle operation. The Spaniard’s injury blow came as it was confirmed that first-choice right back Mathieu Debuchy will also miss three months after shoulder surgery. Arteta has not played since the Champions League clash against Borussia Dortmund on November 26, when he sustained a calf injury. Now the Gunners have confirmed their captain has had a bony spur in his left ankle removed. Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta has been ruled out for three months after surgery on his ankle . Arteta was substituted in the victory over Borussia Dortmund in November and has not featured since . Arsene Wenger said: ‘Mikel has had surgery, which went well, and he is back with us at the training ground. He had limited mobility in his ankle and some persistent inflammation that had an impact on his calf. That meant surgery to give him the best chance to recover.’ Arteta, whose contract expires at the end of the season, agreed an extension before the injury and his lay-off will not affect his pending new deal. But his extended spell on the sidelines will reinforce Wenger’s determination to sign a new defensive midfielder this month. Likewise, Debuchy’s injury means Arsenal will intensify their efforts to land a new defender. The France international dislocated his right shoulder in a collision with Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic on Sunday and surgery was required to ensure the joint is not prone to further injury. Mathieu Debuchy dislocated his shoulder after colliding with Stoke's Marko Arnautovic in the 3-0 victory . Wenger said: ‘It’s very unfortunate for Mathieu, it’s unbelievable because he’s had two surgeries in the same season. He just came back, he played seven games and he’s out again. I count three months out for Mathieu because contact will be a problem for the shoulder.’ Kieran Gibbs could be available for Sunday’s clash against Manchester City after recovering from a heel injury. Danny Welbeck is still out with a thigh problem but has returned to light training. Meanwhile, Nigeria appear to have won the battle to land Arsenal’s highly-rated striker Alex Iwobi. The 18-year-old, who captains Arsenal’s Under 21 side, has represented England at U16, U17 and U18 level but has accepted an offer to join the Nigeria squad this week. He said: ‘I would have loved to play for England but Austin (Jay Jay) Okocha and Nwankwo Kanu have influenced my decision to play for Nigeria.’","Mikel Arteta had surgery on ankle and faces three months of rehabilitation .

"Manchester City must decide who will make way for Wilfried Bony in their Champions League squad by February 3 — three weeks before they meet Barcelona in the first knockout round. Bony’s arrival from Swansea has raised the number of ‘foreign’ players in City’s first team to 17, which is one more than the Premier League champions are allowed this season as punishment for breaching UEFA’s Financial Fair Play regulations. VIDEO Scroll down for Wilfried Bony: I joined Manchester City to become a champion . Wilfried Bony should solve a striker shortage at City, but his arrival has created another problem . Willy Caballero is one of the first-team squad whose European place is under threat since the Ivorian's arrival . Stevan Jovetic is another who could be excluded from City's Champions League squad . The problem will be solved if City can be persuaded to sell Stevan Jovetic, but if not manager Manuel Pellegrini faces a tough decision. Goalkeeper Willy Caballero and full backs Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolarov are the other players understood to be most under threat. Pellegrini said: ‘We must see which of the players will not be in the squad for Champions League because we don’t have space.’ And Bacary Sagna (right) could also see his chances in Europe's Premier League competition limited .

"They are two of the hottest properties in the Premier League, the South American hotshots who will surely decide Sunday’s big showdown between Manchester City and Arsenal. But which of Alexis Sanchez and Sergio Aguero is the better player? Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp sat down for an appreciation, some arguing and a very difficult decision... So, what is it that makes them so dangerous? MARTIN KEOWN: They are fantastic all-round footballers but it’s their ability to run at players and terrorise defenders that makes them so good. They love to fly forward and are able to change direction in an instant — it’s that speed of thought and technique that strikes fear into opponents. They can absolutely embarrass players with their pace but almost always produce something special at the end of it. JAMIE REDKNAPP: There are similarities in their game but I think they’re quite different in terms of their movement. Sanchez is perpetual motion and does not stop running whereas Aguero is much more economical. He is a predator. He will run, stop a defender, then go again. He waits for his moment and, bang, he’s in. Sanchez is different — he chases lost causes all over the pitch. It’s a cliche to say he covers every blade of grass but with Sanchez, it’s nearly true. Sergio Aguero combines agility, speed, a low centre of gravity and an eye for goal in an explosive package . Alexis Sanchez's never-say-die attitude and his constant running are one of the Chilean's many attributes . Both Sanchez and Aguero are vital to their respective sides - but who will emerge victorious on Sunday? Who would you rather have playing for you? REDKNAPP: Great question and one I really have to think about. I like to show Sanchez to my kids and encourage them to play that way — the desire he shows is incredible. He always wants to make things happen and I love that. But, if you’re talking about both players at the height of their game, I think Aguero would just pip it for me. There is hardly anything in it, and that’s testament to how well Sanchez has done because I’m a huge Aguero fan. And Aguero’s finishing would give my team the edge — he is more decisive. KEOWN: I’d tend to agree. Aguero is up there with the best strikers we have ever seen in the Premier League. Since arriving in this country three-and-a-half years ago, he has performed at a consistently high level, at least when he’s not had injury problems. Sanchez has made a sensational start but it’s still early days for him. Many players take time to adjust to England, but Sanchez has already netted 18 times in all competitions . Aguero has a knack of scoring vital goals, as his stunning hat-trick against Bayern Munich showed . Who would you rather play against? REDKNAPP: Neither of them! They would both be so difficult to mark but in different ways. In a way it might be slightly easier with Aguero because you know where he’s going to operate — in the six-yard box or within the width of the penalty area. Martin was as quick as anybody but I’m sure he wouldn’t have fancied chasing after Sanchez! KEOWN: Definitely not! Even though Aguero is the better striker, I would have backed myself to deal with him in my heyday. I wouldn’t have to change my set-up against Aguero but Sanchez roams all over and does everything at incredible speed. You can’t run alongside somebody like that so the only way to deal with them is to take more gambles and get there early. As soon as he takes a touch, you have to be right there. It was the same with Thierry Henry. In training I would sometimes be overly physical to try and stop him because if he won the ball in the first few strides he was away. It’s the same with Sanchez. Sanchez does everything at full pelt and would be a nightmare to mark, says Keown . Aguero is a poacher who operates largely inside the box, but Keown backed himself to deal with the striker . What are there strongest assets? KEOWN: They are both blessed with a hunger to win matches, but it is more obvious with Sanchez. The fans love him because they see him chasing every ball and out-jumping players much bigger than he is. He works harder than anyone else and the harder you hit him, the more he tries. With Aguero, he is so good at sensing defenders around him. That lets him lay the ball off, hold it up or turn and drive on. His close control is exceptional and he teases defenders, drawing them in before whipping the ball away. REDKNAPP: I agree. It’s that sharpness that sets Aguero apart. He is so explosive off the mark and I love watching him hold off defenders in the area. For Sanchez, he spent most of his time at Barcelona playing second- or third-fiddle, but now he is adored at Arsenal. That’s because of the way he puts opponents under pressure. Lots of foreign stars join the Premier League and wait for the ball to come to them. Sanchez goes out and gets it. Aguero coolly beats Robert Green to display his acumen and awareness inside the penalty area . Sanchez sidefoots home against Burnley to show why he is one of the Premier League's hottest properties . Do these two have any weaknesses? REDKNAPP: With Aguero, the only weakness is his injury record. That has to be a worry for him and Manuel Pellegrini and I can sympathise. With Sanchez, it’s hard to find a weakness and that’s why he’s idolised at Arsenal. KEOWN: Sanchez is a fine all-round player but he does have a slight tendency to overrun things. At the start of his Arsenal career he would almost play too quickly and not release the ball at the right time to his team-mates. Now he has ironed that out he is becoming hard to stop. Who's more valuable to their team? REDKNAPP: Aguero because his goals could win City the league. I’ve said before it will be a shootout between him and Diego Costa and I’m not changing my mind. Sanchez is important for Arsenal but Aguero can decide the destiny of the title. KEOWN: I think Sanchez. People said City would crumble without Aguero but they actually narrowed the gap on Chelsea when he was injured. They demonstrated they can cope without him but if Sanchez was out I think Arsenal would start to wave goodbye to a Champions League place. So, who's the better player? KEOWN’S VERDICT: Sanchez has always been used out wide but is now taking on the scoring responsibilities of the modern winger — think Ronaldo or Bale. He could be key as Arsenal try to become title contenders. But, as it stands, Aguero’s longevity and scoring record gives him the edge. REDKNAPP'S VERDICT: It’s such a close call. At their peak I would have to say Aguero but if Sanchez keeps going at this rate we might have a different verdict in the future. Sanchez is currently unattached, after his recent split from Spanish art director and designer Laia Grassi (left). Aguero's girlfriend is Karina Tejeda, a 28-year-old Argentine pop star (right) Rob Draper: Sanchez . This is almost impossible! In terms of ability, finishing and technique it’s hard to split them. But I’ll go for Sanchez — he’s injured less often and for the energy he gives. When you see your star player working that hard, you follow the example. Neil Ashton: Aguero . His hat-trick against Bayern Munich in the Champions League was special. He also kept his cool with the last chance of the game against QPR to win the title for Manchester City in 2012. Sanchez has been brilliant but Aguero is ruthless. Chris Wheeler: Sanchez . ON current form, it would have to be Sanchez — not least because he can stay fit. Aguero is the better finisher but he misses a large portion of games with injuries. Sanchez has set the Premier League alight and offers his ability to play across the front. Laurie Whitwell: Aguero . Close call but the City striker edges it due to his frightening ability to score whatever the circumstances. No matter how tight an angle or implausible a path to goal, he finds a way. Sanchez has been shut out on a few occasions when Aguero would have netted. Sami Mokbel: Sanchez . It's close, because they are two brilliant footballers. But the Arsenal star is more of an all-rounder. Aguero’s game is about scoring goals — but Sanchez has been doing that and more since his arrived in the Premier League this summer. So Sanchez — but only just. Sam Cunningham: Aguero . When Aguero is fit and firing he is virtually unstoppable. At the start of the season before his injury in December, he was beginning to be talked about in the same breath as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Sanchez is a phenomenal player, but he is a level below Aguero at 100 per cent. Craig Hope: Sanchez . Aguero is the better player, yes, but Sanchez does it every week — he’s never injured and has contributed to more than half of Arsenal’s goals by scoring or setting them up. You never know when Aguero is next set for a spell on the sidelines. PS: Sanchez earned £30.3m last year — his Barcelona and Arsenal earnings supplemented by various business ventures in his homeland, Chile, including property holdings, stock investments, Fat Sanchez Burger restaurant chain, the Tocopilla Angels football team and Pure Wondersanchez vodka. In 2011, Aguero signed the most lucrative sponsorship deal in English football with Puma — worth £5m. He also has an endorsement deal with Pepsi.","The South Americans have taken the Premier League by storm this season .
Both players scored in the 2-2 draw at the Emirates in September and it is likely that they will have much to say when at the Etihad on Sunday .
Aguero is a lethal striker, who can run at people and is deadly in the box .
Sanchez hit the ground running, scoring 12 times in the Premier League .
But is the quickfire Argentine or the energetic Chilean the better player?
Redknapp and Keown sat down to debate and decide..."
"The day England striker Daniel Sturridge gave Graham Kitchener the runaround at football made the Leicester Tigers lock realise he should stick to rugby. Towards the end of his three years at the Wolverhampton Wanderers Academy, Kitchener was given a tough time by Sturridge in a junior game against Coventry. Kitchener was 14 at the time and the experience helped him to decide that he should turn his attention to the oval ball. Leicester’s Graham Kitchener charges forward against Harlequins earlier this month . Kitchener is pushing for a Six Nations call-up after an impressive start to the season . Graham Kitchener, Rugby club: Leicester, Football club: Wolves, Football position: centre half . Jordan Crane – Leicester – Leeds United - goalkeeper . Danny Cipriani – Sale – QPR – left back . Mark Cueto – Sale – Crewe Alexandra – left wing . Marland Yarde – Harlequins – QPR – centre midfield . Danny Care –Harlequins – Sheffield Wednesday - striker . Alex Goode – Saracens – Ipswich – centre midfield . David Strettle – Saracens – Manchester City – right wing . Dom Barrow - Newcastle - Manchester United – centre half . The decision paid off and the 6ft 6in and 19st forward is currently knocking on the door for a Six Nations call-up. However, there was a time when he seemed more likely to pursue a career as a centre half, rather than a second-row. ‘I flirted with football for a couple of years,’ said Kitchener. ‘At Wolves, we went on tour and played against teams like Arsenal and Manchester United. ‘I played against Sturridge when I was 14. I was marking him — or trying to! As you’d expect, he wasn’t a bad player and was a pretty big unit back in the day. 'He gave a few of us the runaround, but at the time you didn’t really appreciate what he would go on to achieve.’ Sturridge now earns around £150,000 a week, while salaries in rugby are a relative drop in the ocean. But Kitchener recognised the slim chances involved with pursuing football’s mega-bucks and instead completed his A-levels and signed for Worcester Warriors. Daniel Sturridge gave Kitchener the runaround during an academy game between Wolves and Coventry . Out of his academy age-group at Wolves, only Elliott Bennett went on to play in the Premier League as most failed to make the cut in an extremely competitive market. But doors to the senior ranks opened quickly when Kitchener turned his focus to rugby. ‘I realised I was a bit more suited to the rugby environment with my size and that kind of thing,’ said Kitchener. ‘There were a few transferable skills — we focused a lot on agility and speed over a short distance, which always helps. Kitchener has no regrets turning his back on football to pursue a career in rugby . ‘We would train about three times a week at Wolves — it was tough, but not a lot of people made it so I didn’t see a massive future in the game.’ Kitchener is not the only ex-footballer to make the switch. As with a hard-hitting forward, natural size and strength is a valuable asset for a goalkeeper or defender. Jordan Crane and Joe Launchbury are both former keepers who went on to play in the pack, while Dom Barrow and Kitchener were centre halves who joined rugby’s heavies in the tight-five. Physicality is not such an important asset in the back-line and some of England Rugby’s most skilful playmakers have backgrounds as wing backs, midfielders and strikers. Saracens full back Alex Goode is one of the most intelligent readers of the game — previously he conducted play as a central midfielder for Ipswich Town. Harlequins star Danny Care used to play as a strike for Sheffield Wednesday before switching to rugby . Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care is known for his ability to snipe around the fringes of the breakdown and he used to run lines through the defence as a nippy striker for Sheffield Wednesday. Similarly, Danny Cipriani, Marland Yarde, David Strettle and Mark Cueto all played further up the field in football before becoming astute backs in rugby. At Welford Road, Kitchener is often seen breaking clear of defenders, in a way you would not expect from a man of his size. His footwork and quick change of balance helps keep defenders guessing and his form has earned him a consistent run in Leicester’s starting XV. Director of rugby Richard Cockerill has rotated his squad for tonight’s Champions Cup tie against Scarlets, with Kitchener on the bench alongside England hooker Tom Youngs and Wales hopeful Owen Williams. Kitchener is aiming high and has targeted a first cap for England . But Kitchener has international ambitions. After playing for the Saxons and being called up as injury cover for the November Tests, he is now hoping to go one better and win his first cap. ‘I loved being involved in the autumn and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t thinking about it,’ said Kitchener. ‘The reality is there are a lot of quality second-rows around England at the moment, so I just have to see how it goes.’","Graham Kitchener played against footballer Daniel Sturridge at youth level .

"The New Year is not yet a week old but already Rory McIlroy's love life is the subject of golf gossips across the globe. The Open and US PGA Champion has been romantically linked with several glamourous girls since his split with Caroline Wozniacki last May, but this time there's a twist. Remember when McIlroy nearly scuppered the Ryder Cup Miracle at Medinah before it had even started by oversleeping? Well, he is now reported to be dating the PGA employee who came to his rescue before police rushed him to the course that morning in September 2012. Talk about a fairytale romance. Golf's world No 1 Rory McIlroy has a new girlfriend, Erica Stoll (right), according to reports in Ireland . Stoll came to McIlroy's rescue at the 2012 Ryder Cup when he nearly missed his Sunday tee time . The Northern Irishman overslept and was rushed to the course by police at Medinah just in time . The girl in question is Erica Stoll, a stunning 27-year-old blonde, who is manager of Championship Volunteer Operations at the PGA of America. The new couple have apparently been dating for around three months and, according to several Irish newspapers, saw in the New Year together at a luxury hotel in the 13th-century Ashford Castle in Co. Mayo. McIlroy shared a picture on Instagram that night of a champagne bottle with two glasses resting on napkins bearing the hotel's logo. Just 12 months previously, Wozniacki had been showing off a shiny engagement ring after McIlroy had popped the question on New Year's Eve. He also had only two majors to his name and the world was wondering why his form on the course was so bad. How times change. Since then the 25-year-old world No 1 has had rumoured romances with Irish model Nadia Forde, who went on to appear in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, receptionist Sasha Gale, South African model Shashi Naidoo and now Stoll. McIlroy shared this picture on New Year's Eve of a champagne bottle and two glasses at a luxury hotel .

Since the break-up McIlroy has been romantically linked with Nadia Forde (left) and Sasha Gale (right) Shashi Naidoo (third left) joined McIlroy's family at the Ryder Cup last September to spark more rumours . Mclroy is back to work in preparation for his return to the course at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship in the Emirate on January 15. His major aim this year will be to complete a career Grand Slam by winning the Masters in April. Should the Ulsterman claim the green jacket at Augusta National he would then have a shot at becoming the first golfer since Tiger Woods in 2001 to hold all the major titles at once when he competes in the US Open at Chambers Bay in June. But it appears McIlroy could have found a birdie he cherishes even more than those he earns on the course in the form of his Ryder Cup heroine.","Rory McIlroy has reportedly started romance with Erica Stoll .

"Nine days on from his Open Championship success and Rory McIlroy says he has already moved on. ‘Rather than reflect on it and enjoy it, I want to use it as a springboard,’ he said. ‘Yes, it’s going to be great to be introduced as the Open champion but that’s not all I want to be this year.

VIDEO Sunday - Final Round Highlights . ‘I’ve won three majors but never a World Golf Championship event, so that’s a goal,’ he said. ‘I can also become world No 1 again if I win, and that’s definitely on my list.’ Naturally, it’s not all work. There’s still been time for back-slapping and story swapping with his peers on the practice ground. ‘Keegan Bradley was telling me when he won the USPGA he took the Wanamaker Trophy to this bar and became a bit nervous when everyone started drinking out of it,’ said McIlroy. ‘I couldn’t have done that. I took the Claret Jug to this bar in Belfast on the Monday with my mates and I must admit I did find myself watching where it was going. I didn’t want it going beyond the people I trust.’ McIlroy spent the rest of the week working on his fitness in London and fulfilling some sponsorship obligations before returning with the jug to his home in Florida last Friday. ‘I’ve taken a photo of it on top of the television, on top of the toilet, silly things like that and sending the pictures to my friends,’ he said, smiling. ‘It’s just nice to have it in my possession.’ Old friends: The three-time Major winner consoles his friend Rickie Fowler after the final round of The Open . Picturesque: McIlroy looked comfortable throughout his four rounds on his way to victory . After winning his first major, the US Open, in 2011 McIlroy admitted he could happily have taken the rest of the year off. ‘It was such a relief after what had happened at the Masters (he lost a four-shot lead heading into the final round),’ he said. ‘Winning the USPGA the following year definitely felt different. The London Olympics were on, there were a lot of great sports stories around, and I felt like I do now, that I wanted to get out there and win some more. ‘Going home after winning The Open, though, I certainly feel like my fame has gone up a notch. We’ve got social media now and so your whole life is out there. But it won’t deflect me from my main objectives.’ Reach for the sky: After his US Open win in 2011, McIlroy admitted feeling like taking a year off from golf . Asked if it was possible to live a normal life and still be so intent on winning majors, McIlroy responded: ‘I never grew up wanting to live a normal life. I wanted to win majors. But I still think you can sort of do both. I can still do relatively normal things, and it’s not going to be difficult for me to stay hungry.’ Only once in his life did McIlroy lose his appetite for the game. He explained, laughing: ‘I was 16, I’d just won the Mullingar Scratch Cup and I was driving home with my dad and said to him: “I don’t think I like this anymore.” ‘Three days later, I said to him: “I like it again now.” I guess I was just a grumpy teenager going through some hormonal issues.’ Advisory role: McIlroy thinks Bernhard Langer should stay as Europe's assistant captain for the Ryder Cup . McIlroy was asked about the possibility of Bernhard Langer playing in September’s Ryder Cup at the age of 57 and, typically, didn’t duck the question. ‘I think the dynamic in the team room is just great right now,’ he said. ‘He’d be a great assistant captain but I don’t think he should play.’ It’s a curious thing that McIlroy’s two victories this year have come at Wentworth, a venue he doesn’t like, and at a links that is not supposed to suit his game. Now he’s at Firestone, where he has had three top-five finishes in five starts, followed by the season’s final major, the USPGA at the similarly constructed Valhalla. ‘They’re definitely two courses that should suit me and I’ve got a lot of faith in my game, so let’s see what happens,’ he said. ‘Let’s see if I can ride this momentum.’","The 25-year-old won his third Major title at Hoylake earlier in July .

'I speak with Yaya every day on international duty and I think he will help me to become a better player and a more clinical striker,' Bony added. 'I’ll be playing with great players here at City and this is an opportunity for me to work hard and to take my chance.' Swansea had been locked in talks with the Barclays Premier League champions over the structuring of the transfer, with City having to satisfy Financial Fair Play criteria. Bony will earn £100,000-a-week which is close to double what the striker, who scored 34 goals in 70 games at Swansea, earned at the Liberty Stadium. Crucially, the deal removed a £19m release clause that was included in the original. Liverpool had been interested but are understood to have been put off by his wage demands. City boss Pellegrini added: 'He is very difficult to mark because he is so strong. He is an intelligent footballer who has skill and power. His goals record has been excellent since he came to England. He adapted very quickly to the game here and I think he will settle in at City quickly. 'He will be a very good addition to our squad. We now have four top-class strikers and I am looking forward to seeing them work together.' Bony scored more Premier League goals in 2014 than any other player as he hit the net 20 times .

"American Dustin Johnson is out of the season’s final major next week and the Ryder Cup in September after admitting he needs professional help. The big-hitting 30-year-old, known for his colourful lifestyle, revealed in a dramatic statement on Thursday night that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence. The PGA of America confirmed he won’t be part of the United States team at Gleneagles. Johnson finished 12th in The Open two weeks ago and was fourth in the US Ryder Cup standings. Earlier this year, he got engaged to his glamorous fiancé Paulina Gretzky. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Dustin Johnson and Sergio Garcia play golf on the Thames . Hiatus: Dustin Johnson is to take an immediate break from golf . Getaway: Johnson revealed his decision in a statement on Thursday night and will miss the Ryder Cup . 'We will certainly miss Dustin Johnson at Gleneagles, and we wish him the best,' the US captain, Tom Watson, said.' As one of the longest hitters in the game with an undefeated record of 3-0 at Medinah in 2012, he has clearly been an asset for the United States team. That said, the United States is a team with an abundance of talent.' Johnson’s statement read: 'I am taking a leave of absence from professional golf, effective immediately. I will use this time to seek professional help for personal challenges I have faced. By committing the time and resources necessary to improve my mental health, physical well-being and emotional foundation, I am confident that I will be better equipped to fulfil my potential and become a consistent champion. I respectfully ask for privacy as I embark upon this mission of self-improvement.’ Talk about a statement that left more questions than answers, a point picked up by European Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley on Sky. ‘It’s much better for everyone if there is clarity,’ he said. ‘If something has gone wrong and he has been misbehaving, let’s get it dealt with and move forward.’ Johnson was known for a party lifestyle that led to him being labelled an unfulfilled talent. At 17 he was arrested for buying bullets that were later used in a gangland murder. In 2009 he was in trouble again after being charged with DUI (driving under the influence). Jekyll and Hyde: Talented golfer Johnson has had problems off the golf course in the past . In May 2012, Johnson’s agent David Winkle insisted his client had not been serving a drugs suspension from the PGA Tour when he spent three months out of the game. His coach Butch Harmon was forthcoming in a 2011 interview, revealing: 'Dustin and I had a come-to-Jesus conversation about getting his personal life in order. I told him he needs to figure out who he is and how committed he is to utilizing his talent. He needs to eliminate some of the, shall we say, extracurricular activities. He’s a fun-loving guy, I realize that. But there’s a time to play and a time to work and he needs to understand that better.’ Johnson seemed to have settled down since meeting Gretzky and was an impressive winner of the WGC-Champions tournament in Shanghai last November. Now it is to be hoped he can sort out all his personal demons. All smiles: Johnson (right) got engaged to Paulina Gretzky (left) earlier this year . The news regarding Johnson inevitably overshadowed proceedings on the opening day of the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational here at Firestone, where Australian Marc Leishman led the way after a 64, with Justin Rose shooting 65. Rory McIlroy represented a veritable beacon of tranquillity amidst a sea of tense faces fretting over Ryder Cup places. Earning a Claret Jug will do that for a man, as the 25 year old threatened to carry on from where he left off at Hoylake. Back on the course: Rory McIlroy in action during the Bridgestone Invitational on Thursday . Return: It was his first tournament back since his Open victory at Hoylake . VIDEO Commercial Bank Qatar Masters - Round 1 Highlights - 2014 . As it turned out, an ugly double bogey from nowhere on his penultimate hole turned an opening 67 that would have fairly reflected his play into a 69 that still left him decently placed. This is one of two big events left to decide the automatic Ryder Cup placings on both sides of the Atlantic and boy, can you tell. Welshman Jamie Donaldson, one of those sweating on a spot, summed it up nicely when he said: ’You want to forget about it but all the time you’ve got this voice at the back of your mind nagging away and reminding you what’s at stake.’ It would be desperately harsh if the 38 year old Welshman missed out on a debut after being in the frame for virtually all the qualifying period but it could still happen. A two under par 68, therefore, was a gusty effort. One shot nearer the lead was in-form Italian Frankie Molinari, currently 13th in the standings but who could leap into the automatic spots with a top three finish. Tiger Woods was looking for a good score to shore up his own parlous Ryder Cup position and did that with a 68. Sweating: Jamie Donaldson is one of those chasing a Ryder Cup spot .

"It is no exaggeration to say Lee Westwood has two weeks to save his Ryder Cup career. Two more poor performances, at the Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio this week and the USPGA Championship that  follows, will surely bring to an end a proud record of continuous service dating back to his debut in 1997. Westwood missing out would be a huge loss for Europe. As captain Paul McGinley has acknowledged, he was the unsung hero of the team’s successes over that period. Others may have holed the winning putt or garnered more points but the Englishman was the imposing backdrop. Even when not at his best, at Medinah last time, it was entirely typical he still contributed a point when it was most needed, against Matt Kuchar in the singles. Why not pick him on past record then, as assistant captain Sam Torrance has urged? Because  sentiment has no place at the Ryder Cup and experience is a vicious double-edged sword. Missing the cut? Lee Westwood is in danger of not being selected for the Ryder Cup for first time since his debut . Going through a bad spell: Lee Westwood has missed four halfway cuts in a row . Look at what happened to poor Jim Furyk last time. Furyk and Westwood are both in their early forties and have enjoyed similarly successful careers. In 2012, Furyk was going through a period where he couldn’t win to save his life — still is, alas, as his latest final-round collapse, at the Canadian Open on Sunday, demonstrated — but was picked by captain Davis Love as an act of faith. When push came to shove, Furyk couldn’t deliver. Recent meltdowns trumped experience as he lost his crucial singles to Sergio Garcia despite being one up with two to play. Who would want to see  something horrible like that happen to Westwood, of all people? Over the next fortnight, therefore, he has to earn the right to a wild card. We all know when playing well he’d walk into the team. Heck, even at 70 per cent, I’d pick him. But the facts are Westwood hasn’t even played four rounds in an event since May having missed four  halfway cuts in a row, let alone  contend, and is well off the pace for one of the nine automatic spots. No room for sentiment: Jim Furyk (L) was selected by the US for the 2012 Ryder Cup with disastrous results . Pecking order: Ian Poulter (L) and Graeme McDowell are better placed for wildcards than Lee Westwood . With the much better placed Graeme McDowell and Ian Poulter guaranteed wild cards if necessary, it means he is competing for the final pick against the likes of Stephen Gallacher, the man  currently 10th and who has finished 18-4-15 in his last three starts. Or Frankie Molinari, who is coming into form, or Miguel Angel Jimenez. At least Westwood is assured of 72 holes this week, since there is no cut at Firestone — and he has shown once before that class is  permanent. In 2012, he completed an amazing comeback from 243rd in the world all the way to No 1. How he could do with proving the old adage once more over the next fortnight. Stinger! Ian Poulter was forced to visit hospital after a horse fly bite . Anyone who follows Ian Poulter’s entertaining Twitter feed must have reached the point on Sunday where they just went: what now? The Englishman was on his way to hospital, the latest in a series of medical misadventures this season that have contributed to his disappointing year. Hopefully, this latest ailment, a nasty horsefly bite that caused his arm to swell, won’t cause yet more disruption. He’s another player who could do with a big fortnight. Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley gently took me to task a few months ago when I made light of him mentioning Bernhard Langer as a candidate for a playing spot at Gleneagles. How could you pick a 57-year-old given the strength of the regular European Tour, was the gist of my argument. Yet watching the German’s incredible 13-shot victory in the Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl last week, you could envisage an enticing scenario. Still got it! Bernard Langer scored a 13 shot victory at the Senior Open at Royal Porthcawl . Two foursomes matches  alongside compatriot Martin Kaymer, while who would want to take him on in a singles match? I still don’t think it will  happen. But McGinley is entirely right to give it due consideration. ‘I don’t care what Tiger does between now and the Ryder Cup. If Tiger wants to play, I would certainly choose him.’ Jack . Nicklaus makes his views clear on the great Tiger Woods Gleneagles . debate — and demonstrates why he was a poor Ryder Cup captain. New lease of life: Rory McIlroy won The Open shortly after splitting with Caroline Wozniacki . Couple of birdies: Rory McIlroy has been linked with Nadia Forde (L)  and Sasha Gale (R) Splitting up with fiancee Caroline Wozniacki in May, winning The Open in July and being photographed with two striking women either side of the tournament was enough for at least one columnist to conclude Rory McIlroy is the new Tiger Woods in every sense. As lazy slurs go, this one would be hard to beat for indolence. McIlroy is 25 and has pronounced himself ‘very happy and very single’. When Woods was philandering his way across America, he was married with two kids and continually spouting about the joys of being a family man.

"England's Andy Sullivan won his first European Tour title on Sunday after home favourite Charl Schwartzel suffered a dramatic collapse in the South African Open. Schwartzel took a five-shot lead into the final round at Glendower Golf Club in his native Johannesburg and, despite an error-strewn display, still led by four with five holes to play. However, the former Masters champion then failed to get up and down from a plugged lie in a greenside bunker on the 14th and three-putted the 16th to run up a double-bogey six, before a dreadful tee shot on the 17th led to another bogey and left him tied with Sullivan on 11 under par. Andy Sullivan celebrates on the 18th hole after his winning putt in the sudden-death play-off . Sullivan (left) is presented with the South African Open trophy by Monid Gungabele, Mayor of Ekurhuleni . The players returned to the 18th for a sudden-death play-off and, after both had missed the fairway, Sullivan produced a stunning recovery from the trees and holed from 10 feet for a winning birdie. Sullivan, who held a one-shot lead at the halfway stage but bogeyed the first four holes as playing partner Schwartzel birdied them, started the day seven shots off the lead but carded four birdies, an eagle and one bogey in a closing 67. The 27-year-old from Nuneaton perhaps thought his chance had gone when he left a long birdie putt on the 18th a few inches short, but Schwartzel's shaky finish led to a 74 and ensured extra holes were required. Sullivan (left) and Charl Schwartzel ponder their next moves in the third round at the Glendower Golf Club . 'It's unbelievable,' Sullivan said during the trophy presentation. 'After Saturday I didn't think I stood much of a chance with Charl getting ahead that far. 'I just dug in there yesterday and today and found myself in a position where I had a chance to win. My caddie said over the last few holes 'no regrets' and I've definitely got no regrets over the last few holes, especially that play-off hole. 'Charl has won major championships, my caddie said expect him to hole (his third shot) and he nearly did. I was delighted just to hit the green and have a chance to win and I'm just glad I took it. 'I didn't want to give him a second chance to take the title away from me so I am absolutely delighted and I hope the guys at Nuneaton Golf Club are having a few beers for me! Sullivan produced a stunning recovery from the trees and holed from 10 feet for a winning birdie . 'To just play on the European Tour is something I've wanted to do my whole life, so to win an event just caps it all off and to do it in South Africa where I have always enjoyed playing, it has just been an incredible week.' England's Lee Slattery carded a closing 69 to finish third, just one shot outside the play-off, with Spain's Pablo Martin another shot back in fourth after also recording a 69. Former US Amateur champion Matt Fitzpatrick had been the first player to put the pressure on playing partner Schwartzel with birdies at the second and fourth, but the 20-year-old from Sheffield double-bogeyed the seventh and ran up a triple bogey on the 13th to finish joint fifth.","Favourite Charl Schwartzel suffered a dramatic collapse on the final day .

"It was going to take something special to get things going again on the old sofa. For a month of glorious World Cup football, we telly watching fans were held transfixed as the good stuff just kept on coming. Of course, Andy Murray had the chance to have us blowing the dust off of the remote control and flick over to Wimbledon. But that was a false dawn. I suppose we’d just have to hunker down and wait for the new season to start? Not a bit of it. Instead, a young . Irishman making his living in our green and pleasant land got the juices . flowing again. Rory McIlroy could not have timed his return to . championship-winning form any better. Triumph: Rory McIlroy celebrates at the 17th hole shortly before winning The Open championship . We needed a homegrown hero to do it it on our turf just to remind us that great sport watching comes in all shapes and sizes. And the BBC really delivered our young hero. This truly was the Roryvision Open. There was already something in the air as early as Thursday morning. If you’re ever looking for a man to be positively Churchillian about sport in these Isles, then you need look no further than Peter Alliss. Before a ball had barely been struck he told us he was ‘pawing the ground and sniffing the air like an old war horse’ at the prospect of what was to come. It’s as if he sensed something special was about unfold over the next few days. Well, the old war horse wasn’t wrong. And what did in fact come was delivered by the BBC in a manner that put the viewer straight in the comfort zone. Led by the venerable, veteran commentator, he completed his rounds with a bagful of voices - essentially homegrown - who suited any situation. While the images generated could have been served up with free cream teas and scones. Special day: McIlroy, the champion, celebrates with his mum after securing the win at Royal Liverpool . This was highlighted perfectly on Friday lunchtime when the director launched into a dramatic super slo-mo ‘hero package’ of Adam Scott. Andrew Cotter, in his gentle Scottish lilt, followed it with a slightly awkward ‘ladies and gentlemen. Adam Scott!’ - sounding ever so slightly awkward that they’d just been a bit too showy. Similarly, on Saturday evening, Rory was pieced together in a montage boasting a piece of music Hollywood in its heyday might have thought a bit over the top. Yes, the Americans do it in their coverage. And it sits perfectly well in their Tournaments. But here, well, Peter Alliss had only told us minutes earlier he’d had a postcard from Claire who’d been fed up with the football and couldn’t wait for The Ryder Cup. While on Sunday morning, Dan Walker was stood on a picnic table outside the fish and chip stall asking ‘good people of Hoylake, who do you want to win this?’. I’ll leave you to guess what the answer was. But the point is, our telly isn’t at its best when its full of bombast. It’s just not, well, British. (I should just point out here that I really, REALLY like the graphic ribbon that accompanied some of the tee shots. So yes, if you need me, I’ll be over there in hypocrites corner) Hollywood moment: Mcilroy, pictured with the Claret Jug, had been pieced together in a montage for TV viewers . In fact, all you really need, it would seem, is to just keep that camera set on Roryvision. Of course, this is where the BBC, and we, got lucky. Because the young maestro was captivating stuff from shot one. And there was such a pep in his step, he was even compelling viewing inbetween shots. During the final round, the striding, imperious McIlroy was spotted in all manner of settings. There he was, at one point, stalking through the long grass like he was the subject of a David Attenborough documentary. Then he was just a white baseball cap, bobbing along in a sea of spectators. And in possibly the best telly shot of the championship, our young hero approached his standing ovation at the 18th green in perfect step with a chorus line of white polo-shirted (what Ken Brown called) ‘heavies’. In fact, there was one more image. When Rory had won it. He left the green, went under the stand and across the footbridge to record his score. Again, Roryvision was on, but now there was no crowd, just a young champion realising what he had just achieved. His face was an absolute picture as he allowed himself to really think about what had just happened. I tell you something, it was dear old Bob Hoskins at the end of The Long Good Friday good! Those heady days when Christ The Redeemer wore the sun like a halo as we said farewell to a magnificent World Cup are only just over a week old. And my front room is better for having played host to them. But a few rounds of golf by the seaside up on the Wirral means that great sport on the telly is already moving on.","Rory McIlroy triumph continued a brilliant summer of sport following World Cup in Brazil .

"Four-time major winner Ernie Els admits time is against him, but has not given up hope of a 'Cinderella' victory in the Masters in April. Els finished second at Augusta in 2000 and 2004 - and was sixth, fifth and sixth in the years in between - but has yet to claim a green jacket to go with his two Open and US Open victories. The 45-year-old missed the cut in the Masters last year and failed to record a tournament victory on either the European Tour or PGA Tour all season, dropping from 27th in the world to 63rd as a result. Ernie Els plays a shot during practice ahead of the South African in his native Johannesburg . The Big Easy still hopes to add the US Masters to his collection of majors . Els crosses the bridge with Branden Grace as he looks to get back to winning ways after a poor 2014 . However, the former world number one insists he is as motivated as ever as he seeks a sixth victory in the South African Open at Glendower in his native Johannesburg this week. 'I've played a lot of golf at Glendower, social rounds, tournament rounds, so there's a lot of history here for me and it's wonderful to be back,' said Els, who is also the tournament host and ambassador. Els twice finished runner-up at Augusta, most recently in 2004 . 'I've always taken the South African Open as like a fifth major for me, so to be involved in a capacity where I can host and be an ambassador, thus giving something back to the tournament, is just a phenomenal gift that was given to me. 'I'm getting on now. I've got this title as host ambassador, so you'll see me here for a long time at the SA Open, maybe not as a player later on, but doing what I can. 'It's a different dimension that I'm going into, but as a player right now I feel very motivated to win as many as I can before I'm done, so to speak - especially playing at this course that I know so well and coming back to my roots. 'I still have the drive and want to achieve something. If I can be greedy I would go with Augusta for a win - that would be a Cinderella story.' Local players have an excellent record in European Tour events on home soil, with five of the eight staged last season being won by South Africans. Six events will be held in South Africa this season with England's Danny Willett winning the Nedbank Golf Challenge and South African Branden Grace tasting victory in the Alfred Dunhill Championship in December, while Denmark's Morten Orum Madsen defends his South African Open title this week. 'It's really special to be back and try to defend a title for the first time in my career, so obviously when I stepped in the gate and on to the course it brought back a lot of good memories,' said Madsen, who managed just one other top-10 finish last season. 'Walking into the locker room I remember some really good times in there right after the round, and when all the interviews were over and done with, it was just me, my caddie and my dad in there reflecting on what had just happened. Morten Orum Madsen of Denmark poses with the trophy after winning last year's South African Open . 'It's been extremely exciting and fun to play as a winner on the European Tour. It's definitely drawn extra attention, and also some different feelings from within as to how the game should be played. 'I haven't really performed the way I would have liked to, but I think on some subconscious level I put too much pressure on myself to play well. My expectations sort of rose a little bit more than they probably should have, but I wouldn't have changed a thing. 'This past year has been a good learning experience that I can use for years to come. I feel like I'm a more experienced player now, and I'm probably better suited now to play well and have some success on the European Tour. When I tee it up tomorrow I'll be gunning for the best score I can shoot, but I don't really have expectations.'","Four-time major winner Ernie Els is preparing for the South African Open .

"Saturday night, and it was light entertainment time, with the World Cup version of It’s A Knockout. This time around, it was the BBC’s chance to introduce the boys from Brazil as the opening act after ITV had the honours on the opening day. Back then, Auntie had Thierry Henry as one of her main strikers.  But he has now lost his place alongside Gary Lineker. With a philosophical gallic shrug - which basically said ‘I have no idea why the MLS season is starting up again during the World Cup?’ - he said adieu last week, and went back to training for his club in New York. Off the bench has come Alan Hansen. Enjoying the kind of finale to a career most of us could only dream of. Three weeks by Copacabana beach being slightly more memorable than some warm wine and nibbles in the office, I’d venture to suggest. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hilarious Colombian commentator's reaction to Rodriguez goal . Cast: Alan Hansen joined Rio Ferdinand and Alan Shearer on the BBC panel for the start of the last 16 . Back to the day job: Henry left the BBC team to head back to America to resume the MLS season . For the occasion, he went with a rather sombre black shirt. But this was the only dark note in a quite riveting two hours or so of telly. Even if the last Englishman on the field of play in Brazil very nearly became the big story. The camera seems to really love Howard Webb. Or perhaps it’s the other way around? Either way, his already melodramatic performance suddenly took centre stage when he disallowed Hulk’s second-half goal. Now, if this were domestic coverage of the game, the following few minutes would have forensically picked the moment apart. While also giving us relentless up close and personal looks at Webb and his partner-in-crime with the flag, Mike Mullarkey. But just as Guy Mowbray was telling us us on commentary that Brazilian ‘heads are turning to monitors’ on the bench to see the damning images, so the world was being shown a substitution rather than the moment of the match. Which can often be par for the course with this kind of international event telly coverage. Because when the pictures are being used by an abundance of broadcasters, the safest option is to provide more neutral pictures, tempered with plenty of surrounding colour. Spectacle over specifics. Nevertheless, this sense of occasion can actually also make a moment really special. Such as with the epic penalty shoot-out. This was truly marvelous sport on the telly. Firstly, because the scatter gun images captured so much tension and emotion. And secondly because the BBC stuck with those shots, and had the studio provide fabulous voice-overed insight (‘I was next in Moscow’, shuddered Rio Ferdinand at the thought. ‘And my legs had gone’) into the intensity and pressure of the situation on the players. Formidable, memorable stuff. Centre of attention: Howard Webb disallows Hulk's goal, which would have put Brazil 2-1 ahead . Later that evening on ITV, it was the part two of the evening’s entertainment. And clearly Adrian Chiles and the boys had got all their clothes back from the dry cleaners. Because there they were at the top of the show, by the beach, giving the casual wear a run out. Ian Wright the only man adding a touch of decorum to the whole sorry shorts ‘n’ sandals affair by sporting a splendid panama hat. While at half-time, they were back in the studio, but now dressed like they were all set to hit happy hour as soon as the game finished. Although if the final whistle blew and we came back to them all in pyjamas, I also wouldn’t have been surprised. Somewhere in the middle of all this, of course, Columbia had seen off Uruguay with very little effort. And delivered the goal of the tournament so far, in the process. But with that goal came something of a conundrum over at ITV. All based around the scorer of the goal, Rodriguez. Soaking up the sun: ITV began their presentation of Colombia against Uruguay on the beach . Change: ITV returned to their studio at half-time during Colombia's win over Uruguay . Stars of the show: Colombia lit up the Maracana as they beat Uruguay to move into the quarter-final . In the build up to the game, Wrighty went in hard on the pronouncing of his first name, spelt simply James. Hah-mez, said Ian with a real flourish. Which seemed to meet with the approval of both Lee Dixon and Martin O’Neill alongside him. However, on commentary, Clive Tyldesley was having none of it. Indeed, when Rodriguez rattled in his wonder volley, he even added a fee extra ‘a’s’ to the very familiar pronouncing of James. Adrian then added fuel to the fire at half-time. After Ian said of the goal he could ‘watch it all day’, Adrian suggested he also thought Rodriguez ‘calls himself Ham-Mez’. Then added that perhaps after that goal, all the other James’s out there might want to follow suit? In which case, I’d just like to say to Hah-Mez May, Hah-Mez Blunt and perhaps even Bond, Hah-Mez Bond - great stuff so far, isn’t it? Even if Clive still thinks you are still all plain old James’.","Alan Hansen drafted into BBC studio for coverage of Brazil against Chile .

"So dramatic has Liverpool's slide down the table been in 2014-15 that even if they won every single match until the end of the Premier League campaign they would still not reach last season's tally of 84 points. Brendan Rodgers' side impressed fans across the country with their swashbuckling style last season and finished second only to Manchester City, scoring 101 goals in the process. But the current campaign has seen a significant drop in form, with the Reds having won just nine matches and accumulated a mere 32 points from their 21 matches this season - leaving Rodgers' team a lowly eighth in the Premier League. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Premier League preview: Aston Villa vs Liverpool . Liverpool have endured a difficult 2014-15 campaign - including a 3-0 loss at Manchester United . Even if the Reds win all their remaining 17 matches, they cannot reach last season's points total of 84 - reached while Luis Suarez (left) and Daniel Sturridge were banging in goals for fun . Brendan Rodgers has come under pressure this season after losing Suarez to Barcelona . All this means that, by the middle of January and with 17 games still remaining, Liverpool cannot reach the 84-point mark they achieved in the last campaign. In the unlikely event the Reds won every single one of those 17 matches, they would only reach 83 points. Nevertheless, Liverpool will be determined to accumulate as many wins as they can between now and the end of the season - starting with Aston Villa on Saturday. Mario Balotelli, who cost £16million from AC Milan, has struggled to fill the void left by Suarez . Last season Liverpool's swashbuckling approach saw them finish second to Manchester City . The Reds head to Villa Park to take on a side who have scored just 11 league goals all season. But despite that, Rodgers' record against the Villa boss is hardly inspiring - he has won just twice in seven meetings with Paul Lambert, with the Scot claiming victory on four occasions (plus one draw). However, Rodgers' two victories against Lambert have come at Villa Park on the two most-recent occasions Liverpool have visited Birmingham - with a 2-1 win in March 2013 followed up by a 1-0 triumph in August the same year.

"England's cricketers may have slumped to a one-day international series defeat in Sri Lanka, but the team spirit seems to remain undamaged. That's judging by a tweet from batsman Ravi Bopara, who gave his team-mates the chance to play a prank on him when he forgot to lock his hotel room door. His fellow England players wasted no time in making Bopara regret the error of his ways by dumping the entire contents of his room on top of his bed. Ravi Bopara tweeted the above image of his hotel room after accidentally leaving the door unlocked .

"author] . ENGLAND . ALASTAIR COOK - 5 . He needs to ask himself: ‘Am I making this England cricket team a  better team?’ From the outside it doesn’t appear that he is. At the moment the same mistakes are happening time after time, whether it be batting collapses, being bounced out, bowling too short. The captaincy doesn’t come naturally to him but it is not something you are going to give up easily, believe me. It is the best job an England cricketer can have but he needs to decide if he is making a difference. Ready to walk: Cook leaves the crease after being dismissed during day four of the second Test . Defeat: Cook leaves the field after India's victory on day five of the second Test at Lord's . Looking forward: Cook's leadership qualities have come under fire during his time as England captain . VIDEO I will not walk away - Cook . Would we miss Cook the captain if he didn’t turn up at The Ageas Bowl? No, I don’t think so. But are we missing Cook the world-class batsman with all those Test hundreds? Yes, definitely. When I gave up the captaincy I literally woke up one morning and decided I’d had enough. I’d started to notice in the field that I’d lost the dressing room and I knew inside I was out of energy and it was affecting my decision-making. I knew my time was up. I didn’t think me being captain would make England a better team and that is what Cook must decide. I’ve heard people say that there is no one else but that is not a good enough reason to keep the status quo. If you decide he is not the right man for the job then you can find someone else. What went wrong: Cook, third left, and coach Peter Moores, second right, look on during day five . SAM ROBSON - 4 . Having seen Murali Vijay bat on a pitch like that he should have learned you have to leave the ball well outside off-stump. With Robson, Cook and Ballance at the top of the order England are very  one-paced. GARY BALLANCE - 8 . Another very good hundred in the first innings and looks a good, solid player like a lot of the young lads in the side. Very reliable and will bat at No 3 for a while. IAN BELL - 4 . A victim of the curse of the England Player of the Year award. A bit like Matt Prior the year before, the wheels have come off since he got it. He will consider himself unlucky in this Test but his lack of runs is going under the radar because of Cook’s struggles. Shock: Ian Bell looks on in disbelief after being bowled by India bowler Ishant Sharma at Lord's . JOE ROOT - 7 . Excellent counter-attacking cricket in the second innings. He will be  disappointed with the shot he got out to but he needs to be  positive. He’s a solid, tough cricketer and looks more  impressive every time I see him. MOEEN ALI - 6 . Got runs in both innings and some useful wickets as well. Looks a very elegant player but he needs to work on the short ball because he cannot take his eye off it like he did yesterday just before lunch. Lonely walk: Matt Prior has decided to take some time out from England duty following the defeat . Uncertain: Prior looks on from the home team balcony during England's loss to India at Lord's . MATT PRIOR - 4 . I'm not surprised he has decided to step aside for now because of injury. He looks shot to me, both mentally and physically. The selectors need to look at the senior players and decide if they are past their best. Prior has been a fantastic wicketkeeper-batsman — one of  England’s very best — but he has to decide if he wishes to go on long-term for his country. Another injection of youth and mental energy could well help England because there are clearly still some mental scars from Australia. There are some battered and bruised players in that team at the moment. Prior played a poor shot in the second innings before the new ball. BEN STOKES - 5 . I thought he bowled well in both innings and pitched the ball up. He bowled with passion and seems to be the go-to man. Unfortunately his batting has fallen off a cliff and, in that respect, it looks as if he is mentally just gone. STUART BROAD - 5 . Guilty of bowling too short in the first innings and needed to pitch the ball up more. He and Anderson both bowled too short on that first day and it cost England the Test. LIAM PLUNKETT - 8 . It was a big game for him because everyone was asking whether he would be able to bowl on a green pitch and he showed he could. Useful runs and looks a very good all-round cricketer. JIMMY ANDERSON - 6 . At least he corrected his mistakes from the first innings but in the old days he would have used those  conditions better. He seems to have become more of a hit-the-deck bowler as he has got older.","Former England captain Hussain thinks Cook would perform better without the burden of being captain .
He also believes Prior's decision to step back from England duty is a good one, with the wicket-keeper struggling for fitness and form .
Hussain thinks Gary Ballance and Liam Plunkett were the standout performers for England, while Ajinkya Rahan led the way for India at Lord's ."
"Alastair Cook is too good a player not to return to form at some point. What he must ask himself is whether he can do that while he is captain. Cook’s brain seems scrambled and he is having to work so hard on his leadership that I wonder whether he has the mental energy to work on his batting as well. I am sure there is a hundred just around the corner but it will take a lot of grit, determination and a little bit of luck for Cook to get there. MS Dhoni took his nick on day two but didn’t go for one offered by Gary Ballance. Crossroad: England captain Alastair Cook has some decisions to make after another failure at Lord's . Out of nick: Cook looks back as his edge lands in the gloves of MS Dhoni on day two of the second Test . Under pressure: Cook's dismissal for 10 continues his horror run of form . Even if Cook gets runs in the second innings here he will have to decide whether he has enough in the tank to sort everything out for the third Test. Cook’s captaincy hasn’t been good since the first innings at Trent Bridge. He has been reactive and has to take the blame for how England bowled here. England have had the better of conditions here and may yet go on to win the game but India have shown how best to exploit the conditions. You could argue, of course, that it is the bowlers’ fault that opportunities were wasted on Thursday but the tactics are set by the captain. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad know what they want and like to set their own fields but the captain has to get his way because the wins and losses go against his name. Broad and Anderson are wonderful assets and Cook has to captain them well and make sure they think they’re getting what they want. Even if it’s the captain who is doing it his way. Cook has been in the job for a couple of . years  but he still has a lot to learn. One area of concern is that too . many decisions are being made off the field, such as when England . bowled the right lengths only after lunch on the first day. And Cook . seems too slow to think on his feet and change plans. Assets: Cook needs to make James Anderson and Stuart Broad think they're getting what they want . In the pavilion: Cook appears to make too many decisions off the field . He has to sit down at the end of this Test and ask himself whether putting so much energy into trying to be a better captain is harming his game. What I want to see is Cook getting hundreds for England again. Just say he didn’t play in the third Test. What would we miss most? We’d miss the runs he scores when he is in form more than his captaincy. The bottom line for me is whether Cook feels that giving up the captaincy would give himself the best chance of scoring runs again. He is not a natural leader and has to work so hard at it. But what England need is for him to be their rock again. There is always someone else who could be captain; someone who could surprise us with his leadership. But I want Cook back scoring hundreds, whatever it takes.","A hundred is around the corner for Cook, but it will take grit .
The England skipper went cheaply again, caught behind for 10 at Lord's .
Cook’s captaincy hasn’t been good since the first innings at Trent Bridge .
England would miss Cook's runs more than his leadership on the field ."
"If things don’t go well for England at Lord's and they lose this Test match there can be no excuses. Everything they asked for beforehand, they got. They got the pitch they craved and won the toss but they find themselves in the predicament they are in this morning because they bowled poorly on the first day and failed to take advantage of conditions which were stacked in their favour. Some people have talked about the toss but England captain Alastair Cook had absolutely no choice but to bowl first on that. I don’t care what anyone says. They just didn’t bowl well enough. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Murali Vijay and Paul Farbrace discuss Sunday's play . Crying out for change: Gary Ballance leaves the pitch on Sunday - England's batsmen need to show more aggression . Frustrated: Alaistair Cook leaves the field after being caught behind by MS Dhoni . Nightmare spell: Ian Bell leaves the field after being bowled out by Ishant Sharma . Angry: Stuart Broad shows his frustration during day four of the second test at Lord's . England have little chance of winning unless they completely change the mindset they showed when they batted on Sunday. Sometimes . you have to look at what went before you and the way the opposition had . success and adapt accordingly. This just isn’t the pitch to ‘guts it . out’ because there is always a ball with your name on it. Look at the . way Kumar and Jadeja played with almost a one-day mindset. There was . nothing reckless but they were positive and took the game to England. On . the other hand,  England hit a wall when they got to 70-odd for one. They just didn’t go anywhere and it concerns me that there is no-one in . that top three who is going to take the initiative. Cook, Gary Ballance . and Sam Robson are similar players and nobody seems able to get . busy and go after attacks.. Rare celebration: Ben Stokes gets India's Ravindra Jadeja out for 68 during the second test at Lord's . Bad day: Liam Plunkett sums up England's feelings on day four of the second test . That’s understandable for Cook. He wanted . to guts it out but I’m afraid cricket is about scoring runs and not just . occupying the crease. David Gower used to say to me — when I was out of . nick and would occasionally bend his ear — that it just takes a couple . of  boundaries to get yourself back in nick. Keith Fletcher used to say . the same. But even more important is the mindset. You can’t just . look to leave, leave, leave. There were some good signs but because . no-one is going at the other end there is no-one to relieve the pressure . on Cook. That allows Dhoni just to sit in with his seamers. High expectations: England failed to impress home crowd at a packed Lord's on day four of the second test . There . is no doubt there is still mental baggage from last winter in Australia . for those senior players. This side, the senior guys, were used to . winning and being national heroes. Losing wears you down. You have only . to look at who is doing well in this side and it is the young players . who have come in, such as  Ballance and Joe Root. But there is no . let-up in Test cricket. They can’t go back to county cricket and score . runs like players used to be able to. These players must fix this . themselves. Someone has to play that Jadeja role if England are going to . have any chance whatsoever. Whether it’s Stuart Broad, Ben . Stokes, Matt Prior, whoever. Someone has to take the attack to India. Otherwise there is only one outcome, I’m afraid. Nightmare spell: Ian Bell leaves the field after being bowled out by Ishant Sharma . Familiar sight: India celebrate the wicket of England's Gary Ballance . VIDEO Test evenly poised - Vijay .","If things don't go to plan, there can be no excuses - England asked for this .
Alastair Cook had no choice but to bowl first on the Lord's pitch .
The home side hit a wall when they go to 70-odd runs for one.

There are no leaders to relieve the pressure on captain Cook .

"Wolves provided Mark Warburton’s first taste of defeat as Brentford manager in a 3-0 victory at Griffin Park back in February — and an air of revenge lingered before kick-off on Saturday. Though both clubs went on to secure promotion from League One in May, Brentford are a side transformed from the one who rolled over when these clubs last met. Warburton’s men were ruthless this time round, with goals from Alan Judge, Stuart Dallas, Andre Gray and Jota. Brentford boss Mark Warburton salutes the Bees fans after his side's 4-0 win over Wolves . They are now third in the table, just a point off Steve McClaren’s Derby side in first. Whisper it, but some fans are dreaming of higher ground. Talk in the build-up to the game centred on the Championship newbies’ wildly contrasting form. Brentford had four wins from four, Wolves three defeats from three. In fact, Brentford’s stock has risen to such an extent that discussions have begun, particularly inside the four pubs on the corners of their old-fashioned ground, about where the club could play Premier League football should Griffin Park not meet top-flight regulations. Alan Judge of Brentford opens the scoring during the Championship rout of Wolves on Saturday . It has been a monumental few weeks for London’s forgotten side. At the Hurlingham Club on November 20, more than 600 guests, including England boss Roy Hodgson and FA chairman and long-suffering Brentford fan Greg Dyke, celebrated Brentford’s 125th anniversary. In the club shop, meanwhile, fans can buy a beautifully crafted book to commemorate the milestone. More than 250 have been scanned through the till in the first week of sale. Andre Gray (number 19) celebrates with team-mates after scoring his side's third goal . Brentford are due to move to a new 20,000-seat stadium just a few miles away before the 2017-18 season, but a Premier League promotion before that date could see them sharing with another club. Yet Warburton and the board are refusing to get ahead of themselves, despite Saturday’s emphatic win against a side who finished above them last season. The club’s chief executive Mark Devlin said: ‘Our primary aim is to stay at Griffin Park until our new stadium is complete, whatever division we are playing in. ‘Griffin Park falls short of meeting Premier League requirements in some areas. We are looking at creative and innovative solutions to meet those requirements.’ In his post-match press conference, Warburton added: ‘I think whether you go into a local Under 9 league or you go into the Premier League, it’s about doing the best you can in that competition. Our competition is the Championship. Warburton's side are now just three points off Steve McClaren’s Derby side who lead the Championship . ‘We had a good run of five games, but now it’s December and we start the month with a new target. Our only focus is Huddersfield next Saturday. ‘We’re not going to say that we’re going to come in the top 10 or the top 12, all we are saying is that we will try and maintain our level of performance, and see where we end up in May.’ When asked about his team’s rise to third, he said: ‘It’s tremendous. You can’t say anything other than that. It’s a great place to be, we are one point off the top and I think we deserve to be there.’ Mirco Antenucci’s double inspired Leeds to a 2-0 win against the Championship’s top side Derby at Elland Road. United had failed to beat the Rams since September 2005 and a current run of 10 games without a win meant expectations were low as Steve McClaren’s side came to town. But the Italian Antenucci fired the hosts to three points in a fiery clash which saw referee Mick Russell show nine yellow cards. The club are thriving under the management of Warburton, and the ownership of Matthew Benham. With a new stadium on the way, a blossoming academy, and a team enjoying their best run of form since 1935, things are moving in the right direction. Warburton reeled off the ages of Saturday’s starting XI. Only one of them is over 30, midfielder Jonathan Douglas. Seven of the 11 are 25 or under. He said he will only add to his squad in January if he can find genuine quality. And who can blame him for that? They are doing just fine as it is. Talk of a Premier League ground-share might turn out to be premature. But one thing is for sure, Brentford are going places — sooner rather than later. Mirco Antenucci's brace helped Leeds to a 2-0 victory over Derby County . WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE... Darren Bent might have thought it was clever to cup his hand to his ear in front of Fulham fans after scoring on his Brighton debut. His old club had the last laugh, with goals from Hugo Rodallega and Lasse Vigen Christensen. Nottingham Forest seemed to turn a corner with wins against Norwich and Wolves after an abject run, but they lost their composure at St Andrews. After Britt Assombalonga saw red having made it 1-1 at Birmingham, the hosts went on to win with a penalty. Benik Afobe, on loan from Arsenal, impressed by scoring a hat-trick as MK Dons thumped Colchester 6-0.

"Brentford made it five wins from five in November with a dominant display at Griffin Park, exacting a spot of revenge on the team that pipped them to the League One title last season. Four well-worked goals, scored by Alan Judge, Stuart Dallas, Jota and Wolverhampton-born Andre Gray, saw off Wolves, as Mark Warburton's side continued their remarkable rise up the SkyBet Championship.

Booked: Saville, Edwards, Evans, Ricketts . Manager: Kenny Jackett 5 . Man of the match: Andre Gray . Referee: Mark Brown (East Yorkshire) 6 . Attendance: 10,923 . George Saville was one of four changes made by Wolves boss Kenny Jackett, as they looked to arrest a slump in form that had seen them lose their last three games. Saville started in central midfield against his former side and was on the receiving end of some full-blooded challenges in the early stages. Not that he was afraid to give it back, mind. The former Chelsea man landed a reducer on close friend Jonathan Douglas before picking up the first yellow of the game for a cynical foul on Jon Toral. The visitors, despite not seeing as much of the ball as Brentford in the early stages, posed the bigger threat, particularly Bakary Sako, the Malian winger celebrating his 100th appearance for the club. Some diamond-encrusted commemorative boots to mark his century were confined to the warm-up due to Football League regulations, but his replacement white pair nearly produced the goods when he whipped a free-kick on to the roof of the net from 35 yards early on. And then, in the 16th minute, Danny Graham glanced a header on to the underside of the crossbar following decent play by Rajiv van La Parra down the left. Moses Odubajo of Brentford holds off the challenge of Bakary Sako during the match at Griffin Park . Jon Toral (right)  is tackled by Sam Ricketts as Brentford moved to within a point of leaders-leaders Derby . Brentford broke the deadlock against the run of play, Alan Judge timing his run brilliantly to meet Jon Toral's cut-back from the left side of the box, drift past the two Wolves centre backs, and prod a finish past Ikeme and into the far corner. Wolves were immediately on the hunt for an equaliser, and so nearly got it when Sako's rasping strike was parried away by the alert David Button at his near post. Warburton's team, doing what they could to use Andre Gray's pace to stretch Wolves, nearly doubled their lead in the 34th minute. The striker, released by his home-town club Wolves at 13, raced past Matt Doherty and dinked an inviting ball to the back post, but no Brentford player could touch it beyond Ikeme. After a tepid start to the second half, Stuart Dallas' introduction for Brentford sparked the hosts into life. One of his first involvements was to set Judge clear, only for the midfielder's delicate lob to be clawed away by Ikeme. Bakary Sako wore some custom made boots during the warm-up to commemorate his 100th Wolves game . Play is halted after a distress flare is thrown onto the pitch during the match between Brentford and Wolves . Carl Ikem the Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper clears the ball under pressure from Gray . Five minutes later Dallas made it 2-0, with a crisp strike after some eyecatching footwork from Alex Pritchard on the edge of the Wolves box. The attacker, on loan from Tottenham, jinked away from Rowe and Batth and fired a pass to the sub at the back post, and he slid the ball calmly into the back of the net. On 82 minutes, Gray, who looked so dangerous when given time and space to run in to by Wolves, added a third with thumping effort into the roof of the net, before Jota completed the scoring in added time with a neat finish under Ikeme. Before the game, talk of where Brentford would play if they secured promotion to England's top tier was brushed aside by Warburton. After another maximum return, their fans, at least, will be beginning to dream.","Brentford beat Wolves 4-0 at Griffin Park to consolidate play-off position .

"Percy Harvin played for the Seattle Seahawks for less than two years before his shock trade to the New York Jets. The Seahawks spent around $18.4million on the do-it-all, but injury-prone receiver, who played just eight games for the franchise. One of them was a dazzling cameo in February's Super Bowl victory which showcased some of his speed and playmaking ability. But his short career has been plagued with concerns about his temperament and toughness. Percy Harvin won the Super Bowl with Seattle in February but moves to the 1-6 New York Jets . With 60 NFL appearance to his name, the 26-year-old moves his third team in six years since being taken as the 22nd overall pick by Minnesota in 2009. Plagued with migraines throughout college and his first few years in the NFL, Harvin's superb rookie season was a factor in the Vikings reaching the NFC Championship game. Following the retirement of Brett Favre, Harvin's spell in Minnesota turned sour after the arrival of inconsistent quarterback Christian Ponder, the 12th pick of the 2011 draft. Harvin fell out with coach Leslie Frazier, one of football's good guys, and moved to Seattle two years later, signing a six-year, $67m deal. The Seahawks traded their 2013 first-round draft choice, one of their three seventh-round draft choices and a 2014 third-round draft pick. The move drew criticism from then-MVP Adrian Peterson, who tweeted: 'The best all around player I ever seen or you'll ever see! Goes to Seattle! I feel like I just got kicked in the stomach. Several times!!!' Harvin hobbles off the field  against Washington - a game where he had three touchdowns disallowed . After surgery on a hip injury later that summer, he would only play one regular season game - ironically in a 30-20 win over Minnesota. Harvin returned for the business end of the Super Bowl-winning campaign, but sustained a concussion in the divisional win over New Orleans which saw him miss the NFC Championship game against the 49ers. But his performance in MetLife Stadium - where he will now ply his trade under Rex Ryan - showcased his ability. He had two rushes for 45 yards and ran back the second-half kick off 87 yards for a touchdown in the 43-8 win over Denver. Harvin returns a kick-off during the defeat to the Cowboys in his final outing as a Seattle player . While rumours of dressing room discontent abound - particularly with quarterback Russell Wilson - some of Harvin's Seahawks team-mates reacted with incredulity on Twitter. 'Damn they got my n****....' said Marshawn Lynch. Cliff Avril was on a similar page, saying: 'This business is crazy... Hate to see my boy @Percy_Harvin go,' on the social networking site. Yet Harvin has struggled to stretch the field this season and has failed to shine, despite being used as a runner, receiver and on special teams, contributing 225 yards of offense in five games. He joins a struggling franchise which has lost its last six games. And with the inconsistent Geno Smith just about holding off the jaded Michael Vick at quarterback, one wonders how long it will be before Harvin explodes off the field once more.","Harvin joins his third franchise in six years after joining Seattle in 2013 .

"Tom Brady's three touchdowns passes helped the New England Patriots squeeze past the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium on Thursday and to their third straight victory. The Patriots quarterback picked out Shane Vereen twice and also found Danny Amendola in the fourth quarter to guide his side to a 27-25 win. The New York Jets had an opportunity to win the game when Nick Folk attempted a 58-yard field goal in the dying seconds, but his kick was blocked by Chris Jones and New England held on.

Nick Folk's field-goal attempt on the final play was blocked New England Patriots defender Chris Jones . Vereen of the New England Patriots catches a touchdown pass during the first quarter . 'It's good to feel that ball hitting my hand and it's good to get the win,' Jones said. 'I just played it legally and did all that I could.' Last season, Folk was wide left on a 56-yard attempt in overtime, but Jones was penalized under a new rule against players pushing a team-mate into the opponent's formation. Folk then connected from 42 yards, giving the Jets a 30-27 victory. 'After what happened last year, I thought it was fitting that he made that play,' Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. Folk's longest field goal in his career travelled 56 yards, but he had made all 13 of his attempts this year so the 58-yarder was makeable. Folk (left) kicks a field goal from the hold of Ryan Quigley while Amendola (right) runs for the yardage . 'It felt pretty good off my foot,' he said. 'I did kick it low, in order to give it enough to get it there.' But when Jones batted it down, the Patriots (5-2) raced onto the field in celebration of a win that was much tougher than expected. The Jets (1-6) suffered their sixth straight loss, the longest streak in Rex Ryan's six seasons as coach, after taking a 19-17 lead with just under 9 minutes left in the third quarter on Chris Ivory's 1-yard run. Stephen Gostkowski put the Patriots ahead to stay with his second field goal, a 36-yarder with 4:10 to go in the third. Brady's 19-yard touchdown pass to Danny Amendola gave them an eight-point lead with 4:10 remaining. New England Patriots wide receiver Danny Amendola (centre) celebrates his touchdown catch . New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith, number seven, signals on the line of scrimmage . The Jets made it 27-25 on Geno Smith's 10-yard scoring pass to Jeff Cumberland with 2:31 left, but Smith's pass for the 2-point conversion was incomplete. Ivory finished with 107 yards rushing. 'This is extremely frustrating,' Smith said. 'I felt it was going to happen for us.' Smith, last in the NFL in passer rating, had a solid game with 20 completions in 34 attempts for 226 yards and no interceptions. Brady was 20 for 37 for 261 yards and no interceptions. Jones tackles New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith in the second half . Each team played without two key starters who went on season-ending injured reserve after being hurt Sunday — cornerback Dee Milliner and left guard Brian Winters for the Jets and linebacker Jerod Mayo and running back Stevan Ridley for the Patriots. 'As a whole offence we needed to step up,' running back Shane Vereen said. 'You can't replace Stevan.' The Patriots led 17-12 at half-time despite having the ball for just 7:57, while the Jets held it for 22:03. 'When the defence is out there as much as they were tonight it's going to be tough for them,' Brady said. 'We've got to help them out.' The Jets got inside the New England 30 on all four of their first-half possessions. But they managed just four field goals by Folk, covering 22, 47, 46 and 27 yards. New England Patriots cheerleaders perform in the first half . Patriots mascot Pat Patriot celebrates the victory as he high-fives a minuteman after the game . The Patriots went three-and-out on two of their possessions in the half but made the most of the other two as Brady threw touchdown passes to Vereen — a 49-yarder on their fourth offensive play and a 3-yarder that made it 14-9 with 4:22 left in the half. After Folk's fourth field goal, the Patriots got the ball with 55 seconds remaining in the half. On third-and-10 at the New York 44, Antonio Allen was called for defensive pass interference on Amendola, putting the ball at the 12. An unnecessary roughness penalty against guard Jordan Devey pushed the ball back to the 27. After a 6-yard run by Vereen, Gostkowski kicked a 39-yard field goal on the last play of the half. The Jets were competitive against a top team for the second straight game. They lost to the Denver Broncos 31-17 on Sunday. 'The result is not showing on the scoreboard, but I think we are getting there,' Ivory said.","New England Patriots move to 5-2 in AFC East with third straight win .

"Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle won't be suspended after his arrest on a shoplifting charge. Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said on Wednesday that Randle will be fined 'significantly' but will play in the NFL on Sunday against the New York Giants. Randle was charged with misdemeanor theft of between $50 (£31.30) and $500 (£313) after he was accused of taking $123 (£77) worth of cologne and underwear from a department store at a suburban Dallas mall on Monday. He was detained by store security, taken to jail, and posted bond early Tuesday. Dallas Cowboys' Joseph Randle was arrested for shoplifting at a suburban Dallas mall on Monday . The arrest came a day after one of Randle's best games in two seasons with Dallas in a 30-23 victory against Super Bowl champion Seattle. He had a 38-yard run and a key tackle on a late kickoff. According to an arrest report, Randle was caught on video placing items later identified as a 'tester' bottle of Gucci Guilty Black cologne and a two-pack of Polo underwear into a Dillard's bag after making a purchase at the store at Stonebriar Centre, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of Dallas. Randle, 22, will not be suspended and will play for the Dallas Cowboys against the New York Giants on Sunday . The 22-year-old Randle was stopped by a security guard in the parking lot and later told a police officer that when he saw the 'old guy,' referring to the security guard, he thought to himself, 'All right, y'all got me.' Randle returned to the store and the items were recovered. The cost of the items was $123.50 (£77.45) before sales tax. Randle is in the second year of a four-year, $2.3 million (£1.4m) rookie contract with a base salary of $495,000 (£310,000) this season. Randle declined to talk to reporters in the locker room on Tuesday.","Joseph Randle will not be suspended after his arrest for shoplifting .

"Fernando Torres has been playing as a single, lone striker since he was 17-years-old, when he broke into the first team at Atletico Madrid. He captained that team and has always played as the lone man up-front, taking relentless kick after kick. His devastating pace was used to get in behind defences with very few managers wanting or expecting good link-up play around the half-way line. Finished: Fernando Torres will never rediscover the strengths that made him the player he was . Deadly: In his pomp Torres used devastating pace and movement to beat defenders . He was always on the shoulder of the centre backs. Kenny Dalglish wrote in his book that Fernando needed to have a break as he had been playing non-stop, through the summers in World Cups, the Confederations Cups, or the Euros. He had not had a break and played virtually continuously for eight years. No rest: Torres played almost continuously for eight years and injuries have taken their toll . His strength was in his explosive speed, similar to a Formula One car. But being constantly on full throttle that sharp edge has blunted and he has slowed down. Injuries, kicks and fatigue would no doubt have set in and it is now impossible for him to rediscover what he had. It's time to let him go. Out of touch: Torres has just four Premier League goals this season and none since January . When Jose Mourinho picked a team for the Champions League quarter-final with no centre forward, even though he had two on the bench in Demba Ba and Torres, he was sending a message loud and clear to Mr Abramovich, who hovers above him, that a top quality centre forward is needed. His gamble on Samuel Eto'o has paid off to a certain extent, but he is not as quick as he once was and he's nearly my age. Message: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was sending a message to Roman Abramovich when he didn't start a striker in the Champions League against Paris Saint-Germain . Investment: Mourinho wants the Chelsea owner to invest in a new top class striker in the summer . Mourinho's case for reinforcements was strengthened when Paris Saint-Germain brought on the Ferrari fuel-injected winger Lucas Moura and the devastating Javier Pastore who both waltzed Bruce Forsyth-like through the Chelsea defence with ease. Chelsea's reinforcement at that late stage was 35-year-old Frank Lampard, one of the best ever attacking midfield players who was forced on to play a holding midfield role. The messages were obvious. Impact: PSG were able to bring on Javier Pastore from their substitutes bench . Ba also looks a shadow of the striker I remember when he first moved over to England from Germany in 2011. I recall standing on the touchline at West Ham's Chadwell Heath training ground next to Avram Grant watching a training session and one player was catching my eye. He was useless. A shadow: Demba Ba does not look the same player as the one who arrived in England in 2011 . Avram, who is that chap with the bright green size 15 boots on?' I asked. 'Is he a trialist?' 'No Martin, no,' he replied. 'This player is Demba Ba. I have just signed him from Hoffenheim.' I nodded and smiled, and I looked at Demba's 10-to-2 gait and bright green massive feet. He looked like a duck waddling around. I thought what an earth has Avram done? The next day he banged in two against West Brom! Impact: Ba was a huge hit at West Ham and Newcastle but has failed to fire at Chelsea . In 19 years as a manager in the Football League I've never heard or had anyone mention rigging matches or spot fixing. Never even had a sniff of it. I'm sure for all the players who have been arrested it is a very difficult and testing time. Until proven guilty: Preston North End captain John welsh is one of seven players to be arrested for spot-fixing . But we must remember they are all innocent until proven guilty. Let them carry on playing and let them continue their lives until it's proven that they have done wrong or not. Of course it is a concern, but hopefully the investigations that are going on will nip it in the bud, so there are no longer any doubts about the integrity of the game. Difficult: The players should be allowed to carry on playing and continue their lives until guilt is proven . Talking of integrity, what a mockery it has been made of after Sunderland's fine for fielding an ineligible player was brushed under the carpet and kept secret. It is simply not enough for them to be handed a hefty fine and a slap on the wrist for playing Ji Dong-Won in four Barclays Premier League matches. Mockery: Sunderland were only fined after playing unregistered Ji Dong-Won . Even though he isn't the best of players he is still a good one and why can Hereford and Torquay get docked points in League Two back in 2011 and Sunderland escape? That is Mad. There will be hell to play if they avoid relegation by only a few points. Not only that, when he shouldn't have played in the Capital One Cup they knocked out my old club MK Dons. I cannot understand why somebody is not responsible for spotting that error at the time.Think for one moment if they went through instead of Sunderland. Mad: Hereford and Torquay were docked points for a similar offence in 2011 . They would've gone on to play Peterborough in the next round which would've given them a good chance to progress. And, who knows, they could've then got a tie against a Premier League club, potentially worth millions of pounds. When the team sheets were sent in for the league cup surely someone must hold their hands up and take responsibility for the error that has been made.And I say 'error' as it is not cheating. Just to make it clear, I don't feel Sunderland have cheated, but potentially a lower league club could've been cheated out of a lot of money due to the error. Missing out: MK Dons may have missed out financially because Ji played against them . On Tuesday night last week I faced the dilemma of choosing between Woking versus Forest Green Rovers or Manchester United against Bayern Munich. One was getting out into the thick of it. The other was putting my feet up on the sofa and sticking the telly on. There was only one choice for me. Choice: Going to see Woking and Forest Green was more appealing than staying in to watch United and Bayern . I love the big Champions League games and watching the top players, but the sausage and chips in the board room at Woking before the game and the welcome from the ladies who dish out the tickets and serve the tea and the coffee is different class. They're proud of the role they play and their love for Woking Football Club through the ups and downs is quite moving. The banter from the supporters in what must be the oldest shed-like stand in the country was hilarious. Getting stuck in: The atmosphere at Football League and Non-League grounds is second to none . The one-liners, the stick the 'line-o' got, and the laughs I had throughout the game made my trip to the Kingfield Stadium memorable. I enjoy the Premier and the Champions League, but I love getting stuck in at Football League and non-League matches.","It's impossible for Fernando Torres to rediscover what he once had - Chelsea should get rid of him .

"Manchester City braved the arctic-like conditions on Thursday as they trained at the Etihad Campus ahead of Saturday's mouth-watering top-of-the-table clash against Chelsea. City stopper Joe Hart was pictured with a shovel picking up snow with Manuel Pellegrini's side in need of a lift-off on the field after a frustrating couple of weeks. Following successive defeats against Arsenal and most recently Middlesbrough in the FA Cup, this weekend's crunch clash against Jose Mourinho's men bears even greater significance now.

We will try to win that game to close that gap again. 'The game we must play at Stamford Bridge is a very important game. We must close the gap to two points.' Pellegrini's men will be looking to cut the five-point deficit the leaders Chelsea currently hold, with a defeat at Stamford Bridge putting City's title bid in serious jeopardy - considering Mourinho's men have lost just twice in the league all season.

"Katarina Johnson-Thompson has withdrawn from the Great Britain team for the European Championships in Zurich. The 21-year-old heptathlete, who had been due to compete in the long jump in Switzerland, has still not recovered sufficiently from the foot injury which ruled her out of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. British Athletics said in a statement that 'taking the longer-term view rather than short-term risk' would ensure her winter training programme was not compromised. Withdrawn: Katarina Johnson-Thompson has failed to recover from her foot injury in time for the Euros .

Recovery: Johnson-Thompson had been due to compete in the long-jump in Zurich but has had to withdraw . However, missing both of this season's major championships is still a major blow for the Liverpool athlete, who had been enjoying a superb season. She would have been favourite for heptathlon gold in Glasgow and a very strong medal contender in Zurich next week. Shara Proctor, who pulled out of the Commonwealth long jump final after picking up a thigh injury, has also pulled out of the Europeans. Phillips Idowu has withdrawn after finishing a disappointing fifth at the Commonwealths to focus on training and rediscovering his best form, while Sebastian Rodger has replaced Dai Greene in the 400m hurdles after the former world champion failed to achieve the qualifying standard for Zurich.

'Having had a fairly nightmarish past 18 months - and not knowing whether I'd ever throw or compete again - getting back into the GB vest alone has been incredible. To say captaincy is an added bonus, is a massive understatement,' the 32-year-old said. British Athletics performance director Neil Black said: 'I was delighted to offer Goldie this captaincy. She has a career that has spanned both junior and senior ranks that sets a real example to the youngsters making that transition.' The European Championships get under way on Tuesday.

"One of the country's most important Jacobean houses that has been used as a police training college for decades has been put up for sale by the Home Office for £25m. Built in 1612, Bramshill House, near Hook in Hampshire, boasts a lake, two chapels and world-class training facilities, not to mention the 329 bedrooms. The Home Office says it is selling because the historic mansion and its 300-acre grounds cost £5m a year to run, but the police have been heavily criticised for their lavish spending on the historic estate. Bramshill House in Hampshire, which the Home Office is selling for £25m, was built in 1612 and sits in 300 acres . The Home Office bought the Jacobean mansion in 1953 and have used it as a police training college . In 2011 the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) was slammed for spending more than £18,000 of taxpayers' cash on the mansion and its grounds, including £1,800 on a beehive and cultivator for the kitchen garden, and £147 on rhododendrons. And the year before that, the agency was revealed to have spent £750,000 on restoring an ornamental bridge - a 1940s folly - in the grounds. The NPIA also spent £2m resurfacing a mile-long stretch of the drive there, and spent £31,000 on a black tie dinner for officers at Bramshill in September 2007. The Home Office has used the Grade I-listed property, which at 43,000sq ft would be one of the largest homes in the UK, since 1953 as a training centre for police. The site also houses the British National Police Library, the largest policing library in Europe, the National Missing Persons Bureau, and the Serious Crime Analysis Centre. The mansion, which was built between 1605 and 1615, has 15 bedrooms, a long gallery, chapel, lounges, a mezzanine and a number of 'magnificent state rooms' which have now been converted into banqueting halls. Grandeur: But such elegance comes at a price: the Home Office says Bramshill costs £5m a year to run . Away from the Jacobean mansion, there . are a number of purpose built buildings which include two bars, 58 staff houses, two . restaurants, a sports hall and 231 en-suite bedrooms. The address dates back to the Domesday Book when it was known as the estate of 'Bromeselle' and held by Hugh De Port. By the 14th century the Foxleys owned the estate and in 1347 Sir Thomas Foxley Constable of Windsor Castle was granted permission to enclose 2,500 acres of land as a deer park at Bramshill and Hazeley. Between 1351 and 1360 Sir Thomas also 'erected a noble mansion at Bramshill', possibly using tradesmen from Windsor. In 1605, the estate was acquired by Cambridge-educated Edward, 11th Lord Zouche of Harringworth. As the ambassador to Scotland and Lord President of the Council of Wales, Zouche needed a large country mansion to make a statement that he was a force to be reckoned with, and so reconstructed the house between 1605 and 1615. King James visited in 1620 and the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1621 and it was also used for a first class cricket match between England and Hampshire in 1823 with the county side winning by five wickets. Bramshill was used as a maternity home during World War Two and afterwards as a shelter for the exiled King of Romania. Emma Cleugh of estate agents Knight Frank, who are selling the house and grounds, said: 'Bramshill's rich history is part of its appeal but also its modern facilities bring it right into the 21st century. 'Bramshill represents an unequalled opportunity to the market - whether for continued institutional/training/educational uses or alternative uses and further development.'","Grade I-listed Bramshill House in Hook, Hampshire, was built in 1612 .

"A Briton emerged today as one of the many heroes of the devastating typhoon after saving dozens of people trapped in their hotel rooms on a holiday island. Electrical engineer Jonathan Fitzpatrick kicked in hotel doors and led families to safety moments before walls of the hotel were swept away by 235mph winds battering Leyte island. The 23-year-old from Walsall, West Midlands, was one of many Britons on holiday in the Philippines who found themselves caught up in the rescue and relief operations. In the province of Leyte, 10,000 are feared to have died in Tacloban, 580km (360 miles) southeast of Manila, where survivors said waves hit their homes ‘like a tsunami’. Hero: British electrical engineer Jonathan Fitzpatrick saved dozens of people from his hotel after breaking down their doors just before the storm swept the walls of the building away . I'm safe! Mr Fitzpatrick gives the thumbs-up to his family over Skype after they feared the worst having not heard from him for 33 hours . Some were even volunteering for the . Red Cross in the capital Manila today, offering to stay on to help the . massive relief operation facing the beleaguered country. Mr . Fitzpatrick was with four workmates who found shelter and protection in . a stairwell at the Ormoc Villa Hotel but hearing panic in nearby rooms . from people unable to open their doors because of the sheer strength of . the wind, he kicked them in and led families to safety at the three-star . resort. Today, he . was able to relay his story to his anxious family, who had alerted him . initially that a huge storm was on its way so he had been able to warn . others. But it was not for 33 hours that he was able to tell them he was safe. Destruction: The province of Leyte where Mr Fitzpatrick kicked in hotel doors and led families to safety moments before walls of the hotel were swept away by 235mph winds . City of the dead: Residents try to salvage belongings in Tacloban, Leyte province, where up to 10,000 people are feared to have been killed . Scene: The Ormoc Villa Hotel (pictured before the typhoon), where Mr Fitzpatrick was staying when the storm struck . His sister Rachel, 25, said: 'Because we had prepared him and told him about the storm, he and his mates went out of the room and started to tell people to get back inside. 'That lasted about 20 minutes and he said when the storm came back it was about 100 times worse and the wind direction had changed, so instead of people trying to keep their doors closed, they were getting trapped in their rooms as they could not open their doors. 'He admitted he thought that was going to be it. But he decided he didn't want to go like that, and he wanted to go fighting. 'He . and his friends started kicking doors down to get the families out of . their rooms and into the stairwell, and taking bottled water to hand out . to people. 'He said that in some rooms there were entire families, with eight children huddling on the bed.' Courageous: The electrical engineer was in the Pacific country working on a power station . Mr Fitzpatrick's family told how they . had witnessed his workmates - who were in the Pacific country to work on . a power station - struggling to hold their hotel door closed when he . made the long-distance video call on Skype. He spoke to each member of his family individually to speak to them for what could have been the last time. After . losing contact, they had to wait almost a day-and-a-half to hear . whether he had died in the violent weather conditions but then on . Saturday morning he sent a text to girlfriend Kirsty Smith, 21, to tell . her he had escaped unharmed. - Girlfriend Kirsty Smith . She . said: 'It was a very big relief. When we spoke to him before losing . touch, he told us ""I don't want to worry you, but I love you all"".' Meanwhile, another Briton Tim Harding, from Sunderland, said he was one of many foreigners who were volunteering at a Manila Red Cross centre in the storm's aftermath. Mr Harding said he had planned a holiday to the nation's capital with his wife, who was originally from the Philippines, but it had instead become a volunteer mission. 'There's only one priority here and that's to get together, get stuck in and do the greater good,' he said. 'It's good to see everyone getting on, doing a job where race, nationality, income level, nothing matters at all. Mr Harding said he would help wherever he could for the next few weeks and it was a mind-set shared by other foreigners hailing from not only the UK, but elsewhere in Europe and the world. He said there were mixed emotions in the recovery centre, with many locals also helping out to take their minds of the devastation. 'There's a lot of panic going on here,' he said. 'Although we just got some good news a few minutes ago that a three-year-old child had actually been rescued in the debris at a place in Tacloban city. 'There was a big cheer that went up.'","Jonathan Fitzpatrick trapped on Leyte island as 235mph winds swept in .

"An Iranian man should be sentenced to having his eyes gouged out after pouring acid over a young girl's face leaving her blind, an Iranian court has ruled. Opposition group, The National Council of Resistance of Iran, said the man could have his right ear and nose cut off as punishment for attacking the girl with acid, causing her to lose her eyesight and right ear. The man was convicted last October of intentionally attacking the girl, haartez.com reported. President Hassan Rohani won a surprise election last year, after pledging more openness with the West. But an increased use of the death penalty has dashed hopes the country's will improve its human rights record, the UN said . The national council said Iran's high court defended cutting off the body parts of those found guilty of a crime, and removing eyes, as part of the country's judicial system. Last month, the state-run Mehr news . agency, reported another Iranian man was sentenced to have one hand and . one foot cut off as punishment for an unspecified crime. As many as 95 people are thought to have been executed in Iran this year. The dramatic rise in the use of the death penalty has dashed hopes for human rights reform under President Hassan Rohani, the United Nations said earlier this year. President Rohani won a surprise election last year, after pledging more openness with the West. In September, the country released dozens of political prisoners, prompting hopes Iran would improve their human rights record. 'There were some encouraging signs last year where political prisoners were released ... But it appears at least in the past seven weeks that in fact executions have been scaled up,' UN human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a news briefing. 'We regret that the new government has not changed its approach to the death penalty and continues to impose capital punishment for a wide range of offences. We urge the government to immediately halt executions and to institute a moratorium.' Last year Iran executed between 500 and 625 people, including at least 28 women and two children, Ms Shamdasani said.","Opposition group claims Iran's high court has sentenced man to gouging and losing his ear and nose .

"Arda Turan obviously wasn’t listening to the half time team talk from Diego Simeone at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday night. The Argentine coach, furious that the referee had sent off his captain Gabi in the tunnel, had told his players that the game had finished and instructed them not to push themselves in the second 45 minutes, concentrating instead on conserving energy, playing out time and not conceding. It was just three minutes into the second half that the Turkish international threw his boot at the linesman escaping punishment presumably because on a night when chaos had reigned since the 47th second when Fernando Torres opened the scoring the referee just didn’t register the seriousness of the offence. VIDEO - Scroll down to see a vine mocking Turan throwing his boot . Atletico Madrid's Arda Turan hurls his boot at a linesman  but remarkably only received a yellow card . The Barcelona and Atletico Madrid clash was full of incident, including Turan hurling his boot at the linesman . Simeone was proud of his players efforts and said he told them to show restraint in the second half . Retired referee Rafa Guerrero said on Thursday in his column in Marca: ‘Arda should have been sent off not shown the yellow card’. In his defence the player had had his boot knocked off before he launched it at linesman Angel Nevado. He hadn’t taken it off on purpose, it wasn’t quite the significant religious act of disrespect that it was likened to post-match with the Internet virals doing the rounds of Arda pelting his branded footwear at George Bush. The fiery Atletico Madrid midfielder is no stranger to controversy. In the last Balon d’Or voting he didn’t vote for his coach Simeone as manager of the year, although he later claimed this was an error by Fifa. More than firebrand however his reputation is for flamboyance. Last year he appeared on Turkey’s version of ‘The Voice’. In the Christmas edition of the talent show showing up as a guest contestant singing: Sari Cizmeli Mehmet Aga – a classic Turkist rock song. The 29-year-old midfield lapped up the applause and took the criticism of his dubious sining talents well. Turan (centre) surrounded by Ivan Rakitic (left), Luis Suarez (second right) and Sergio Busquetes (right) Neymar silences the Vicente Calderon after firing Barcelona 3-2 up  against Atletico  in the Copa del Rey . The panel of judges on Spanish FA’s disciplinary panel are likely to show far more mercy to the midfielder. There is far less retrospective punishment handed out in Spain than in England – the referee’s report tends to be final. In his report of Wednesday’s night’s game match referee Gil Manzano said that Turan had thrown his boot off the pitch in frustration and made no reference to the fact that it narrowly missed the linesman and also endangered the safety of a Vicente Calderon ball-boy. Just as Cristiano Ronaldo was only given a two-game ban for his red card, picked up last week against Cordoba for Real Madrid because the referee’s report did not mention him striking Jose Angel Crespo, so Turan will not have his yellow card bumped up to a red. Neither will Turan be disciplined by his own manager. The defeat to Barcelona on Wednesday was one long nightmare for Simeone who had two players sent off and one locked up pre-match when he argued with police and slammed one officer’s hand in his car. The coach wants to move on. Simeone will be relieved that Turan will not receive a ban and his yellow card will not be upgraded . Fernando Torres opened the scoring at the Vicente Calderon after just 40 seconds on Wednesday night . Arda Turan shaved his head two years ago after winning the Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu. He did in the dressing room immediately after the game and came out in to the mixed zone to show off his new lock to the waiting press. ‘I promised I would do it so I did,’ he said. Maybe his team-mates will ask him to promise not to throw anymore boots, what they wont ask him to do is ever change his slightly peculiar ways.","Atletico Madrid's Arda Turan threw his boot at a linesman on Tuesday night .

"McLaren’s much-heralded new partnership with Honda was ‘launched’ with all the gusto of a flat balloon – a 75-second video smuggled out on its website at noon on Thursday. It was accompanied by brave talk of ‘a new era’ and ‘making history’, but for a team famed for staging some of the most lavish launches in even Formula One’s decadent world, this online offering was shamefully tame. The video flashed from the old McLaren-Honda to the 2015 model, the MP4-30. The new car had a red streak up the sides and red wing mirrors, harking back to the chariots that took Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost to their title victories more than 20 years ago. McLaren released the first images of the car they hope will fire them to Formula One glory in 2015 . McLaren's 2015 challenger is the first to be powered by Honda in more than 20 years . The flashes of red on the bodywork are a throwback to the cars which Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost raced . Briton's Jenson Button and ex-Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso will form a new-look partnership at McLaren . Button was retained  at the end of 2014 while Alonso ended his stay with Ferrari to re-join McLaren . But it was a farcical ‘launch’ by the standards of McLaren, who previously employed the Spice Girls and Cirque du Soleil to accompany the unveiling of their cars. Even the timing of the ‘launch’ was kept secret. And their drivers, Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, were absent from the ‘launch’ video. McLaren-Honda are hoping to recreate their glory period of the late Eighties and early Nineties, when they won four drivers’ and four constructors’ championship and 44 races from 80 starts. To do so, Honda will have to make a better job of matching Mercedes’ engine than this launch did of representing a first-rank team. We will get the first indications of McLaren-Honda’s strength when testing starts in Jerez, Spain, on Sunday. The Spice Girls helped launch McLaren's 1997 challenge - pictured with Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard . The British girl group performed at Alexandra Palace in the build-up to the 1997 Formula One campaign . The team merely issued a press release containing quotes from management and the drivers. 'The off-season has really brought about a sense of renewal coming into 2015 – continuing my relationship with McLaren, getting married, and now embarking on such an exciting chapter: McLaren’s new partnership with Honda,' said Button. 'I’ve trained hard over the winter, and I’m absolutely itching to get going in the new McLaren-Honda MP4-30. 'It’s been interesting to spend time in the factory during the past few weeks: you can really sense a feeling of reignited optimism and positivity around the building. I’ve never seen such motivation amongst the guys – we’re all massively keen to get going in Jerez and to work hard on developing our new car. The splashes of red on this season's car are a throwback to McLaren's previous dominant spell with Honda . Ayrton Senna (pictured) and Alain Prost formed a formidable partnership with McLaren over 20 years ago . 'But we’re under no illusion that it will be easy – there’s a huge challenge ahead of us to try to pull back the gap to our rivals, but we’re certainly up for it. We ended last season with great momentum and clear progress, and I’m determined to carry that forward into 2015. 'I’m also looking forward to working with my new team-mate, Fernando [Alonso], and I’m confident that our joint experience on track will pay dividends in our development race to get our team back to the front of the grid. I’m hugely motivated to make more history in this new McLaren-Honda era.' Alonso, who re-joins the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007, added: 'Although the winter period is a time for rest and relaxation from racing, my motivation could not be stronger for the new season. 'I’ve done a lot of training during the winter break, to reach my peak physical fitness, and I’ve been working hard in preparation for this new era of McLaren-Honda. I’ve never felt better, or more ready for a new season. 'Of course, we’re prepared for a steep learning curve, but it’s clear to see that inside McLaren-Honda there’s total commitment, and a real change in feeling, as we start this new partnership. 'Our first target will be to learn the maximum from the car at the pre-season tests, understand the package, and extract as much performance as possible. That won’t be easy or trouble-free, but we’re ready for that. Why? Because our key focus will be on development. 'Historically, McLaren has already been characterised by its ability to bring updates to the car quickly, and develop a strong package. 'It’s going to be a real privilege to be the first person to drive the new McLaren-Honda MP4-30 at Jerez, and I can’t wait to begin what I’m certain will be a very exciting new chapter in my career. I’m as motivated now as I was when I was given my first opportunity at the wheel of an F1 car. 'Last but not least, I’m excited to be sitting alongside Jenson, a great team-mate and a very experienced competitor. Together we’ll push the team forward, to learn, to progress, and eventually to achieve the best possible results together. We are ready for the new era.'","McLaren released a 75-second video showcasing this season's car .

"Chelsea great Ron Harris and supporters chiefs have told fans to forget about Frank Lampard for 90 minutes on Saturday and back the Blues. Lampard, Chelsea's record goalscorer, returns to Stamford Bridge with Manchester City bidding to cut the five-point deficit to Jose Mourinho's men at the top of the Barclays Premier League standings. The 36-year-old spent 13 years at Chelsea and insisted he would never play for another Premier League club. Frank Lampard refuses to celebrate after scoring an equaliser for Man City against Chelsea in Setember . Lampard (right) puts his hand up as though apologising to Chelsea fans after his goal against his old club . Lampard left the Chelsea to join New York City, via a season-long spell at Chelsea's rivals Man City . So playing for City, on a one-season deal before moving to New York City FC in Major League Soccer, tarnishes his status in the eyes of some Chelsea fans. 'There will be some for him and some against,' Harris, Chelsea's record appearance holder with 795, said. 'They should support Chelsea. Frank's a terrific lad and served Chelsea ever so well. '(But) if he was to score the winning goal for Manchester City, it might blow up.' Didier Drogba, now in his second spell with Chelsea, was heralded by all sides of the ground when he returned with Galatasaray in the Champions League last season, but Lampard is unlikely to be afforded such a welcome. Lampard was spotted leaving popular Nobu restaurant with partner Christine Bleakley in London on Sunday . Chelsea fans supported Lampard when he played against Chelsea at the Etihad in September 2014 . Ron Harris, pictured sliding into tackle with George Best in 1971, urges Chelsea fans to forget about Lampard . Chelsea Supporters' Trust chair Tim Rolls said: 'I don't think anybody is going to boo him. Lampard is respected, but I think there's a frustration he said one thing and did another. 'Assuming he comes on as a substitute, he'll get applause and he might have a few chant his name, but I don't think it will be like Drogba. 'Life goes on. It doesn't particularly wind me up, but a number of supporters are wound up. 'If you fast forward 10 years, I don't think people will remember that. I think they'll remember the trophies he won and the goals he scored. Lampard (left) scored 211 goals in a Chelsea shirt before moving north to Manchester City . As Lampard prepares for Stamford Bridge return, Supporters' Trust chair expects him to get a good reception . 'Lampard is a sideshow really for Saturday. If Chelsea win we're eight points clear with 15 games to go. It's an absolutely fundamental game for our season. I'd hope the support will get behind the team.' Chelsea were on course to beat City at the Etihad Stadium in September until Lampard equalised with five minutes remaining. Rolls added: 'At Man City, when he came on, before he'd scored, he got a lot of support from Chelsea fans. My thought was we should be supporting the team, not an ex-player. 'He scored, City fans started chanting his name and some of our fans started chanting his name, during the match. That was a little bit strange.'","Chelsea welcome Manchester City to Stamford Bridge on Saturday .

"Former Scotland captain Andy Nicol has criticised Vern Cotter’s decision to leave experienced back- row forwards Kelly Brown and John Barclay out of his Six Nations squad — while including a player who has never played a first-team game for Edinburgh. The Scotland head coach on Tuesday defended his selection of New Zealand-born openside flanker Hugh Blake, one of four uncapped players from the capital club named in his 32-man squad ahead of next month’s opener in Paris. But Sportsmail columnist Nicol fears Brown and Barclay have been discriminated against because they play outside Scotland, while the likes of 22-year-old Blake, currently on trial at Edinburgh, has been fast-tracked ahead of them. Scotland manager Vern Cotter named  with four uncapped Edinburgh players in his Six Nations 32-man squad . Ben Toolis, in action for Edinburgh, has earned his first call-up for the Scotland national side . ‘We seem to be promoting players who have come in from New Zealand at the expense of John Barclay and Kelly Brown,’ said Nicol. ‘There are a number of players in the Scotland squad who play out the country but I think it’s very clear that your chances of playing are greatly heightened by playing for Edinburgh and Glasgow. ‘That might be the right thing to do, don’t get me wrong. I just think that, if you’re picking your best players for this Six Nations — and forget the World Cup, because if they’re good enough for the Six Nations, then you’re good enough for the World Cup — you pick your best players and I would have thought Kelly Brown and John Barclay in particular are two that would come in there.’ Cotter admitted he had only watched video analysis of Blake with the Highlanders of New Zealand and seen him live in one BT Premiership game with Melrose last weekend. Asked if that was enough evidence, he said: ‘That is probably where we back our instincts. There will probably be another loose forward included within the group later but let us see what he offers. Everything and everyone so far speaks positively for him.’ Saracens flanker Kelly Brown (left) was a surprise omission from Cotter's squad . Cotter’s fellow New Zealander, who only moved to Scotland in December and qualifies through his Scottish grandparents, is included with other new boys Sam Hidalgo-Clyne, Ben Toolis and Hamish Watson. ‘My gut feeling is he gives us something we don’t have, something a little bit different to what John (Barclay) does,’ said Cotter. ‘Hugh gives us a bit more speed, more turnovers and the way we want the team to play we need speed, and we need initiative. We need to be able to tackle, able to change the course of games.’ Meanwhile, Brown tweeted that he had not given up hope of adding to his 65 caps for Scotland. ‘I am clearly disappointed to miss out on selection but I’ll keep plugging away,’ said the former captain. ‘Greig (Laidlaw) and the boys have the potential to do something special.’","Vern Cotter included four uncapped players from Edinburgh in his squad .

"DANNY CIPRIANI . No English fly-half keeps defenders guessing quite like Cipriani. Be it a deft chip over the defence or an audacious dummy, he has the guts to try things that others won’t. His defence was called into question as a youngster, but a grounding experience with Sale has improved that area of his game. If Stuart Lancaster is looking to add spark with a second-half replacement, then Cipriani ticks all the boxes. Strength: Attacking spark . Weakness: Goal-kicking . Danny Cipriani will provide Stuart Lancaster's side with plenty of attacking spark . GEORGE FORD . Ford  is beginning to deliver on the potential that saw him named IRB Junior World Player of the Year in 2011. Alongside Cipriani, the 21-year-old is England’s second most attack-minded option, but is much more consistent. His spatial awareness and willingness to run at defenders creates chances. Kicking from hand is world class. Strengths: Goal-kicking, vision . Weakness: Inexperienced . George Ford is a strong goal-kicker, but the 21-year-old lacks experience at the top level . OWEN FARRELL . The Saracens youngster is very good at managing the game from outside-half, but he does not have attacking instincts of Ford and Cipriani. If England are planning to stick to rigid patterns and set-plays Farrell is an effective middle-man, who also brings a good goal-kicking rate when under pressure. Club form has been hit by injuries and Charlie Hodgson’s form. Strengths: Composure, defensive management . Weakness: Lack of spark .

"Tom Ince is closing in on a loan move to Derby County - but Hull City are asking for a fee of £300,000.

How many of us remember the 2000 final between Leicester and Tranmere in which the Foxes won 2-1? Matt Elliott scored twice to win it for Martin O’Neill’s side and it was actually a decent game. But interest in the competition had faded – the other semi-finalists had been Bolton and Aston Villa, no sign of the big boys, and that’s exactly how they wanted it. Arsenal exited to Middlesbrough that year with a team which included Tommy Black, Paolo Vernazza and Stefan Malz. Manchester United made an equally hasty departure at Villa, Michael Twiss, Michael Clegg and Ronnie Wallwork among the losing side. Even a decade on teams were rotated right through the competition. When United beat Villa in the final of 2010, Sir Alex Ferguson fielded what amounted to a second XI, Tomasz Kuszczak in goal and Michael Owen leading the line. But those days, it seems, have gone. The League Cup has been elevated in importance, capturing with it the imagination of supporters and the wider viewing public.

Chelsea won at Shrewsbury in the fourth round and included Gary Cahill, Andre Schurrle, Oscar and Didier Drogba, while Eden Hazard, Nemanja Matic and Willian were called on from the bench.

Rather, it is more the realisation that Wembley finals – and the joy they bring to players and supporters – are only open to four teams each season. Bigger clubs allowed themselves to be blinded by the Champions League – and, to an extent, still are – but it is almost as if the League Cup has offered light relief from the cash-driven chase for the continent’s premier prize. The dates help, too. Before fatigue kicks in post New Year, the competition has already found its last four teams. There was something exciting about the pre-Christmas round of quarter-final matches, the appeal of knock-out football amid the regularity of the league calendar and increasing irrelevance of the Champions League group phase.

"This remarkable series of pictures shows just how much life has changed in the streets of London surrounding the River Thames in the last 150 years. A unique series of photographs taken in the 1860s, using an early type of camera, showcase life in Victorian London for those living in the thriving and bustling streets next to the river. Landmarks Battersea Bridge, Cheyne Walk and Chelsea Physic Garden are easily spotted in the series of eight frames, set to go under the hammer at auction later this month, valued at around £500. Scroll down for video . Echoes of history: Chelsea Old Church on the corner of Old Church Street and the Embankment. The church was painstakingly rebuilt after a parachute landmine blew the tower over onto the church, destroying most of it, in the Blitz in April 1941. For nine years the congregation carried on  in a ward of the adjoining hospital. From 1950 onward the church was reopened bit by bit and  reconsecrated in May 1958 by the Lord Bishop of London in the presence of the Queen Mother . The church's chancel (space surrounding the altar) probably dates back to the 13th Century and there is believed to have been a church on this site ever since Christianity first came to England. The Chapel on the South was rebuilt in 1528, as his private Chapel, by Sir Thomas More, the renowned social philosopher. More moved to Chelsea in about 1520 and built himself a house on what is now Beaufort Street - researchers once believed his skull was hidden in his monument at the church . Bridging centuries: Battersea Bridge in 1860. The bridge was commissioned by John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer and first opened in 1771. The structure was poorly thought-out and boats found it hard to navigate underneath. There were a number of accidents including serious injuries and deaths and the bridge would regularly need repairs after being rammed by ships.  In 1879 the dangerous and maligned wooden structure was taken into public ownership, and demolished in 1885 . The original bridge, frequently hit by boats, was replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette. It is the narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames and, perhaps as a result, one of the least busiest. Oil lamps were added to the deck in 1799, making Battersea Bridge the first Thames bridge to be lit. The bridge briefly attained national prominence in January 2006 when a 19-foot long female bottlenose whale became stranded in the water close to it . The grainy sepia images contrast with pictures taken today in the exact same spots the original photographer stood. The skyline behind the old Battersea Bridge looks completely different to the new bridge, which was completed in 1890. While the land directly behind the old bridge appeared to be undeveloped, the new pictures show towering skyscrapers and the iconic Battersea Power Station chimneys, which are currently being pulled down. The Adam and Eve pub is pictured  with three large multi-paned square windows, balconies on all three levels and rickety steps leading down to the shore. The establishment was demolished to make way for the Chelsea Embankment. The pub was famously sketched by the American artist James Whistler, who adopted London as his home. This picture shows how the area was more socially and economically diverse in 1860.  In the background Chelsea Old Church is visible . Dirty origin: The Embankment was completed in 1874, planned by Joseph Bazalgette, who also designed Battersea Bridge.  It was part of the Metropolitan Board of Works' grand scheme to provide London with a modern sewage system and is considered one of the great engineering achievements of the age. In total, Bazalgette's scheme reclaimed 22 acres of land from the river using granite for the project, which was brought to London from Lamorna Cove in Cornwall . Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. It takes its name from William Lord Cheyne, an MP between 1681 until 1687. Most of the houses were built in the early 18th century and the houses used to front the River Thames until the construction of the Embankment. The trees in the picture above are seen today, albeit taller and thicker. The road's most prominent building is Carlyle Mansions, a block of flats built in 1886 and named after Scottish philosopher and writer Thomas Carlyle . The road is one of the most desirable places to live in London and house prices have soared in value over the past decade. It is situated in Chelsea, which has been an upmarket locale since at least 1694 and was once described as 'a village of palaces'. Famous residents who have lived on Cheyne Walk include former Prime Minister David Lloyd George, Rolling Stones guitarist Kieth Richards and lead singer Mick Jagger and esteemed novelist Vera Britain . April - The last major bare-knuckle boxing match in England . July - The Nightingale Training School and Home for Nurses, the first nursing school is opened at St Thomas' Hospital in London. August - The first street trams in Britain are introduced in Birkenhead in Merseyside. October - The first professional golf tournament is held at Prestwick in Scotland . November - The 'Temporary Home for Lost and Starving Dogs', what would become the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, is established in London by Mary Tealby . Novelist George Eliot spent the last three weeks of her life there. Mortimer Menpes, the watercolourist and etcher, shared a flat with fellow artist James Whistler. Henry James spent his last years at number 21. Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull lived at number 48 in 1968. Retail pioneer John Sainsbury lived at number 103. Painter Joseph Mallord William Turner died there in 1851. Crime writer Lionel Davidson lived at Carlyle Mansions from 1976 to 1984. A unique series of photographs taken in the 1860s, using an early type of camera, showcase life in what is now one of Britain’s most affluent areas. Pictured is Cheyne Walk, where men in top hats can be seen wandering along the dirty road which once lay on the bank on the river. The 150-year-old pictures form part of the Fine Arts and Antique Photography sale taking place at specialists Dominic Winters auction house in Cirencester, Gloucestershire . A two-bedroom house can sell for more than £8,300,000 in modern Cheyne Walk. Musician Mick Jagger, footballer George Best, actor Laurence Olivier, writer Henry James and architect Isambard Kingdom Brunel, as well as his father Sir Marc Brunel, who designed the Thames Tunnel, are all former residents of the street. In contrast to the photo taken in the 1860s, the street no longer sits next to the river thanks to the construction of Chelsea Embankment in 1874 . During the Victorian era, in Charles Dickens’ London, the cobbled streets are lined with small saplings, and paupers can be seen trying to scrape a living. But now, the trees are much bigger and the paved roads are populated by cars rather than horse-drawn carriages. The pictures form part of the Fine Arts and Antique Photography sale taking place at specialists Dominic Winters auction house in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. A spokesperson for the auctioneers said: 'It is a group of eight albumen print photographs, circa 1860s, including a two-part panorama of Battersea old bridge.'","Photographs taken in the 1860s show how the streets situated near the river have transformed over the years - or not .
