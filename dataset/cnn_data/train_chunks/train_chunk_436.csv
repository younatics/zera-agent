"(CNN) -- A state judge struck down Colorado's ban on same-sex marriage on Wednesday, but he prevented gay and lesbian couples from immediately marrying by staying his decision. ""The court holds that the marriage bans violate plaintiffs' due process and equal protection guarantees under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,"" Judge C. Scott Crabtree wrote. Crabtree also ruled that same-sex marriages performed out-of-state should be recognized in Colorado and that having ""civil unions"" instead of marriages ""is further evidence of discrimination against same-sex couples."" While the judge clearly came down in favor of allowing same-sex couples to marry, he did not give the go-ahead for such marriages to occur right away. His rationale is the ""final chapter of this undoubtedly has to be written in either Denver, Colorado, or Washington, DC"" and that ""it will take time for this issue to be finally resolved."" ""The court finds that a stay is necessary to avoid the instability and uncertainty which would result in the state of Colorado if the court did not stay its ruling and for the orderly administration of justice,"" said Crabtree, ordering his own judgment to be ""stayed pending a resolution of this matter on appeal."" Crabtree is the latest judge to rule same-sex marriage prohibitions -- like the one in Colorado's state constitution -- should not stand. Most of those rulings have come from federal judges in the year after the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark U.S. v. Windsor ruling. While these decisions have been one-sided in favor of gay and lesbian couples pushing for marriage on par with opposite-sex couples, most of them have been stayed as appeals work through the system. The U.S. Supreme Court hasn't decided when or, even, if it might consider whether same-sex marriage bans in individual states should be allowed.

"He's one of the fieriest political activists in Hong Kong — he's been called an ""extremist"" by China's state-run media — and he's not even old enough to drive. Meet 17-year-old Joshua Wong, a skinny, bespectacled teen whose meager physical frame belies the ferocity of his politics. Over the last two years, the student has built a pro-democracy youth movement in Hong Kong that one veteran Chinese dissident says is just as significant as the student protests at Tiananmen, 25 years ago. Echoing the young campaigners who flooded Beijing's central square in 1989, the teen activist wants to ignite a wave of civil disobedience among Hong Kong's students. His goal? To pressure China into giving Hong Kong full universal suffrage. Wong's movement builds on years of pent-up frustration in Hong Kong. When the former colony of the United Kingdom was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries struck an agreement promising Hong Kong a ""high degree of autonomy,"" including the democratic election of its own leader. But 17 years later, little resembling genuine democracy has materialized. China's latest proposal suggests Hong Kongers may vote for their next leader, but only if the candidates are approved by Beijing. Wong is bent on fighting the proposal — and impatient to win. ""I don't think our battle is going to be very long,"" he tells CNN. ""If you have the mentality that striving for democracy is a long, drawn-out war and you take it slowly, you will never achieve it. ""You have to see every battle as possibly the final battle — only then will you have the determination to fight."" Youth awakening . Doubt him if you like, but the young activist already has a successful track record of opposition. In 2011, Wong, then 15, became disgusted with a proposal to introduce patriotic, pro-Communist ""National and Moral Education"" into Hong Kong's public schools. With the help of a few friends, Wong started a student protest group called Scholarism. The movement swelled beyond his wildest dreams: In September 2012, Scholarism successfully rallied 120,000 protesters — including 13 young hunger strikers — to occupy the Hong Kong government headquarters, forcing the city's beleaguered leaders to withdraw the proposed curriculum. That was when Wong realized that Hong Kong's youth held significant power. ""Five years ago, it was inconceivable that Hong Kong students would care about politics at all,"" he says. ""But there was an awakening when the national education issue happened. We all started to care about politics."" Asked what he considers to be the biggest threats to the city, he rattles them off: From declining press freedom as news outlets change their reporting to reflect a pro-Beijing slant, to ""nepotism"" as Beijing-friendly politicians win top posts, the 17-year-old student says Hong Kong is quickly becoming ""no different than any other Chinese city under central administration."" That's why Wong has set his eyes on achieving universal suffrage. His group, which now has around 300 student members, has become one of the city's most vocal voices for democracy. And the kids are being taken seriously. In June, Scholarism drafted a plan to reform Hong Kong's election system, which won the support of nearly one-third of voters in an unofficial citywide referendum. In July, the group staged a mass sit-in which drew a warning from China's vice president not to disrupt the ""stability"" of the city. In the end, 511 people were briefly arrested. This week, the group is mobilizing students to walk out of classes — a significant move in a city that reveres education — to send a pro-democracy message to Beijing. The student strike has received widespread support. College administrators and faculty have pledged leniency on students who skip classes, and Hong Kong's largest teacher union has circulated a petition declaring ""Don't let striking students stand alone."" China's reaction has been the opposite: Scholarism has been named a group of ""extremists"" in the mainland's state-run media. Wong also says he is mentioned by name in China's Blue Paper on National Security, which identifies internal threats to the stability of Communist Party rule. But the teenage activist won't back down. ""People should not be afraid of their government,"" he says, quoting the movie ""V for Vendetta,"" ""The government should be afraid of their people."" Hong Kong a ""seed of fire"" for China . Compared to activists in Hong Kong, activists in mainland China face a situation far more grim. Few understand this better than veteran human rights activist Hu Jia, 41. A teenage participant in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, he remembers witnessing the carnage in the aftermath of Chinese government's crackdown. ""At the age of 15, it made me understand my responsibility and my mission in life,"" he tells CNN in a phone call from Beijing. ""The crackdown made a clear cut between myself and the system."" Tiananmen protester: I was willing to die . Inspired to fight for change, in 2000 he worked to expose ""AIDS villages"" in central China, where unregulated blood trades were infecting entire rural towns with HIV. But he paid a price: authorities jailed him for three and a half years for ""inciting subversion of state authority,"" then placed him under frequent house arrest, where he remains today. ""Fear has been deeply rooted in our genes through the past 65 years,"" he says. ""The majority of China's 1.3 billion people are not true citizens — most of the people are simply submissive."" That's why Hu thinks Hong Kong, with its relative freedom, is a perfect place for activists to spark a democracy movement that could sweep all of mainland China. ""You can form political parties in Hong Kong.  You can publish books that are forbidden in mainland China.  The media can criticize the central government and the chief executive of Hong Kong. ""Mainland China is a tinderbox that's been physically suppressed by the authorities, and Hong Kong is a seed of fire. ""The Communist Party is very scared of this tiny bit of land, because if true universal suffrage can blossom in Hong Kong, it is very likely true universal suffrage will end up happening in the mainland."" It's a dream that Wong acknowledges. ""I can't say we students striving for democracy now will directly lead to universal suffrage in China,"" he says. ""But at least, universal suffrage in Hong Kong could be a pilot for the people in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, and even the whole of China — it would let them know that a Chinese society under the rule of a Communist Party can still have a fair system."" Because of the high stakes involved with challenging China, Hu says Hong Kong's activists should prepare for the worst. ""Maybe the Chinese government will one day send troops onto the streets, or even tanks,"" Hu says, though adding the possibility of the military actually opening fire would be ""very small."" More likely, says the elder activist, the Party might go after individuals like Wong himself. ""Joshua Wong could be arrested, or jailed,"" Hu tells CNN. ""I hope he understands this will be a battle of resilience. It is not a fight, nor a skirmish, it is a true war, in terms of the length of time it involves, its complexity, and the potential sacrifice it might involve.""

"Blues legend B.B. King was forced to cancel the remainder of his current tour after falling ill following a October 3 show at Chicago's House of Blues. The 89-year-old Rock and Roll Hall of Famer had eight gigs left on his current trek, including stops at his namesake B.B. King Blues Club in New York. B.B. King is friends with everybody . ""[King] was immediately evaluated by a doctor and diagnosed with dehydration and suffering from exhaustion whereby causing the eight remaining shows of his current tour to be canceled,"" King's official site posted. No other details about King's condition were revealed. As EW's The Music Mix points out, King gave a shaky performance in St. Louis in April 2014, with the concert being so erratic that the blues great's reps issued a statement apologizing following the gig. ""The combination of the rigors of the very long drive and high blood sugar due to his medication error resulted in a performance that did not match Mr. King's usual standard of excellence,"" the statement read. King suffers from Type II diabetes, a condition he's lived with for two decades. Bono talks to B.B. King in exclusive clip . Guitarist Hamish Anderson, whose band was serving as King's opening act during the trek, tweeted, ""Very sad to hear the news of BB King's sickness and subsequent cancellation of the tour. The band and I wish him a safe speedy recovery!"" According to King's official site, the guitarist does not have any more dates scheduled for the rest of 2014. In November 2013, the ever-touring King canceled an Oklahoma City concert but that was due to unsafe conditions on the roads into the city. See the original story at RollingStone.com.","B.B.

"Three inmates who escaped from a rural Alabama jail over the weekend are now all back in custody, authorities said. Armed robbery suspect Justin Terrell Gordon was captured about 100 miles north of the Choctaw County jail on Saturday evening after breaking out along with cellmates Gemayel Culbert and Demarcus Woodward, according to Sheriff Tom Abate. Culbert, who was being held on capital murder charges, was captured Sunday in Sumter County, about 50 miles from the jail. Authorities found Woodward, 23, who is accused of killing a work release inmate, early Monday in Tuscaloosa. The three were locked down together in a single cell around 2 a.m. Saturday when one started screaming, saying another of them was very sick, Abate said. The jailer looked through a porthole, saw someone vomiting, then opened the cell door. When he did, the inmates jumped the jailer, stole his keys and cellphone, and fled on foot, according to Abate. Local authorities using tracking dogs tracked the escaped inmates about a quarter of a mile down state Highway 17 in Butler, Alabama, where Abate said they were either picked up or had a vehicle waiting for them. Alabama's State Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service in Mobile and local authorities all had roles in the manhunt. Abate said the jailer, who was choked, was treated and released at an area hospital Saturday morning. Choctaw County, with population of fewer than 14,000, is on the western edge of Alabama, about 100 miles north of Mobile.","All the escapees were captured separately on Saturday, Sunday and Monday .

"Mourning three Israeli teenagers at their funeral Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised his nation will avenge their deaths at ""the hands of evil men"" and show its strength in the process. ""Throughout the history of our people, we have proved time and again -- in view of the horrors that we have experienced, the grief and sorrow -- the force of life that pulsates within us overcomes the forces of death,"" he said in Hebrew, according to a CNN translation. The Israeli leader lamented the killings of the three ""gifted, pure, honest and decent teens,"" bloodshed that he said shows ""a broad moral gulf (that) separates us from our enemies."" ""They sanctify death, we sanctify life,"" Netanyahu said, comparing the teens to those who killed them. ""They sanctify cruelty, and we mercy and compassion. That is the secret of our strength."" A short time later -- after the burials of Eyal Yifrach, 19; Gilad Shaar, 16; and Naftali Frankel, a 16-year-old dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, by each other in Modiin -- the Prime Minister spoke again about the three before a security cabinet meeting, saying, ""May God avenge their blood."" ""Whoever was involved in the kidnapping and the murder will bear the consequences,"" Netanyahu said Tuesday evening. ""We will neither rest nor slacken until we reach the last of them. And It does not matter where they will try to hide."" These actions are well underway. The Israeli leader noted that, already, hundreds of Hamas activists have been arrested, dozens of institutions in Gaza have closed and homes have been demolished. This is along with stepped-up airstrikes in Gaza -- Palestinian land controlled by Hamas, a militant Islamic organization that denied it is behind the abductions. The Israeli military said it launched 34 strikes targeting terror infrastructure targets since Sunday evening in response to 18 rockets from Gaza. The Palestinian Cabinet on Tuesday claimed 12 Palestinians have been killed since the military operation to find the teens began June 13; it did not identify them by name, nor detail how or when they died. CNN reported earlier, citing Palestinian medical sources, that at least one man died from a heart attack during a raid on his West Bank home last month; at least five were killed in clashes with the Israeli military; and two men accused by the Israeli military of being involved in recent rocket attacks were killed in an airstrike last week in Gaza. Addressing ""all of those who are ... happy at our sadness,"" Israeli President Shimon Peres warned at Tuesday's funeral, ""Terror is a boomerang."" ""I know that we will eventually get our hands on the murderers,"" Peres said, ""and they will be punished."" Israeli leader: 'Hamas will pay' The bodies of Yifrach, Shaar and Frankel were found Monday, nearly three weeks after their abduction while hitchhiking home from school in the West Bank. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the Fatah party and is based in the West Bank, has condemned the abductions, even as the Palestinian Cabinet has criticized what it calls ""Israel's illegal measures"" in response. Yet Mark Negev, a spokesman for Netanyahu, suggested Monday that Abbas' Palestinian Authority bears some responsibility for what happened because ""the terrorists came from areas under Palestinian Authority control and returned to territories under Palestinian Authority control."" Still, while Abbas and the Palestinian Authority are clearly feeling the pressure, it's nothing compared to that facing Hamas Just listen to Netanyahu on Tuesday evening: ""Hamas is responsible. Hamas will pay, and Hamas will continue to pay."" The Israel Defense Forces named two men -- Marwan Kawasme and Omar Abu Aysha -- as the ""Hamas terrorists who kidnapped"" the boys. Their West Bank homes were destroyed overnight. Palestinian news agency Ma'an reported Tuesday that a little-known group called Ansar as-Dawla al-Islamiya (Supporters of the Islamic State) had claimed responsibility for the killings and threatened to ""slaughter"" the Palestinian Authority. CNN could not independently verify the claim. Hamas has made no such claim. Still, as it bears the brunt of the retaliation, the group warned that if Netanyahu ""brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him."" Obama: Israel, Palestinian Authority should work together . The teens' kidnappings and killings -- as well as the Israeli response -- have spurred strong reactions well outside the Middle East, including among U.S. politicians, New York's mayor and the Vatican. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch, for instance, said the killings ""would amount to a war crime if committed by an armed group"" even as it urged Israel to avoid ""collective punishment."" British Prime Minister David Cameron has called the teens' deaths ""an appalling and inexcusable act of terror."" U.S. President Barack Obama similarly condemned what he called a ""senseless act of terror against innocent youth."" He reiterated ""our full support to Israel and the Palestinian Authority to find the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice."" ""And I encourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to continue working together in that effort,"" Obama said. ""I also urge all parties to refrain from steps that could further destabilize the situation.""

"An international operation led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement aimed at child pornography and sexual abuse has resulted in the arrest of 245 suspects, officials announced Thursday.  All but 23 of the suspects were apprehended in the United States. The agency said that during the course of Operation Sunflower, law enforcement officers identified 123 victims of child exploitation and removed 44 of those children from their alleged abusers with whom they were living. The other cases involved victims who were exploited by people outside their homes or children who were harmed years ago and are now adults. Several of the children were shockingly young. Five were under age 3. Nine were between the ages of 4 and 6.  Of the 123 victims, 110 lived in the United States in 19 different states.  ICE officials did not identify the six other countries where victims were identified or where some of the arrests were made, citing the need to work discreetly with international law enforcement partners. According to ICE, some of those arrested during Operation Sunflower were registered sex offenders. Operation Sunflower was conducted in November and December, but efforts are continuing on other cases.  During a news conference, ICE Director John Morton said the agency was calling on the public to provide tips and mentioned several open investigations.  One of those cases involves the sexual molestation of an unidentified girl thought to be around 13. Investigators believe the abuse took place about 11 years ago, but the pornographic images were widely circulated.  ICE has posted pictures of an unidentified woman and man suspected of abusing the girl on its website. The woman has some distinctive tattoos that investigators hope will lead to tips about her identity. Based on a forensic analysis of the pornographic images in that case, investigators think the abuse occurred in the Los Angeles or San Fernando Valley area of California.  Although the girl may now be an adult, ICE officials want to identify and prosecute the suspects and prevent them from harming new victims. ""Forensic analysis technology has become critical in the fight against child exploitation,"" Morton said. ""We are coming across these images on the Internet. They are being produced in one country but shared literally around the world, often in real time."" Morton said ICE works with other law enforcement agencies and with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to look for clues in the pictures of abuse to identify where the acts occurred and track down the victims and perpetrators. The name Operation Sunflower was chosen to commemorate a case from 2011 in which Danish law enforcement officials shared images and chat board information about a 16-year-old boy who allegedly planned to rape an 11-year-old girl.  One image taken from a moving car showed a road sign with a sunflower on it. ICE's Homeland Security Investigations determined that the road sign was unique to Kansas.  Agents were then able to find the exact stretch of road where the picture was taken and to locate the girl. 18 rescued in child pornography raids, feds say . 3 Mexican brothers extradited to U.S. to face 25 counts linked to sex trafficking .","Immigration agency's ""Operation Sunflower"" identified 123 child victims of pornography, abuse .

"The winter sun was low in the sky on Nice's Promenade des Anglais when the $650,000 Ferrari Enzo driven by Suleiman Kerimov skidded into a tree and burst into flames. The Kremlin-connected tycoon and his passenger -- glamorous Russian TV anchor Tina Kandelaki -- were pulled out of the wreckage by passersby. Kerimov was badly burned and in critical condition. Barely alive, he was flown by helicopter to a hospital in nearby Marseilles and placed in intensive care. The year was 2006 and that November had brought stormy skies to the French Riviera, a known playground for Europe's jet-setting elite. Kerimov survived but the incident left senior staffers at Barclays -- a bank which does business with some of Russia's richest individuals and their companies -- deeply unsettled. Now, as Barclays' investment banking practices come under the spotlight with inquiries into its rigging of Libor, the Kerimov episode provides echoes from the past. Warnings to staff . Soon after the oligarch's accident Hans-Joerg Rudloff, chairman of the firm's Barclays Capital -- or BarCap -- unit and its main powerbroker for Russia, put in a call to Kerimov's right-hand man Allen Vine. He wanted an update on the magnate's health. The next day, around 25 staff working on Russian deals at BarCap's Canary Wharf office in London were summoned to a meeting. One banker present recalls Rudloff using the Kerimov case as an example of why employees should ensure they conduct appropriate due diligence on clients. The banker did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the talks. ""Ask yourselves,"" that banker says Rudloff told them. ""Who are these people? Where does their money come from? And where is it held in the event they pass away?"" Barclays declined to provide details of its dealings with Kerimov or its lending to Russians as a whole, for reasons of confidentiality. Emails and calls to the magnate's Millennium Group went unanswered. Soon after the Kerimov affair Rudloff spoke with Jerry del Missier, then BarCap president and future chief operating officer for the Barclays group. Del Missier's team was ordered to minimize risks by cutting the value of the bank's equity swaps with Russian counterparties. Barclay's Russian links . Kerimov -- branded the ""secret oligarch"" by the Financial Times -- was born in Dagestan, a republic in Russia's North Caucasus. Two decades of heavy borrowing and investing in Russian blue chips have helped the 46-year-old to chart a course from the factory floor to the Forbes rich list. Latest estimates put his fortune at $6.5 billion. Oligarchs like Kerimov often obtain access to such leverage by pledging shares as collateral. The returns on such business -- called margin lending -- can be tantalizingly lucrative, but dangerous in default. Barclays would not say whether it had entered into such transactions with Kerimov or other oligarchs but a person familiar with the matter said the activity was commonplace for a top-tier investment bank. Barclays Capital: Loss and scandal . Martin Taylor was Barclays' chief executive back in 1998, the year Russia couldn't pay back its debts. Taylor, writing in the Financial Times this month, revealed BarCap traders had built up a large, unauthorized exposure to the country's bond markets, incurring the bank substantial losses and making the firm look ""reckless"" in the eyes of regulators. Barclays declined to comment on Taylor's statement when contacted by CNN but the company's annual report for the year shows BarCap swung to a £265 million loss ($414 million) from a profit of £252 million ($394 million) the year before. The publication cited the Russian economic crisis for the shortfall. Taylor said he spoke up now because of ""striking parallels"" between that event and the bank's recent ""lowballing'"" of Libor -- a key benchmark interest rate upon which trillions of dollars of financial contracts are priced. Barclays, whose admission to the Libor manipulation earned it a record $453 million penalty, took out advertisements in the British press this week to reassure people it was ""truly sorry for what has happened."" In the message, outgoing chairman Marcus Agius promised the organization would not allow itself to be ""distracted from what really matters -- delivering for [customers and clients]."" From Russia with risk . When Barclays got burned on Russia fourteen years ago Bob Diamond was running the BarCap unit -- a job he held until being promoted to group chief executive in 2011. Taylor, who has long since left the company, says he wished he had fired Diamond when he had the opportunity,  but was swayed by the latter's insistence he was unaware of the wrongdoing. Besides, the American swore he ""loved Barclays,"" a defense repeated twice by the 60-year-old this month during his testimony to a parliamentary committee. Diamond resigned this July on the same day as del Missier saying the external pressure placed on the bank had ""reached a level that risks damaging the franchise."" A spokesman for Diamond declined to comment on Taylor's remarks. Fast cars and football clubs . Kerimov is unlikely to be the only client to have given Barclays cause for reflection. But he symbolizes its close ties with Russia and the relationship sheds light on the intensely private world of Barclays' investment arm at a time when such banks -- which also manage consumer savings -- are under pressure to be more transparent. Those ties reach to the top of the organization; Rudloff, for example, acts as vice-chair of Russia's state controlled oil giant Rosneft alongside his chairmanship of BarCap. At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, when other British banks like Royal Bank of Scotland had to accept government bailouts, Barclays turned to the emerging markets for funds. Among the institutions it approached was Kremlin-controlled Sberbank, according to the banker. Instead it sold a stake to sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf states of Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Kerimov, a non-English speaker who avoids the limelight, surfaced on the international stage last year when his Dagestani soccer team bought former Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o for a reported $30 million, cementing his oligarch status alongside the likes of Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and Arsenal's Alisher Usmanov. Off the pitch, Kerimov also plays a high-stakes game. His holdings -- past and present -- in some of the world's largest companies, like Gazprom and Goldman Sachs, have seen him make and lose billions at a time, only to resurface rich once more thanks to his propensity to convince banks to extend him credit. In 2008 alone, the father of three's net worth plummeted from $14.4 billion to just $3.1 billion, according to Forbes. Four years later his fortune had doubled again. At one point Barclays even tried to tap Kerimov for money by encouraging the oligarch to buy into a placement of its shares offered to fifty select parties, according to another banker with knowledge of the issue. That individual says Kerimov did not make the purchase, though Barclays' pitch exemplifies the close links its top personnel enjoy with some of the world's wealthiest and least-known people. Tendency to push the limits . This week  Adair Turner, head of the UK's Financial Services authority, told British parliamentarians that Barclays had a ""cultural tendency to be always pushing the limits."" That tendency, it seems, has been there for some time. Taylor stood down from the top job at Barclays in 1998, after clashing with the board over the ""risk shadow,"" he says BarCap was exerting on the rest of the enterprise. A decade later a UK government-commissioned report -- partially written by Taylor - formally recommended banks separate their retail and investment divisions. But for all the theory, Barclays' detractors have yet to acknowledge that the bank's riskier division provides the bulk of the firm's profit. Without the cash it generates the company's balance sheet would look very different. Diamond, was once described by Britain's former trade secretary, Peter Mandelson, as the ""unacceptable face of banking"" for his generous pay packets and unapologetic stance after the credit crunch. He turned Barclays into the one of the most successful financial institutions in the UK and part of that plan involved bringing in Rudloff to build up its capital markets - or client funding - operations and target prospects such as Kerimov. Bereft of its investment banking veterans like Diamond and del Missier and with its top management in turmoil, the challenge for Barclays' new guard will be to balance its legacy as a trusted, household name with the febrile hunt for returns -- be they in Russia or elsewhere.","The 2006 crash of a Ferrari prompted Barclays to reassess its Russian exposure .

"The United States has promised to supply weapons, communications equipment and training to rebels in Syria so they can help battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS.) Now comes the hard part: identifying ""acceptable"" groups able and willing to take the fight to ISIS. The security landscape in Syria changes daily. Alliances and priorities among the many rebel groups shift, fortunes ebb and flow.  And the hard truth is that none of them appears able to uproot ISIS from its strongholds in north-eastern Syria. Joshua Landis, a veteran Syria-watcher and Associate Professor at the University of Oklahoma, says the situation inside Syria is more fluid and unpredictable than ever, with rebel groups confused about U.S. intentions and knocked sideways by ISIS' ruthless advance. Landis says President Barack Obama is the reluctant warrior -- forced by domestic politics and the outrage over the beheading of two Americans by ISIS to pledge not just to degrade but to destroy ISIS. That means going after its Syrian heartland -- and without American ""boots on the ground"" mobilizing Syrian rebel groups to help. But as the President admitted last month to the New York Times when talking about moderate Syrian groups: ""There's not as much capacity as you would hope."" White House spokesman Josh Earnest has tried to put a more optimistic spin on the situation, asserting last week that ""over the course of the last three years, the United States has gotten much greater clarity about which individuals in the region we can rely on and count on and work with, and which individuals, frankly, that we can't."" Many moderate factions have been squeezed out or self-destructed in a morass of corruption, incompetence and dissent. A columnist for Al-Monitor who writes from Aleppo under the pseudonym Edward Dark says ""the stigma of corruption and ineptitude permeates most of the Syrian rebel factions designated as 'moderates,' and some have even been involved outright in serious war crimes."" That corruption and incompetence have eased ISIS' path among civilians in some areas -- as it has delivered security, fuel and bread -- and led some fighters of the Free Syrian Army (Washington's preferred partner) to migrate to Islamist groups. Writing on the Syria Comment, Matt Stevens says he found a consensus among Syrian refugees he met in Jordan: that the FSA was ""scattered, under-resourced, devoid of unity—and increasingly, bit players in a drama between two unthinkable antagonists."" Those antagonists are President al-Assad and ISIS. The twin threats from ISIS and the Assad regime have made for a network of unlikely local alliances -- just to make the situation even more complicated.  Moderate groups have reached understandings with the al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al Nusra and the radical Islamic Front. Last week there were even reports of a brief truce between an FSA brigade and ISIS near Damascus in an effort to stave off regime advances. That makes the illicit transfer of weapons and men more likely. What's more, some senior figures among rebel groups say they will use the training and equipment they get against the Assad regime before they turn it on ISIS. The founder of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al Asaad, said his forces wouldn't battle ISIS until he had assurances of western help to oust the regime. But that would draw the U.S. and its allies deeper into a civil war which they see as an unwinnable quagmire. One man who might benefit from Washington's new plan is Jamal Maarouf, commander of the Syrian Revolutionary Front, which was formed to oppose ISIS in northern Syria. This month, Maarouf has committed substantial manpower to confronting ISIS in the Aleppo countryside. He has proved a capable commander but the number of fighters he can command is variously estimated at between 6,000 and 25,000. And many analysts regard Maarouf as an opportunist. He has been open about fighting alongside al Qaeda affiliate al Nusra as circumstances have demanded, telling the British newspaper the Independent in April: ""It's clear that I'm not fighting against al Qaeda. This is a problem outside of Syria's border, so it's not our problem."" There is also the issue of 'life expectancy' among rebel leaders. Maarouf claimed last week he had escaped assassination attempts by both the regime and ISIS, one of which killed his daughter. Until recently Ahrar al Sham -- an Islamist group focused on the battle against al-Assad and hostile to ISIS -- was one of the most effective rebel factions. Then a mysterious explosion in the city of Idlib earlier this month killed its leader, Hassan Aboud, and most its senior officials. Some sources blamed the regime; others ISIS, which has in the past targeted the leaders of rival groups. Landis says Abboud was a wily operator and a ""super-leader"" among Syrian rebel factions, and the group's future is very much open to question. Aron Lund of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace summed up the scale of the loss. Ahrar al Sham has been ""the missing link between radical Salafi-jihadism and the type of mainstream and Syrian nationalism-infused Islamists that Western and Gulf state powers preferred to work with -- a powerful ""swing voter"" in the struggle over the ideological direction of Syria's insurgency."" Counter-balance to ISIS . There are also grave doubts over the future of al Qaeda's affiliate al Nusra, which until last year was arguably the Assad regime's most capable opponent. Landis says ISIS has made al Nusra ""look just like any other militia,"" driving it out of Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria and Aleppo. It has also been riven by internal dissent. Al Nusra is still a serious player in many theaters -- especially the south and in the province of Idlib, but Lund says one Nusra commander has allegedly admitted that ""in several provinces, his organization is in an advanced stage of decay due to defections, financial difficulties, and flagging morale"" as fighters have tired of the fratricidal war against ISIS. Normally this would be good news for the U.S. and its western allies, but in the short-term at least al Nusra's survival provides an important counter-balance to ISIS. Landis says it could bounce back quickly ""if ISIS is whacked"" by the U.S. -- but that's unlikely to be the desired consequence. Over the past few days, ISIS has again shown its resilience and reach. It has mounted complex suicide attacks in Baghdad, continued to keep up the pressure on beleaguered rebel groups in Aleppo and embarked on a lightning offensive against Kurdish areas in Syria --- driving as many as 130,000 people across the border into Turkey. The Kurds had been more successful than most groups in resisting ISIS in Syria. In recent weeks, the Kurdish Front -- Jabhat al Akrad -- had begun co-operating with other rebel groups in the face of the common threat from ISIS, forming a joint operations room and claiming responsibility for attacks on ISIS, according to Joseph Sax at the Institute for the Study of War. That may have prompted the ISIS onslaught; now those Kurds left in northern Syria are fighting for their survival. And they will get no help from the U.S. or Turkey, says Landis, because of their close relationship with Turkish brethren in the PKK -- which is regarded as a terrorist group in Washington and Ankara. Surveying this grim landscape, one could be excused for wondering how vetting and training rebel fighters -- 5,000 to start with -- can turn the tide. Landis says 5,000 -- properly armed, disciplined and provided with intelligence could dent either ISIS or the Assad regime. ""Assad is very weak, after four years of war,"" he says, ""but at the moment the others are all weaker."" The rosiest scenario, says Landis, sees moderate Sunni groups eventually carving out a state in northern Syria, expelling ISIS in the process, while the regime holds onto Damascus and a swathe of the coast around Latakia. But Syria has a habit of confounding all but the grimmest of scenarios, and Landis acknowledges that ""perpetual anarchy"" seems more likely. There is another pitfall in fuelling the conflict with more weapons: escalating fighting could drive even more Syrians across the border, further destabilizing Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The U.S. has consistently sought to contain the Syrian conflict; ISIS would like nothing better than to export it.","U.S. has promised to supply and train ""acceptable"" rebels in Syria .
At best, analysts say the plan could cement Bashar al-Assad's grip on power .

"A 60-foot-wide sinkhole formed under a resort in central Florida late Sunday, forcing guests out of their rooms as one three-story building collapsed and another slowly sank. Guests at the Summer Bay Resort in Clermont, about 10 minutes from Walt Disney World, called for help before the collapse, saying they heard loud noises and windows cracking. All guests inside the buildings -- an estimated 35 people, authorities said --  were evacuated before the first structure crumbled. Sinkhole eating family out of house and home . A roughly 15-foot-deep crater swallowed much of one building, Lake County Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Tony Cuellar said.  Aerial video from CNN affiliate WFTV showed one end of the building -- which had held two-bedroom, two-bathroom villas -- still standing, but the rest reduced to a pile of debris. The evacuation started after 10:30 p.m., when a guest told a security guard about a ""window blowing out,"" said resort president Paul Caldwell. After another window broke in the guard's presence, the guard called a co-worker and, together, they got everybody out. ""He estimated, I think, about 40 minutes after everyone was evacuated, the big fall came,"" Caldwell said about the first guard. ""His quick thinking, in my opinion, saved lives, or limbs, or injuries,"" he said. No injuries were reported. A couple and their infant escaped through a window because a door frame had collapsed, witness Maggie Ghamry told WFTV. ""He, his wife and an infant, he had to break the window so they could escape,"" Ghamry told WFTV. ""There were windows breaking everywhere. ""One woman was sitting in the tub, and the tub levitated, and that's when she just grabbed a pair of shorts and came out with nothing."" CNN affiliate WFTV: Buildings damaged . That woman wasn't the only one to leave belongings behind. Other guests left keys and bags in their rooms, and it wasn't clear Monday whether guests would be able to get items back from parts of the collapsed building, Caldwell said. The resort has made other rooms available to all of the affected guests. ""Those items ... to be very bluntly, realistic -- may never be retrieved,"" Caldwell said. ""They are not going to let us in there to go get stuff for people."" Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . Florida is notorious for mammoth sinkholes. In February, a sinkhole opened beneath a suburban Tampa home, swallowing 36-year-old Jeff Bush from his bedroom. Bush's body was never recovered.

"Hundreds of demonstrators, including prominent lawmakers, were arrested at a peaceful sit-in in Hong Kong early Wednesday, following a huge rally calling for democracy in the Chinese territory. Large crowds had turned out for a 5 km march through the city's central business district Tuesday, in a massive show of defiance against Beijing's vision for the city's political future. Police said 98,600 people took part in the march, while organizers said 510,000 participated. Statisticians from the University of Hong Kong estimated the turnout as between 154,000 and 172,000. At the end of the rally, student activist groups held illegal sit-ins at two locations, at Chater Road in the heart of the business district, and outside the office of Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying. Police said 511 people were arrested at the Chater Road sit-in for unauthorized assembly and obstructing police officers. Among those arrested were pro-democracy lawmakers Albert Ho and Lee Cheuk-yan, their staff told CNN. At about 3 a.m., police officers began arresting demonstrators at the Chater Road site, telling those present to disperse or face prosecution. Buses were brought in to transport protesters away, and arrests continued through the night, police said. Joshua Wong, the 17-year-old co-founder of Scholarism, one of the student groups behind the sit-ins, said the demonstrations were a success. ""We were able to show that peaceful, non-violent protest is possible,"" he told CNN. ""We did not engage in any verbal or physical conflict with the police."" Amnesty International described the arrests as ""disturbing"" and called for the immediate and unconditional release of the protesters. ""This was not an illegal assembly; it was a peaceful and legitimate protest under international law,"" said Mabel Au, director of Amnesty International Hong Kong. ""The police action was hasty and unnecessary and sets a disturbing precedent."" 'Last resort' Pro-democracy protests on July 1 -- the anniversary of the 1997 handover of the former British colony to China -- are an annual event in Hong Kong. But public anger over a recently published Chinese ""white paper"" declaring Beijing's ""comprehensive jurisdiction"" over the territory, released amid a campaign by pro-democracy activists for universal suffrage, drew a larger than usual turnout. READ MORE: Hong Kong politics -- an explainer . Marchers gathered in Victoria Park before setting out along the protest route through the downtown business district, amid sweltering temperatures and sporadic heavy rain showers. Posters of the controversial Beijing white paper, which stressed that Hong Kong does not have ""full autonomy"" and comes under Beijing's control, were taped to the ground along the protest route for marchers to trample underfoot. At one point along the route, a protester flogged a giant model of the white paper with a whip. ""This is our last resort. If we don't say anything, then Hong Kong will turn into a Chinese city,"" said a 50-year-old protester, who like many on the march, was not comfortable giving her full name. A 36-year old teacher was marching with his wife and two young children. ""I want them to grow up in a society in which we can freely express ourselves,"" he told CNN. Johnson Yeung Ching-yin, convener of the Civil Human Rights Front, the organizers of the rally, said it was a pivotal moment for political reform in Hong Kong. ""If we want real democracy right now, then this rally is very significant,"" he said. ""We can show the world and show the central government that Hong Kong people want democracy so badly and we will fight for it at all costs."" Lawmaker Cyd Ho Sau-lan said that the march was necessary to send a message to Beijing. ""The Hong Kong government is only a puppet of the central government,"" she told CNN. ""We must pressure the central government, and tell them not to ignore the will of the Hong Kong people."" 'One country, two systems' Under the ""one country, two systems"" policy, the seven million residents of Hong Kong -- defined as a ""Special Administrative Region"" of China -- are afforded greater civil liberties than those in the Mainland, under a leadership approved by Beijing. This reflects an agreement reached between China and the United Kingdom prior to the handover, which promised Hong Kong a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years after its return. But there are increasing fears that those freedoms are being eroded. While the Hong Kong government has promised residents they will be able to vote for their next chief executive in 2017 elections, Beijing says it will only allow candidates who ""love China."" Chinese state media carried reports on Beijing's official response to the march, which was that the size of the protest would not change the central government's stance on Hong Kong's political arrangements. READ MORE: Pro-democracy activism not in Hong Kong's interest, China warns . The Hong Kong government said in a statement that regardless of the calls from protesters for the candidates for the chief executive position to be publicly nominated, Article 45 of Hong Kong's Basic Law stipulated that the power to nominate candidates was vested in the Nominating Committee only. Pro-democracy campaigners complain that the Nominating Committee is stacked with pro-Beijing appointees, and are calling for Hong Kongers to be able to freely elect their next leader. Unofficial 'referendum' Pro-democracy activist group Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP) recently conducted an unofficial referendum in which Hong Kongers could register a ""vote"" in favor of free elections for the city's next leader. According to organizers, more than 780,000 did so, significantly higher than the 100,000 they were initially expecting. Beijing condemned the referendum, with state media editorials branding it an ""illegal farce"" and accusing activists of sowing ""hatred."" But Yeung said he believed the referendum had helped pressure leaders in Hong Kong and Beijing towards a more moderate position. Occupy Central says that if its calls to reform electoral processes fail, then it is prepared to resort to civil disobedience. The group has floated plans to ""occupy"" the central business district by mustering thousands of protesters to sit and peacefully block traffic.

"With its tradition of free speech, Hong Kongers have long prided themselves on their strong opinions and loud mouths. But now local journalists say they are being shut up. On Sunday, 6,500 people massed in downtown Hong Kong to protest what they see as alarming levels of media censorship in the former British colony as it grows closer to Mainland China. The march comes just over a week after thousands of runners in the Hong Kong Standard Chartered Marathon wore blue ribbons to raise awareness of ""deteriorating"" press freedoms. Protest organizer and veteran journalist Shirley Yam said the city's press freedom is the worst she's seen in her 30-year career. ""Headlines were added, complete pages were removed, photos were cancelled, interviews were bought, columnists were sacked,"" Yam told CNN. ""We get calls from senior government officials, we get calls from tycoons, saying 'we don't want to see this in your paper.'"" ""It's sad and terrifying,"" she said. Historically, Hong Kong was known as a ""window into China."" Prior to the opening of Communist China to the West, Hong Kong was often the only place foreign journalists could report on the mainland. Even today, the Hong Kong media plays a watchdog role, often breaking stories about corruption, health epidemics, and human rights issues that  mainland media shy away from. Beijing is a ""control freak"" But now protesting journalists say they are finding themselves silenced if they dare to question the Chinese Communist Party or Hong Kong's leader C.Y. Leung, who is favored by China's government. Last month, journalists at Ming Pao -- a newspaper known for its coverage of human rights in China -- were stunned when their editor-in-chief was suddenly replaced by a Malaysian editor. READ MORE: Why is this cuddly wolf toy a symbol of Hong Kong anti-government protest? Days later, AM730, a tabloid daily known for its criticism of the government, announced that mainland Chinese firms had simultaneously pulled their advertisements, costing the paper over $1 million a year. Yet those are just the big examples. Multiple journalists at the protest told CNN they have received calls from the Chinese government's representatives in Hong Kong asking them to remove coverage of certain topics or change their arguments, something they say is happening more and more often. Hong Kong legislative council member Cyd Ho, who attended the protest, said these examples are reflective of an obsession with loyalty in the Chinese Communist Party. READ MORE: China 'employs 2 million people to police internet' ""Beijing is a control freak,"" she told CNN. ""It cannot bear to hear any opposition.""

""The central government is paranoid."" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused CNN's request to comment on these allegations. Fighting against giants . But some of the censorship may not even be forced at all. ""Suppression sometimes happens not as a the result of a direct order from the Beijing government,"" said Adrian Chow, a columnist for the Hong Kong Economic Times, who suggests that many journalists voluntarily cozy up to the regime in hopes of receiving favorable treatment. ""They want to show that they are in line with the Beijing government's main melody,"" said Chow. ""I think people who resist are actually a minority."" READ MORE: Censorship protest a test for China . A report released this month by the non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists said that ""more than half"" of Hong Kong's media owners have accepted appointments to China's main political assemblies. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's press freedom ratings have fallen precipitously. French-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Hong Kong 61st worldwide in press freedom in 2014 -- a far cry from its 18th place ranking in 2002, when the rankings were first conducted. And a 2013 opinion survey by the University of Hong Kong found that over half of Hong Kongers believed that the local press engaged in self-censorship. Protesters fear things may get worse still. ""To be honest, we are not optimistic at all,"" said Yam. ""We're journalists, we don't want to be in the news, we should be covering the news."" ""But as journalists, we are used to fighting against giants, and that's what we shall continue to do,"" she added. Ho acknowledged the uncertainty. ""Some people say Hong Kong is dying,"" she said.

"A debate of more than five years could stretch even longer with Wednesday's call for a health study on the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada. Two Democratic senators -- Barbara Boxer of California and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island -- urged Secretary of State John Kerry to examine higher rates of cancer and other illness reported in places impacted by the ""tar sands"" oil from northern Alberta. Their letter to Kerry sought to further delay the project that has support from Republicans, some Democrats, the oil industry and labor unions. A Pew Research Center poll in September showed 65% of respondents favored building it. So why is this still being debated? Answers show how the pipeline has become a political albatross around the neck of President Barack Obama and Democrats as they try to hold onto control of the Senate in November's congressional elections. What's this all about? A Canadian company wants to complete a pipeline from northern Alberta to the Gulf Coast that would carry the tar sands oil across six U.S. states. The $5.3-billion project by TransCanada needs federal approval because the pipeline crosses an international border. For now, the decision rests with the State Department headed by Kerry. U.S. report on Keystone indicates little climate impact . Environmental groups oppose the pipeline because extracting and refining the tar sands oil emits 17% more of the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change than conventional oil production. Detractors fear the project would increase U.S. reliance on the dirtier oil at a time when the nation -- one of the world's biggest carbon emitters -- should be moving away from fossil fuel dependence to limit climate change. ""At the end of the day, Keystone XL is not just another oil pipeline; it's a gateway to the unchecked development of one of the world's dirtiest fossil fuels,"" wrote Tom Steyer of NextGen Climate Action in a CNN opinion piece on February 20. Supporters say the years of study since TransCanada first sought U.S. permission in 2008 show the pipeline itself wouldn't significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions. They note the project will create more than 3,000 temporary U.S. jobs, as well as a likely greater number of indirect jobs. Once it is built, the pipeline would need less than 50 permanent U.S. jobs to operate it. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican of Kentucky, called the pipeline ""the single largest shovel-ready project in America"" and an ""important project that won't cost taxpayers a dime to build but will bring thousands of private-sector jobs to Americans who desperately need them."" Where does the Keystone oil come from? The pipeline starts in western Canada where tar-like black oil called bitumen saturates the sand around the Athabasca River and other areas. In the 1920s, scientists discovered how to mix what was called tar sand with hot water and caustic soda to separate the components so they could extract the bitumen. Now, major international oil companies have invested tens of billions of dollars to construct huge extraction and refining complexes around Fort McMurray, just over 200 miles northeast of Edmonton. Where does the pipeline go? The Keystone XL pipeline would begin in Hardisty, Alberta, and extend for 1,179 miles through Saskatchewan, Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska to connect with existing segments in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Once completed, it would carry 830,000 barrels a day that could travel to Houston and Port Arthur on the Gulf Coast. Who wants it? The September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terror attacks prompted a U.S. push to reduce its dependence on Middle East oil. Interest rose in getting it from Canada, a neighboring ally, and rising prices made the high cost of tar sands oil production more feasible. Time to get serious on energy: Clean or dirty? Oil companies invested billions in tar sands complexes to extract and refine the Canadian bitumen, and now want to cash in with increased production to meet both the U.S. and export demand. Republicans who traditionally support the oil industry and big business want the pipeline to keep the profits flowing and bolster the economy, while labor unions that historically align with Democrats also back the project because of the jobs it will create. In addition, four Democratic senators facing tough re-election battles this year -- Mary Landrieu in Louisiana, Mark Begich in Alaska, Mark Pryor in Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina -- back the pipeline. ""This single project will inject billions of dollars into Louisiana and national economies and reduce our dependence on oil from hostile countries,"" said Landrieu, whose state has major oil production facilities. Who opposes it? The environmental lobby, with backing from wealthy liberal donors, has mounted a growing campaign of protests and other opposition to the pipeline. Steyer, a billionaire former hedge fund manager, says he will spend up to $100 million in the 2014 election cycle to promote the fight against the climate change. ""America cannot lead the fight on climate change abroad while allowing even more pollution to be produced in our own backyard,"" he wrote. ""To truly be a global leader on climate change, President Obama must first make the right choices here at home. He must deny the Keystone XL pipeline."" 5 reasons why climate change is back in the news . Boxer and Whitehouse opened a new front Wednesday with their call for the State Department to include a full health review in assessing the pipeline project. ""Elevated levels of carcinogens and mercury have been documented downstream from tar sands extraction sites, and communities in these areas show elevated levels of rare cancer rates,"" they said in their letter to Kerry. ""Tar sands oil is very difficult to clean up when a spill occurs, and a 2010 tar sands pipeline spill into the Kalamazoo River still has not been resolved."" They also cited ""significantly higher levels of dangerous air pollutants and carcinogens"" downwind from tar sand refineries, with people living those areas ""suffering higher rates of the types of cancers linked to these toxic chemicals, including leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."" Where does Obama stand? In both of his inaugural addresses and his most recent State of the Union speech, Obama cited climate change as an issue of administration focus. He has mandated improved auto and truck fuel efficiency standards and toughened pollution regulations for new power plants, but the Keystone issue has become the most visible symbol of the climate change debate. In a speech last year on climate change, Obama said the pipeline must be basically carbon-neutral, meaning that approving it would have no more impact on climate change that not approving it. Obama, Harper differences over Keystone pipeline on display at summit . A recent State Department environmental report concluded that building the pipeline would have little impact on overall carbon emissions from tar sands oil. Approval or denial of any single project was unlikely to affect how much oil gets extracted from the tar sands, explained Assistant Secretary of State Kerri-Ann Jones. Election-year politics also come into play. Obama would risk a voter backlash against Democratic candidates in November if he rejects the pipeline, which could cost the party its vital control of the Senate. The split over the issue between pillars of the Democratic liberal base -- with the environmental lobby opposing the pipeline and organized labor supporting it -- further confuses the President's approach. What happens next? More delay, most likely. Release of the State Department environmental report on January 31 launched a 90-day period for public comment and consultation. Kerry, who is known for his effort to combat climate change, will then determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest, thought the final call clearly rests with Obama. On Wednesday, the State Department inspector general cleared one potential hurdle from a final decision by concluding there was no conflict of interest involving a group with ties to TransCanada that took part in the environmental impact study. Republican Rep. Ed Royce of California, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the inspector general's conclusion ended questions about the process, adding: ""Let's stop the excuses and get America back to work."" However, the call for a health review by Boxer and Whitehouse offers potential cover for putting off a decision. So does a Nebraska state court ruling last week threw out the governor's approval of the pipeline route through the state. With an appeal likely to take months, the court process gives the Obama administration a plausible reason for waiting until after the November vote. It wouldn't be the first that the process got delayed until after an upcoming election. In 2011, the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline due to concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water that is important for the state's agricultural economy. Republicans accused Obama of putting off the issue until after the 2012 presidential election, but their efforts to force an earlier decision failed to work. Meanwhile, TransCanada rerouted the pipeline in the state.","Inspector general finds no conflict of interest in environmental assessment .

"There are many ways to measure 30 years, but for Glenn Ford, the yardstick is simple. ""My sons -- when I left -- was babies. Now they grown men with babies,"" he said, speaking as a free man for the first time in nearly three decades. Ford, Louisiana's longest-serving death row prisoner, walked free Tuesday after spending nearly 30 years behind bars for a murder he did not commit. ""My mind's going all kinds of directions, but it feels good,"" Ford, 64, told reporters outside the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, according to CNN affiliate WAFB. One reporter asked whether he harbors any resentment. ""Yeah, because I was locked up almost 30 years for something I didn't do,"" said Ford, who wore a denim shirt, a hat and dark-rimmed glasses. ""Thirty years of my life, if not all of it,"" he said, WAFB reported. ""I can't go back."" According to the Capital Post Conviction Project of Louisiana, a judge ordered that Ford be freed Monday after prosecutors petitioned the court to release him. New information corroborated what Ford had said all along: that he was not present at nor involved in the November 5, 1983, slaying of Isadore Rozeman, the project said. ""We are very pleased to see Glenn Ford finally exonerated, and we are particularly grateful that the prosecution and the court moved ahead so decisively to set Mr. Ford free,"" said Gary Clements and Aaron Novod, Ford's attorneys. They have argued his trial was compromised by the unconstitutional suppression of evidence and by inexperienced counsel.

"As the United Kingdom continues to enforce sanctions on Russia over its actions in Ukraine, the British Museum has announced it is lending one of the controversial Elgin Marbles to a St. Petersburg museum, describing it as ""a marble ambassador of a European ideal."" A statue originally from the Parthenon in Greece will go on display at the Hermitage Museum on Saturday, British Museum Director Neil MacGregor said in a statement. It is the first time the British Museum has loaned one of the Elgin Marbles to a foreign museum. The British government and other European Union and NATO nations have imposed sanctions on Moscow over Russia's annexation of Crimea and allegations of continued interference in eastern Ukraine. Britain's sanctions are not cultural, instead targeting Russia's financial, defense and energy sectors, as well as imposing asset bans and travel restrictions on specific individuals. However, MacGregor's statement did touch upon the issue: . ""The Trustees have always believed that such loans must continue between museums in spite of political disagreements between governments,"" MacGregor said. ""It is a position energetically shared by our counterparts in Russia."" Western countries and the Ukrainian government in Kiev accuse Moscow of sending troops and military equipment into eastern Ukraine to help pro-Russian separatists fighting against government forces. Russian officials have persistently denied their military is involved. At the G20 summit in Australia last month, British Prime Minister David Cameron warned Russia to change course over Ukraine. Otherwise, Cameron said, ""The relationship that Britain has with Russia, that the European Union has with Russia, the relationship that I hope Australia has with Russia, will be very different."" 'Provocation to Greek people' Greece has for decades been demanding the return of the sculptures, which were ""acquired"" by Lord Elgin between 1801 and 1805, bought from him by the British Parliament in 1816, and later presented to the British Museum. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras described the decision to loan the sculpture as ""a provocation to the Greek people."" ""The Parthenon and its sculptures have been looted. The value of the sculptures is priceless,"" he said. ""We Greeks identify with our history and culture, which cannot be fragmented, loaned or bestowed."" The Elgin Marbles are a series of sculptures in a frieze that once adorned the upper sections of the Parthenon in the Greek capital of Athens. The sculpture being loaned to Russia, of the river god Ilissos, ""is one of the finest of those to survive from the Parthenon,"" the British Museum said. Describing itself as ""the most generous lending museum in the world,"" the museum said the loan was part of ongoing exchanges with the Hermitage, which had requested it to mark the 250th anniversary of its foundation. ""The British Museum is a museum of the world, for the world and nothing demonstrates this more than the loan of a Parthenon sculpture to the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg to celebrate its 250th anniversary,"" MacGregor said. Mikhaile Piotrovsky, director of the State Hermitage Museum, said: ""I am delighted that this important, beautiful and significant sculpture has been lent in celebration of our two museums' shared values and will be seen alongside the permanent classical sculptures of the Hermitage."" The British Museum says the statues ""are part of the world's shared heritage and transcend political boundaries."" Greece's Prime Minister said the decision to send the Ilissos statue to Russia disproved what he said was the British Museum's rationale for retaining the Marbles. ""The last, until now, British doctrine that the Parthenon Marbles could not be moved is no longer valid -- as their other 'argument' for the lack of an appropriate space to house them collapsed with the opening of the Museum of Acropolis,"" Samaras said. The Parthenon was a temple in ancient Athens' Acropolis citadel, built in the 5th century B.C. The Acropolis Museum says the area is believed to have been largely intact until the 17th century, but after damage in warfare, foreign visitors began taking parts of the structure as souvenirs. ""It was in the 19th century that Lord Elgin removed intact architectural sculptures from the frieze, the metopes and the pediments of the building,"" the museum says. The latest Acropolis Museum building was completed in 2007 and is the place ""where eventually the Parthenon sculptures will be reunited,"" the museum says. It says the Parthenon frieze was originally 160 meters long. ""From the entire frieze that survives today, 50 meters are in the Acropolis Museum, 80 meters in the British Museum, one block in the Louvre,"" the museum said, adding that ""other fragments are scattered"" among museums in Sicily, the Vatican, Germany, Austria and Denmark. Earlier this year, UNESCO said it had received a request from Greece to mediate in the dispute between Greece and Britain over the Elgin Marbles. In October, the U.N. agency said it had not yet received a response to an official letter sent to the British government and the British Museum.","The British Museum says it is lending one of the Elgin Marbles to a foreign museum for the first time .

Under the new rules, gamers can be suspended from Twitch for nudity or broadcasting themselves wearing items ""including lingerie, swimsuits, pasties, and undergarments."" While dealing with a serious issue, the rules maintain a playful tone. ""You may have a great six-pack, but that's better shared on the beach during a 2-on-2 volleyball game blasting 'Playing with the Boys,'"" read the rules, with a link to the iconic scene of that nature from the movie ""Top Gun."" ""If it's unbearably hot where you are, and you happen to have your shirt off (gents) or a bikini top (ladies), then just crop the webcam to your face. If your lighting is hot, get fluorescent bulbs to reduce the heat. Xbox One Kinect doesn't zoom? Move it closer to you, or turn it off. There is always a workaround."" While the post's wording goes out of its way to note the rules apply to both men and women, it comes at a time when female game developers, journalists and players have been targeted with death and rape threats, among other abuse, linked to the so-called GamerGate movement. Behind the furor over GamerGate . Ostensibly about ethics in video-game journalism, the movement quickly targeted ""social justice warriors,"" most of them women, who questioned the portrayal of women in video games as well as the treatment of women in the community. Most recently, actress Felicia Day, known for the gaming-oriented Web series ""The Guild,"" had her email and real-world address posted online less than an hour after a blog post in which she criticized GamerGate. Day had written that she feared retribution when she decided to share her views on the movement. In recent weeks, game designer Zoe Quinn, gaming critic Anita Sarkeesian and game designer Brianna Wu have all received threats of violence on Twitter and other platforms.","Twitch has said gamers can't broadcast without clothes on .

"The comment on the Facebook page of the Norwegian tabloid newspaper Verdens Gang last July was unequivocal. ""The death penalty is the only just sentence in this case!!!!!!"" it said. Written by Thomas Indrebo, the ""case"" to which the message referred was the meticulously planned mass murder of 77 people in Oslo on July 22, 2011by Anders Behring Breivik. This week, the Breivik case has finally come to Oslo central criminal court. But Indrebo, who, as it happens, had been selected as a ""lay"" judge (the Norwegian version of the U.S. and UK jury system), wasn't in court. He had been dismissed for his Facebook comment which the case's presiding judge, Wenche Elizabeth Arntzen, suggested could ""weaken trust in his impartiality."" Strangely enough, even Breivik, who posted his murderous intentions on his own Facebook page just before the July rampage, might have agreed with Indrebo's Facebook comment. Speaking in court yesterday, Breivik admitted: ""There are only two just and fair outcomes of this case. One is an acquittal, the other is capital punishment."" Breivik's bizarre comment captures the baffling nature of a case that has so far lurched from the grotesque public confessional of a mass murderer to the equally tasteless spectacle of a hatemonger whose racist delusions seem to have been fed, in part at least, by the Internet. Indeed, virtual networks like Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia and the World of Warcraft seem to offer as good clues as any to why this 32 year-old man should decide one day to blow up and shoot as many fellow Norwegians as he could. Anders Behring Breivik may or may not be found to be clinically insane. But beneath or beside his madness, there's something about Breivik which captures, in extremis, the increasingly delusional, violent and narcissistic nature of our digital culture. It would, of course, be crass to blame something as tragic as the mass murder of 77 innocent Norwegians on social media. And yet it would be equally irresponsible to simply ignore these signs and refuse to draw any connection at all between Breivik's troubled personality and the broader culture forces in our electronically networked world. Firstly, there's his self-evidently narcissistic personality which has enabled him to stand in an Oslo court this week and unselfconsciously boast about what he called ""the most sophisticated and spectacular political attack in Europe since World War II."" It was this same narcissism, of course, that also generated his 1,500 page ""2083 Manifesto"" as well as his prolific postings on social media sites like Facebook and YouTube. Narcissism, of course, wasn't invented by the Internet and it would be absurd to establish a causal connection between self-love and mass murder. That said, however, today's digital media culture -- which shatters the 20th century mass audience into billions of 21st century authors and enables them all to broadcast their most intimate thoughts to the world --  seems to be making narcissism the default mode of contemporary existence. As Stephen Marche notes in an excellent Atlantic cover story this month about Facebook: ""Rising narcissism isn't so much a trend as the trend behind all other trends."" Social networks like Facebook are making us lonely, Marche concludes. The more connected we think we are on social media ""communities,"" he argues, the more isolated and atomized we really are becoming. And if there's one self-evident thing on show this week in Oslo's central court, it is the loneliness of being Anders Behring Breivik. ""July 22 wasn't about me. July 22 was a suicide attack. I wasn't expecting to survive that day. A narcissist would never have given his life for anyone or anything,"" Breivik said this week in court. But the crime, this me-terrorism, was all about him. He can talk all he likes about his association with obscure racist groups like the Knights Templar, but the truth is that Breivik is totally alone. No friends, no fellow conspirators, no girlfriend, no loved ones.  Even his father hadn't spoken to him for years. Then there's Breivik's reliance on the Internet to learn about the world -- a world that he sees in the stark Manichean terms of evil Moslems and communists versus good Norwegian Christians. When asked this week about the greatest influence on his ideology, Breivik's answer was simple. ""Wikipedia"", he said. That's what most informed his bizarre worldview. Perhaps part of the narcissist's affection for Wikipedia lies in its over 10,000 word article about him, an entry that describes him as a ""terrorist,"" includes 200 footnotes and is almost as detailed as the Wikipedia entries on Martin Luther or Karl Marx. Indeed, given the ""open"" nature of the Wikipedia editorial system, who is to say that the self-obsessed Breivik himself hasn't been contributing to his own entry? Most troubling of all is Breivik's obsession with the multiplayer role-playing World of Warcraft, a violent online game that he played ""full-time"" between 2006 and 2007. Indeed, one of the few times that he smiled this week was when the image of his World of Warcraft character was displayed in court. Some apologists for video games have suggested that Breivik's addiction to World of Warcraft ""means nothing at all."" But they are wrong. Given his absolute absence of remorse over the murders, it's not hard to imagine that this obsession with violent online games has enabled him to somehow virtualize the killing of real people, transforming them from flesh and blood characters into abstractions. I have to agree with Thomas Indrebo. The death penalty is, indeed, the only just sentence in the Breivik case. That said, however, this case isn't just about a single delusional character. Breivik's obsession with violent online games, his narcissism, his reliance on Wikipedia and Facebook are warnings about how digital media can corrupt our grasp of reality. Breivik may be a worst case scenario, but I fear that there will be more young men like him in future if virtual reality becomes our only reality.","Keen: Breivik captures the delusional, violent, narcissistic nature of digital culture .

"Celebrity publicist Max Clifford was arrested Thursday by police investigating sex abuse allegations sparked by a scandal involving a now-deceased TV host, British media reports said. Surrounded by media as he left Belgravia Police Station later that night, Clifford said the claims against him are ""very damaging"" while insisting they are ""totally untrue."" ""These allegations ... are very distressing for myself, my family and my kids,"" said the publicist, who didn't elaborate on the accusations except to say they dated from 1977. Opinion: BBC in crisis -- What have we learned? ""Anyone who really knew me those years ago and those who have known me since will have no doubt that I would never act in the way I have today been accused."" His lawyer earlier confirmed that Clifford -- who is famous in Britain for representing celebrities and members of the public willing to sell kiss-and-tell stories -- was questioned by police but did not say what it regarded. ""Max Clifford is being interviewed by police. Mr. Clifford will assist the police as best he can with their inquiries,"" said lawyer Charlotte Harris, from the Mishcon de Reya law firm. London's Metropolitan Police said a man in his 60s was arrested on suspicion of sexual offenses Thursday morning in Surrey, outside London, in connection with the inquiry involving late television personality Jimmy Savile. Those arrested under British law can be held in a cell and questioned, after which they may be released or charged with a crime. Read more: TV icon sex-abuse scandal rocks the BBC . But the force declined to name the suspect, in line with policy. The police set up Operation Yewtree to investigate a flood of sex abuse allegations made against Savile and others following a documentary run by broadcaster ITV in October, in which several victims came forward. Read more: Jimmy Savile: National treasure in life, reviled 'sex abuser' in death . The investigation has three strands, one involving claims against just Savile, another involving ""Savile and others,"" and the third involving only ""others."" A police statement said Thursday's arrest fell under the category of ""others."" Police believe Savile, who died last October at age 84, sexually abused as many as 300 young women and girls in past decades. Savile, who hosted popular BBC children's TV programs including ""Jim'll Fix It"" and ""Top of the Pops,"" was a household name in Britain for decades. He was also well-known for his philanthropy, having raised millions of pounds for charity, and was awarded a knighthood. Savile's targets were apparently mostly girls in their mid-teens in what authorities have described as alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale, some of it conducted on BBC premises.","Max Clifford says the allegations are ""very damaging"" and ""totally untrue""

"The struggle for democracy is not dead, say Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists, who have pledged to continue opposing Beijing despite setbacks. The activist group Occupy Central had hoped that their threats of a mass sit-in in Hong Kong's downtown Central district would convince China to approve open democratic elections for Hong Kong's next leader. But on Sunday, the Chinese government said the elections should only consist of candidates approved by a Beijing-backed committee, dealing a blow to democracy supporters. Even the leader of the movement seemed deflated. ""Up to this point, we failed,"" Benny Tai, the co-founder of Occupy Central, told Bloomberg Tuesday. ""Beijing refused to back down."" But Chan Kin-man, a fellow co-founder, told CNN on Wednesday that Tai's remarks did not mean surrender. ""We may not have attained that specific goal,"" he said, referring to the hoped-for reforms. ""But we want to create a resistant movement in Hong Kong. As long as the democratic spirit continues in Hong Kong, we will not give up."" 'We will occupy Central' Chan said Occupy will proceed with its mass sit-in ""soon,"" bringing downtown Hong Kong to a halt. It's the culmination of years of pent-up unhappiness. When Hong Kong, a former colony of the United Kingdom, was returned to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries struck an agreement promising Hong Kong the democratic election of its own leader, known as the chief executive. But the democratic reforms have not materialized. Seventeen years after the handover, the city's chief executive is chosen by a committee filled with Beijing loyalists, leading to frustration among pro-democracy Hong Kongers who want the city's leader to be chosen by local people, not China. That's why many of them see China's recent proposal as a bitter sham. The National People's Congress (NPC) proposed Sunday the Hong Kong public be given the right to vote for its next leader — but only on up to three candidates approved by a Beijing-backed committee. Democracy's activists' chosen response, civil disobedience, is similarly controversial. Chinese officials have repeatedly said occupying Central would be an illegal act that would jeopardize Hong Kong's economic security. Hong Kong's own security chief has warned the protest could turn violent, and ""things could get out of control."" In August, an ""anti-Occupy"" march organized by pro-government activists drew tens of thousands. ""We want universal suffrage, but not at any cost,"" said its organizer Robert Chow. 'Ungovernable' Hong Kong streets aren't the only thing that'll be paralyzed. A group of 26 pro-democracy legislators has said they will vote down any undemocratic proposal. Without their votes, Beijing's reform proposal will not have the necessary votes to become Hong Kong law, resulting in gridlock. ""We are going to veto it to show our determination that we are not going to accept this fake democracy,"" said Albert Ho, a pro-democracy legislator who is involved with Occupy Central. Li Fei, China's deputy secretary-general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, has said Hong Kongers only have themselves to blame for lack of reform if they veto Beijing's proposal. This has effectively set up a standoff between Hong Kong and Beijing. Alan Leong, another pro-democracy legislator, said Hong Kong is becoming ""ungovernable."" Without a popular mandate, the next chief executive will face serious challenges as he or she tries to control an increasingly upset civil society. ""There will be a new age of civil disobedience and non-cooperation across the board,"" Leong told CNN. But, he added, Hong Kong spiraling into chaos may also persuade Chinese leaders that robust democratic reforms are what's needed to regain stability. ""It's like a phoenix rebirth sort of thing. We're getting worse in order to get better."" International support . In recent days, Western governments have spoken up in defense of Hong Kong's democracy activists. British lawmakers have announced plans to visit Hong Kong to conduct an inquiry into whether its handover treaty is being violated by China's actions. But China's National People's Congress has responded angrily, calling the inquiry a ""highly inappropriate act which constitutes interference in China's internal affairs."" In the United States, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. government ""supports universal suffrage in Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law and the aspirations of the Hong Kong people."" ""We believe that an open society with the highest possible degree of autonomy and governed by rule of law is essential for Hong Kong's stability and prosperity."" But Hong Kong's democracy activists doubt the United States or United Kingdom can make a big difference. ""I do not have much hope on these two governments in particular,"" said Ho. ""Of course they should say something, if they still have the moral fiber to stand up to the strong economic pressure of China. They should know what is right and what is wrong... if they have the guts to do it."" Ho said he and other legislators are currently requesting an ""urgent appeal"" with the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations and the Human Rights Committee on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to examine whether the rights of Hong Kongers are being violated.

"A Hong Kong court on Monday said it would wait for psychological reports on a British banker who has been charged with the gruesome killings of two Indonesian women at his apartment. Prosecutors have requested the assessments of Rurik Jutting, a 29-year-old former employee of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, to establish whether he is fit to enter a plea to the two counts of murder he faces. In a court appearance last week, Jutting didn't enter a plea to the charges. On Monday, the court adjourned the case until November 24 to allow time for the psychological reports to be carried out. The grisly deaths of the two women shocked many residents of Hong Kong, where the violent crime rate is low for a city of its size. Body found in suitcase . Jutting is accused of killing Sumarti Ningsih, 25, whose decomposing body was discovered inside a suitcase on the balcony of his high-rise apartment in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong. The other woman, Seneng Mujiasih, 29, was found on the floor of the one-bedroom apartment with her throat slashed. Police say Jutting called them to the apartment early on November 1. They say Mujiasih had been killed that day, and Ningish five days earlier. Sumarti's father has called for his daughter's killer to be executed, but Hong Kong doesn't impose the death penalty. 'Just an ordinary woman' The two victims' bodies are expected to be sent back to Indonesia on Tuesday, according to the Asian Migrants' Coordinating Body. The Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong wasn't immediately available for comment on the repatriation of the women's remains. Around 200 people attended a vigil for the women Sunday in the city. ""Sumarti Ningsih is just an ordinary woman from Indonesia,"" said a woman named Jumiati, who identified herself as the victim's cousin. ""Like me and many others, she was forced to work abroad to feed her poor family and make her dream come true,"" Jumiati said in a statement.","The court adjourns the case for two weeks, pending the psychological reports .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Demonstrators wheeled out the looming figure under cover of darkness. The sculptor, a 22-year-old artist who calls himself ""Milk,"" had yet to title his creation. But passersby were quick to nickname the mannequin ""Umbrella Man."" Built of wooden squares, the 10-foot tall statue of a man holding aloft a yellow umbrella has now taken its place alongside the posters, cartoons, banners and calligraphy that now decorate the streets and sidewalks of Hong Kong's Admiralty district. Since they occupied this area a week and a half ago, pro-democracy protesters have transformed a stretch of concrete highway running through the center of the city into an improvised outdoor gallery of politically-inspired art. ""It's an outpouring of creative talent,"" exclaimed Douglas Young, a Hong Kong-based designer and entrepreneur, during a recent visit to the protest encampment. ""Why haven't we seen this before?"" asked Young, who also took care to point out that he was not an active supporter of the protest movement. Umbrella inspiration . The sit-in has acted as a magnet attracting artists eager to make their voices heard. The artist known as Milk told CNN his statue was inspired by the image of a protester holding an umbrella to shield a police officer from the rain. Most of the other images displayed here also riff on the umbrella and the yellow ribbon, two symbols of the protest movement. Last month, protesters used umbrellas -- an accessory Hong Kongers carry to protect themselves from torrential downpours as well as tropical sun -- to shield themselves from pepper spray fired by police. Less than 48 hours into the occupation, demonstrators erected a globe-shaped monument out of umbrellas above the traffic circle next to the Legislative Council building. Since then, the streets and sidewalks have been plastered with cartoon-like characters holdings umbrellas, accompanied by slogans calling for democracy, freedom and justice. One of the posters shows a helmeted police officer with riot shield yelling ""You're such a thug!"" while pointing his finger at an umbrella-toting cartoon that resembles the children's book character Paddington Bear. The artist who drew the cartoon is a 30-year-old graphic designer Carol Hung. ""My initial idea was to make people laugh in this heavy atmosphere,"" Hung told CNN. Hung, who described herself as a political neophyte, said she was inspired to produce a series of protest-inspired drawings after seeing reports of police clashing with protesters on September 28th. ""At the moment I saw the tear gas, it made me want to support the students,"" Hung said. Art as 'silent protest' On a recent afternoon, art teacher Josephine Lau sat in the middle of the highway now occupied by students, painting yellow ribbons onto Chinese paper.  She hoped her posters would prove more durable than previous slogans she had made, which were washed away by rainstorms last week. ""We can use different media to express ourselves... to tell people what we feel about Hong Kong,"" Lau said. ""I like the peaceful and silent protest and I'm supporting the students behind the scenes."" Not far away, 17-year-old Timothy Sun was designing his own posters on the asphalt with the slogan ""GOV YU NO LISTEN TO US?"" ""I want to use my way to show my voice to the public,"" the teenager said. Post-it politics . Like many others here, Sun said his favorite piece of art at the protest site was actually a colorful piece of work created by thousands of contributors named the ""Lennon Wall."" Thousands of pastel post-it notes bearing messages and drawings written by passersby in many languages coat the curved staircase that runs along the outside wall of one of the government office buildings in Admiralty. Many of the messages profess love for Hong Kong. The wall serves as proof that, despite young Hong Kongers' freedom to digitally post anything they like on social media, there is still a powerful attraction to expressing oneself using old-fashioned paper and ink. ""This feels very much to me like Twitter, but paper Twitter,"" observed Young, the businessman and art aficionado. ""Old school Twitter, if there's such a thing."" Young, who runs a chain of high-end design stores called Goods of Desire, was quickly inspired to add his own post-it message to the wall.  It was an appeal to Hong Kong's beleaguered top official to preserve the post-it monument: ""Mr. Chief Executive, Please don't tear this wall down."" ""I see a lot of tenderness, a lot of passion... a lot of imagination, which is fantastic,"" Young said, while gazing out on the largely empty encampment and its fluttering banners and posters. ""I wonder where that's from?"" he asked. ""I wonder where these people will be after this, when it all ends.""

"South Korean prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the captain of the capsized Sewol ferry and life in prison for three other crew members involved in the deadly disaster earlier this year. The death penalty is unusual in South Korea, which has not carried out executions in 17 years. It hasn't been used in decades, as a backlash to how it was used in the past for political purposes. Prosecutors charged the captain, Lee Joon-seok, and the three crew members with murder, because prosecutors allege the ferry's crew members didn't use the ship's facilities such as life rafts, life vests and announcements to evacuate passengers. The captain was filmed being rescued in his underwear on April 16, as the ferry capsized off the South Korean coast. Lee said he was changing clothes and smoking at the time of the incident. He was rescued while hundred remained inside the boat, listening to announcements to stay put. He has apologized to the victims saying his actions were not intentional. At least 294 people died -- including hundreds of high school students on a field trip -- when the ferry sank. Ten bodies are still missing. Prosecutors are also seeking 30 years in prison for a female crew member, who was at the helm of the ship at the time of its sinking. The closing statement was held Monday, and the three judges are expected to issue a verdict and sentencing on November 11. The death penalty cannot be carried out in South Korea without a signed order from the country's president. ""The death penalty is essentially a mere life sentence,"" said Jasper Kim, a professor at the Graduate School of International Studies at Ewha University, who has a background in law. He also added that South Korea does not usually sentence convicted criminals to life without parole --  so life sentences usually represent about 20 years or less of imprisonment. The Sewol disaster caused widespread outrage in South Korea over lax safety standards and the failure to rescue more people as the ship foundered.","South Korean prosecutors seek death penalty for ferry captain and life in prison for three others .

"(CNN)No need to worry about dinner conversation in this cafe, your meal buddy may not be able to speak -- or move, or eat. Hong Kong's latest eatery, the Moomin Cafe, features Nordic cuisine and a host of stuffed dining companions to help banish the loneliness of solo diners. It's the first overseas venture for a concept that's already proved a hit in Japan. The Moomin Cafes are inspired by popular Finnish stories that depict the whimsical adventures of a family of white hippo-like characters and their friends. The Moomins was first published in 1945 in Finland but came to global attention after the creation of several television series, the most popular in the 1990s. Tokyo's first Moomin Cafe opened in Tokyo in 2003. Since then, three more have opened and six Moomin-themed coffee stands. The timing of the Hong Kong cafe's opening could not be better -- this year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Moomin creator, Tove Jansson (1914-2001). Japan's original Moomin Cafe has been operating for over a decade, but its popularity only exploded earlier this year after its ""anti-loneliness"" concept went viral. Plush creatures . To save its lone customers from the awkward perils of solo dining, a plush Moomin character is brought over to the table as dining companion. ""I thought if people can stay and sit with Moomin characters like Moominmamma and Moominpappa (parents in the Moomin family), it'd be more interesting,"" says Mickey Kera, who came up with the cafe concept. But Hong Kong's single diners may have to fight for an adorable meal buddy. ""Unlike Japan's anti-lonliness cafes, Moomin characters will be placed at various tables and joining a Moomin character will be up to luck,"" says cafe spokeswoman Cindy Wu. Wu says the Hong Kong location will have three additional characters not featured in the Japanese outlets: Hattifatteners, Little My and Snufkin. Bringing Finland to Hong Kong . Though originating in Japan, the Hong Kong cafe tries to reflect Finnish lifestyle and cuisine. The Tsim Tsa Tsui venue is designed to look like a tradition Finnish house, with photographs of Finland and hand drawn artwork of Moomins. ""I love the venison soup stew, salmon milk soup and Jansson's temptation (baked potato with caramelized onion gratin), which are traditional Nordic dishes,"" says Kera. ""I really want to introduce Moomin and Finnish lifestyle to Hong Kong people."" The cafe also serves Finnish traditional bread called Piirakka and Scandinavian salad with pickled herring, as well as a Nordic dish of salmon with goat cheese and basil. Exclusive only in this cafe . The Hong Kong restaurant features dishes not available in Japan, such as Moomin House Pancakes -- an impressive stack drizzled with cream and accompanied by a three-story ceramic Moomin house containing custard pudding, chocolate mousse and mango jelly. Sadly, you don't get to take the Moomin house home,but diners ordering the Souvenir Mango Cup Pudding are allowed to keep the mug used to serve the dessert. In addition to the Moomin pancake house, coffee mugs and Moomin-shaped pasta are available at the souvenir store. Moomin Cafe Harbour City, LCX, Ocean Terminal, Tsim Sha Tsui, Hong Kong; +852 2730 0963; open daily 11 a.m.-11 p.m. A separate pop-up store will open until January 4, 2015.","Japan's Moomin cafe opens in Hong Kong where diners can sit with stuffed animals when dining .

"Kristian Kano dreams of a new house away from the sea that almost killed her and her family, when Typhoon Haiyan slammed into the eastern Philippines one year ago. ""We're afraid to stay here, but we don't have a choice,"" the 25-year-old mother said, as she looked out from their makeshift house near the shore in the coastal village of Anibong, Tacloban City, which was worst hit by Haiyan. Kano said she and her 7-year-old daughter still have nightmares about the typhoon, referred to locally as Yolanda, which left thousands dead or missing, and millions homeless. ""When it rains, my daughter would hug me tight and cry,"" she said. ""I try to be strong but I am also scared. I don't want to stay here, but I have to wait for the government because we can't afford to move on our own."" ""The government said they have a plan for us. I just hope it will come soon."" 'Danger zones' Kano is among more than 70,000 residents living in coastal communities designated as danger zones by authorities in Tacloban City, a bustling regional hub of 220,000 people. So far, only 250 of the residents have been relocated to permanent resettlement sites. Providing safe homes for survivors is a top priority for Tacloban City Mayor Alfred Romualdez, whose seaside mansion was among those destroyed by the tidal surges. ""We are in great need of transitional shelters,"" he said. ""We don't have enough temporary homes, that's why we can't relocate those in the danger zones."" But the construction of new houses has been hobbled by a lack of funds, available land, building materials and even manpower. Bad weather has also slowed down work in some areas, Romualdez said. The government initially ordered that areas 40 meters from the coast would be designated as no-build zones. But the restriction was modified to a no-dwelling zone after commercial establishments warned of the impact on industries such as tourism and fishing. Maria Lagman, who heads the shelter cluster of Tacloban's recovery effort, said authorities were assessing the hazard risks of all 138 villages to come up with a building code tailored for the city. ""It's like going to war. I have a bulletproof vest and you don't have one, then I will be more secure,"" she said. ""In a storm or whatever hazard, the building code will specifically say what kind of structures will be resilient in this place."" ""The strategy is to lower the density of people in the high risk areas,"" she added. ""Only those who have bulletproof vests, or houses that are sturdy, can stay in the firing line."" Livelihoods ruined . Haiyan survivors also worry about their livelihoods, especially since many of the identified resettlement sites would take them far away from their places of work. Kano said she used to be a sales clerk at a warehouse near their house, but the store was forced to close after Haiyan, which triggered storm surges up to 10 meters high that ripped apart homes, commercial establishments and infrastructure. In Anibong, eight cargo and passenger vessels slammed into houses, including Kano's. She said her family, together with her nine siblings and parents, ran to the highest location nearby and stayed there until the water subsided. ""We ate anything we could to survive,"" she said. ""I remember seeing these ships smashing into the houses."" Kano's husband, who used to be a cargo handler at the pier, now works in one of the ships that ran aground in Anibong. He earns 250 pesos (nearly $6) a day to help refloat the vessel that the new owner hopes to sail again. Other ships have been chopped up and sold as junk. Praying to endure . The measly salary is not enough even for their small family, Kano said. ""We have to buy everything here, from water for cooking and drinking, even water for taking a bath and washing clothes and wood for cooking,"" she said. ""We have to make do with what my husband earns daily, but my worry is what happens when the ship is gone and there is no more work."" Kano would love to work again, but she doesn't have extra money to go out and prepare the usual requirements for employment. ""I just pray to God that he gives us the strength to endure,"" she said.

"Turkey, a key U.S. ally and a NATO member that borders the territory captured by ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic State, in Syria and Iraq, could play a critical role in the U.S.-led military assault against the jihadist group. Ankara has the second-largest army in NATO and hosts an American airbase. Turkish forces could participate in the U.S.-led bombing, or Ankara could allow the United States to use the Incirlik airbase in southern Turkey to stage the attacks. But Turkey prefers to play a secondary role. Citing its concern over the fate of 49 hostages who were captured by ISIS when the group seized Mosul in June, it limited its role to stemming the flow of foreign fighters, tightening border security, and cracking down on ISIS's oil-smuggling networks. The hostages were released over the weekend following what Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described as a ""covert rescue operation."" Now that the Turkish government's thorny dilemma has been resolved, will Ankara change its stance? To the delight of its Western allies, Turkey signaled a possible change in policy on Tuesday when Erdogan said ""Ankara could give military or logistical support to U.S.-led air strikes against Islamic State insurgents in Syria."" But the Turkish president's change in tone is more likely to be, not a change of heart, but rather an attempt to allay international criticism that has been mounting since U.S. President Barack Obama laid out his strategy to fight ISIS. The release of the hostages might have removed a major obstacle to Turkey's playing a frontline role in the U.S.-led anti-ISIS coalition, but there are many more. Ankara and Washington have different priorities in the conflict. Washington is primarily concerned about the rise of ISIS and views the conflict through the lens of counter-terrorism. Hit hard by the ongoing civil war in Syria, Turkey sees ISIS as a symptom of the brutality of an illegitimate regime in its neighboring country that has posed Ankara far greater challenges. The Syrian civil war has dealt a blow to Turkey's image as a regional superpower that mediates regional conflicts and pursues a non-sectarian foreign policy. Turkey hosts more than 1.2 million Syrian refugees [UNHCR now believes there are more than 1.5 million refugees], which incurs not only financial costs but also presents political dilemmas for the Turkish government in addressing the ethnic and sectarian balance within its own society. For Turkey the most dangerous fallout of the Syrian civil war has been the resurgence of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). In retaliation for Turkey's support for the Syrian opposition, al-Assad gave a free hand to the Democratic Union Party (PYD), the Syrian offshoot of the PKK based in northern Syria, by allowing it to operate unencumbered, recruit new fighters for its campaign against Turkey, and undertake a pseudo-governmental role in Kurdish regions of Syria. The backbone of Turkey's Syria policy has been to ignore ISIS because it has been waging war against the Kurdish group in northern Syria. Turkey believes that fighting the Assad regime is more important than the narrow counter-terrorism mission that President Obama has in mind. A military attack against ISIS is likely to strengthen not only Assad's but also the PYD's hand. To Erdogan, a strong advocate of regime change, anything short of al-Assad's ouster carries the risk of further weakening Turkey domestically and regionally and fueling extremism. There is also a deep-seated lack of trust in a long-term U.S. commitment to the resolution of the conflicts in Iraq and Syria that has kept Turkey from playing a frontline role in the coalition against ISIS. Enmeshed in a three-decade-long fight against the PKK, Turkey knows all too well that countering ISIS calls for long-term international commitment and cooperation. Ankara does not want to render itself even more vulnerable to ISIS attacks without an assurance from the United States that it will not leave Turkey in the lurch. Domestic and regional public opinion is another point of concern. Turkish public opinion has always been skeptical of U.S. involvement in Turkey and the Middle East. Therefore, Turkey has historically been wary of allowing the United States to carry out military operations from the U.S. airbase in Incirlik. Taking an active military role in a U.S.-led military strike against a Sunni entity is likely to draw criticism from the people of the region as well. Turkey's image as an independent actor that is looking after its own interests and willing to defy Western powers if necessary has won Ankara favorable notice in the Arab world. The Turkish parliament's refusal to allow the United States to station troops on Turkish soil to open a second front against Iraq in 2003 challenged Turkey's old image as an American stooge and increased Turkey's credibility on the Arab street. The Turkish government does not want to deal a blow to its regional image by taking part in another Western-led military operation in a Muslim country. Hemmed in by these constraints, Turkey seems unlikely to take an active military role in the strikes against ISIS unless the United States shifts its policy to effect regime change in Syria. Until then, Turkey will focus its diplomatic energy on convincing its allies at the U.N. to set up a buffer zone along its border with Syria.","Turkey could play a key role in the U.S.-led military assault against ISIS, writes Gönül Tol .

"St. Louis, Missouri (CNN) -- Hundreds of demonstrators marched 12 miles Saturday from Ferguson, Missouri, to a downtown St. Louis plaza near its iconic Arch to deliver a message: They want the police officer who killed Michael Brown to be charged with a crime. But few protesters traveled as far as Sara Benjamin, 23, and daughter Imari, 5. They trekked 750 miles from Baltimore to attend the Justice For All Rally on St Louis' Kiener Plaza. ""I came down here because I'm the mother of a 5-year-old, and we wanted to show our solidarity with the people of Ferguson,"" Benjamin said. ""I think this is an attempt to break up the black community by targeting black men."" She was referring to how a white Ferguson police officer fatally shot Brown, 18, who was black and unarmed, on August 9. By splitting costs with others for gas, food and lodging, the trip cost her a little over $100, Benjamin said. Civil rights activists calling for charges to be brought against the police officer who killed Brown held a second day of protests Saturday. According to tweets from St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson, protesters threw rocks at police and tried to storm a QuikTrip store early Sunday. ""Arrests have been made for continued illegal behavior"" says one tweet. The protests, dubbed a ""Ferguson October"" and ""Weekend of Resistance,"" are taking place in Ferguson, St. Louis and the surrounding area. Demonstrations focused on the encounter between Brown and Police Officer Darren Wilson, who authorities said shot Brown after he attacked him and tried to take his gun. But witnesses said the unarmed teenager had his hands in the air when he was shot. The shooting prompted weeks of protests in Ferguson, which sometimes became violent when demonstrators and police clashed. Before this week, protests had died down considerably. Are you there? Share your images . The goal of the protests scheduled for Friday through Monday is to demand Wilson's arrest and bring attention to what organizers describe as racial profiling and police violence nationwide. ""Power concedes nothing without a demand,"" organizers said. ""Our country can no longer deny the epidemic of police violence facing black and brown communities,"" the movement's website states. ""Mike Brown is now part of a long list of people like John Crawford, Ezell Ford, Eric Garner, Oscar Grant and countless others who have been unjustly killed by police. Their lives mattered."" Demonstrations on Friday night focused on the Ferguson Police Department, which is facing a storm of criticism after Brown's death. A large group of protesters marched the West Florissant corridor -- the scene of looting and vandalism after Brown's death -- to police headquarters. Then they proceeded to St. Louis, said St. Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman. Marchers in the diverse, multigenerational crowd declared their attempt to create a national movement about alleged police abuses against minorities as ""vitally important,"" one demonstrator said. Protesters hailed from California, Illinois and Kansas. ""We have people from all across the United States to stand in one accord for justice in this matter,"" Reginald Rounds, who lives in the same apartment complex where Brown resided, said Saturday. ""We are not going to stop addressing the matter until we get some resolve. We'll be here,"" he said. Organizers said they expect thousands to attend four days of events. The early Saturday protests featured a few hundred people as police in riot gear stood watch. ""No justice, no peace!"" they chanted. ""Hands up, don't shoot!"" Others carried placards that read, ""Demilitarize the police."" As protesters stared down police officers standing single file, an announcement came on a megaphone. ""If you touch a police officer, you will be arrested for assault,"" it said. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . The protests kicked off Friday afternoon when demonstrators invoked a Mexican Halloween tradition and set up a Day of the Dead altar to memorialize Brown and others. The altar featured candles, flowers and photos of the deceased. Men in dark suits quietly carried a coffin made of mirrors down the streets as chanting protesters followed. A few hours later, the crowd dispersed. Several other events will be held Sunday, including an evening meeting of ""reflection and resistance"" at St. Louis University with author and professor Cornel West, rapper-activist Tef Poe and Rabbi Susan Talve. A closing ceremony Monday will feature participants removing items from the Day of the Dead memorial, organizers said. Twelve miles away in St Louis, protesters have also rallied against the death of Vonderrit Deondre Myers, 18. Protests erupted there after a white police officer fatally shot the black teenager. But this one was different from the Brown case because the teenager was armed and fired at the officer, according to authorities. CNN's Stephanie Elam and Bill Kirkos contributed from Missouri. Faith Karimi, Brian Rokus, Greg Botelho, Joe Sutton and Carma Hassan also contributed to this report.

"(CNN)Turkey would be willing to put its troops on the ground in Syria ""if others dos their part,"" Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an interview that aired Monday. ""We are ready to do everything if there is a clear strategy that after ISIS, we can be sure that our border will be protected. We don't want the regime anymore on our border pushing people against -- towards Turkey. We don't want other terrorist organizations to be active there."" ""We want this humanitarian policy on the other side of the border. Second: military strategy, security. If there is there any threat against our national security, we will take all the measures -- all the measures."" Turkey, Syria's northern neighbor, has been central to the civil war there since it began over three years ago. Then-Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan broke with his longtime ally, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to support Syria's opposition. Ever since, the government has been trying to convince the international community to do more to stop al-Assad. U.S. President Barack Obama, long wary of becoming involved, has become convinced that he must intervene in the Syrian war, but only to stop ISIS, not to go after the leader he nonetheless says long ago lost the legitimacy to govern. 'Our approach should be comprehensive' ""We shouldn't be separating pre-ISIS and post-ISIS Syria,"" Davutoglu told Amanpour. ""From the first early days of the crisis until now, no other country did more than Turkey; what Turkey did against the attacks, brutal attacks of the regime, as well as against ISIS."" He said that American airstrikes in Syria were necessary but not enough for a victory. ""If ISIS goes, another radical organization may come in,"" he said. ""So our approach should be comprehensive, inclusive, strategic and combined ... not just to punish -- to satisfy our public opinion -- to punish one terrorist organization, but to eliminate all terrorist threats in the future, and also to eliminate all brutal crimes against humanity committed by the regime."" ""We want to have a no-fly zone. We want to have a safe haven on our border. Otherwise, all these burdens will continue to go on the shoulder of Turkey and other neighboring countries."" Right now on Turkey's border, ISIS has been vying for control of the Syrian town of Kobani; CNN crews on the border witnessed what appeared to be an ISIS black flag flying on the eastern side of town. ""We will do everything possible to help people of Kobani because they are our brothers and sisters. We don't see them as Kurds or Turkmen or Arabs. If there is a need of intervention to Kobani, we are telling that there is a need of intervention to all Syria, all of our border."" The rise of ISIS, and the international military strikes against it, have forced hundreds of thousands of refugees across Turkey's border in recent weeks, to join the nearly 1 million refugees that the United Nations refugee agency says are already there. ""People are asking us to receive refugees, and they are praising us, OK. But at the same time, they are saying please control your border. How can you control a border if, in three days, 180,000 people are coming? In three days!"" On the front lines of Syria's war, Turkey is trying to dispel the idea that the United States can become involved in Syria by going after ISIS but not al-Assad. ""We said chemical weapons are the red line. He used chemical weapons. What happened to him?"" ""We didn't do anything."" ""He killed people by punishing through hunger. He surrounded cities, neighborhoods, and kept them hungry. And we have seen -- you showed in your program -- 50,000 photographs who were killed by these methods, by Syrian regime. And everybody was silent."" ""And now, because of these crimes, there was no reaction, these radical organizations -- I mean ISIS -- misused this atmosphere and told these people the international community doesn't defend you. Nobody defends you. Only I can defend you by my own means. This was the source of ISIS."" Davutoglu said Turkey warned the West ""several times"" about the rise of radicalism in Syria. ""We talked to our European and American colleagues that if there is no solution against these crimes against humanity by the Syrian regime, there will be a rise of radicalism. At that time, there was no name of ISIS, but we were telling them."" A porous border, a diplomatic spat . Disagreements over how much America should involve itself in the Syria civil war are not the only source of tension between Turkey and the United States. Last week, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden blamed Turkey in part for the rise of groups like ISIS. ""They poured hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad,"" he said. ""Except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra and al Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world."" The vice president apologized to Erdogan in a phone conversation this weekend. ""This is really a very unfair accusation,"" Davutoglu said. ""What we expect, Christiane, are two things: fairness and empathy."" ""America, the United States of America, has a border with Mexico, and there are two states on both sides. Is it easy to control all the border?"" ""One point six million people came (to Turkey). This is the combined total, combined population of Washington, D.C., Boston and Atlanta."" ""You can imagine which type of risks and challenges we are facing. Either we will close the borders, which means nobody can come in, which would be against our culture."" Turkey has nonetheless openly supported the moderate opposition. ""We didn't hide that we are supporting the moderate opposition, Syrian National Coalition, by all means. If others listened to our advice -- our allies and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- if they had protected and supported the moderate opposition, today we wouldn't be facing such a big crisis of ISIS."" Turkey in transition . Davutoglu has been Prime Minister for a little over a month, having previously been foreign minister. The change comes as Erdogan has transitioned to the office of president, having won a landmark election -- the first time Turks directly elected their president. Though the role of president is officially ceremonial, Erdogan has talked openly about changing the constitution, and many critics say he has become increasingly authoritarian in his governing style. ""I made some important changes"" in the Cabinet, Davutoglu said. ""That was my own choice. I don't want to make big changes because there will be a new -- another election in 2015."" ""I also told and I promised my people that there is a need for a new constitution because this constitution is a product of a military coup d'etat. But the main change of constitution is -- will be directed to human rights and not state-centric constitution."" On the eve of Davutoglu's ascension to prime minister, a prominent Turkish writer said in The New York Times that he could have a calming effect on the country's politics. ""Although Mr. Erdogan chose him because they seem to agree on all major issues, Mr. Davutoglu could still help Turkey by bringing his gentle, polite and smiling persona to the country's bitter and hate-filled political scene,"" Mustafa Akyol wrote. ""First of all, the assumption is wrong,"" Davutoglu said. ""In many aspects, in fact, there have been many reforms in last three, four years."" ""About my style, everybody has his personality, and this does not mean these are alternatives to each other. These could be complementary and inclusive in that sense. And I will, from academic life until now, I had the same personality, my personality didn't change and will not change.""","Ahmet Davutoglu: U.S. airstrikes in Syria were necessary but not enough to beat ISIS .

"The first time I walked down the main drag in Wan Chai in Hong Kong, I couldn't believe what I saw; all the mama bars there and prostitutes openly in the street outside trying to get guys to go in. Within the first week I'd already been offered cocaine, though I didn't take it at that stage. When I did, it was easy to get. I know 100 guys between the ages of 20 and 50, and I'd say around 30 of them were regular cocaine users. Not all were working in banking, but most were, of the ones I knew. They were all Westerners. I know guys in banking in London, Chicago and Sydney and they've all got the same pressures as Hong Kong. Yes, I know some cocaine users in those cities, but the ratio of the people I know to the ratio of people I know who are drug users is minimal -- it's almost non-existent. So it can only really be down to two things -- the availability of it and how many people do it; the general acceptance of it in Hong Kong. When I read the news of the murders in Wan Chai, allegedly by a British banker, my first reaction was ""I hope I don't know him, please don't be someone I know,"" because it easily could have been. I knew some guys who were seriously screwed up and now I realize just how much I had changed in Hong Kong, almost inhuman at times. Getting drugs . The guy that I used, you could give him a phone call or a text message from 4 p.m. onwards and within an hour -- I think his record was 10 minutes -- one of his drivers was sitting in a car outside the office. You'd just tell people you were popping down for a cigarette. You'd dive over into his car, he would just drive around the corner, and by the time you got out 30 seconds later, you've got cocaine and you've given him the money. He had four or five delivery points that were his favorite delivery points and they were all within walking distance of the office. And if your guy was busy or not answering, then you knew that someone else had a guy and they could get some off him. Of the hundred nights that I wanted to get cocaine, I think I can only remember one night when I couldn't get any. You could walk into almost any bar in Wan Chai and stand there and have a drink and you would soon pick up the signs of another cocaine user; they're going to the toilet every 20 minutes, their nose is running, they're talking rubbish, really quickly. They wouldn't say no if they had some on them. It felt like some unofficial club where you only knew members first names -- but you all looked out for each other on the drug front. A gram would cost between $90 to $130 (HK$700 and HK$1,000). At the start I was doing it once a month, and after a few years I found myself doing it four times a week. I would do one gram for one night out. But then quite often I would find myself on a three or four-day bender. You could do that because there are a couple of bars in Wan Chai that stay open until 9 a.m. And then when one of those kicks you out you can just walk across the road to another bar that's opening at 9 a.m. -- as long as you can make it across the road without being hit. The bars that stayed open until 9 a.m. -- they weren't the mama bars with the girls standing outside, but inside there were always prostitutes asking you to buy a drink for them at an inflated price. And then generally it wouldn't take long for them to ask you if you wanted to go back to a hotel with them. You'd never have to ask them.  I personally always said no because I was more interested in my beer and coke. 'No one was really that worried' If you weren't going on a bender, and you were just out drinking until 3 a.m., you could go to work and function. I was one of them -- I was still functioning. But if I had a three-day bender then I had to make up excuses for being off sick, or whatever, or somebody would cover for you. Generally, no one was really that worried. In my office there were three guys who would regularly go AWOL for three or four days, and of course the wives would worry and would be ringing everybody. People would be trying to get hold of them but you kind of knew, ""they're alright, they're just in a bar somewhere, on  cocaine, and they'll turn up in a few days looking ashamed and promising they won't do it again, for a week."" If you were out in Wan Chai you knew you weren't going to get into trouble with the law. You could go into the toilet, into the cubicle, and chop your cocaine up on the ledge behind the toilet. You could clearly see that was going on -- the people who were regularly going into the toilet every 20 minutes -- not covering up the noise they were making when they were doing it. The women were obviously very, very easily accessible if you wanted it. I knew guys whose number one priority was the drinking, I knew guys whose number one priority was the drugs, and I knew guys whose number one priority was the women. Generally the guys in the last of those groups, you wouldn't see them around as much because they'd be off with a woman somewhere. Hong Kong can break you as a person. That scene in Wan Chai with these girly bars everywhere, getting cocaine whenever you need it, being able to stay up and drink all night, you end up believing that that's the norm. When you go to other cities, it's like ""why haven't they got somewhere that stays open all night. It's a pain in the arse to try to get cocaine from somebody."" I wouldn't have got out of it in Hong Kong. I would have been destroyed. Leaving Hong Kong saved my life.","British banker left Hong Kong to escape pull of drugs scene .

"There is never a day where at least one person isn't outside the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department sitting or standing near an anemic tree, the only place for a bit of shade. At night, the crowd tends to swell, and the protest grows more intense. There are almost always two or three people streaming events live. You can hear them loudly sharing thoughts or giving a play-by-play of what's happening. While their cameras capture live images, they call out what they think are injustices surrounding the August shooting of Michael Brown and the subsequent police crackdown on protesters in the 10 weeks or so since Brown was killed by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. The police are geared up with cameras as well. They wear body cameras, and any time officers approach protesters there is usually at least one officer with a handheld camera, too. It's a careful dance in which protesters and police are trying to make sure they have proof if a law is broken or someone's civil rights are violated. Both outside the police department, and roughly 2 miles east -- along the main protest route, where most of the imagery of the sometimes-violent protests has originated -- tension can go from zero to 100 in seconds on any given night. Police can tally dozens of arrests a night since the city erupted. Among those placed in cuffs were journalists, clergy, a local rapper, a state senator, a St. Louis alderman and activist/intellectual Cornel West. It's tough to predict the mood each night. On Tuesday, a small group of about 50 protesters caused no disturbances, and there were no arrests, police said. The next night, five police officers were assaulted with rocks, water bottles and a metal rod as demonstrators blocked traffic and knocked down barricades outside the police department. Protesters, many of them increasingly suspicious of a recent spate of leaks surrounding the Brown investigation, say there will be more nights like Wednesday than Tuesday should a grand jury not indict Wilson. Recovery in progress . On West Florissant, where thousands of protesters have marched for months chanting things like ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" buildings still bear the scars of the community's frustration. At businesses such as the Ferguson Market & Liquor and Red's BBQ, plywood slats sit where windows once stood before violent elements among the protesters looted and vandalized businesses along the corridor. The QuikTrip that was one of the first businesses attacked still lies in shambles, a chain link fence protecting it from further damage. Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou, a Boston-based author and pastor who grew up in St. Louis, has been participating in the protests. He has been arrested twice. As he walks by the burnt-out convenience store just a few blocks from where Brown died, he says, ""Democracy is on fire, and we're called to be firemen."" Asked to elaborate -- is he all right with the looting and burning? -- he says he'd prefer that the protests unfold without the violence and destruction. ""I mean, it is not my preference, no,"" he said. ""I'm more concerned about the conditions that produced this -- the simmering poverty, the simmering oppression, the simmering alienation, the existential crises that black youth feel in America. I am far more concerned about the condition that produced the burning of buildings."" ""Our children are in a tremendous amount of pain."" Tinderbox awaiting a match? It appears Ferguson will not imminently simmer down, and a group called Ferguson October hoped to grow the demonstrations with a ""national day of action against police brutality"" on Wednesday. Many protesters are preparing for the possibility that the grand jury may decline to indict Wilson. If that's the case, one protester told CNN this week, ""Excuse my French, all hell is going to break loose."" That has been a pervasive sentiment since the protests began: Many in Ferguson don't care about reports that a scuffle preceded the shooting and that Brown may have reached for Wilson's gun. The only facts that matter, they say, is that Wilson shot perhaps as many as 11 times, hitting Brown six times above the waist. The fatal shots came as he stood roughly 30 feet away from Wilson's police cruiser, and, according to some witnesses, with his hands up in surrender. It's an unnecessary use of force, say many residents who feel Wilson aimed to kill, not arrest, Brown. Marquita Rogers, a 27-year-old mother of two who lives a few blocks from the Canfield Green subdivision where Brown died, said in August, when the protests were at their ugliest, that she didn't care what Brown did before encountering Wilson. ""Jaywalking? Smarting off? Stealing cigars? Running? You're not supposed to die for that,"" she said. Her neighbors, Arvid Wilkerson, 22, and Patricia Pendelton, also predicted during August interviews -- days after a grand jury started hearing evidence in the case and the Justice Department announced an independent investigation -- that the turmoil in Ferguson would only worsen if Wilson wasn't indicted. ""If this police officer don't get no kind of charge,"" said Pendelton, 41, a nurse, shaking her head, ""they think it's chaos now?"" Calculated leaks? In recent days, The New York Times received information from a federal source and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was given Brown's autopsy report and spoke to a source with knowledge of the investigation. The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported that at least six black witnesses gave grand jury testimony that supported Wilson's side of the story. The proceedings in a grand jury inquiry, by law, are not supposed to be made public, and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has told his staff it's ""inappropriate and troubling"" that information is trickling out while the grand jury and federal investigations are ongoing. He further said that the ""selective flow of information coming out of Missouri"" is diminishing his faith in local authorities, a Justice Department official said. Prosecutor Robert McCulloch and Wilson's defense team released separate statements Thursday saying they were not the sources of any of the leaked information. Sources have confirmed to CNN the information provided to The Times and Post-Dispatch is part of the testimony being considered: that Brown's blood was found on Wilson's uniform and inside his police car and that one of the wounds Brown suffered was a close-range gunshot to his hand after attacking Wilson. ""We are not surprised by the information leaked last night by the St. Louis Medical Examiner's office,"" Brown family attorney Ben Crump said in a statement. ""Several independent witnesses indicated there was a brief altercation between Michael Brown and Officer Wilson at the patrol car. What we want to know is why Officer Wilson shot Michael Brown multiple times and killed him even though he was more than 20 feet away from his patrol car; this is the crux of the matter!"" Peruse Twitter, and you'll find that many believe the leaks -- along with Gov. Jay Nixon's announcement this week of a Ferguson Commission to study social and economic conditions -- are harbingers of the grand jury declining to indict Wilson. ""Feeling in Ferguson among protest leaders is that leaks are coming from law enforcement in attempt to signal that no indictment coming,"" tweeted Wesley Lowery, a Washington Post reporter who was detained in the early days of the protests. On Monday, St. Louis County's former police chief, Tim Fitch, told local radio station KMOX that it is ""probably very unlikely"" that the grand jury will indict Wilson and the leaks are a calculated effort ""to start getting some of the facts out there to kind of let people down slowly."" A former federal law enforcement official said something similar. ""It could be really for, in part, a beneficial purpose, to start leading those community leaders and those leading the protests to believe that there won't be an indictment,"" said Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI Criminal Division. Lack of faith in system . Amy Hunter lives in St. Louis and is the director of racial justice at YWCA Metro St. Louis. She has been taking part in the protests and notes it's a young people's movement and that Brown was the unfortunate catalyst in a ""seminal moment for change."" She remains concerned, however, about what might happen in this St. Louis suburb of 21,000 if the grand jury decides not to indict Wilson. ""I think we are all worried,"" she said. ""As a mother of three sons and a daughter, I also worry that if we don't end this that I will be sharing a fate just like Michael Brown's mom."" Asked during a news conference if he, too, was worried that Ferguson could erupt if the grand jury comes back with a no bill, Nixon said Tuesday, ""When you have this level of energy and when you have what has happened over 73 days, you can rest well-assured that we are focused and concerned about what could be the most problematic scenarios."" Despite the assurances from government officials, the statements ring hollow to protesters like Sekou. ""The only words that would have mattered, that could have possibly began the process of some symbol of justice, is the creation of a special prosecutor or the announcement of the indictment of Darren Wilson,"" he said. He also has his doubts about assertions that the case is traversing the justice system and that citizens should have faith as it runs its course. ""This justice system?"" Sekou asked. ""Which has a wonderful set of facts to support the way it has engaged police who have taken black lives? This justice system?""

"Jerusalem (CNN)At least two rockets fired from Syria landed in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on Tuesday afternoon, prompting Israel to respond with artillery fire, the Israeli military said. No injuries were immediately reported. After the rocket fire, officials evacuated Israeli-controlled areas around Mount Hermon, site of a ski resort, the military said. The Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah is suspected to have been involved in the rocket attack, which ""came from a Syrian air base in an area controlled by the Syrian army with a known Hezbollah presence,"" an Israeli military source said on condition of anonymity. Hezbollah supports the Syrian regime, which has been battling Sunni Islamist militants and other rebels in a civil war for more than three years. Weapons fire from Syria into Israeli-controlled Golan Heights -- both targeted and errant, the Israeli military contends -- has happened intermittently in the past year as the Syrian civil war raged. More than a week ago, Iranian semiofficial media reported that an Israeli airstrike killed six Hezbollah members and a senior Iranian commander in the Syrian controlled portion of Golan Heights around the Syrian town of Quneitra, the site of the only border crossing between Israel and Syria. Iran, like Hezbollah, supports the Syrian regime. The Israeli military refused to comment about the January 18 strike. Israel has occupied a portion of the territory since seizing it during its 1967 war with Egypt, Jordan and Syria. CNN's Elise Labott reported from Jerusalem, and CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","Hezbollah involvement suspected in rocket attack, Israeli military source says .

"Hong Kong's democracy movement has raised issues such as income inequality and an increasing cheerless economic outlook, especially for the younger generation.  Not coincidentally, these are the same issues that are causing Singaporeans to despair over their future. Despite the fact that, according to the Economic Intelligence Unit, Singapore lays claim to the dubious honor of being the most expensive city in the world, there is no minimum wage in Singapore. Is it any wonder then, that amongst comparable economies, the island-state has one of the highest levels of income inequality? Singapore has the highest proportion of millionaires in the world but nearly 5% of the workforce have an annual income of less than U.S. $5,000, according to a 2011 report by The Straits Times. And it's not just the lower-income workers who are getting pounded. The middle-class squeeze is as prevalent as ever. Nearly 50% of Singaporeans subsist from paycheck to paycheck, saving less than 10% of their monthly incomes. An alarming 14% have no savings at all. If and when an economic whirlwind visits, many will be left unable to cope. Working conditions have also deteriorated. For years, Singaporean workers have worked more hours than in most countries, and, perhaps unsurprisingly it has resulted in an extremely unhappy workforce. The death of innovation . What facilitated such a dismal outcome? One major factor is the lack of dissenting views. The ranks of the opposition, civil society and labor movement have been decimated in the last 50 years through imprisonment without trial and criminal prosecution, and nearly every newspaper, TV channel and radio station is owned and run by the state. Without an opposing voice, the echo chamber in government simply grew louder. Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew has argued that the practice of democracy serves only to undermine political stability and, therefore, economic progress. The strategy that Lee articulates, what might be called the Singapore model, bifurcates the economics of a community from its politics, the goal being to maintain absolute power while pursuing economic growth. But this authoritarian system has backfired. It has robbed the Singaporean society of the verve needed to take the economy to the next level where ideas and innovation are essential. Steve Wozniak said that Singapore could not produce a company like Apple because the system has destroyed ""creative elements"" that give rise to innovative companies. While Singapore's mercantilism appears the epitome of success, it is an economy unable to regenerate itself. The situation has deteriorated to the point that it has to rely on foreigners to stimulate growth. Lee Kuan Yew, its first prime minister and architect of the country's one-party rule, said, in a stunning admission, that ""without [foreigners], the jobs will not be there to begin with."" Singapore is like a Ponzi scheme which needs new immigrants just to keep the economy ticking over, but which also reduces the quality of life for its current citizens.  And yet, there are no signs that the current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Lee Kuan Yew's son, understands the urgent need for reform. ""I don't think there is salvation in saying we need more democracy and that will make these countries prosper,"" he said in a recent interview. Among those words is surely a line of self-interest. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying was, perhaps, a little more candid when he said that the poor would have to be listened to if elections in the territory are genuinely free. Clearly, Singapore and Hong Kong are at a crossroads. While the path of democracy may not be a panacea for all of society's ills, political freedoms, especially in an age of innovation and rapid change, are crucial to keep the economy moving forward. The road of keeping the people silent, on the other hand, is a one-way ticket to mediocrity and eventual irrelevance.","Inequality is causing Singaporeans to despair over their future, writes Chee Soon Juan .
Singaporeans work long hours but are among world's unhappiest .
Government's control over media has stifled dissent and prevented innovation .
Without democracy, Singapore is doomed to mediocrity and irrelevance ."
"Another Hollywood movie is running afoul of a foreign government this month. ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" was banned in Egypt. ""The Ministry of Culture bans the film 'Gods and Kings' for historical inaccuracies,"" the Egyptian agency said in a statement. The movie, which stars Christian Bale as Moses, is a re-enactment of the biblical story of the Jews' escape from slavery in Egypt more than 3,000 years ago, during the time of the pharaohs. Australian actor Joel Hedgerton plays the Pharaoh Ramses in the 20th Century Fox production. Egyptian Culture Minister Jabir Asfour slammed the film as ""Zionist."" ""It shows history from a Zionist viewpoint and forges historical events, therefore it is was banned in Egypt,"" according to state news agency EGYNews. In 1956, the same biblical story was told in ""The Ten Commandments"" starring Charlton Heston as Moses and Yul Brynner as Ramses. That version was filmed on location in Egypt. ""Exodus"" is the latest in Hollywood's string of religious-themed movies released this year. In March, several Muslim countries banned the blockbuster ""Noah,"" saying the depiction of Noah -- whom Muslims revere as a prophet -- is forbidden in Islam. News of the ban comes on the heels of the limited release of ""The Interview,"" the movie that provoked North Korea to vow ""merciless"" action against the United States  over its lampooning of leader Kim Jong Un. On Saturday, North Korea called U.S. President Barack Obama the ""chief culprit"" who forced Sony to ""indiscriminately distribute"" the picture.","Egypt bans the movie ""Exodus: Gods and Kings""

"Turkish authorities on Friday were investigating suspicious substances or objects at the Canadian, German and Belgian consulates in Istanbul, officials said. Canadian officials reported receiving a letter containing an unidentified yellow substance Friday, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. A person who opened the letter was directly exposed to the substance, and six people nearby may have been indirectly exposed, but no one was exhibiting alarming reactions, a representative of Turkey's emergency management agency said. Chemical, radiological and nuclear experts were investigating the substance, and as a precaution were decontaminating the area and the seven people, the agency said. Authorities also are investigating security incidents at the German and Belgian consulates in Istanbul, the agency said without elaborating. The Belgian Consulate said that police were investigating a substance found in an envelope that had been sent there.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Wednesday is National Day, a day for all Chinese to celebrate the People's Republic of China. Yes, dignitaries gathered and ceremonies took place to mark the holiday in Hong Kong. But the national pride mixed with profound dissent as pro-democracy protesters occupied parts of the Asian business hub -- not to celebrate the central government in Beijing, but to denounce and challenge it. LIVE BLOG: Follow CNN's coverage of the protests . There was a sense, entering Wednesday, that the protest ranks could swell with more people off work for the holiday. The movement has seemingly grown regardless, unaffected by clashes with police, thunderstorms and repeated admonitions by authorities who have refused to budge. So there they were, Wednesday morning, waking up to chants over loudspeakers calling for the local chief executive's resignation, for police not to use violence against them and for everyone to ""protect Hong Kong."" Flag-raising protest . Student pro-democracy leader Joshua Wong, who was arrested during protests Friday and released Sunday, led a group of students in a silent protest at the official National Day flag-raising ceremony in Golden Bauhinia Square. The group silently turned their backs to the flag and raised their arms in crosses as the Chinese flag and the flag of Hong Kong were raised. ""We crossed our arms because we want to express our dissatisfaction toward the government, to reflect our mistrust towards the central Chinese government, and to object to the National People's Congress decision on August 31,"" he said, referring to Beijing's controversial ruling to allow only candidates approved by a nominating committee to run for office as Hong Kong's chief executive. In the build-up to the flag-raising, a statement from Wong's Scholarism group calling for calm and restraint during the ceremony was widely circulated among protesters on social media networks. ""Just wear black, stay quiet with your chin down or carry an umbrella,"" read a message. ""No matter how much you dislike a country, disturbing its flag-raising ceremony will only be disrespectful."" As CNN's Ivan Watson noted from downtown Hong Kong, little seemed to have damped demonstrators' fervor. Then again, there was also no sign that authorities are ready to give in. ""Both sides appear to be digging in their heels,"" Watson said. When it was transferred from British to Chinese control in 1997, Hong Kong was supposed to be the centerpiece of Beijing's one nation, two systems approach. But protesters fear that independence is slipping away. They decry a recent decision allowing national government leaders to vet -- in other words, decide who is in and who is out -- any candidates up for a vote to lead Hong Kong's government. Changing that policy is demand No. 1 for the protesters, who say that having every citizen get a vote in an election is moot if the options are decided in Beijing. A growing number have also blasted Hong Kong's current leader for putting the central government ahead of his own citizens and demanded he step down. One demonstrator, Jobie Soo, explained to CNN's Watson: ""(We want the government) just to respect the democracy that Hong Kong deserves and really uphold the principle of one country, two systems."" The powers-that-be don't appear to be in much of a talking mood. They have refused to budge while condemning the protests, which they say are against the law and are undermining Hong Kong's economic and security. Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung, a day after saying ""this illegal protest will not force the central government to go back on its decision August 31,"" said Wednesday that people should accept a deal as is. Speaking at a National Day reception, Leung said, ""It is understandable that different people may have different ideas about a desirable reform package. But it is definitely better to have universal suffrage than not. ""It is definitely better to have the (chief executive) elected by five million eligible voters than by 1,200 people. And it is definitely better to cast your vote at the polling station than to stay home and watch on television the 1,200 members of the Election Committee cast their votes."" Hong Kong leader: 'This is based on the basic law' Like other chief executives, Leung wasn't elected by a popular vote but rather by a 1,200-strong committee stacked with Beijing loyalists. That was set to change in 2017. In a way, it will. Leung points out that ""we will be able to have one-person, one-vote"" -- meaning citizens, not just committee members, can cast ballots. But as to which candidates they can choose from, the chief executive said that much has been settled and it won't change. ""I understand this universal suffrage is somewhat different to what the public thinks it would be,"" he said. ""But this is based on the basic law. We still want to remain peaceful, calm and think what the best is for Hong Kong."" Leung has backing from pro-Beijing groups like The Silent Majority for Hong Kong, who have had their own rallies and run advertising campaigns to preach their message that pro-democracy activists will ""endanger Hong Kong"" and create chaos. While the city of 7 million people is still bustling in some ways, the unrest already has had an impact on one of Asia's biggest financial centers. ATM services were disrupted and 37 bank branches closed Tuesday, according to the Hong Kong Information Services Department. Leung said ambulances and fire trucks had to be rerouted to get around the crowds. Some 157 schools closed Tuesday. The Hong Kong government canceled the city's annual National Day fireworks display because of the protests. Officials in the city have spoken out against the protest and -- at least on Sunday -- acted out. That's when police hurled 87 tear gas canisters into the crowd after they refused to heed calls to disperse, spurring protests. ""We gave them enough of a chance to leave, and this included warnings,"" Assistant Police Commissioner Cheung Tak-keung said Monday, explaining the police decision. ""But when they failed, we had to use force."" Such forceful sentiment aren't being heard everywhere, however. Leaders in Beijing have been largely silent about what's happening in Hong Kong. At the United Nations building in New York on Tuesday, CNN's Richard Roth asked China's deputy U.N. ambassador what he thought of the protests. Wang Min replied, ""What, where? Hong Kong is part of China,"" and then walked away. Activist: 'It's more or less like North Korea' Contrast this silence to what's happening in Hong Kong. Even as censors blocked access to Instagram after images of protests flooded the photo-sharing app and China blocked out reporting on Hong Kong in mainland China, those on the streets managed to make their voices heard in other ways. Some took to Twitter, and a few turned to CNN iReport -- including one capturing a collective of umbrellas which, besides shielding at times torrential rain, have become symbols of the protests . They are relaying the sentiments of the tens of thousands who have hit the streets. Many of them are students like lead organizer Alex Chow, who described ""the current situation (as) totally out of C.Y. Leung's control."" ""Actually, the government is under great pressure,"" he continued, ""and we will demand and call for more people"" to protest in the coming days. Even if more people come out, some say it's not a fair fight -- not with police fully equipped and demonstrators armed with little more than their umbrellas. Grace Cheng, a 21-year-old recent college graduate, is worried authorities will come at them even harder next time. ""We can't really stop them,"" she said. Such fears notwithstanding, the activists weren't backing down. If anything, their demands -- including for Leung's resignation -- appear to have grown louder. ""All the candidates will be pre-selected by Beijing ... It's more or less like North Korea,"" protest organizer Chan Kin-man said. ""But we are an international city. We have a younger generation who have been taught about civil rights, political rights. And we want our words to be heard."" Some analysts say they see little hope of compromise between the committed protesters and the Chinese Communist Party, which remains notorious for its ruthless suppression of pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. ""I see no way the Chinese government can tolerate what is happening in HK. Greatly fear this will end badly,"" tweeted Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute at the University of Southern California, who covered the Tiananmen crackdown for CNN. Chinese authorities apparently tried to restrict the flow of information into the mainland about what was happening in Hong Kong. On Tuesday, China blocked out reporting on Hong Kong in mainland China, CNN Beijing correspondent David McKenzie said. Earlier, censors had blocked access to Instagram after images of the protests flooded the photo-sharing app. ""Everybody is in completely unknown territory,"" said Roderic Wye, an associate fellow at London-based Chatham House. ""How these things end, we just don't know."" CNN's Jethro Mullen reported from Hong Kong. CNN's Ashley Fantz and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"With images of violence and torture coming out of Syria daily, a U.N. panel on Friday stated what many people consider obvious: ISIS has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, and leaders of the militant group should be held accountable by organizations such as the International Criminal Court. The U.N. Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria based its conclusions on more than 300 firsthand accounts and included photos and videos of violence and victims, a statement said. ""Those that fled consistently described being subjected to acts that (terrorize) and aim to silence the population,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the commission. The commission issued a paper titled ""Rule of Terror: Living Under ISIS in Syria"" that described previously known ISIS tactics such as killing, enslavement, rape and sexual slavery. But the report provides details about other, less sensational abuses, such as the penalty for smoking or having tattoos. ""ISIS also carries out amputations and lashings in public spaces in its areas of control,"" the paper said. Men have had their hands amputated for allegedly committing theft. The group has also amputated the fingers of men caught smoking, according to the commission's report. ""Men have been lashed for being in the company of women who ISIS considers to be 'improperly' dressed, for smoking, not attending Friday prayers, trading during prayer times and for having tattoos."" ISIS targets women and children . The acts of terror are not random occurrences but are part of the ISIS organizational policy, the paper said. That's why commanders for ISIS, sometimes called the Islamic State, should be held accountable by groups such as the International Criminal Court, the paper said. ISIS aims to establish a ruling Islamic government in Syria and Iraq. Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program for Human Rights Watch, said the International Criminal Court could only become involved in Syria if  the U.N. Security Council approves.  A previous U.N. motion on Syria was thwarted by veto votes by China and Russia, he said. ""The ICC has no say-so,"" he said. ""The power lies in the hands of the U.N. Security Council."" The commission's report about war crimes is significant, however, because it focuses only on ISIS and not the other groups involved in the Syrian conflict, Dicker said. ""It reshapes the frame around ISIS's actions,"" he said. ISIS is well-financed and draws fighters from many nations, including the United States and other Western countries. ISIS targets ethnic groups, journalists, women and children, the paper said. ""Unmarried women -- whom ISIS considers to be females over the age of puberty -- pose a particular threat to the armed group's enforced social order,"" the paper said. ""Parents of unmarried women and girls are terrified of their daughters being forced to marry ISIS fighters and as a result, early marriage is on the rise. Their fears are not unfounded. ""There are distressing accounts of fighters taking girls as young as 13 years old away from their families, resulting in violations of international humanitarian law and acts that amount to war crimes of cruel treatment, sexual violence and rape."" Education is used to indoctrinate children, the paper said. Propaganda and social media . In the Syrian city of Raqqah, ""children are gathered for screenings of videos depicting mass executions of government soldiers, (desensitizing) them to extreme violence. By using, conscripting and enlisting children for active combat roles, the group is perpetrating abuses and war crimes on a massive scale in a systematic and organized manner,"" the paper said. Children are also exposed to horrific sights, such as public executions, public mutilations and the display of bodies in town squares and other visible spots, it said. Besides terror, ISIS exerts control by taking journalists captive and regulating public services in areas it controls, the paper said. ""At the core of ISIS' propaganda strategy is an effective use of modern communications, particularly social media for purposes of recruitment and fundraising,"" it said. ""Many new recruits, from the region and beyond, have been influenced by widely disseminated violent images of executions, beheadings and stonings."" In other news from Syria, the United States-led coalition carried out 20 airstrikes, including 19 against ISIS and one against the al Qaeda-linked group, Khorasan, U.S. Central Command said Friday. The strikes happened between Wednesday and Friday and 17 of them destroyed ISIS positons and vehicles near Kobani. An airstrike east of the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa destroyed one of the militants training camp. The strike against several terror suspects associated with the Khorasan group took place west of Aleppo. Meanwhile the coalition also conducted 16 airstrikes in Iraq against ISIS, including two strikes west of Kirkuk, three near Baiji and one near Fallujah that destroyed a large ISIS unit, according to Central Command.","U.N. commission includes photos and videos of abuse, victims' accounts .

"Few people would consider those with loved ones on AirAsia Flight QZ8501 lucky, but Sarah Bajc has a particular perspective. ""I'm almost a little jealous in a way because, you know, at least they have this ability to put some closure to it,"" she told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday, after the wreckage of the AirAsia flight was found. Her partner, Philip Woods, was on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared without a trace almost 10 months ago. ""We're still in limbo. There's still no evidence as to what happened to the plane,"" she said, struggling to hold back tears. Earlier, before the discovery of the AirAsia flight, Bajc described feeling an incredible ache. She said: ""It's a physical pain through your whole body. And just imagining what all those families are feeling as well, I can imagine it. Unfortunately, I know exactly what they're going through."" So does Danica Weeks, whose husband was on MH370. The plane disappeared from radar screens on a flight between Malaysia and China on March 8. On Sunday, AirAsia Flight QZ8501 went missing over the Java Sea on its way from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, with 162 people on board. Debris was recovered Tuesday in the waters off Indonesia. ""The last few days has been torment. It's brought everything back. We're just reliving what we've gone through,"" Weeks said. ""It's a horrible nightmare."" A network of support . Bajc said families of MH370 victims have banded together as they wake up each day without their loved ones. And it's vital that relatives of AirAsia 8501 reach out for support, Weeks said. ""You just have to call on your close friends and family,"" she said. ""You need to lean on them because they are basically the only way you get through this."" ""Nine months, none of us are as strong as we used to be."" Help center closed . In the weeks following MH370's disappearance, the grand ballroom at Beijing's Lido Hotel turned into the briefing room for relatives of those on board the flight. Every day, the families came in hoping for a miracle. And every day, they left dejected. On Tuesday, the ballroom was dark and empty. The family assistance center was closed. Many families feel they've been forgotten. MH370 search carries on . But the search for MH370 goes on. Crews are still scouring the southern Indian Ocean with a variety of high-tech equipment. But no wreckage has been found. At the Malaysian government's request, Australia is leading the search efforts. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said last week that the mapping of the sea floor continues, and a vessel is still searching underwater for the plane. ""Our work will continue to be thorough and methodical, so sometimes weekly progress may seem slow,"" the ATSB said. ""Please be assured that work is continuing and is aimed at finding MH370 as quickly as possible."" But families of those passengers and crew may have to wait even longer. ""Assuming no significant delays with vessels, equipment or from the weather, the current underwater search area may be largely completed around May 2015,"" the ATSB said. Weeks has no choice but to wait. ""We will never find peace until we do what's right by our loved ones, and that's bring them home to us.""","The partner of a man on board MH370 describes a feeling of limbo .

"In the midst of the ongoing Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, travelers in Hong Kong may find moving around slightly more difficult than usual despite the city's efficient and impressive public transport system. The full impact of the protests on transport is likely to be felt more this week. Many people were away or on leave for a lot of last week due to two public holidays. Since being occupied by demonstrators, access for vehicles is restricted in key areas of the city and many shops and restaurants in those areas have chosen to close. This means that it is hard to get to some hotels in these areas via taxi or buses. Sections of major roads have been closed to vehicle traffic, though largely left open for pedestrians. In fact, walking around Hong Kong has been an extremely pleasant experience for a lot of visitors walking on roads that are normally jammed with cars. Despite the clashes and tear gas attacks on protesters last Sunday night/Monday morning and later clashes between protesters and other groups in Mong Kok, the protests have been extremely peaceful and relatively festive. However, the situation on the ground could change at any time and all visitors are advised to be appropriately cautious. Several nations have posted travel warnings to Hong Kong with similar advisories. Brief transport update: . In more detail: . Areas affected . In Hong Kong Island's Admiralty and Wanchai districts, Gloucester Road, Harcourt Road and Connaught Road Central have been closed to vehicle traffic, but remain open to pedestrians. Yee Wo Street outside SOGO shopping mall in Causeway Bay and parts of Argyle Street and Nathan Road in Mong Kok remain closed. Various streets in these above areas have also been closed to vehicle traffic, but remain open to pedestrians. The protest tends to grow at night, as more residents join after school, work or other activities. It is also possible the protest groups may move or extend to other areas without notice. READ MORE: Inside Hong Kong's 'Umbrella Revolution' Safety concerns . Travel to and within protest areas is generally safe but visitors are advised to use caution around Mong Kok where there have been several physical and verbal clashes between protesting students and anti-protest groups despite a police presence there. Arrests have been made in the last few days from these clashes. Public transportation has remained safe. Getting around information . Though the MTR is currently operating as normal, updates on MTR station operations are available in English on the company's mobile app. Bus updates in English can be found on websites operated by Hong Kong's public bus companies, KMB and Citybus/First Bus. Tram updates are available at Hong Kong Tramways. READ MORE: Hong Kong protest: What you need to know . 'Protest tourism' The protests have proven to be an attraction for some visitors. Many tourists have taken to walking to and through protest zones independently, though tourists on private tours around protest areas have been seen. Locals, tourists and supporters of the protestors have taken to ""sightseeing"" and looking for photo ops on elevated pedestrian bridges over roads near the Central Government Offices in Admiralty, where the largest protest (in terms of number of people) is taking place. The idea of Hong Kong protests as tourist attractions might seem surreal, but it isn't entirely new. In 2012, Lonely Planet included Hong Kong in its list of top 10 cities to visit, recommending such exotic attractions as the Star Ferry, Chinese fortune-telling and local protest rallies. The popular guidebook called Hong Kong ""China's most liberated city"" and predicted that 2012 would be an exciting year for the city, highlighting its ""rallies infused with theatrics and eruptions of song, dance and poetry"" as it continued its push for greater democracy.","The train system is operating as normal and is the recommended public transport to access protest sites .

"The massive street rallies that have swept Hong Kong since the weekend present a major dilemma for China's leadership and the city's own government. China has called the protests ""illegal"" and Hong Kong's leader C.Y. Leung has said repeatedly that China's Communist Party leaders won't reverse a decision requiring a pro-Beijing committee to screen candidates in the territory's first direct elections in 2017. The goal of protesters is to change this policy, arguing that the right to vote is pointless if the candidates are picked by Beijing. This, ostensibly, yields little wiggle room for a compromise that would allow both sides to walk away from the standoff, say analysts. ""Xi Jinping does not want to be seen as someone who can't manage a bunch of students in Hong Kong,"" David Zweig, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology told CNN, referring to China's president. Here we take a look at what might happen next: . What chance is there that Beijing will give ground? Xi has emerged as a hardline leader, with a track record of using strong-arm tactics against Tibetans and Uyghurs, and dissidents in China, said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. China also fears that what is happening in Hong Kong will have a domino effect on other Chinese cities, he added, especially in wealthy coastal areas. Even with a media blackout, some Chinese have reportedly been shaving their heads as a gesture of support for the Hong Kong protesters. ""For (Xi) to make a compromise on Hong Kong would be a tremendous loss of face,"" Lam said. Victor Gao, director of China's National Association of International Studies and a one-time translator to former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, told CNN that protesters were ""really indulging in fantasy"" if they thought the central government would back down. However, Zweig said there is still some possibility of give-and-take on electoral reform such as allowing more democrats on the nomination committee or by promising to introduce greater democracy in elections slated in 2022. ""That could be a third way,"" he said. Is Beijing prepared to sacrifice Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung? Hong Kong protesters have extracted concessions from the Beijing leadership in the past. Shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's first post-colonial leader, stepped down in 2005 amid widespread public dissatisfaction. Protesters have demanded that Leung should follow suit and Lam thinks that it's not inconceivable that Beijing may give him the boot. ""It's a tough situation but I think that there is still room to maneuver on both sides assuming Beijing decides not to use force and that it chooses to marginalize Leung,"" said Lam. ""He's a very divisive and unpopular figure."" Elizabeth Economy,  a senior fellow at U.S. think tank Council on Foreign Relations, said the best outcome might be to replace Leung, ""not with a lackey of Beijing or a democracy activist,"" but with a politician like former chief secretary Anson Chan or Christine Loh, current under-secretary of the environment. They both have strong political credentials and managerial experience, she said. ""The next three years could then be a test case for what a more independent-minded Hong Kong leader might mean for the island's relations with the mainland and provide guidance for further revisions to Beijing's current limited conception of universal suffrage,"" she wrote in a blog. What's the worst-case scenario? As a last resort, Beijing could deploy People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops on the streets of Hong Kong, said Lam. The PLA has a garrison in Hong Kong, with some 6,000 troops and they have reportedly undergone anti-riot training over the border in nearby Shenzhen. The People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official mouthpiece, said in an editorial on Wednesday, that Hong Kong could face ""unimaginable consequences"" if ""Occupy Central"" were allowed to continue. ""I don't think they would use lethal weapons but nonetheless deploying armored personnel carriers on the streets could frighten the demonstrators (Into leaving)"" said Lam. ""It would be a last resort. The images of tanks rolling down the streets of Hong Kong would evoke images of the Tiananmen Square massacre. This would be very bad for the Xi administration."" Will authorities just let the protests run their course? When protests first erupted at the weekend, authorities initially took a tougher line - using riot gear, pepper spray and most controversially, tear gas to try and clear the demonstrators. But on Monday, sensing their approach was backfiring, riot police retreated, suggesting authorities may allow the protests to run their course or, at least, wait until the tide of public opinion turns against them. An unnamed source quoted by the Wall Street Journal that Beijing had told Leung to halt the protests in a peaceful way. ""You cannot open fire,"" the source said. What has Beijing said so far? Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has been the most senior official to comment on the protests so far. He echoed previous statements released through state media, calling the protests ""illegal acts"" but stressing that Beijing believes Hong Kong has the capability to handle the situation. ""For any country, for any society, no one will allow those illegal acts that violate public order. That 's the situation in the United States, that's the same situation in Hong Kong,"" he said in Washington before meeting U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The official Xinhua news agency has said that its decision on electoral reform carries ""unshakeable"" legal status and force, angering protesters who are opposed to Beijing retaining the ability veto candidates. ""I think the 'Occupy Central' movement is the Hong Kong version of street politics and color revolutions we've seen in other countries. It's very dangerous,"" said Chen Zuo'er, a former vice minister of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under China's cabinet. ""Democracy and the rule of law are the pillars of economic prosperity and social stability in Hong Kong. 'Occupy Central' has attacked both pillars.""","Massive street protests present dilemma for China's leaders .

"Mount Ontake erupted late Saturday morning, sending a plume of smoke and ash into the sky, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported. At least three people have been injured, said a task force in Otaki village, just south of the volcano. They have observed 17-20 inches (40-50 centimeters)  of volcanic ash covering the ground. Local authorities said there were roughly 150 hikers in the area at the time, according to the agency, which raised the Volcanic Alert Level for Ontake from 1 to 3. 'Volcanic unrest' shakes California . The public is advised to not approach the volcano, and police and firefighters have deployed to help hikers near the summit. About 250 people living near the mountain have decided to remain in their homes, police said. The volcano last erupted in 2007. It is located about 155 miles (250 kilometers) west of Tokyo. 10 of the world's most photogenic volcanoes .","A nearby village task force reports 16-20 inches of ash on the ground .

"It's not quite the Mummy Returns -- more like an attempt to stop the Mummy disappearing in the first place. Archeological experts have built an exact, full-sized replica of King Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt, recreating every tiny detail to save the original from being destroyed by visitors. The replica tomb opened this week near the southern Egyptian city of Luxor, where tourists flock to see the ancient Valley of the Kings complex that houses the young pharaoh's actual resting place. Laser scanners and high definition printers were used to recreate the precise textures and colors of wall murals depicting the afterlife. King Tutankhamun's original tomb, built following the 19-year-old ruler's death in 1327 B.C., was discovered almost intact by archaeologist Howard Carter in 1922. Great fakes: Top tourism replicas . But decades of tourism have taken their toll. Moisture from the breath of visitors has damaged the murals and walls, while temperature fluctuations have caused paint to flake off and cracks to expand. Journey into the afterlife . Luckily, dampness isn't an issue in the new tomb -- some Egyptologists attending an official inauguration reportedly burst into tears when they saw how accurate it was. The facsimile tomb recreates the paintings -- which depict the young pharaoh's journey into the afterlife -- in their existing damaged form from images taken in 2009. Carved masonry inside the structure, including the sarcophagus in the middle of the burial chamber that once contained King Tut's mummy, have been recreated using resin. Both the tombs are currently open to the public, but the plan is eventually to close the original to allow for conservation work. And, no doubt, offer some peace and quiet to Tutankhamun, whose remains are still there, protected by a glass case. Social and political turmoil . The new tomb also help safeguard one of the Egypt's key attractions at a time when social and political turmoil is wreaking heavy damage on its tourism industry, pushing takings down by 43% according to some reports. Egypt unveils massive restored statues . ""Our heritage is something that gives Egypt its unique identity; preserving it through such projects is vitally important,"" said Omayma El Husseini, a spokesman for Egypt's tourism board. ""They also ensure visitors have the opportunity to experience pharaonic sites of significance, allowing them to stay for longer periods to fully appreciate the importance and relevance of such projects."" The $690,000 replica is the work of Factum Arte, a Madrid-based conservation team also engaged in similar projects to recreate the important tombs of Queen Nefertari and Seti I. ""This remarkable project is a fine example of how new technology can preserve and indeed promote Egypt's rich archaeological heritage,"" James Moran, the European Union's ambassador to Egypt, said at the ceremony to open the new tomb. ""It should also help to revive much needed tourism in the unique area of Luxor, something that is badly needed for the development of Upper Egypt.""

"North Korea said Tuesday that it had promoted a little-known general to a key military rank, a day after it announced that it had relieved its army chief of all his government posts. The secretive state's top two military commissions have decided to give the title of vice marshal to Hyon Yong Chol, according to a report by the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The KCNA report did not say whether Hyon will replace Ri Yong Ho, the departed army chief. Ri held the title of vice marshal along with other military and party posts before his removal. North Korea said Monday that it was relieving Ri from all his posts due to an unspecified illness. The news prompted speculation among analysts that there might be a power struggle between North Korea's powerful military and civilian elite. Kim Jong Un became ""supreme leader"" of North Korea after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in December. Ri -- who was appointed army chief in February 2009, according to KCNA -- was considered one of Kim Jong Un's closest aides during and after his rise to power. There are several other vice marshals in North Korea at the moment. Those holding the title are considered to be eligible for key posts in the upper echelons of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea. Not much is known about Hyon, but his promotion is probably the work of Kim Jong Un's uncle, Jang Song Taek, an influential figure behind Kim's rise, according to Park Soo-geun, a former commander of the South Korean Defense Intelligence Command. ""He was promoted in 2010 to the rank equivalent to that of four-star general together with Kim Jong Un,"" Park said of Hyon. ""But being promoted to vice marshal means he will now show off his power at the political stage,"" Park, a retired South Korean major general, added. Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University in South Korea, agreed with Park's assessment. ""This follows a pattern we have seen since at least last March,"" Lankov said. ""People who can be described as the Jang Song Taek group are taking the upper hand. It seems Jang Song Taek may be removing people who might constitute a threat to him."" If so, this may be the the first purge under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, Lankov said. ""Not necessarily a bloody one but the first case of a person of great political significance being removed,"" Lankov said. Korea observers may soon find out what's happening inside the secretive nation, said Han Park, a professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia and director of the school's Center for the Study of Global Issues. ""If it is a power struggle of that nature, we will see some ensuing changes in top personnel,"" he said. ""Unless we see that, (Ri's stepping down) is really for personal reasons, such as illness."" Park said he saw Ri in April at a banquet in Pyongyang celebrating the 100th anniversary of the birth of the nation's founder, Kim Il Sung. ""He didn't appear to be a very healthy person,"" Park said. ""His kind of color is a little dark, and it didn't appear to be very healthy."" Still, he said, he was ""shocked"" when he heard the news that Ri had been removed from his posts. ""He's a very formidable person there,"" Park said.","Removal could be evidence of first leadership purge under new leader, analyst says .

"How can you not love Hong Kong? Home of Bruce Lee, divine dim sum, lofty buildings, loftier real estate prices and -- in spite of all those buildings -- easy access to incredible stretches of great outdoors. It's been more than 15 years since the British handed Hong Kong over to Chinese rule but little has changed. Hong Kong remains a competitive and independent city, consistently ranked as one of the world's best places to live. But don't take our word for it. Here are 10 things this great city does better than anywhere else. 1. Tonal talents . Native English speakers who've managed to learn Cantonese from scratch: give yourselves a pat on the back. The language has a total of six to nine tones, depending on where you're hearing it, compared to English's zero tones. No other Asian language comes close. (There are four tones in Mandarin, five in Thai and six in Vietnamese). That's kind of like saying one English word can be pronounced six different ways and have at least six different meanings. Locals like to say this makes us particularly good at music (certain karaoke sessions have proven otherwise) and studies have shown there's some truth to this. To add to the complexity -- and fun -- of the language, Cantonese is a dialect with new slang invented everyday and many words aren't used in written communication. Intimidated? Check out Carlos Douh's YouTube channel, the Internet's most entertaining Cantonese language teacher, for quick and easy Cantonese lessons. 2. Staying alive . Don't wanna get murdered? Come to Hong Kong! The city not only has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, it ranks third in a list compiled by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 2011 of places with the least homicides. Hong Kong -- with an intentional homicide rate of 0.2 per 100,000 people in the last 16 years -- only lost out to Monaco and Palau, where there have been zero recorded murders. When you consider that Hong Kong has a population of more than 7 million crammed into a city of 1,104 square kilometers, while Monaco only has about 36,000 people and idyllic island nation Palau about 20,000, Hong Kong definitely triumphs as the safest city in the world. 3. Getting you there . Hong Kong is really good at getting you where you need to go. The public transportation system is famous around the world for its efficiency and profitability, making Hong Kong one of the least car-dependent cities, with only about 710,000 registered vehicles. In particular, the MTR Corporation that operates Hong Kong's subway system is so good at what they do they run other city's trains as well, including operating sections of subway lines in Beijing, Hangzhou, Shenzhen, London and the whole of Melbourne and Stockholm's underground networks. 4. Building into the sky . When you've got a heck of a lot of people and very little land, what do you do? Hong Kong's solution is to stack them up on top of each other, inside tall buildings. Once the city started doing it, it couldn't stop. Hong Kong now has 1,251 skyscrapers and high-rises, the most in the world, creating a dramatic skyline. There's the bamboo-like Bank of China by renowned architect I.M. Pei and the 490-meter International Commerce Centre (Hong Kong's tallest), the latter of which will become a gigantic art piece at the hands of sound artist Carsten Nicolai during Art Basel Hong Kong 2014. 5. Daredevil construction . Most of those skyscrapers were built using bamboo scaffolding, an old craft that involves tying long pieces of  sturdy bamboo together to form a freestanding grid structure for workmen to hang out on. Daredevil scaffolders dangling precariously on bits of bamboo suspended in midair, with a small harness for support, are a common and heart-stopping sight in Hong Kong's streets. While most other cities are using steel and aluminium scaffolding, Hong Kong stands by bamboo, even establishing a licensing system through the Hong Kong Construction Industry Council. There are now more than 1,700 bamboo scaffolders registered with the Construction Workers Registration Board. 6. Letting you keep your money . As a financial center that's historically been seen as the gateway to the Chinese market, Hong Kong is a great place to make money. What truly sets it apart is that residents actually get to keep most of the money they earn. With one of the lowest salaries tax rates in the world, capped at 15-17% and no sales tax or VAT, Hong Kong is an attractive place to work and play. The profits tax rate is the same for foreign and local companies at a low 16.5% and there's no capital gains tax in Hong Kong. That doesn't make the local government a charity case though. Property and shares trade keep the government flush -- Financial Secretary John Tsang estimates an HK$12 billion surplus for this year. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the salaries tax rate. The error has been corrected. 7. Kung fu movies . Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chow Yun Fat, Maggie Cheung, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai ... the list of Hong Kong's cinematic heavy hitters goes on. For a relatively small city (population 7 million) tucked away in a far corner of East Asia, Hong Kong sure has produced a lot of Hollywood-worthy stars. But it's the city's kung fu movies that are the most recognized. ""Enter the Dragon,"" ""Fist of Fury,"" ""Once Upon a Time in China,"" and ""Drunken Master"" are just a few of the classics that come to mind. Much of the city's cinematic martial arts glory is due to the efforts of one legendary movie mogul: Sir Run Run Shaw, who passed away at the age of 107 in January. Shaw put Hong Kong movies on the map by inventing and popularizing kung fu genre films in the 1970s and pushing co-productions such as ""Blade Runner."" Despite all that clout Shaw never got to work with Bruce Lee, as the kung fu superstar was offered a better deal by rival Golden Harvest early in his career.

Most love the efficiency, the fast connection to the city through the Airport Express, and the frequent traveler system that allows jet setters to use a fast lane through immigration. The airport is one of the most lauded in the world, winning nearly 40 awards from international operations since it opened in 1998 and ranking atop Skytrax's World's Best Airport list for eight years in a row. Sure, it's recently been toppled from the throne by Singapore's Changi Airport. But Hong Kong handles more passenger traffic, 53 million passengers in 2011. Take that, Singapore. 9. Foodie-ism . Hong Kong: 7 million people, 15,000 restaurants. This is a city of unashamedly camera-toting, food-blogging, lip-smacking gourmands. And while we don't have the restaurant density of New York City, our diversity is staggering. Foodies here will have lunch at a three Michelin star restaurant and dinner at a street-side dai pai dong hawker stall. Our cha chaan teng diners can whip up fantastical East-meets-West dishes, considered sacrilegious anywhere else in the world -- ever tried a syrup-slathered French toast filled with satay beef slices? Or instant noodles dressed in a cheese sauce? No? You haven't lived. Take it from this city of people who are very good at eating. 10. Partying so hard the neighbors want in on it . First time visitors to Hong Kong's party area, Lan Kwai Fong, might think they've entered a time warp, suddenly appearing in Ibiza or Cancun at 9 p.m. on a Friday night. The area crams more than 100 bars, restaurants, clubs and shops into just a few short streets (and in the high-rises along the streets), which themselves are nearly always crammed with expats, flight attendants and other 9-to-5 refugees. Neon lights blur into happy hour signs, which blur into fridges filled with garishly colored vodka jelly shots. Come special events, such as the Rugby Sevens or New Year's Eve, the area gets ridiculously, lung-crushingly crowded. Lankwaifong.com claims it's ""Hong Kong's premiere dining and entertainment destination,"" which makes it sound somewhat more sophisticated than it really is. But for turning a rubbish Tuesday workday into a heady, beery, feels-like-Friday evening, where you're guaranteed to meet someone you know, there's no place like it. It's so successful that Chinese cities are asking Lan Kwai Fong Group to re-create the nightlife districts in their cities, namely Lan Kwai Fong Chengdu and Lan Kwai Fong Wuxi.

"(CNN)Today, as we celebrate the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., I know there are those who will ask, ""How long will it take?"" How long until the dream is fulfilled? How long until our destination is reached? But, like Dr. King, we must continue to march on. We march on toward the realization of the American Dream. We are not diverted by those who would deny opportunity based on what we look like or where we came from or who would deny equality based on who we love. We march on poverty, until every child has the nourishment of body and mind needed to fuel their chance at success. We must find ways to bring those from the ""outskirts of hope"" closer to the circle of opportunity. We march on ballot boxes, because the rights for which we fought are too important to give up now. And no one should silence us simply because they might disagree with our views. We march on because all lives matter, not to be judged by the color of their skin. How long? Not long, because the images and words and fights of half a century ago still have the power to rouse us to march. How long? I don't really know. But as Dr. King once told us, ""the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" This year, I know I am not the only one with the Oscar-nominated ""Selma"" on my mind. Across the country, people are lining up in theaters and watching a raw image of the sacrifice 600 voting rights marchers made: as they pursued the right to vote, they were brutally attacked by police using billy clubs and tear gas. The lessons of the struggle depicted in this movie are important, important enough to be mindful of them every day. But we should be especially mindful as we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Today is a day of national reflection, but it is also a day of action. Remembering those who sacrificed before us is important, but carrying on their legacy and continuing to march forward is essential. The walk from Selma to Montgomery that turned into Bloody Sunday leaves us with a strong reminder of how much those before us gave for basic human rights. The walk is a strong reminder of how John Lewis stood side-by-side with Dr. King, so that today he can stand in the chambers of Congress and continue to use his voice to fight, as he did 50 years ago, for the right to vote. Because even though 50 years have passed since the marches of 1965 that led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we are still in that fight today. Just last week, Republican House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte said that it's not ""necessary"" to fix the mangled Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to burdensome and unfair voting restrictions. All I can say is he either does not read the news or he doesn't think protecting all eligible Americans' right to vote is important. In the last election cycle, we saw the country take significant steps backward as more states restricted the right to vote. In Ohio and Wisconsin, Republicans passed measures limiting the times polls are open and cutting weekend voting typically favored by black and low-income voters. In North Carolina, Republicans passed what have been called the ""nation's most restrictive voting laws,"" establishing rules that make it more difficult for people to register to, and actually, vote. In Texas, students were banned from using student IDs as a valid form of identification, while recently married or divorced women were stopped from voting if their names did not match their IDs. And it's important to remember that all of these new voting restrictions are aimed at addressing a problem that does not exist. Reported cases of voter fraud are incredibly rare, so it's puzzling why the GOP is so insistent on pushing these laws. One thing we do know is that these laws disproportionately affect women, young people, the elderly, African-American and Latino voters -- voters who traditionally vote for Democrats. Those negatively affected by these unnecessary, indeed oppressive, voting restrictions constitute over half of the voting population. The 2014 midterm elections left us with even more conservative state houses and more conservative governors, so it's never been more important that we remain vigilant in fighting back against these discriminatory measures. When more voices are heard, our country is better for it. When more voices are heard, the leaders better represent the views of those they represent. Our country has seen unrest this year, and as our civil rights leaders taught us, a vote is the clearest way to make our voices heard, to stand up for our convictions. We have such a pressing moral obligation to live up to the name of this day. For Dr. King who gave his life, along with many others including Jimmie Lee Jackson, Viola Liuzzo and the Rev. James Reeb, for the 600 individuals who made unbelievable sacrifices that day in Selma, for our children who should not have to face the same hardship the men and women before us had to face. Let's honor this day and those who fought for freedom before us, and let's keep fighting for the things we still believe make us the country we are today. Let us continue to march on.","Donna Brazile: Anniversary of Selma 50 years ago reminds us work on rights continues .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish singer and actor Ibrahim Tatlises was in critical condition Monday after being shot in the head by unknown assailants early Monday morning, his doctor said on television. Tatlises, who has millions of fans in Turkey and the Middle East, was shot in the right side of his brain and underwent surgery, Dr. Ilhan Elmaci said in front of the Acibadem Hospital. Tatlises and his spokeswoman, Buket Cakici, were shot as they left the building housing private Turkish television channel Beyaz TV following Tatlises' weekly television show. Cakici was in stable condition, doctors said. Tatlises will be kept ""asleep"" for 24 hours, Elmaci said, adding that his left side was paralyzed upon his arrival at the hospital. Elmaci said he does not believe that Tatlises will have problems with speech, as the side of the head that was injured does not control speech abilities. Tatlises, 59, comes from Turkey's mostly Kurdish-populated southeastern province of Sanliurfa. He also is a businessman who owns restaurants and music, television production and tourism businesses. He has been involved in construction projects in northern Iraq. Known as ""Emperor"" and ""Ibo,"" Tatlises has more than 30 albums and has acted in and directed more than a dozen movies. He has no formal education and once quipped: ""If there had been an Oxford (University) in Sanliurfa, I would have gone there."" Tatlises was at the height of his entertainment career in the 1980s when he acted in more than a dozen films, directed and writing several of them, according to the Internet Movie Database. CNN's Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","Ibrahim Tatlises was shot early Monday .

"(CNN)Hidden, but vocal, average Syrians are questioning one of the most feared terror groups in the world and attempting to hold them accountable for crimes committed against the civilian population. From an undisclosed location, a Syrian activist operating under the pseudonym Abu Rafiq spoke to CNN about the war taking place on one of ISIS's main front lines -- social media. The targets of the grassroots offensive are foreign fighters, notorious for using their Twitter and Facebook accounts to encourage young people to join their jihad. ""We would like to deliver this message to those who are joining ISIS especially from Europe, America, and some Arab countries and make them understand this is not the way, and this is not humility and this is not Islam,"" Abu Rafiq says, ""You can't just go and let some guy brainwash you and make you think you will go to paradise."" A handful of natives split evenly inside the ISIS strongholds of Raqqah and Abu Kamal recently launched the hashtags ""Scream from al-Raqqah"" and ""Abu Kamal Under Fire"" to heckle ISIS extremists and share photos and news from the occupied cities. Some of the images are grotesque; one shows a decapitated man tied to a pole with his head in his lap, a warning of the consequences that may befall any who violate the terror group's draconian rule. Other images seem to act almost as a proof of life -- a small sheet of paper held close to the camera with the name of Abu Rafiq's group scribbled in blue ink, and in the background a recognizable landmark. ""We are hear (sic) and we continue to reveal ISIS's crimes,"" a caption on Twitter reads. Taking these types of photographs has already landed two of the activists in the custody of jihadis, according to Abu Rafiq who said that ISIS did not realize they were part of an organized opposition group and released them after a few days. But at least one endured torture at the hands of his captors, he said. ""The regime played the media card and ISIS did the same, and they are both very good at this,"" Abu Rafiq said explaining the importance of press coverage. ""So I thought we have to do something about this, and all of the Syrian people thought the same, so I am one of those who joined against ISIS."" They were once taxi drivers and medical students, but now these activists are among the brave few engaging ISIS militants directly online -- questioning their beliefs and then posting the interactions for the world to see. ""Look at the murders of ISIS they cant (sic) even make excuses because they are brainwashed and they are like pieces on a chess board and when they are cornered they run away,""  wrote one user above a screen shot showing his account had been blocked by an ISIS fighter after he badgered him online. The online taunting caught the attention of ISIS's central command structure in Syria, and a sleeper cell was ordered to find and destroy the clandestine group, according to a letter Abu Rafiq claims was leaked to his organization. The team of activists has yet to see a crackdown, but remains vigilant. ""We are not scared. It is just a letter. Because when you take a photo in front of ISIS members you are risking your life to deliver the truth from on the ground, so we are used to it,"" he shrugs. Abu Rafiq claims that some foreign fighters are defecting from ISIS, something reported by other activists and local media. He points to a literal sign of this trend -- a billboard warning truck drivers not to pick up or transport jihadis across the country. ""It shows how scared and worried they are because the number defecting is more and more, so they are telling drivers not to help them or take them anywhere,"" he said. Abu Rafiq's underground network is modest so far, but similar groups in the area that have more support and resources -- including one calling itself ""Raqqah is Being Slaughtered Silently"" -- have been threatened with death for publishing reports on the ISIS operation in their hometown. ""Syrian people are very patient, but we have a limit,"" he told CNN. ""What happens with Assad, it might happen with ISIS and with anyone else. I think that might happen very soon.""","Syrian activists are taking the fight to ISIS over social media .

"Hong Kong (CNN)An ancient Chinese system of summoning good luck, feng shui -- literally wind and water -- is part of the fabric of Hong Kong life. Shopping malls, office towers and homes draw on its principles in their design in an attempt to create prosperity. And individuals often consult feng shui masters to decide on the best date to get married, give birth or move house. The run-up up to the Lunar New Year is the busiest time of year for Kerby Kuek, a feng shui practitioner who has published 15 books on the subject. His clients, which include some of Hong Kong's biggest companies, all want their ""annual audit"" to maximize their good fortune in the year to come. He took time out to take CNN on a tour of the city's feng shui hot spots, where the cosmic energy will help you do the Year of the Sheep proud. It's hard to believe that Times Square, the crowded, traffic-clogged heart of Hong Kong shopping district Causeway Bay, enjoys some of the city's best feng shui. But imagine the towering skyscrapers are mountains and the endless procession of cars, taxis and delivery trucks a meandering river and it all begins to make sense, says Kuek. Causeway Bay benefits from what Kuek calls a ""feng shui meridian"" between four peaks and it's built atop two ""dragon pulses"" that flow into Hong Kong in the form of mountain ranges. It's this that attracts the hordes of free-spending shoppers that make the place a goldmine for retailers and landlords. If you can put up with the crowds and the noise, Causeway Bay is also lucky place to call home, says Kuek, who lives here. How to get there: Causeway Bay MTR . Two bronze lions stand guard at the entrance to the HSBC Building in downtown Hong Kong, protecting the money within. Some locals like to stroke their paws and noses in a hope their good feng shui fortune will rub off. The bank, says Kuek, harnesses energy from the five mountains nearby -- benefiting it and the surrounding buildings. But it's a different tale a short walk away at the IFC or International Finance Center -- Hong Kong island's tallest building. Built on reclaimed land that interrupts the flow of water in the harbor, the building's ""unkind energy"" leads to grievances -- not least, he says, for the family that built it. The three Kwok brothers behind property developer Sun Hung Kai became embroiled in a years-long family feud and the eldest has been indicted on misconduct charges in a corruption case that gripped the city. How to get there: Central MTR . The striking Hong Kong government headquarters, known as Tamar, were the focus of massive pro-democracy protests that rocked the city late last year. This was no coincidence according to Kuek. The government has been beset by difficulties since it moved to the new building in 2011. Like the IFC, the building is sited on reclaimed land and radiates ""bad energy"" he says. ""Reclamation is changing Hong Kong's feng shui,"" he says. ""We should stop now or things may get worse."" How to get there: Admiralty MTR . Just south of Hong Kong's border with China, a small path in the village of Sheung Shui leads to this ancestral hall. It was built in 1751 for the now rich and prosperous Liu clan to worship their ancestors, but the plot of land originally belonged to the rival Kan clan, says Kuek. In order to claim the ""feng shui hot spot"" for themselves, the Liu clan chased out the Kans and built their hall. But to appease the ancestors of their rivals, they made offerings to the Kam's forefathers as well as their own. To this day, the Kans are unhappy about the ""kidnapping"" of their ancestors and blame the Liu clan for their family's bad fortune. This spring they'll perform a ritual to invite their ancestors back to their own hall, says Kuek. How to get there: Sheung Shui MTR, 15 minute walk . Che Kung Temple in Shatin is as good a place as any to ring in The Year of the Sheep, but it hasn't always been an auspicious spot. The original temple was built by villagers 300 years ago in an desperate attempt to halt the spread of a plague outbreak. Legend has it that the epidemic began to subside the day the temple was completed, says Kuek. On the third day of the Lunar New Year, which this year falls on Saturday, it now attracts crowds of worshipers who light incense and wish for good health. It's also where, each year, a government official draws a fortune stick in a divination ritual thought to foretell Hong Kong's luck in the coming year. The message is written in classical Chinese and interpreted by a feng shui master. How to get there: MTR Che Kung Temple Station . A 15-minute boat ride from the stilted fishing village of Tai O lies a tiny village with a shady past. In the 1950s and 60s, many of the village's women left to work as prostitutes in Macau, Kuek says. Alarmed, village elders consulted a local feng shui master, who identified an ""obscene rock"" on the headland near the village that resembled a naked man ""showing off his private parts,"" he tells me.

"West Hollywood, California (CNN) -- From the time it was first incorporated by a group of gay activists, West Hollywood has styled itself as America's gayest city. Throughout the '80s and '90s it was a magnet for young gay men and lesbians looking for a place where they could fit in and be accepted. It was a place of bohemian lifestyles and bold experimentation. It's a town where the American flag and the gay pride rainbow flag fly side by side. ""We founded this city on an ideal that people could come here to remake their lives,"" says city council candidate John D'Amico. But it is a principal that D'Amico and others believe is slipping away. Gentrification has become a major issue in Tuesday's city elections. Challengers to three incumbent council members up for re-election say city policies have boosted development, but high rents are squeezing out the young and the innovative. Lynn Pickwell has lived in West Hollywood for 23 years. She doesn't like some of the changes that she has seen. ""The city sold out to developers,"" according to Pickwell. ""They have destroyed old buildings for the construction of million dollar cookie-cutter condos."" The gay bars and dance clubs still line Santa Monica Boulevard. And the Sunset Strip still bristles with rock clubs. But is the city that was once a hipster haven morphing into suburban conformity? Most of the rough edges that once defined West Hollywood have long since been smoothed over. The notorious gay bath houses and seedy massage parlors are long gone. So too are many of the funky counter-culture boutiques that lent the city a great deal of its charm. In their place one finds fancy day spas, expensive restaurants and upscale merchants. The gay community is still a force in West Hollywood, but today that community has prospered, aged and settled down. Mayor John Heilman says, ""Priorities have shifted."" Heilman believes that West Hollywood may have matured over the last two decades but, ""is still a dynamic and vibrant community."" Resident Dave Coerman agrees, ""I think its still one of the most liberal and progressive communities around."" The 47-year-old Coerman moved his family to West Hollywood just one year ago because, ""The city takes good care of its residents, and if it's a little more conservative I don't think that's a bad thing."" But Scott Schmidt, another city council candidate, believes the city is rapidly losing something special. ""This community has made a promise to the gay and lesbian community of America that this is your home."" And Schmidt says that promise is not being kept because ""access is simply not there for young people to move in and revitalize the community."" Others believe that the creative core of the gay community has already moved east, to neighborhoods in Echo Park, Hollywood and Long Beach. ""I've seen it before,"" says Steven Peros. ""It happened in the East Village and Alphabet City in New York when those neighborhoods began to become gentrified."" Is West Hollywood losing its mojo? Mayor Heilman says the city is simply aging gracefully. ""I wish I could be 24 again, too. But that's just not reality.""","In '80s and '90s West Hollywood was a magnet for young gay men and lesbians .

"Al Aour, Egypt (CNN)Mina Aziz had no real education but he did have a strong back. With marriage on his mind and empty pockets, the 24-year-old left his Egyptian village for Libya. Aziz was one of many Egyptians who go to Libya looking for work, but his journey ended in horror. He was one of 21 Egyptian Christians killed at the hands of ISIS' Libyan branch. The Islamic militants released a gruesome video Sunday showing the beheadings of at least a dozen of the men on a beach. Thirteen of the dead were from Aziz's village, Al Aour, roughly 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Cairo. One mother in the village, Om Beshir, lost two of her sons in the ISIS slaughter. Before their abduction, they had talked about their planned return home to celebrate Christmas. ""They said, Ma, cook all the holiday food,"" she tells me. ""But the bastards kidnapped them. Like they deprived me of my sons, I hope God deprives them."" The Egyptian military responded to the horrific killings by bombing ISIS targets in Libya on Monday. The 21 Egyptian Christians were seized in the Libyan city of Sirte in two separate incidents in December and January. Hana Aziz says he was almost taken, too. Masked men came for his cousins and nephew in the adjacent room. Hana Aziz says he witnessed the scene unfold through a crack in the wall, hearing the militants announce they had orders from ""the emir"" to arrest all Christians in Sirte. He managed to escape into the desert with 15 others. Now back home in the dusty streets of Al Aour, he is avoiding his family. ""I feel guilty,"" he says. ""First of all, the situation was difficult, more than you can imagine. How can your nephew be taken from your hand? How can you face your brother or your uncle? What would you tell them?"" Despite the grisly video of the men's deaths, Hana Aziz takes solace in one aspect of what it shows. ""To the last moment, the name of Jesus was on their lips,"" he says. ""As they were being martyred, they were calling God's name, saying, 'God, have mercy on us.' The entire village is proud."" Hana Aziz says he won't return to Libya, but some of his neighbors probably will. Like other villages in the region, Al Aour is impoverished and work is scarce. Libya offers young men like Mina Aziz a chance to earn money. At his home, his boyish face stares out of a photo clutched by grieving relatives. In the picture, his jeans and dressy black shirt belie the type of labor he did. ""He was a worker, he used to carry sand and rocks, what else could he do?"" says Mina Aziz's mother, Afaf. ""He didn't have a trade. He would have taken any job offered to him."" CNN's Ian Lee reported and wrote from Al Aour, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","Thirteen of the 21 Egyptian Christians killed by ISIS in Libya were from Al Aour .

"(CNN)She waited patiently for 10 years for a chance to perform on the highest stage and when it finally arrived Nadine Angerer did not fluff her lines. Thrust into the spotlight at the 2007 Women's World Cup, the perennial reserve goalkeeper put in a virtuoso performance, going unbeaten for a world record 540 minutes during Germany's victorious campaign that year. In keeping a clean sheet for all six matches at the tournament in China, Angerer became the first goalkeeper, male or female, to play an entire World Cup Finals without conceding a goal. ""The whole tournament I wasn't thinking about it because I was so much under pressure. I was just focusing on not making any mistakes,"" Angerer told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""But after the World Cup, it was like  ... OK cool, I broke this record! But it's not that important for me. I'm more proud that we won the World Cup as a team."" The feat was even more impressive given Germany's opposition in the final -- a Brazil side which had torn apart opposition defenses, scoring 17 goals en route to the final. But they couldn't find a way past Angerer, who repelled everything that came her way, including a penalty from the South American's star striker Marta. ""As a goalkeeper you are always happy when you save a penalty, but it was a special one because we were leading 1-0. It was the final and world star Marta shooting a penalty against a nobody goalkeeper ... it makes me proud. It was an important save."" It was the standout moment that helped launch Angerer's career, finally allowing her to take over from Silke Rottenberg, the veteran who had dominated German goalkeeping since the early 1990s. ""It was destiny,""  Angerer says. ""It was not the easiest way, but it was good way sitting on the bench -- you learn, get experience and it was a good life lesson as well."" Late starter . Born in Lohr a. Main, a town near Frankfurt, Angerer grew up playing football with the boys in the neighborhood before making her mark at junior level for the local ASV Hofstetten girls side. But back then she was more interested in wearing the No. 9 rather than the No. 1 shirt. ""I never wanted to be a goalkeeper, I wanted to be a forward and until Under-16 (level), I was a forward."" After playing in goal in a regional trial match, Angerer was encouraged to keep putting on the gloves. ""When I was 15, I started to train as a goalkeeper and (I progressed) very fast and two years later I got my first cap for the (full national) team."" A handful of appearances followed before she settled into her role as reserve to Rottenberg. It was a situation that suited her just fine at the time. ""I wasn't really mature when I was 17. I said to myself: 'oh, that's easy,' because I was always very athletic and didn't need to train --I was still much better than all the others,"" she recalls of her attitude when she was younger. This relaxed outlook extended to her social life when she started her club career at Bayern Munich -- Angerer would spend her days organizing her back four and her nights arranging to go to parties. ""I moved out of home and moved to Munich by myself, my own flat. I enjoyed the night life, the party stuff."" But Rottenberg's more mature approach -- ""she really trained hard,"" Angerer says -- would eventually rub off and when the veteran keeper injured her knee just weeks before the 2007 World Cup, Angerer was prepared. ""I was waiting 10 years and I'd developed so much as a goalkeeper. I trained so hard and I wanted to be the No. 1 ... it was now my time to show it."" Leading from the back . Further triumphs followed at the Women's European Championships in both 2009 and 2013 -- where she reprised her penalty-saving heroics not once, but twice in the final against Norway. It was Germany's sixth successive Euro triumph in all, but it was in many ways her finest moment as she captained a severely depleted German team to glory. ""Before the European championships, seven players from our normal line up got injured ... and so we had to replace (them) with some very, very young players. I think our average age was 22, 23,"" she explains. ""This was the tournament which showed me what you can achieve if you have a good team spirit -- we definitely weren't the best team at that tournament. ""But we won it because we were a team and that made me so proud. This was actually the most important tournament I ever played."" Her outstanding individual performance and leadership skills didn't go unnoticed by the wider football community who voted Angerer the world women's player of the year in 2013 at FIFA's annual Ballon d'Or ceremony in January last year. Real Madrid and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo may have taken all the headlines, picking up his second best player award, but once again Angerer was quietly celebrating another first -- she is the only goalkeeper, male or female, to win the award. Forward thinking . Angerer has enjoyed successful stints at German clubs, winning the Bundesliga twice (2004 and 2006) and a UEFA Women's Champions League with Turbine Potsdam, and latterly the DFB Pokal Cup with Frankfurt in 2011. Since 2013, she has divided her time between the U.S. and Australia, playing for the Portland Thorns in the U.S. National Women's Soccer League, and on loan at the Brisbane Roars in the  Australian W-League. The experience of playing abroad, particularly in the U.S., has helped her game evolve, she says. ""It was a perfect experience for me to go to the U.S. and adjust to a new system and a new way of playing soccer.  I learned so many new things ... it's totally different compared to the game in Europe,"" she says. ""My goalkeeping coach from the national team and my head coach, were both like: 'Wow! You've developed so much.' That makes me proud as well. ""That's also my motivation that I always have the feeling to keep getting better and better ... even if I'm quite old."" Watching her dive around athletically on the Brisbane turf, it's easy to envisage Angerer carrying on for several more years at the top level. One day, she hopes to coach the next generation of keepers, but it seems that can be saved for later. ""I'm 36 and I feel better than ever, so there's no reason to quit. Why should I? I feel good, I'm fit and most importantly, I like what I'm doing.""","Veteran German goalkeeper has won World Cup twice, once as reserve, once as a player .

"Airstrikes like those that have helped slow the advance of ISIS fighters in the Syrian town of Kobani rocked the city again Saturday. A huge plume of smoke rose over the city's center in the aftermath of an apparent airstrike that hit the area with three large blasts, according to CNN crews watching from bordering Turkey. While accounts from within the city differed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian Kurdish forces who have retaken parts of the city fought with ISIS fighters south of the city, near the border crossing with Turkey. A fighter in Kobani who declined to be identified for security reasons said clashes also occurred in the city's eastern neighborhoods. A civilian who similarly declined to be identified said there was no front-line fighting or shelling of the city. Kurdish and Free Syrian Army forces were fanning out across the city probing for ISIS soldiers, the fighter told CNN. Opinion: From guerrillas to conquerors: How ISIS has changed . U.S. warplanes struck only twice Friday and Saturday in Kobani, the U.S. Central Command said Saturday. Both targeted ISIS fighting positions, the military said. That's far fewer airstrikes than in recent days -- U.S. jets flew at least 14 missions near Kobani on Thursday and Friday, according to Central Command. And although Central Command commander Gen. Lloyd Austin warned Friday that the city still could fall, ISIS militants appear to have vanished from at least portions of the city, the Kobani fighter told CNN. While the Kurdish and Free Syrian Army troops feel victorious, the fighter said they remain wary of ambushes and booby traps left behind. Opposition group: ISIS militants training to fly warplanes in Syria . The civilian who spoke to CNN said water has become an issue, with residents and fighters drawn to wells that are common for homes in the city. In other developments in the fight against ISIS: . -- At least seven civilians died in a U.S. airstrike on an ISIS-controlled oilfield near the city of Khusham, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Three more died in a strike near the village of Kabiba, the group said. The U.S. Central Command said that it had bombed ISIS crude oil collecting points and refineries, including three strikes on a facility northeast of Khusham. The military statement, however, made no mention of civilian casualties. -- Airstrikes also targeted ISIS units in Iraq, destroying an armed vehicle a machine gun position, a building occupied by the group and three guard shacks near Bayji. Airstrikes near Mosul hit an ISIS building, machine gun and vehicle and three small ground units. -- Iraq's Parliament approved the appointment of a Shiite to the job of interior minister and a Sunni as defense minister, a member of the parliament, Ali al-A'laq, told CNN. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi had promised to fill the two vacant jobs and give one to a Shiite as part of efforts to heal sectarian divides in the country. Those divisions have been blamed, in part, for allowing ISIS to make the gains it has.

"Boat after boat, body after body from a capsized South Korean ferry came ashore Sunday morning, a solemn process interrupted by piercing cries and screams from passengers' kin. The wrenching scene came after four police boats arrived in rapid succession. The first carried four bodies. The second boat had three more, likewise the third and fourth. Each body was taken onto a stretcher on the dock in Jindo, draped in cloth. After an inspection, they were carried along a path guarded by police -- who themselves shed tears -- and past even more outwardly emotional family members. These relatives cried and, in some cases, yelled loudly, clearly overtaken by the moment. Some of those shouts came from inside the identification tent. One man yelled out, ""Wake up! Wake up, please!"" The arrival of the 13 bodies corresponds with the South Korean coast guard's announcement, a short time earlier, that the death toll had increased by that number, up to 50. But few expect it to stop there. While 174 were rescued shortly after the vessel sunk Wednesday, there have been none saved since despite extensive, exhaustive searches by air, from ships and by divers plunging into the frigid waters and ideally inside the now completely submerged ship itself. The number of those unaccounted for stood at 252 early Sunday. Relatives of some of them gathered in Jindo -- the nearest port to the wreckage some 12 miles (20 kilometers) away -- were asked earlier in the weekend to submit DNA samples. Ship's captain defends evacuation . As divers and others scrambled to retrieve yet more bodies, details are trickling in about what happened the day the ferry capsized. Capt. Lee Joon Seok defended his order to delay the evacuation of his sinking ferry, CNN affiliate YTN reported early Saturday. Lee was charged with abandoning his boat, negligence, causing bodily injury, not seeking rescue from other ships and violating ""seamen's law,"" state media reported. He appeared before reporters in handcuffs. ""Mr. Lee is charged with causing the Sewol ship to sink by failing to slow down while sailing the narrow route and making (a) turn excessively,"" prosecutor Lee Bong-chang told the semiofficial Yonhap news agency. ""Lee is also charged with failing to do the right thing to guide the passengers to escape and thereby leading to their death or injury."" If convicted, he faces from five years to life in prison. Lee wasn't at the helm of the Sewol when it started to sink; a third mate was at the helm, a prosecutor said. Where was the captain? The captain was not in the steering room when the accident occurred, according to police and his own account. He was in his cabin. A crew member, described as the third mate and identified only as Park, appeared in handcuffs with Lee. Park is facing charges including negligence and causing injuries leading to deaths, said Yang Joong Jin, a maritime police spokesman. A technician with the surname Cho is also facing the same charges, he said. Lee answered questions as he left a court hearing Saturday. ""The tidal current was strong and water temperature was cold, and there was no rescue boat,"" he told reporters, according to CNN affiliate YTN. ""So I had everyone stand by and wait for the rescue boat to arrive."" He said he plotted the ship's course, and then went to his cabin briefly ""to tend to something."" It was then, he said, the accident happened. The third mate, who was at the helm of the ship when Lee left, said she did not make a sharp turn, but ""the steering turned much more than usual."" The captain was one of at least 174 people rescued soon after the Sewol began to sink, violating an ""internationally recognized rule that a captain must stay on the vessel,"" maritime law attorney Jack Hickey said. ""Pretty much every law, rule, regulation and standard throughout the world says that yes, the captain must stay with the ship until all personnel are safely off of the ship, certainly passengers."" More ships, aircraft . Hopes of finding the missing alive dimmed further when the entire boat became submerged Friday. Until then, part of the ship's blue-and-white hull was still poking out of the frigid waters of the Yellow Sea. The coast guard said workers continued to pump air into the hull of the submerged ship, but could not stop its descent.  The ferry boat sank 10 meters (33 feet) farther below the surface of the Yellow Sea overnight, Maritime Police told CNN Saturday. South Korean officials said Saturday they are sending in 176 ships, 28 aircraft and 652 divers to take part in the search and rescue efforts.","The death toll climbs to 50, the South Korean coast guard says .

"The Federal Communications Commission voted 3-2 Thursday to consider lifting its ban on in-flight cell phone use. On the same day, the federal Department of Transportation and three members of Congress took steps to block those calls. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx said in a statement to CNN that he is looking into the possibility of banning in-flight calls, citing its aviation consumer protection authority. The DOT will determine whether allowing calls is ""fair to consumers."" Many people consider the idea of cell phone conversations annoying in the close confines of a plane, and some are casting it as a consumer rights issue. ""Over the past few weeks, we have heard of concerns raised by airlines, travelers, flight attendants, members of Congress and others who are all troubled over the idea of passengers talking on cell phones in flight -- and I am concerned about this possibility, as well,"" Foxx said. Meanwhile, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California) and Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tennessee) introduced legislation on Thursday to ban cell phone conversations on commercial airline flights. House Rep. Bill Shuster, (R-Pennsylvania) has also introduced a bill that would prohibit in-flight voice communications but allow text messaging. Those actions come as the FCC considers whether it should lift its decades-old ban on cell phones on aircraft. Are the two government entities working at cross purposes? Perhaps. But each cites its individual and independent mandates. The FCC has banned in-flight calls for technical reasons. But new technology has made that ban obsolete, the commission says, and there's no reason to continue it. The DOT, which includes the Federal Aviation Administration, is entrusted with safe air travel, but also with protecting the rights of air travelers. Phones on a plane: To talk or not to talk? The FCC has been pelted with criticism in the last several weeks after the commission's new chairman made the announcement. ""I'm the last person in the world who wants to listen to someone talking to me while I fly across the country,""  FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler -- who proposed the change -- told a congressional panel Thursday. ""But we are the technical agency, and we will make the rules for the way the new technology works."" The current requirement that cell phones may not be used in-flight would actually be expanded to include all bands, said Wheeler, unless airlines install new on-board equipment that prevents interference with terrestrial networks. ""The proposal would not require airlines to either install such equipment, or to offer mobile wireless services aboard their aircraft"" he said. ""Airlines would be free, within the confines of the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Department of Transportation (DOT), to make their own decisions.  We simply propose that because new technology makes the old rule obsolete the FCC should get government out from between airlines and their passengers."" Your view: Would allowing cell phones on flights open Pandora's chatterbox? ""If we move beyond what we do here today and actually update our rules to allow voice calls on planes we can see a future where our quiet time is monetized and seating in the silent section comes at a premium,"" said FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, who voted in favor of the proposal. The Association of Flight Attendants, a union that has been leading a campaign against cell phone calls in-flight, promised to continue lobbying against the proposal. ""As the last line of defense in our nation's aviation system, flight attendants understand the importance of maintaining a calm cabin environment, and passengers agree,"" said AFA president Veda Shook, in a statement. A Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday indicates most Americans want silence when they fly, with 59% saying they don't want the use of cell phones on airplanes and only 30% saying they are in favor of lifting the ban. A mute button is also a strong option among those polled. Even a majority of tech-reliant younger respondents, ages 18 to 29, are against using phones on planes -- 52% opposed to 39% in favor. The FCC is taking public input on the proposal, and an agency statement says officials will consider consumer and stakeholder opinion before taking any final action. The agency offers more information on its website, including a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) and a means of filing comments online. Rep. Shuster told CNN that crying babies and snoozing adults cause enough commotion on flights, and cell phone calls will only make matters worse. ""Tap, don't talk,"" Shuster said.

"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong's unpopular chief executive C.Y. Leung, nicknamed ""the wolf"" by detractors, has one Lunar New Year's request for his city's people: . Be more like sheep. ""Last year was no easy ride for Hong Kong,"" said the pro-Beijing leader in an official statement released Wednesday. ""In the coming year, I hope that all people in Hong Kong will take inspiration from the sheep's character and pull together in an accommodating manner to work for Hong Kong's future. ""Sheep are widely seen to be mild and gentle animals living peacefully in groups,"" explained Leung. At first glance, the statement might seem innocent enough -- perhaps even cute. But it's a sharp rebuke to thousands of Hong Kongers who staged a massive protest just three months ago in an unsuccessful call for Leung's resignation. Popularly known as the ""Umbrella Movement,"" demonstrators occupied major roads for over two months and demanded genuine universal suffrage: the right to nominate and elect their next leader. Leung -- who was elected by a small committee dominated by Beijing loyalists -- staunchly resisted the protests. Alan Leong, a legislator who participated in the demonstrations, was horrified by Leung's New Year wish. ""Does he know he has been called a wolf by Hong Kong people?"" he said. ""So is it the wolf speaking, wanting Hong Kong people to behave like sheep, so as to be slaughtered and eaten up by him? ""I think it's crazy, and he is sick."" The leader's lupine nickname is well-known in the city. In late 2013, a protester hurled an IKEA stuffed wolf at Leung, causing the toy to sell out in stores across the city. Although Hong Kong's pro-democracy street occupations have been dispersed, fierce discontent remains among residents who feel the former British colony's values are collapsing under the weight of mainland China's influence. Protesters have repeatedly vowed to organize new forms of civil disobedience this year. When the largest street camps were cleared in December, many demonstrators left banners with a simple message: ""We'll be back.""","Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader C.Y.

"(CNN) -- Call Shonda Rhimes an ""angry black woman"" if you want, but be prepared for the response. A Twitter firestorm erupted Friday morning when New York Times writer Alessandra Stanley described Rhimes, the producer of ABC's ""Scandal,"" ""Grey's Anatomy"" and the new ""How to Get Away with Murder,"" by using the term ""angry black woman"" in a feature about her. ""When Shonda Rhimes writes her autobiography, it should be called 'How to Get Away With Being an Angry Black Woman,' "" Stanley wrote. The story later observed, ""Ms. Rhimes has embraced the trite but persistent caricature of the Angry Black Woman, recast it in her own image and made it enviable."" Immediately, the Internet reacted, led by a bemused Rhimes, who observed that she didn't create ""How to Get Away with Murder."" ""Confused why @nytimes critic doesn't know identity of CREATOR of show she's reviewing,"" she tweeted in response to a tweet from Pete Nowalk, who did create the series. (Incidentally, Nowalk -- a former ""Grey's"" staffer -- is a white male.) Rhimes was just getting started. ""Apparently we can be 'angry black women' together, because I didn't know I was one either! @petenowa #LearnSomethingNewEveryday,"" she continued. And, noting that Stanley had highlighted a rant from ""Scandal's"" Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) as illustrative of Rhimes' own perceived anger, she wondered why other rants by white characters don't get the same attention. ""Final thing: (then I am gonna do some yoga): how come I am not 'an angry black woman' the many times Meredith (or Addison!) rants? @nytimes,"" she tweeted. ""Grey's"" star Ellen Pompeo, who plays Meredith Grey on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" agreed. ""Didn't Meredith Grey (Medusa) and Christina Yang also terrify and intimidate medical students?"" she tweeted. Others also lit into the Times piece. ""Wow,"" tweeted ""Scandal's"" Joshua Malina. ""Did I just read a @nytimes piece that reduced my brilliant, creative, compassionate, thoughtful, bada** boss to an 'angry black woman?'"" Malina's co-star Washington gave a more pointed response, referring the Times to two articles that dispute the ""angry black woman"" label. ""So Shonda Rhimes is 'angry black woman' but Aaron Sorkin 'delivers an opinionated speech' and 'forceful denunciation',"" posted Sarah Kendzior of ""The Newsroom's"" writer and creator, who's also fond of rants. ""Too many thoughts on the Shonda-Rhimes-Is-An-Angry-Black-Woman debacle. Mostly: REALLY, @nytimes?!"" added Rachel Simon. Stanley wondered what all the fuss was about. ""The whole point of the piece -- once you read past the first 140 characters -- is to praise Shonda Rhimes for pushing back so successfully on a tiresome but insidious stereotype,"" she said in a statement.

"Lionel Messi's remarkable La Liga scoring streak came to an end on Sunday as Barcelona celebrated reclaiming the Spanish title with a less than convincing 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid. Messi started his first domestic match since the end of March, but was taken off in the 68th minute having apparently failed to recover from the injury problems that have dogged the latter part of his season. It meant his run of having scored in 21 successive league matches came to a halt, but Barca did recover from 1-0 down when he left the pitch despite needing to complete the match with only 10 men having made all possible replacements. The victory that leaves the Catalans on course to match Real Madrid's points record from last season. Having clinched a fourth title in five seasons when second-placed Real could only draw with Espanyol on Saturday, Barca went behind five minutes after halftime in the Spanish capital. Gabi dispossessed Gerard Pique and fed the ball to striker Radamel Falcao, who netted his 28th goal this season to stay third in the ""Pichichi"" scoring stakes behind Messi (46) and Cristiano Ronaldo (34). Alexis Sanchez leveled the score five minutes after Messi departed, toe-poking in a low shot after combining well with Cesc Fabregas for his 10th in La Liga. The Chilean was then booked after taking off his shirt to reveal a Mother's Day message. Barca's winner came with 10 minutes to play, and was equally unrepresentative of the elegant play usually associated with the club. Striker David Villa scuffed a shot which deflected off Diego Godin and -- apparently going wide of the goal -- then hit Gabi before bobbling into Thibaut Courtois' net. Ugly as it was, it means Barca can equal Real's tally of 100 points by winning the last three games. Atletico stayed third after the defeat, but can still win a trophy this season by beating city rivals Real in next Friday's Copa del Rey final. Valencia climbed into the fourth Champions League place with a 4-0 win at midtable Rayo Vallecano, moving a point above Real Sociedad -- who host Granada on Monday. Sixth-placed Malaga drew 0-0 with Sevilla, while seventh-placed Real Betis won 1-0 at home to second-bottom Celta Vigo, with Ruben Castro scoring the second-half winner. France . Paris Saint-Germain clinched a first Ligue 1 title since 1994 after winning 1-0 at third-placed Lyon on Sunday. Midfielder Jeremy Menez scored the only goal in the 53rd minute to put big-spending PSG seven points clear of Marseille with two matches to play. It gave coach Carlo Ancelotti a league title in three countries, having previously won in Italy with AC Milan and in England with Chelsea, while star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrated a championship in his fifth different nation. January signing David Beckham came on for a brief cameo in time added on, and is now the first English player to be involved in title-winning teams in four countries. It also represented the first trophy for PSG's Qatari owners, who have spent a reported $320 million on players since taking a controlling share in 2011. ""We fulfilled our objectives of winning the Ligue 1 title and going a long way in the Champions League,"" said Ancelotti, whose team reached the quarterfinals of Europe's top club competition before losing to Barcelona on away goals. ""The squad has worked very hard and were always very professional."" The club's president Nasser Al-Khelaïfi added: ""I am delighted to have won this title after two very tough years. We deserve to win this trophy. We were happy that Marseille won yesterday, because we wanted to win the league with a victory in this match. ""It's a magnificent moment for the club and our supporters. I am so proud of our fans who have been right behind us through thick and thin. They deserve this title too after 19 years.""","Barcelona star Lionel Messi unable to continue his 21-game domestic scoring run .

"While some babies in India are snapped on smartphones the second they are born and their pictures shared on Facebook, others never get access to the internet in their lifetime. Bangalore is known as India's Silicon Valley because the city is a hub of technology entrepreneurs and home to some of the world's top global software companies, but the paradox is that many of its residents have never surfed the Web. India might have the world's second highest number of Facebook users, but according to the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), Internet penetration across the entire population is still below 10 percent. In the UK and U.S. it is 80 percent. IAMAI's research has found that while 20 percent of urban Indians are connected, only three percent of rural Indians are. According to consulting firm Maplecroft, India is among the worst performing countries in the world for digital inclusion. However, attempts are being made to try and bridge the digital divide. More from LeWeb: ITU meeting 'no threat to free speech' Mr Kemperaj from Hennur in north Bangalore specializes in making lamp shades and pillow cases. He used to travel more than 70 km every day to get a sample of his work approved by his vendor. Now he sits in front of a computer, sends the photos by e-mail and surfs the Net to research new designs and discover new sales routes such as eBay. He is one of hundreds of craftspeople who have benefited from ongoing workshops organized by the Internet Society (ISOC)'s Bangalore Chapter. Using an Internet Society Community Grant of US $9,000, ISOC Bangalore is training everyone from tailors and glass cutters to cotton weavers and furniture makers to download pictures, e-mail, video conference, instant message, use Excel and Word, as well as promote their products on Facebook and Twitter. Ankush Bagotra, chairman of ISOC Bangalore, says: ""These artisans had seen computers and heard of the internet but most had never used it or wanted to use it as they did not realize it solved a lot of problems for them. ""One thing is the cost of buying a computer or laptop; another is that broadband infrastructure is not as ubiquitous in India as the U.S. and it's costly for the common man. ""Paying a monthly data fee is also costly and they don't appreciate how it can benefit them."" He says having access to Web and Microsoft tools has empowered the craftspeople to sell their products to a wider custom base, compare their rates to the competition, get new ideas, increase their productivity and learn computerized accounting. More from LeWeb: 'Father of the internet': Why we must fight for its freedom . One group of artisans used to create pages of orders every day. Now they use Excel. Another is using Google Docs and instant messaging to communicate with their clients. ""Often there is no wired connection in villages as there is not a good return on investment to the Internet service provider,"" explains Raghavendra Sathyanarayana, a 31-year-old wireless communications engineer from Bangalore, currently living in Finland. He registered a company, Cramnet (Cognitive Radio Assisted Mobile Network) Wireless Communications in October this year, which he hopes will empower Indians trapped on the wrong side of the digital divide. He plans to use unused spectrum to provide wireless internet free of charge to the digitally disenfranchised in India. ""The Industrial Scientific and Medical Band is an example of spectrum that can already be used for free in secondary mode,"" he explains. He hopes it will enable people to pay bills online, farmers to check wholesale prices of their crops and mothers to know what vaccinations to give their children. More from LeWeb: China looks to lead the Internet of Things . The Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) in Delhi with the support of the Internet Society, has already been installing wireless networks in remote tribal regions using wasted spectrum. Osama Manzar founded DEF in 2002 after resigning from his position as CEO of a software company three years earlier. The 45-year-old says he realized that ""the entire country could leapfrog the developmental cycle if she were to forget about racing for the industrial revolution and aspire for an information revolution instead."" ""There are two unlicensed bands in India which can be used by anybody for non-commercial use,"" he says. Wireless mesh networks have so far been installed at Chanderi a town in Madhya Pradesh, in which more than 60 per cent of the population earn a living from handloom weaving, at Tura in the northeast state Meghalaya, where the Garo tribe lives and in Baran in Rajasthan where the Bheel tribe lives -- they use it to deliver video conferencing to educate tribal children. ""Power is a serious concern in remote areas, but we try to make sure that the supplying nodes are solar-enabled. Having said that even battery back-up is good enough as nobody in remote areas wants a 24/7 service,"" Manzar adds. As for whether efforts should instead be made to provide clean water and electricity first, he says: ""That too is a priority. But they have not been getting it for several centuries and if they do not join the information bandwagon now they will continue to suffer and be exploited. Being part of the digital media, they can at least share their grievances."" So the Wireless for Communities project is not just about giving the digitally ignorant access to information. Another aim is to help those who ""never in the history of India got a chance, to be an equal participant in information creation,"" Manzar says.","The Indian city of Bangalore is home to some of the world's top global software companies .

"A policewoman narrowly escaped injury when a petrol bomb was thrown at a police car in Belfast, police said, as tensions in Northern Ireland prompted by a vote on the flying of the Union flag continue to simmer. At the time of the attack, the car was stationed outside the office of Alliance Party lawmaker Naomi Long, who received a death threat last week. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is treating the incident as an attempted murder. Long, the Alliance Party's sole lawmaker in the UK Parliament at Westminster, has called on British Prime Minister David Cameron to intervene. Read more: Police: Loyalist paramilitaries behind Northern Ireland violence . The violent outbreaks were prompted by a decision on Monday of last week by Belfast city councilors to stop flying the Union flag year-round, restricting it instead to certain days. Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson condemned the attack, saying: ""The attempted murder of a police officer in East Belfast was a despicable act of terror. ""The masked men responsible do not act in the name of our Union flag. They are bringing shame on it. My prayers are with the police officers at the center of this attack."" Robinson, of the Democratic Unionist Party, said he defended the right to peaceful protest, but ""those intent on violence should stay at home."" Read more: Clinton urges calm amid tensions in Northern Ireland . About 32 police officers were injured in the past week's violence, Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton said. There have been 38 arrests in connection with the loyalist disorder. ""It is completely unacceptable that officers who were carrying out their professional duty on behalf of the community should be subjected to a potentially murderous attack,"" Hamilton said of the petrol bomb attack. ""This was a planned attempt to kill a police officer which also put the lives of the public in danger, and it is fortunate there were no injuries."" Clashes also broke out between groups of nationalist and loyalist youths in east Belfast, police said. Addressing Parliament, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Theresa Villiers condemned the violence and appealed for calm. ""There can be absolutely no excuse or justification for this kind of thuggish and lawless behavior,"" she said. ""Nobody can be in any doubt about the government's support for the union and its flag. But those people engaged in the kind of violence we have seen in the past few days are not defending the Union flag. They are dishonoring and shaming the flag of our country."" A number of properties linked to the cross-community Alliance Party, which backed the decision to restrict the flying of the Union flag, have been targeted in the week since the vote. Alliance Party councilor Linda Cleland said the windows of her car were smashed and several windows in her home broken over the weekend. ""This violence must stop,"" she said. ""There is no justification for the attack on my home or the homes and offices of my colleagues."" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton joined Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness last week in condemning the threat to Long and the outbreaks of violence. Robinson and Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist leader, met Monday to discuss political proposals to address widespread concerns across the community, and agreed to hold further talks Tuesday. Police said Saturday that loyalist paramilitaries were behind some of the violence in Belfast and elsewhere. The vote on the Union flag followed a summer of heightened tensions between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities. Riots in September left dozens of police officers injured. Just more than a month ago, a prison officer was killed in a suspected dissident Irish Republican Army attack, the first such attack in years. In recent days, a number of suspected dissident IRA members have been arrested. The recent disorder follows more than a decade during which Northern Ireland has made steady progress toward lasting peace and stability. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict. But six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s, the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, and largely Roman Catholic nationalists, who want it to be reunited with the rest of Ireland, exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The three decades of ensuing violence between loyalists and the IRA claimed more than 3,000 lives, most of them north of the border. While the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, distrust remains between Catholics and Protestants.","Secretary of state for Northern Ireland condemns ""thuggish and lawless behavior""

"Discipline is a key ingredient in the package required to succeed in the world of professional golf. Paula Creamer has not been found wanting in that department on her journey from military kid to major champion. The 2010 U.S. Open winner and darling of the LPGA Tour is the daughter of a Navy officer. The 25-year-old has racked up earnings of $9 million in her career so far and has decided the time has come to contribute to the military cause. Through her charitable foundation Creamer already helps to fund promising young golfers in the U.S. and Mexico -- now she wants to dedicate a large chunk of her time assisting people whose lives pivot around service to their country. With America still engaged in combat operations in Afghanistan and some of its military personnel still in Iraq, Creamer is offering support to wives and families of soldiers, veterans and reserves as well as those in active service. Giving it back: Golf's 'Pink Panther' invests in future stars . ""I wouldn't be where I'm at today if it wasn't for the soldiers and everybody that fights for us,"" she told CNN. ""I wanted something that I could truly relate to and I could really feel that all my hard work, my time and everything I do is going to go to, and that's the military."" Family service . Creamer's father Paul flew for the Navy for 22 years before retiring in 1997. Her uncle and her cousin are Marines -- the latter went to Iraq for eight months, and he is currently stationed at the Pentagon. Growing up in a military family, Creamer was expected to display the same kind of discipline that was such a vital component of her father's job. ""I didn't understand why I had to do all my homework before I could go out and have fun,"" she explains. ""I said, 'Dad you can't have these rules, I'm not in the military.' "" But now, Creamer says: ""I'm grateful for it, I don't know any different; there are no excuses when you are in the military, you live and fight till the death -- that's kind of how he has looked at everything."" She is hoping to supplement a system in which the Department of Veterans Affairs offers pensions and compensations to the soldiers' widows, taking into consideration the spouse's military experience and the income of the widow. Helping those left behind . Creamer knows firsthand the strain that can be put on the families of those that serve -- a common scenario being that wives run the family home while their husbands are locked in combat on the front line. ""My cousin has four sons, and his wife had to take care of four kids from the ages of one to six while he was gone. I've seen what these wives had to go through because their husbands are taking care of us. I think that's remarkable. ""The soldiers should get all the credit, but the wives are definitively up there with them, they're the ones that make them want to come home and stay strong and fight."" Of the many memories Creamer retains from her childhood, one of the fondest is when her father dressed up in his military whites for a wedding. Paula's mother Karen recalls: ""Her cousin got married, he had a military wedding at Annapolis and everybody wore whites. Paula saw them going through the swords and she was young, wiggly, but she enjoyed that."" During his time in the Navy, Creamer's father was primed for action twice -- in Vietnam and during the first Iraq War -- but never deployed. Cousin's call-up . Creamer was 10 when her father retired, but he continued his role as a commercial pilot for American Airlines. Still, the family's army links went on. When Creamer graduated from high school and became a fulltime LPGA member in 2005, her cousin was on a tour of duty in Iraq. ""I wore an up-pin on my lapel that was his company and battalion insignia,"" she explains. ""I wore it every round of golf I played starting the day they deployed to show support of Teague and all the brave men and women under his command during their entire deployment to Iraq. ""I did not take it off until the final member of his command returned to U.S. soil."" Now that she has decided to lend her support to army families, Creamer has picked the perfect person to help her vision become a reality -- her dad. ""To me he's the best person for it, as he has a lot of ties within the military and he's going to want to make it as big as we possibly can. I think he is a perfect person to take ownership in that sense."" Finding funding . Born in Mountain View, California, Creamer now lives in Orlando, Florida. She is hoping to spread her project across the country. ""It is hard to say no to people who fight for all of us and our country, I have a big soft spot for them; it was the way I grew up, to respect that,"" she says. ""Appreciating others' sacrifices, even simple chivalry -- how a man treats a woman, and also how you conduct yourself in front of people -- those are all rules that I've always lived by and I feel it is important that I give back."" Her ultimate goal is to hold a tournament to raise money for the cause, and have both male and female stars along for the ride. ""I want to have a professional event, that would be my dream, we've talked a lot about it,"" she says. ""Logistics-wise I'd love to have it with the men, that would be a lot of fun to do and it'd bring a lot of interest. These days a lot of the guys have foundations that not necessarily are for the military but they are tying back to military things."" It can be daunting for someone so young to set such an organization, so Creamer has enlisted the help of friend and tennis pro James Blake, who runs the Thomas Blake Senior Memorial Cancer Research Fund, founded in memory of his father. She has also been to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which treats injured service personnel -- a visit she describes as inspirational. ""It was probably one of the most eye-opening experiences I've had in my life. Getting to know people that just had their leg amputated, there are no words to describe how I felt. It puts everything into perspective.""","Ladies golf star  Paula Creamer is to help families of soldiers through her foundation .

"(CNN)After a grand jury decided in November not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, many shifted their attention to a federal investigation into the killing. But on Wednesday, officials told CNN that federal investigators didn't find enough evidence and that Justice Department prosecutors won't recommend civil rights charges against Wilson. Attorney General Eric Holder, who has the final say in the matter, has said he will announce his decision before he leaves office, which is expected to be by the spring. The news that emerged Wednesday is likely to upset those who saw the federal investigation as a way to pursue justice for Brown and his family. ""I think you have a lot of people who will be disappointed if this does turn out to be the case,"" said Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who lives near Ferguson. ""The community and the family wanted a day in court, an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out, cross-examined. And it looks like that's not going to happen."" Some legal experts, however, said the prosecutors' decision wasn't surprising in light of the laws involved. But this doesn't mean that all legal avenues are closed off for the Brown family. First, let's explore why analysts aren't surprised by the news. ""These cases are very hard to bring,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""If someone is not prosecuted on state charges, the odds that they will be prosecuted on federal charges are substantially lower,"" Toobin told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Holder had already acknowledged at the situation in November, saying that ""federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases."" But he also may have raised some people hopes, according to Areva Martin, an attorney. ""Holder traveled to Ferguson, he talked to that community and he talked about how aggressive the Department of Justice was going to be in its own independent investigation,"" Martin told CNN. The Brown family doesn't appear to have been holding out much hope from the federal investigation. Family attorney Benjamin Crump had expressed pessimism in November about the probable outcome. ""That is a very high standard and it's not very likely,"" Crump said. ""The family understands if there is no indictment it is likely the killer of their child won't be held accountable and that's heartbreaking to them."" Martin said the federal hate crimes statute wasn't designed for cases like this one. ""I think there's a lot of confusion about the federal hate crimes statute and how it should be used,"" she told CNN. The key factor in the investigation was likely to be whether Wilson exhibited ""racial hostility,"" Toobin said in August. ""The most important thing would be, did he say anything that indicates racial hostility, either before, or after, or during (the shooting)?"" Toobin said. Wilson is white, and Brown was African-American. But race didn't have to be a factor in the shooting for investigators to allege there was a federal civil rights violation, said CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos. Federal statute says it's a crime for government officials ""to willfully deprive a person of a right or privilege protected by the Constitution."" Federal prosecutors could have argued that Brown's right to life was violated, Cevallos, a criminal defense attorney, said. But it's a tough case to make. ""They have to show that the officer intended to deprive somebody of that constitutional right,"" he said. ""They would have to show intent to kill ...which is not a particularly easy showing to make."" -------------------------------------------------- . So, what avenues are still open for the Brown family? Legal experts still expect Brown's family to file a civil lawsuit against Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department. Crump said in November that the family is considering the option of civil remedies to obtain ""some sense of justice."" The family could file a wrongful death lawsuit against Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department, CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said at the time. He said Brown's family could file a lawsuit under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code -- a federal statute that permits damages against state officials for violations of legal or constitutional rights. Another CNN legal analyst, Mark O'Mara, noted in November that law enforcement officers are afforded certain legal protections. Wilson's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, told CNN that he was expecting a civil suit from Brown's family. But he said he thought they would have a difficult case to make. ""Even though it's a different standard, in a civil case, you still have elements you have to prove and they're going to flow very closely to what you have to prove in a criminal case,"" Bruntrager said. ""If you don't have enough for a grand jury even to issue an indictment, it's going to pretty hard, I think, in a civil suit,"" he said. The Justice Department is also carrying out a civil rights investigation into the Ferguson Police Department's overall track record with minorities. That inquiry is examining accusations that the police department as a whole practiced racial profiling and heavy-handed tactics. But that type of investigation typically looks at possible reforms for a law enforcement agency, rather than punishing past alleged misconduct, analysts say. ""People consistently expressed concerns stemming from specific alleged incidents, from general policing practices and from the lack of diversity on the Ferguson police force. These anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention,"" Holder said in September. ""Our investigation will assess the police department's use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson's city jail,"" Holder said. Wilson resigned from his position as a Ferguson police officer in November.","""These cases are very hard to bring,"" says CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.

"Flamboyant former NBA star Dennis Rodman left North Korea without meeting the country's leader Kim Jong Un but praised the local basketball players he trained there. ""They are awesome,"" Rodman told CNN while in transit at Beijing Capital International Airport on Monday. Rodman started his third visit to North Korea last week, spending four days in the isolated nation to assist setting up an exhibition game featuring North Korean players and a dozen NBA veteran players whose identities have not yet been announced. The friendly game is planned for Kim Jong Un's birthday on January 8. Rodman's latest round of ""basketball diplomacy"" came less than a week after North Korea announced the dramatic purge and execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, North Korea's No. 2 leader. Jang's reported execution has caused confusion and uncertainty about what's going on in North Korea and worsened its tense relations with South Korea and the United States. Rodman struck up an unlikely friendship with the young Kim when he traveled to North Korea for the first time in February. That time he brought a team of Harlem Globetrotters for an exhibition game watched by Kim, who is a basketball fan. Kim later met and dined with the eccentric basketball star, and Rodman told his host he ""had a friend for life."" This time around, however, there was no meeting with Kim. ""No, I'm not worried about it. I'll see him again,"" the 52-year-old Rodman told CNN, adding that his goal was to try out the local players and prepare for the game. ""I will be coming back in another week."" Rodman has described Kim as a ""very good guy"" in the past despite international condemnation of the country's human rights record. The former Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls star has avoided commenting on the human rights issue, telling the Associated Press he goes to North Korea ""just to do a basketball game and have some fun."" North Korea: Reality vs. the world according to Dennis Rodman . Rodman's latest trip was sponsored by Paddy Power, but the online betting company later withdrew its connection to Rodman. ""We reviewed the project and, with the benefit of hindsight, recognized that we got this one wrong and so have decided to remove our name from the event,"" Paddy Power said. ""It's a response to the worldwide scrutiny and condemnation of the North Korean regime in recent weeks, which has resulted in us changing our mind. We will of course be honoring all our contractual commitments to Dennis Rodman and his team."" Earlier this month, Rory Scott, a Paddy Power spokesman, said that the trip was nonpolitical, but was intended ""to prove once again that sport has the power to rise above all issues."" Rodman was criticized for his first trip during a period of political turmoil when North Korea was threatening missile strikes on the United States, South Korea and Japan.","Online betting company Paddy Power ends connection to Rodman .

"Former basketball star Dennis Rodman has checked into an alcohol-rehabilitation center after facing backlash for his visit to North Korea. ""Dennis Rodman came back from North Korea in pretty rough shape emotionally. The pressure that was put on him to be a combination 'super human' political figure and 'fixer' got the better of him,"" his agent, Darren Prince, said Sunday in a written statement. ""He is embarrassed, saddened and remorseful for the anger and hurt his words have caused."" Prince said Rodman is at a facility in New Jersey, one with a ""28- or 30-day"" program. He said Rodman drank heavily in North Korea during a recent tumultuous trip to the secretive state to play a basketball game with some former NBA stars against national team players from the regime. ""His drinking escalated to a level that none of us had seen before,"" Prince said Saturday. Rodman teammate Charles Smith: North Korea didn't pay us . Rodman entered a center on Wednesday, a source close to him told CNN. Rodman -- the colorful basketball Hall of Famer who won five NBA titles while the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls  --  said alcohol was one reason he shot from the lip earlier this month and told CNN that an American imprisoned in North Korea since 2012 may have done something to deserve his sentence of 15 years' hard labor. After Kenneth Bae's family complained, Rodman apologized, saying he was under stress and had been drinking when he was interviewed on CNN's ""New Day."" Some commentators have said Rodman's ""basketball diplomacy"" may have positive effects in North Korea by offering the people there a different view of the West, compared with its demonic portrayal in the country's tightly controlled state media. But others, including human rights activists, say it's an embarrassing media sideshow that distracts attention from the North Korean regime's brutality. A State Department official said Rodman's visit was ""marginally unhelpful"" and Sen. John McCain said of the retired athlete, ""I think he's an idiot."" Rodman, 52, led a team of former NBA players in a game in North Korea, which he called a birthday present to dictator Kim Jong Un, and, in a bizarre moment, sang ""Happy Birthday"" inside a packed sports stadium. Upon leaving North Korea, Rodman was immediately criticized for his friendship with Kim. A mass of reporters met him at the Bejing airport and Rodman broke into tears while answering questions. ""I'm not the president,"" he told the reporters. ""I'm not an ambassador. I'm Dennis Rodman."" Rodman also said, ""I'm sorry for what's going on in North Korea, the certain situations,"" but he didn't apologize for his visit. Prince said Rodman wasn't paid by Pyongyang to bring his basketball team to North Korea. ""Dennis is proud to be an American citizen and his trips to North Korea have been paid by sponsors,"" Prince said Sunday. Rodman visited during a time of high tension between the two nations.

"(CNN)If you're in the mood for thrills and chills on the big screen this year, you won't be disappointed, judging from a slew of fresh movie trailers released recently. The creepy trailer for ""Crimson Peak"" went viral after its Friday release, with two versions drawing close to 2 million views by Sunday. If the first peek of the haunted house horror flick is any indication, director Guillermo del Toro has a lot of frights up his sleeve for the film's October 16 release. From the disturbing automated toy man to the ghostly woman in a bathtub, it's 90 seconds of foreboding imagery. Another creepy trailer released last week is whetting moviegoers' appetite for horror. Some may scoff at the idea of a remake of the 1982 supernatural hit ""Poltergeist,"" which debuts July 24. But the trailer has plenty of jumpy moments to shock even the most jaded horror fan -- especially if you're afraid of clowns. Two spy movies on the horizon offer thrills of a different kind. ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" a reboot of the 1960s TV series, stars Henry Cavill as an ace American secret agent in the 1960s. It hits theaters in August. Also out in August is ""Hitman: Agent 47,"" an adaption of the popular video game.

"(CNN)""I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat,"" Winston Churchill once told the British House of Commons. A UK auction house is taking the former prime minister's words literally. Duke's auction house has announced it will auction a vial of Churchill's blood, taken during a hospital stay in 1962, three years before his death. Churchill had fallen out of bed and fractured a hip, necessitating a multiweek stay at Middlesex Hospital. The blood was drawn by nursing student Patricia Fitzgibbon, according to the auction house. The sample was never used and the hospital was set to dispose of it when Fitzgibbon asked to keep it. Before her death, Fitzgibbon gave the vial to a friend, who has decided to sell it. ""This is probably the first time that such a personal piece of Churchill's history has been offered on the open market,"" Duke's said. ""This year marks the 50th anniversary of Churchill's death -- the blood is a poignant reminder of an injury which marked the beginning of the end for Churchill, and as such we expect there to be great interest in it."" Churchill died in 1965 at age 90. The iconic British leader is best known for his leadership of Britain during World War II. The blood will go up for auction on March 12 in Dorchester, England, along with a signed declaration from Fitzgibbon attesting to its origins.

"(CNN) -- They're the golden girls of downhill skiing -- but neither Dominique Gisin nor Tina Maze could hide their surprise after making Olympic history in Sochi. Cue elation, huge smiles and hugs after the two skiers recorded the same time to each win a gold medal for the first time in the history of alpine skiing at the Olympics, following a dramatic conclusion to the women's downhill event Wednesday. Switzerland's Gisin, who has not won a World Cup downhill race since 2009 and whose best finish in the downhill this season is seventh, had appeared set to claim gold outright after finishing with a run of 1 minute 41.57 seconds. Follow CNN's live Sochi Winter Olympics coverage . But last year's overall World Cup champion Maze had other ideas -- powering through the course in the exact same time to take a share of the spoils. ""I have no words,"" the Slovenian, who won silver in the super-G four years ago in Vancouver and was one of the pre-race favorites, told reporters. ""This doesn't feel real. I will have to see my team to get myself together and realize how much this means to us,"" added the 30-year-old, who kissed the snow after finishing her run. ""I have been dreaming about this since I was little. The first ski race I ever won in my life was a downhill, so before I went down the track today I said to myself: 'This has to be it. I can do it,' and I just went for it."" Gisin failed to finish in 2010 but, after a year interrupted by injury, this time she came through in style to shock not just her rivals but also herself. Incredible . ""This is incredible,"" the 28-year-old told reporters. ""I am overwhelmed with emotions. I am so happy -- what a day. I don't think I even dreamed about this. Now that I have won, I am living the dream, but this is better than dreaming."" This not the first time Gisin has tied for top honors -- she shared the podium with Sweden's Anja Paerson when she claimed her maiden World Cup victory in 2009. An outsider for the title on this occasion, the Swiss Air Force pilot was ranked 12th in the overall World Cup standings ahead of Sochi and suffered concussion in her only previous Olympics appearance. ""That's the story of my career, up, down, forwards, backwards,"" she added. ""I have had a lot of injuries in my life, I had nine knee surgeries. I was close to the podium a lot. I never won a medal on a big event, so what comes around, goes around,"" she said. Gisin, who started skiing when she was 18 months old, started eighth in Wednesday's race and then faced an agonizing wait until Maze, who went out 21st, crossed the line some 30 minutes later. ""I looked away and I looked up again and then I thought, 'Zero. That means we're good,' "" said Gisin. ""I was so nervous, just waiting. There was nothing I could do but in the end I was ahead -- well, together with Tina, but that's fine. I am for sure happy where I am."" Celebrations . Gisin is the first Swiss downhill winner since Michela Figini in the Sarajevo Games 30 years ago. Celebrations involved a phone call to Gisin's grandparents, who helped her learn to ski as a child. ""It was very emotional, they did so much for me,"" she added. ""My whole family did. They always believed this would come, they always said you have to believe."" The pilot, who doesn't fly in the winter because ""it is too stressful,"" believes the injury problems which have blighted her season gave her extra motivation to succeed in Sochi. ""I had trouble giving everything in races since the last injury, adding half a meter here or there, leaving a little more space rather than too little,"" she said. ""That's not how you win races. I didn't feel like an athlete anymore. ""Having to qualify, I had to fight in a strong team like this. That's what I needed, and now I feel like an athlete again and that's the biggest victory for me today."" There have been instances of shared medals in skiing at the Olympics. France's Christine Goitschel and American Jean Saubert shared giant slalom silver at the Innsbruck Games in 1964. In 1992, American Dian Roffe and Austrian Anita Wachter tied for second place in the same discipline. Switzerland's Didier Cuche and Austrian Hans Knauss tied for the men's super-G silver in 1998.","Switzerland's Dominique Gisin and Tina Maze both win gold in women's downhill .

"(CNN)Most road rage incidents don't amount to much. Some shouting.  A few harsh words.  A rude gesture or two.  Everyone gets it out of their system and life goes on. But sometimes it takes a tragic turn. Last week in Las Vegas, a mother of four was killed in an apparent road rage case. Police say Tammy Meyers died of a gunshot wound to the head after a suspect followed her home and opened fire.  Meyers and the man argued over a traffic incident earlier in the day. A study published in the International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine in 2010 concluded that one-third of the people it surveyed  reported road rage. A 2013 Washington Post poll said the number of drivers who say they feel ""uncontrollable anger toward another driver"" has doubled from eight years earlier. The number is 12%, or more than 1 in every 10 drivers on the road. A couple of things appear to be making matters worse, much worse:  cameras and guns. In this age of social media, it seems natural to document everything in our lives. But experts say snapping a photo or video of the person you feel has wronged you on the road doesn't help matters. Back off from aggressive drivers . If you get cut off, back off, take a deep breath, and remain calm. Now you're read for what comes next. If you need to vent, wait to you get home, then talk to a friend. Know your driving style . If you're an aggressive driver, you might be the problem.  Are you provoking other drivers? These are the habits of aggressive drivers: . Tailgating . Overuse of the horn . Flashing headlights . Changing lanes quickly, often and without signaling . Guesturing to other drivers . Talking or texting on your cellphone . -- from DMV.org . In a video posted this month to YouTube, a man in Austin, Texas, is seen cursing at a woman and spitting on her windshield after she photographs his license plate.  The man was charged with reckless driving and later apologized for his behavior. Last month, a mother in North Carolina began to videotape another driver she said was acting aggressively. ""This person in front of me is being a real ... character right now,"" she says on the video. Moment later, the driver is seen lashing out, banging on the woman's car window: ""You stupid (expletive)."" ""You're taking the chance of shooting footage of someone who's enraged and could that further enrage them? It's hard to say ... but you're taking a risk,"" said Jeffrey Spring of the AAA of Southern California. ""The most important thing ... is to get out of the situation,"" he said.  ""You don't want to escalate it to that point where there's someone so enraged where they're not thinking about what they are doing."" With guns just slightly less ubiquitous than cameras these days, drivers face a second far greater risk in road rage incidents. In 2013, David Kollar was driving on Interstate 75 near Lexington, Kentucky, when he noticed a man driving recklessly in and out of the emergency lane.  He pulled out his phone and started shooting video. First, he tried to get the license plate number, then Kollar pulled alongside to get a shot of the driver. That's when the man driving the car rolled down his window and appeared to fire a shot. No one got hurt, but lesson learned.  ""I was scared,"" he said.  ""It was a little crazy."" Late last year, a family in Atlanta narrowly escaped after a driver opened fire, after a roadway altercation.  The gunman followed them to a strip mall and started shooting. The family dog jumped in, taking a bullet for the family. ""They were fired upon and their family was terrorized,"" Atlanta police Sgt.Gregory Lyon told CNN affiliate WXIA. ""They survived that only to find that their pet is now gone."" So what can be done about it? Last year, AutoVantage came out with a road rage survey.  It found that drivers in Houston, Atlanta and Baltimore are the least courteous.  Portland, Pittsburgh and St. Louis are at the most. DMV.org offers some suggestions on how to handle road rage. Back off from aggressive drivers:  You can't control them so give them some room to operate. Know your own driving style:  Maybe you're the bad guy or gal.  Maybe you're provoking the drivers around you. And here's another thing to think about.  You never know who's behind the wheel of the other car. They might just be having a bad day or maybe have some serious problems. Or you could find yourself in a situation like the one portrayed in a Georgia public service announcement featuring Evander Holyfield. An angry man, who calls out a driver who cut him off, finds himself face-to-face with the menacing former heavyweight champ. The punchline?  ""Avoid road rage.  You never know who you might run into.""","A Washington Post poll says road rage is increasing .

"The ancient world was full of strange animals that have gone extinct, such as a group of marine species with claw-like structures emerging from their heads. A new study suggests that these creatures were related to spiders and scorpions. Researchers discovered the fossilized remains of a species in southwest China that provides new insights into the evolution of animals in the modern era, scientists said. They report their findings in the journal Nature. Scientists believe that the creature -- 1 inch long, and with two pairs of eyes -- lived 520 million years ago and that it crawled or swam in the ocean. They were able to reconstruct the creature's nervous system to gain insights about its evolutionary relationships to animals familiar to us. ""For the first time, we are able to use fossilised neural anatomy to sort out how fossil animals are related to animals today,"" study co-author Xiaoya Ma of the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum in London wrote in an e-mail. This creature belongs to the Alalcomenaeus genus, and its place in the animal kingdom lies in ""a group of weird extinct animals"" called the ""megacheiran"" or ""great appendage"" arthropods, Ma said. The species of the Alalcomenaeus group had elongated, segmented bodies with about 12 pairs of appendages they used for swimming or crawling. They also had a pair of long, scissor-like head claws, most likely for grabbing or sensing. Scientists say the reconstruction of the new creature's nervous system is the most complete for an arthropod living at that time, in the Cambrian geological period. Discovery makes a splash: The rarest whale . The brain and central nervous system of the creature are organized in a way that is similar to those of the chelicerata, the group that includes horseshoe crabs and scorpions. This suggests a close evolutionary relationship between the ancient Alalcomenaeus and the living chelicerata. A distinct group of arthropods called the mandibulates includes lobsters, insects, centipedes and millipedes. Last year at the same site in China -- called the Chengjiang formation near Kunming -- Ma and colleagues discovered a 520 million-year-old crustacean-type nervous system in an animal called Fuxianhuia. Taken together, these discoveries suggest that by 520 million years ago, the two major groups of arthropods had diverged. Their common ancestor must have been older, researchers said. ""This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans,"" co-author Nick Strausfeld, neuroscience professor at the University of Arizona, said in a statement. Strausfeld's team used sophisticated imaging techniques to look at the inch-long Alalcomenaeus fossil. One kind of scan revealed that iron had built up in the nervous system as the creature fossilized. They also used a technique called computed tomography that reconstructs 3-D features. By combining these images and discarding any data that weren't in both, they were able to create a sort of negative X-ray photograph, ""and out popped this beautiful nervous system in startling detail,""  Strausfeld said. It confirmed what scientists had believed from the creature's outward appearance: The extinct genus Alalcomenaeus was related to chelicerates (spiders, scorpions and others). They also saw that the brain in the fossil was like the brains found in modern scorpions and spiders. If researchers find a fossil with features shared by this creature and the crustacean-like fossil Ma and colleagues found last year, that could be a common ancestor of both. There's plenty more weirdness from ancient history to uncover. 18-foot oarfish discovered .","The fossil is 520 million years old and was found in China .

"A performer from Cirque du Soleil died in a weekend accident during a show at a Las Vegas casino, authorities said Sunday. The performer, 31-year-old Sarah Guillot-Guyard, was pronounced dead shortly before midnight Saturday, the Clark County, Nevada, medical examiner's office told CNN. The cause of death had not been determined Sunday afternoon. The accident happened during the show's finale, said Cirque Du Soleil spokeswoman Renee-Claude Menard. During the scene, performers are suspended up to 50 feet in the air on lines controlled by wireless remote controls, according to the troupe's website. Guillot-Guyard ""was being hoisted up the side of the stage and then just plummeted down,"" witness Dan Mosqueda told the Las Vegas Sun newspaper. ""Initially, a lot of people in the audience thought it was part of the choreographed fight. But you could hear screaming, then groaning, and we could hear a female artist crying from the stage."" Guillot-Guyard was born in Paris, specialized as an acrobat and aerialist and had performed for more than 20 years, according to a website for Cirquefit, which describes itself as a circus and fitness program for kids. She taught classes through that program. Parents of some of her students left messages on the group's Facebook page remembering Guillot-Guyard. ""No words.

The activists placed yellow letters next to a famous hummingbird design, and now Peruvian authorities are threatening to sue Greenpeace and criminally charge the activists with ""attacking archaeological monuments,"" according to The Associated Press. The demonstration was timed to coincide with United Nations' Lima Climate Change Conference ending Friday. ""It's a true slap in the face at everything Peruvians consider sacred,"" Deputy Culture Minister Luis Jaime Castillo told The Associated Press of the activists' decision to enter a ""strictly prohibited"" area next to a famous hummingbird design.

Artwork that is made from placing or moving stones, earth or other objects, geoglyphs in the area fall into two general categories, according to the site's UNESCO listing. One type is representational, featuring animals, plant life and other extraordinary figures. The other consists of the lines, mostly straight lines crossing the region's pampas in different directions. Some are long -- several kilometers -- and form shapes.

"Another year of magic kicks off Thursday morning at the 87th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, with its signature giant balloons, whimsical floats  and performers taking over the streets of New York City, but a couple of displays are generating some controversy. From its modest beginnings in 1924, the annual parade has become a  holiday tradition featuring some of the world's most beloved characters and attractions. In all, more than 50 balloons -- including Christmas SpongeBob Squarepants, Finn and Jake from ""Adventure Time"" and Toothless from ""How to Train Your Dragon"" -- and nearly 40 floats will roll down the streets, with new additions from Cirque Du Soleil, ""Despicable Me,"" Royal Caribbean, Lindt Chocolate, and SeaWorld -- whose float is being met with protests. Animal rights activists, including members of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, say they plan to protest SeaWorld's ""A Sea of Surprises"" float Tuesday at the New Jersey location where the floats are built and stored. ""This planned float is deceptive in the extreme because it shows orcas frolicking in a magnificent sea alongside their families when really we all know now that SeaWorld deprives orcas of all these things,"" Ashley Byrne, a spokeswoman for PETA, told CNN. The documentary ""Blackfish,"" which recently aired on CNN, examines the safety and ethics of keeping killer whales in captivity. The film profiled Tilikum, the whale that killed a trainer at SeaWorld in 2010. PETA has released an online petition asking that the SeaWorld float be removed from the parade. According to Byrne, more than 80,000 people have already signed it. ""As far as what happens the day of the parade, it remains to be seen,"" Byrne said. PETA is also connected to a float controversy involving rocker Joan Jett. Joan Jett & The Blackhearts were scheduled to sing atop a South Dakota tourism float, but the band was removed from the float after protests that Jett, a vegetarian and PETA advocate, was representing the state where cattle are important to the economy. ""Farming and ranching are primary drivers of South Dakota's economy. Many livestock producers expressed concern about whether Joan Jett was an appropriate representative for an agriculturally oriented state like South Dakota,"" Jodie Anderson of the South Dakota Cattlemen's Association told CNN. It is unclear on what float Joan Jett & The Blackhearts will perform Thursday. ""I've decided to switch from South Dakota to another float because people's political agendas were getting in the way of what should be a purely entertainment driven event,"" Jett said in a statement this month. ""I will remain focused on entertaining the millions of people watching, who will be celebrating a great American tradition."" In the past, Macy's Inc. has avoided controversy at the parade. ""The Parade has never taken on, promoted or otherwise engaged in social commentary, political debate, or other forms of advocacy, no matter how worthy,"" a spokesperson for Macy's Inc. said in a statement. ""Its mission has always been about entertaining millions of families and spectators."" More than 3.5 million people are expected to line the parade route. Another 50 million are expected to watch more than 1,600 cheerleaders, 11 marching bands and 900 clowns from home. Jimmy Fallon and The Roots, The Goo Goo Dolls, Gavin DeGraw and Fall Out Boy are among the scheduled performers. Despite recent controversies, Macy's ""will remain steadfast in following the guiding core of a decades old mission, celebration and entertainment for all.""","The Thanksgiving tradition enters its 87th year with new floats and balloons .

"Every dog has its day, and scientists are trying to figure out when that first day happened. At some point in ancient history humans developed close relationships with four-legged creatures that would have otherwise been wild, fierce wolves. A new study in the journal Science argues that the domestication of dogs happened between 18,800 and 32,100 years ago in Europe. They say European hunter-gatherer cultures were responsible for turning lupine foes into best friends, long before humans developed agriculture. It's a conclusion that barks up a controversial tree. The study goes against the idea wolves were domesticated when they wandered over to human agricultural settlements, lured by food. The study also contradicts previous research suggesting that dog domestication may have first happened in the Middle East or East Asia. ""There were many aspects in this study that we didn't expect,"" said Olaf Thalmann, researcher at Finland's University of Turku, who led the study. Chief among the surprises: the European origin of dog domestication. Digging up bones . Seeking to sniff out when and where domesticated dogs emerged, scientists turned to genetics. Researchers extracted and sequenced mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are structures in cells that convert food energy into usable forms. When working with these ancient samples, scientists focused on mitochondrial DNA because it is more prevalent in cells than DNA within a cell's nucleus. Scientists recovered DNA fragments from the genomes of 18 prehistoric dog and wolf-like carnivores and 20 modern wolves with origins in Eurasia and America. Researchers compared these mitochondrial genome sequences with those of 49 wolves, 77 modern dogs, 3 Chinese indigenous dogs and 4 coyotes. By highlighting similarities in DNA sequences among all of these specimens, researchers put together trees of close relationships called ""clades."" The more similar two creatures' sequences are, the closer together they will be in the clade. Researchers organized the specimens in the study into four clades, with three of these groups having sister species represented by ancient fossils from Europe, and the fourth relating to modern wolves as well. It appears, based on these groupings, that the oldest domesticated dogs were in Europe. The carcasses that ancient hunters left behind may have attracted wolves, which could have led to a relationship between dogs and humans, study authors said. A group called Clade A includes examples of the modern dog breeds Basenji and Dingo, as well as some pre-Colombian New World dogs as old as 8,500 years. The ancient dogs of the Americas seem to have already been domesticated when they got there, having arrived with humans, Thalmann said. ""What we propose is actually the process that led to dog domestication in Europe also gave rise ... (to) dogs in the New World."" Clade A demographically shows a connection with humans. Between 5,000 and 2,500 years ago dog population declined, but then began to rise sharply starting about  2,500 years ago, said Thalmann. Human population size also went up at that time, indicating that dogs were dependent demographically on the human societies, he said. Meanwhile, wolves became more scarce, as agrarian cultures emerged and wolves lost their habitats and wild game. Surprisingly, researchers did not find a population of modern wolves that might have given rise to modern dogs. In fact, modern dogs have more genetically in common with ancient wolves than the ones we see today. ""It's quite likely that the population of wolves that gave rise to modern dogs does not exist anymore,"" Thalmann said. Dogs vs. wolves . Another big surprise from the study is, based on mitochondrial DNA, the two most ancient samples of dog-like creatures included in this study didn't seem to be dogs at all. One of the oldest samples was previously described in a 2011 study in the journal PLOS One, led by Nikolai Ovodov, a co-author on the new Science study. Ovodov and colleagues described remains of a ""dog-like"" creature from Razboinichya Cave in Siberia, about 33,000 years old, and found similarities between it and domesticated dogs from Greenland that lived about 1,000 years ago. But the new study's genetic analysis suggests that this particular sample is an ancient sister lineage to modern dogs and wolves, not a direct ancestor. A 36,000-year-old dog-like carnivore found in Belgium does not seem to represent a direct ancestor either. ""We did not expect that these two particular dogs -- the putative earliest dogs -- that they're not directly related to modern dogs,"" That's not something the study authors expected, Thalmann said. So what's going on? There are two theories about what happened to these creatures, Thalmann said. It's possible that both of these fossils represent early attempts of humans to domesticate dog-like animals. These creatures did not appear to leave any descendents, so they may signify a failure of domestication. Alternatively, these creatures may not have been domesticated at all, but rather unusual wolves that died out before the last Ice Age. More recent specimens -- such as a 14,700-year-old fossil from the Oberkassel site in Bonn, Germany, and the 12,500-year-old fossil from Germany's Karstein cave -- seem to be more directly related to modern dogs. Scientists previously had evidence based on their physical features, but the new mitochondrial genome analysis adds more support, Thalmann said. By 14,000 years ago, ""dogs had become a consistent component of human settlements and were subject to deliberate burial themselves and were included in human graves,"" the PLOS One study said. On the scent of other theories . This new study doesn't present the whole story, however. It did not include ancient samples from the Middle East or China, which are alternative proposals for the origins of dog domestication. Thalmann anticipates that this will be a criticism of the study. Also, regarding wolves, the study included fewer wolf samples from the Middle East and East Asia than other areas, potentially skewing that part of the analysis as well. But, notes the study's senior author Robert Wayne, a biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, the oldest dog fossils from East Asia are no more than 8,000 years old, making them much younger than the European samples and dating from well after the domestication of dogs. The oldest Middle Eastern dog remains are between 10,000 and 12,000 years old, and so still more recent than the European fossils. Mitochondrial DNA from ancient canines from these areas would make for a more complete picture of canine evolution, but it was not available in this study. If a 20,000-year-old dog fossil were available from these areas, scientists would also need to find other fossils to arrange them in a tree of relationships, Thalmann said. If those were genetically more closely related to modern dogs than the European samples, that would argue for a different origin of domestication -- but such samples have not been recovered. This result seems unlikely, given the close associations found between modern dogs and ancient European wolves and dogs, Wayne said. Many questions remain about the first domesticated canines.

"Hong Kongers are howling in disappointment as their potent -- if unlikely -- symbol of protest once again goes missing from the city's shelves. IKEA's wolf-like Lufsig doll, which played a cameo in local politics last year, quickly sold out upon its return to the city. Residents snapped up the stuffed toy in December after one was hurled by a protestor at C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's leader, who is nicknamed ""wolf"" for his political cunning. Modeled after the antagonist of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale, Lufsig went on sale at Hong Kong's three IKEA stores on Wednesday but quickly sold out as throngs of customers lined up early to get their hands on the toy, which has been out of stock since its rise to prominence in December. The South China Morning Post reported that 2,000 of the toys were made available in the Swedish furniture giant's Causeway Bay, Sha Tin and Kowloon Bay stores at a cost of HK$99.9 ($13) each. IKEA staff handed out tickets to eager customers before the stores opened for business. Each ticket allowed the purchase of a single doll, although reports of some enterprising customers rejoining the back of the line quickly spread. The toys have become a popular symbol of protest against the chief executive, who is criticized in the city as having too close ties to Beijing, and for putting off his responsibilities to secure universal suffrage for the city's voters by 2017. There is also an element of bawdy humor associated with the toy, whose former Chinese name is a near-homonym of a crude sexual term in Cantonese. Ikea has since updated the name. The toy's popularity remains undiminished, and some of the 50,000 followers of the Lufsig Facebook group page expressed their disappointment with IKEA. ""It's just improper planning, you can't even order one online so people who have to work everyday can't get one,"" said one disgruntled Lufsig fan. However, despite the immediate demand for the toy, the resell market hasn't caught fire, with dolls  selling on the Hong Kong portal of eBay for around HK$140-$150 ($18-19), a modest 40-50% markup. IKEA said that Lufsig would next be in stock around the end of March, although it remains to be seen if he will retain his political potency in the meantime.","IKEA's hit toy sold out within hours of restock in Hong Kong .

"A federal judge in Utah has struck down part of that state's law banning polygamy, after a lawsuit was brought by the stars of the television reality series ""Sister Wives."" The ruling late Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups threw out  the law's section prohibiting ""cohabitation,"" saying it violates constitutional guarantees of due process and religious freedom. But the judge said he would keep in place the ban on bigamy ""in the literal sense -- the fraudulent or otherwise impermissible possession of two purportedly valid marriage licenses for the purpose of entering into more than one purportedly legal marriage."" The 91-page decision comes months after the Supreme Court struck down a separate federal law that defined marriage as between only one man and one woman, a major legal, political, and social victory for homosexual couples seeking recognition of their same-sex unions. The current suit was brought two years ago by Kody Brown, a Utah resident and his four wives -- Meri, Janelle, Christine, and Robyn -- who together have 17 children, and whose lives are chronicled on the TLC cable television program. Polyamory: When three isn't a crowd . They claim their privacy rights were being violated by the decades-old law, passed around the time Utah became a state. They are members of a fundamentalist branch of the Mormon Church  known as the Apostolic United Brethren Church. Brown and his family  said in a statement they were grateful for the ruling. ""Many people do not approve of plural families,"" he said, but ""we hope that in time all of our neighbors and fellow citizens will come to respect our own choices as part of this wonderful country of different faiths and beliefs."" Some religious groups criticized the ruling. ""This is what happens when marriage becomes about the emotional and sexual wants of adults, divorced from the needs of children for a mother and a father committed to each other for life,"" said Russell Moore, of the Southern Baptist Convention. ""Polygamy was outlawed in this country because it was demonstrated, again and again, to hurt women and children. Sadly, when marriage is elastic enough to mean anything, in due time it comes to mean nothing."" There was no initial reaction to the ruling from Utah officials, but they are expected to appeal. The case is Brown v. Buhman (2:11-cv-652).","Ruling would keep in place the ban on bigamy in its ""literal,"" fraudulent-intent sense .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen and security forces exchanged fire near the U.S.-Mexico border Saturday, one day after a top leader of the Gulf drug cartel was killed, the Mexican state media reported. Authorities in Reynosa, which is across the border from McAllen, Texas, were telling people to avoid road travel, Notimex reported. It also warned of shootouts between gunman and security forces there. The trouble came one day after Antonio Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, known as ""Tony Tormenta"" or ""Tony the Storm,"" was killed in Matamoros, a city to the east of Reynosa. Cardenas, 48, was a top leader of one of Mexico's major drug-trafficking operations, and the U.S. State Department had been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. Saturday, U.S. President Barack Obama called his counterpart in Mexico to express his support for Felipe Calderon's efforts to ""end the impunity of organized criminal groups,"" the White House said in a statement. Obama also reportedly offered his condolences on the death of the Mexican officials who died during the operation. Naval troops were met with grenades and assault-weapon fire when they approached Cardenas' hideout in the center of the city around 3:30 p.m. Friday (5:30 p.m. ET), the Mexican navy said. Four other suspected members of the cartel were also killed in the operation, which ended about 5:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET) the navy said. Three naval officers were killed and four others were injured, authorities said. ""Today was another significant step in the destruction of criminal organizations that have done so much to damage the people of this country,"" said Alejandro Poire, security spokesman for the Mexican government, soon after Friday's clash. The Gulf cartel is one of Mexico's major drug-trafficking organizations. It is based in Matamoros, which is across the border from Brownsville, Texas. It is also strong in Reynosa. Both cities are located in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which has become a bloody battleground between the Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. The Zetas used to be the armed branch of the Gulf Cartel but split off into a separate drug-trafficking organization earlier this year. Cardenas allegedly began his drug trafficking career during the late 1980s, rose through the ranks of the Gulf cartel and was eventually given control over the Matamoros-Brownsville corridor, the U.S. State Department said. In that role, he has been responsible for shipments of marijuana and cocaine across the border, according to the State Department. He has been indicted several times by U.S. federal authorities for alleged drug trafficking crimes, including directing drug shipments by boats, planes and cars from Colombia and Venezuela to Guatemala, Mexico and Texas, according to a statement from the U.S. Justice Department last year. Friday's operation came after more than six months of intelligence gathering, the Mexican navy said. The four others suspected cartel members killed Friday were ""part of the circle of protection closest to 'Tony Tormenta,'"" the navy said. The University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College canceled classes through Saturday and said it would rework several weekend events ""because of gunfire taking place across the Rio Grande."" Most of the students and faculty members have gone home, said Letty Fernandez, a university spokeswoman. The campus is about half a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border. More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Calderon intensified the government's fight against cartels and organized crime after taking office in 2006, according to government figures. Authorities have scored a string of important wins against drug cartels recently. In September, officials arrested Sergio Villarreal, known to Mexican officials as ""El Grande,"" an alleged top leader of the Beltran Leyva cartel. His capture came soon after the August arrest of American-born ""La Barbie,"" or Edgar Valdez, thought to be one of Mexico's most ruthless drug traffickers. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo and Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama calls Mexico's president to express his support .

"With barely a month until the World Cup opens in Brazil, violent protests and strikes are breaking out across the country by groups angry about the changes the sporting event has brought -- and what it hasn't. Demonstrations were held in 18 cities Thursday. The biggest and most violent was in Sao Paulo, where police shot tear gas and protesters threw rocks and smashed the windows of a car dealership and a bank. While thousands of people took part in the protests, they were still much smaller than the massive marches seen during the Confederations Cup last year when tens of thousands took to the streets. In the morning, the Homeless Workers Movement blocked main avenues across the city and about 4,000 people marched on the Arena Sao Paulo where the inaugural game of the World Cup will be held on June 12. Demonstrators accuse the government of spending billions on new stadiums and not enough on low-income housing. ""The World Cup has done nothing to help us,"" said Diana, a manicurist who has been on a list for a government-subsidized house for a decade. ""So we decided to use it as a platform to make our voices heard."" Taking advantage of the global attention focused on the country for the world soccer championship, other groups are staging protests to air their grievances. Across the country in Recife, also a World Cup venue, soldiers were deployed to rein in crime and looting after police went on strike there. In Sao Paulo, more than 5,000 striking teachers marched to demand higher wages. In the evening, a string of anti-World Cup protests were staged in different cities. In Sao Paulo, activists turned out carrying banners that said ""FIFA go home"" and ""A World Cup without the people means we're back on the street again!"" About 1,500 people marched peacefully for a couple of blocks before clashes erupted. Anti-World Cup protesters and homeless activists vowed to keep up the pressure through the global event that ends on July 13. A total of 600,000 foreign visitors are expected for the cup and another three million Brazilian fans are expected to travel around the country.","The World Cup opens in Brazil on June 12 .

"Singapore's pollution standards index (PSI) tipped the scales at 401 at noon on Friday, the highest ever recorded, as the government warned that the lingering haze could last for weeks. The National Environment Agency warned the elderly, pregnant women, children and those with heart and lung conditions to remain indoors as the index hit an historic high. An index reading above 300 is defined as ""hazardous"" and is regarded as potentially life threatening to the ill and elderly. Interactive: See the smog descend on Singapore . Meanwhile, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsieng Loong warned residents angry about the smoke wafting in from Indonesia that they may have to learn to live with it, for now. ""We can't tell how this problem is going to develop because it depends on the burning, it depends on the weather, it depends on the wind,"" he told a press conference on Thursday. ""It can easily last for several weeks and quite possibly it could last longer until the dry season ends in Sumatra which may be September or October."" The Straits Times reported that queues had formed outside pharmacies across the island on Friday morning and that many had sold out of the particulate-filtering N95 respiratory masks within minutes. While schools remained closed in Singapore for the summer break, more than 300 were shut temporarily in nearby Malaysia due to the haze. Many office workers in the city-state, meanwhile, struggled to get to work through the haze-shrouded central business district. ""It looks like footage of London smog in the 1950s, except that it smells like a day-old hearth,"" a British expat energy sector analyst, who did not want to be named, told CNN. 'It smells like burning' says Singapore resident . Singapore's Minister for the Environment, Vivian Balakrishnan, flew to Jakarta on Thursday evening to meet with his Indonesian counterparts in a bid to coordinate a response to the smoke problem. The haze, caused by seasonal burn off in Sumatra, has strained relations between the two countries which normally share friendly ties. ""Singapore should not be behaving like a child and making all this noise,"" senior Indonesian minister Agung Laksono told a press conference on Thursday. ""It's not what Indonesians want, it's nature."" Singapore -- which prides itself on its good air quality and green credentials - -- has blamed Indonesian commercial interests for causing the smoke problem. ""Singaporeans have lost patience, and are understandably angry, distressed and concerned,"" Balakrishnan said on his Facebook page. ""No country or corporation has the right to pollute the air at the expense of Singaporeans' health and wellbeing."" Jakarta, meanwhile, has pointed the finger at Singaporean palm oil ventures which it says have caused the smog by clearing land to make way for plantations that provide the feedstock for city-state's refining industry. ""The slash-and-burn technique being used is the cheapest land-clearing method and it is not only used by local farmers, but also employees of palm oil investors including Singaporean and Malaysian companies,'' Hadi Daryanto, a senior official at Indonesia's Forestry Ministry, told Indonesian media. ""We hope the governments of Malaysia and Singapore will tell their investors to adopt proper measures so we can solve this problem together.'' Three Singapore-based palm oil companies with land concessions in Indonesia, including Wilmar International Ltd, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd and First Resources Ltd, said this week they had ""zero burning"" policies and used only mechanical means to clear land. Singapore's Prime Minister Lee said the city-state had provided satellite data to Indonesia to help identify who was responsible for the fires.","Singapore's pollution index hits record high as smoke lingers over city state .

"When Jason Collins pulls on his No. 98 Brooklyn Nets jersey, he's not just representing a basketball team. As the first openly gay player in major U.S. sports, he's also paying tribute to Matthew Shepard, the victim of one of the most infamous hate crimes in recent American history. Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, was beaten to death in 1998. ""I was very fortunate to speak with Matthew's mother, Judy,"" Collins told CNN's ""Unguarded with Rachel Nichols."" ""She had some great advice I don't think she would mind me sharing. Typically I like to keep private conversations private but her message was: 'Let the haters hate. Just keep living your life and keep going out there and being yourself.' "" It's a powerful message and it's proving effective -- earlier this week Collins' No. 98 jersey became the best-selling in the NBA. Not bad when you consider that Collins -- who had been without a team after coming out at the end of last season -- has only signed a 10-day contract with the Nets. ""It's really cool to see the support that's out there,"" he said. ""It's cool to see that people are going out there and buying the jersey and wearing it with pride. ""So I hope that continues and I'll keep wearing the jersey and keep going out there and trying to do my job."" Collins has been doing his job since making his NBA debut in 2001. He spent seven years with the New Jersey Nets, the former name of his current employer, before going on to play for Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards. The center's first game of 2014 couldn't have gone any better. The 35-year-old played 10 minutes during a 108-102 win at the Los Angeles Lakers -- his hometown team -- and was given a warm ovation by the Staples Center crowd. The reception he received is an indication of Collins' newfound prominence. Since coming out in a cover story for an issue of Sports Illustrated in April 2013, he has become part of a band of high-profile U.S. athletes who have gone public about their homosexuality -- and they have been supporting each other. U.S. international Robbie Rogers, who plays for Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy, announced he was gay two months before Collins. After telling the world about his sexuality, Collins went to Rogers for advice on how to handle the media. NFL prospect Michael Sam revealed he was gay this month after completing his college career. If drafted by a franchise, he will become the league's first openly gay player. ""I've met some other athletes who are in the same position as I am,"" explained Collins. ""We're sort of like a fraternity just trying to help each other, just trying to keep inspiring each other, whether it be Robbie Rogers or Michael Sam, the list goes on and on. ""And it's really great to you know hear each other's stories and keep inspiring each other to work,"" added Collins, who was a guest of First Lady Michelle Obama at the State of the Union address in January. A free agent since July, Collins' determination to get back in the NBA was such that he went on a five-mile run the morning before his trip to the House of Representatives. ""I've grown so much as an individual, I've come across so many great people, great organizations, heard so many great stories, inspiring stories,"" he said. ""I feel like with my actions I've had a positive impact on someone else's life."" While Collins' return to the NBA has been a success, it could well be short-lived. His temporary contract means he could be out of the league again by the end of next week, but he remains hopeful of extending his professional career. ""You know anything can happen -- anything's possible,"" he said. ""You continue to work hard, that's what I did over the past 10 months ... Always having that positive mindset that good things will happen if you prepare for it. ""It's the same environment. Everything is the same. Like I said before, 12 years in the NBA, not a problem, not an issue. Year 13, not a problem, not an issue, same old, same old."" For the man who is changing the face of the U.S. basketball, Collins is convinced everything looks just like it did before.","Jason Collins is the first openly gay player in major U.S. sport history .

"At her research lab at the University of Louisville, neuroscientist Susan Harkema turned her back to her study subject to check a reading on a computer screen. ""Hey Susie, look at this,"" the patient called out to her. ""I can move my toe!"" Startled, Harkema spun around. The purpose of her study, which involves sending electrical stimulation to broken spinal cords, was to learn more about nerve pathways, not to actually make patients move. That must be an involuntary spasm, she thought. She asked the patient, Rob Summers, to lie down and close his eyes and follow her commands. ""Move your left toe,"" she said to him -- and he did. ""Move your right toe,"" she asked -- and he did. ""Holy s***!"" she yelled out loud. Over the next five years, Harkema's team applied electrical stimulation to three more paralyzed men, and all four developed movement, and not just small movements. In addition to wiggling their big toes, they can lift and swing their legs, move their ankles and sit up without support. Two patients can even do situps. Their study, funded in part by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, is being published Tuesday in the journal Brain. It's not the first time electrical stimulation has made paralyzed patients move, but Harkema says it's the first time electrical stimulation directly to the spinal cord has shown voluntary activity. Experts say this new technique is another piece of the puzzle toward helping paralyzed people walk again. And it's another avenue doctors can go down to try to help these patients. Brain-controlled devices may help paralyzed people . ""This is a breakthrough,"" says Dr. Barth Green, co-founder of The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami, who was not involved in the research. ""It shows you can have a living spinal cord under the layer of their injury."" More than 1,700 paralyzed people have inquired about using this technology, which involves surgically implanting a stimulator and giving it directions with an external remote control. The stimulator creates a small, slightly visible bulge in the lower abdomen and is connected to wires that send electrical pulses to the spinal cord. But patients shouldn't expect that the stimulator will help them walk -- at least not now and maybe not ever. The stimulator can only make one leg work at a time. Patients have to turn the stimulator off and then back on again to make the other leg work or to make another set of muscles such as their torsos work. Even though he can't walk, the stimulator has had other benefits. Dustin Shillcox, the fourth patient to try the device, said he has dramatically improved bladder, bowel and sexual function. ""That's a difficult thing to go through life not having,"" he said. ""It just changed my entire life. It's extraordinary and amazing."" Plus, tests showed the patients, who could finally move their legs and torsos after years of paralysis, became healthier in general with improved heart and respiratory function. ""If you can change health and wellness and life expectancy, to me that's a home run,"" Green says. ""Remember, Christopher Reeve died from complications of immobility,"" The researchers are pretty much stumped as to exactly why electrical stimulation to the spinal cord created the movement on demand -- after all, they didn't touch the patients' brains. Perhaps, Harkema says, the spinal cord in a way has a brain of its own. ""Maybe the spinal cord makes the decision to move on its own and then executes the movement,"" Harkema says. ""Otherwise I don't know how you would see what we see today."" The Louisville researchers now have funding to implant the device in eight more patients. They hope a device company will help them come up with a way to stimulate more than one muscle group at the time. ""I think what's incredibly exciting is we've opened up a realm of possibilities of what we can do now with people who are paralyzed, and we've just scratched the surface,"" she says. Harkema says she hopes to have more ""holy s***"" moments in her research. ""I'll never live that down, and now it's the mantra of the lab,"" she says with a laugh.

"(CNN) -- Controversial whistleblower Julian Assange was ""a very bright boy with a keen sense of right and wrong"" when he was growing up, according to his stepfather. The young Assange grew up constantly on the move, the son of parents who were in the theater business in Australia. Brett Assange, who now lives alone in Sydney, was Julian's first real dad, raising him from the age of one and giving him his surname. In an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate Seven News, he described his stepson as a ""sharp kid who always fought for the underdog."" He added: ""Strangely enough I always thought he would do something like this. He was always very independent. And he certainly wouldn't take no for an answer. ""He always stood up for the underdog. I remember that, like with his school friends. He was always very angry about people ganging up on other people. He had a really good sense of equality and equity."" Now age 39, Julian Assange faces his toughest challenge yet, as he sits in a British jail fighting Swedish attempts to extradite him in relation to a sex crimes investigation. Cyberattacks follow Assange's arrest . This comes as his Web site, WikiLeaks, has been releasing reams of classified U.S. intelligence, prompting politicians and power-players the world over to call for his arrest for exposing sensitive documents. Supporters contend Assange represents free speech at its finest. They say he is a man and an organization committed to outing injustices. Yet despite unrelenting global media attention, Assange has remained an enigmatic figure. Perhaps that's because he learned as a child to cope with living a solitary life. Assange has been described by his mother, Christine, as ""highly intelligent."" He was just 16 when she bought him a Commodore 64 computer. It was 1987, and there were no Web sites. Assange attached a modem to his computer and began his journey through the growing world of computer networks. ""It's like chess,"" he told New Yorker magazine. ""Chess is very austere in that you don't have many rules, there is no randomness and the problem is very hard."" Though his mother raised him without any religious influence, she sensed that from a tender age, her son was led by a strong desire to do what he perceived as just. ""He was a lovely boy, very sensitive, good with animals, quiet and has a wicked sense of humor,"" she told the Melbourne, Australia, Herald Sun newspaper Wednesday. He would go on to study mathematics and physics at the University of Melbourne. In interviews, his scientific precision shines through. He speaks in a baritone voice, in measured pace, choosing each word carefully. He can be charming yet cagey about his private life and is rarely shaken by discussions of even the most controversial revelations on WikiLeaks. He's the kind of person who, he says, can hack into the most sophisticated computer system. But he can forget to show up for an interview. Or cancel at the last minute. When he talks, he displays an astonishing breadth of interests: from computers to literature to his travels in Africa. Even when he walked out of a CNN interview in October after refusing to answer questions about the sex charges in Sweden, Assange remained cool and collected. He projected a stately demeanor helped by his profusion of gray hair -- which grew at an early age -- and an equally steely facial expression. After his initial foray into computers, Assange delved into computer encryption and grew keen on computer security. He once relayed a story about how he set up an encryption puzzle based on the manipulation of prime numbers. The New Yorker article, published earlier this year, described how in 1991, Assange hacked into the master terminal of the telecom company Nortel, after which he developed a growing fear of arrest. He had married and fathered a child when he was only 18 but the relationship fell apart and his wife left him with their infant son. He was charged with 31 counts of hacking in Australia but in the end paid only a small sum in damages, according to the New Yorker. The young hacker began to focus his attention away from network flaws to what he perceived as wrongdoings of governments. In a 2007 blog post on IQ.org, he wrote: . ""The whole universe or the structure that perceives it is a worthy opponent, but try as I may I can not escape the sound of suffering. Perhaps as an old man I will take great comfort in pottering around in a lab and gently talking to students in the summer evening and will accept suffering with insouciance. But not now; men in their prime, if they have convictions are tasked to act on them."" IQ.org is believed to be a blog created by Assange and is registered under the name ""JA"" by the same U.S. domain company as WikiLeaks. Its Australian postal address is also the same as a submissions address for WikiLeaks. Among myriad topics addressed in the blog, Assange discusses mathematics versus philosophy, the death of author Kurt Vonnegut, censorship in Iran and the corporation as a nation state. Driven by the conviction of an activist and the curiosity of a journalist, Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006. He slept little and sometimes forgot to eat. He hired staff and enlisted the help of volunteers. Always, he protected his sources, never discussing where information came from. ""People should understand that WikiLeaks has proven to be arguably the most trustworthy new source that exists, because we publish primary source material and analysis based on that primary source material,"" Assange told CNN. ""Other organizations, with some exceptions, simply are not trustworthy."" The Web site skyrocketed to notoriety in July when it published 90,000 secret documents about the war in Afghanistan. It was considered the largest intelligence leak in U.S. history. WikiLeaks followed in October with classified documents about the Iraq war. And then this week, it began posting 250,000 cables revealing a trove of secret diplomatic information. Some praised WikiLeaks as a beacon of free speech. But others, including outraged Pentagon and White House officials, consider it irresponsible and want WikiLeaks silenced for what they call irreparable damage to global security. Assange, the elusive public face of WikiLeaks, catapulted to celebrity status. The image of the lean, lanky, leather jacket-clad figure with the pale skin and mop of white hair was splashed on television screens and websites. Everyone wanted to know how the editor in chief of WikiLeaks had pulled it off. Time magazine has nominated him for its Person of the Year, calling him a ""new kind of whistle-blower ... for the digital age."" But Assange's notoriety did not stop there. Shortly after the Afghan war releases, he became the subject of a sex crime case in Sweden. The Stockholm Criminal Court issued an international arrest warrant for Assange two weeks ago on probable cause in that case, saying he is suspected of rape, sexual molestation and illegal use of force in separate incidents in August. He could be sentenced to two years in prison if convicted. Interpol issued a high alert for Assange on Wednesday at the request of Sweden. Assange has maintained his innocence and called the charges in Sweden a smear campaign. He has also dismissed reports of internal strife within WikiLeaks. Daniel Domscheit-Berg, a longtime volunteer and spokesman for WikiLeaks who recently quit his job, told CNN that Assange's personality was distracting from the group's original mission: to publish small leaks, not just huge, splashy ones like the Afghan War Diary. Assange took issue. ""It is my role to be the lightning rod,"" Assange said. ""That is a difficult role. On the other hand, I get undue credit."" Assange's mother said Wednesday that she feared her son had become ""too smart for himself."" ""I'm concerned it's gotten too big and the forces that he's challenging are too big,"" Christine Assange told the Herald Sun. She did not comment on the sex crimes charges in Sweden. But she said lately, Assange had distanced himself from his family to protect them. Assange, too, declined to address the charges in the October interview with CNN in London. ""This interview is about something else. I will have to walk if you are ... going to contaminate this extremely serious interview with questions about my personal life,"" he said. Then, he pulled off his mic, said sorry, and walked away. CNN's Mia Aquino, Atika Shubert, Ashley Fantz, Moni Basu and Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.","Stepfather described him as a ""sharp kid who always fought for the underdog""

"Hong Kong (CNN)Student leaders will meet with Hong Kong government representatives Tuesday, the first time the two sides have met since pro-democracy protesters took to the streets of the city more than three weeks ago. But while the talks present the best chance for a peaceful resolution to the chaotic demonstrations that have convulsed the city and divided its residents, they are unlikely to yield major concessions given that the government and protest leaders remain poles apart. ""The start of talks is not an end in itself,"" said Anson Chan, a former senior government official. ""Only the government can break the current impasse.  It must show the leadership that has been totally lacking in the past three weeks, by coming to the table with proposals that offer genuine and substantial reform."" But this seems unlikely. Beijing unlikely to budge . Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung has said repeatedly that he would not step down -- a key demand of protesters. Nor, Leung has said, is Beijing unlikely to budge on its prescription for electoral reform in the city and offer the kind of democracy protesters are seeking. Even the moderator of the talks, Lingnan University President Leonard Cheng, warned not to expect too much: . ""I'm not going to speculate at all about whether there will be a resolution,"" he said on Monday, adding that this would not be the only round of talks. Five representatives from the Hong Kong Federation of Students including Alex Chow, the group's secretary general, and his deputy Lester Shum will meet with Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's second in command, Justice Secretary Rimsky Yuen and three other senior government officials or advisers. The talks begin at 6 p.m. local time and will be broadcast live from The Hong Kong Academy of Medicine in an event that will likely have the city's seven million residents gripped. Some say they will hold viewing parties and the talks will be live-streamed to crowds on big screens set up in some areas -- including Mong Kok, a busy commercial district that has seen some of the most violent confrontations between demonstrators, police and residents that oppose the protests. Poor can't be trusted? On Monday, Leung offered a controversial defense of Beijing's plan for elections in the financial capital, telling foreign media that an open nomination process would give the city's poorest residents greater influence over the political system. ""You have to take care of all the sectors in Hong Kong as much as you can,"" he said, according to the New York Times. ""And if it's entirely a numbers game and numeric representation, then obviously you would be talking to half of the people in Hong Kong who earn less than $1,800 a month. ""Then you would end up with that kind of politics and policies."" His comments are likely to rankle the protesters and their sympathizers given Hong Kong's yawning wealth gap and a widespread perception that the current system of government is stacked against ordinary citizens. Wiggle room . One possible concession the government could make to immediately defuse tensions would be to re-open Civil Square -- a fenced off courtyard outside central government headquarters that students stormed at the end of September, triggering the unprecedented protests. There is also still some possibility of give-and-take on electoral reform,  such as allowing more democrats on the nomination committee or by promising to introduce greater democracy in elections slated in 2022. The framework proposed for the election of the city's next leader in 2017 will allow registered voters to select their leader, although candidates must be approved by a committee that critics say will be stacked with Beijing loyalists and not be representative of Hong Kong. Currently, the chief executive is elected by a specially-appointed 1,200-member election committee. However, even if the talks yield concrete concessions, there is no guarantee that the protesters on the streets will go home. There are several protest groups and it's not always clear who calls the shots or whether Hong Kong's young protesters will listen. ""I would want C.Y. to step down and for the government to show that they are sincere,"" protester Janice Tung told CNN. CNN's Esther Pang, Anjali Tsui, Paula Newton, Pamela Boykoff  and CNN Money's Charles Riley contributed to this report.","Student leaders will meet with Hong Kong government representatives on Tuesday evening .
It's the first time the two sides have met since pro-democracy protesters took to the streets .

However, few expect major concessions."
"To Oriannah Paul and many on the right, embattled Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is a hero who stood on principles and took the state out of the red and created a surplus. To Lane Hall and many on the left, Walker is a man who should be removed from office for stripping collective bargaining rights and cutting education funding. In March 2011, after weeks of bitter dispute highlighted by demonstrations inside the state Capitol, Walker and GOP allies in the Wisconsin State Legislature pushed through a bill to limit raises for public employees, except police and firefighters, to the rate of inflation. They also moved to bar unions from deducting dues from workers' paychecks. Meet Scott Walker: From the archives, watch Gov. Walker in 2011 make his case: ""we don't have any more money.' The past 16 months have been a nonstop slugfest, pitting neighbor against neighbor, and in some cases splitting families in half ideologically. 'Where's the civility?' Paul, a tea party follower and founder of the Sheboygan Liberty Coalition, glows when she talks about Scott Walker. People know she's a fan when she drives by in her pickup truck with its magnetic ""Scott Walker is my hero"" bumper stickers. But when she talks about the nastiness of the race, fear transforms her expression. ""I've never seen anything like this in my life,"" Paul says of the negativity. ""Where's the civility?  Why can't we be amicable?"" Paul says her car -- plastered with her Walker bumper stickers -- has been keyed, and she's even been hit in the head with a sign, all because of the recall race. Does Obama's absence portend outcome of Wisconsin recall vote? ""It's unfortunate that there has to be so much division,"" she says. A dog groomer as of a few years ago, Paul has only just recently gotten involved in politics. It started with a general dislike of President Barack Obama, and it's coming to a head with this one race, a race she believes will carry over into the general election. She's organizing rallies and taking part in various door-knocking and phone bank efforts. ""We are facing one of the most critical elections in the history of this country. What happens here will determine what happens across the country."" Tim Phillips is president of Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group built around many of the same principles as the tea party. They've pumped more than $10 million into Wisconsin touting Walker's policies. Phillips agrees there are larger implications at stake. ""It's big for the people of Wisconsin and their economic future, but I think it's even bigger nationally as well. I think every governor, every state legislator around the country is looking at Wisconsin, and they're going, OK, if I got the courage to stand up and do what I think is right to get my state moving again ... will someone have my back? And hopefully the answer is going to be, you bet."" Americans for Prosperity launched its final effort in this campaign, a bus tour titled ""A Better Wisconsin,"" on Wednesday. Paul was present at the Sheboygan stop. The tour wraps up with a large rally hosted by the Racine chapter of the tea party and will not only include the AFP bus but the Tea Party Express bus as well. TPE launched a bus tour Saturday that wraps up on election day. Democrats may not be planning any bus tours, but they did plan several rallies over the weekend. They've also been campaigning for Barrett in some rather unconventional ways. 'This is a story ... about Wisconsin' Lane Hall is a 56-year-old English professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Per Walker's legislation -- known as simply Act 10 -- Hall's benefits were cut by 8%. And while 8% may not sound as bad as others in the state have seen, Hall says the benefits package at UW-Milwaukee used to be the selling point at the school. ""It is seriously difficult now to both retain and attract quality people,"" Hall said. ""We are no longer competitive."" Democratic group makes $100k Wisconsin push in final days . Hall has never described himself as a political activist but, on this issue, he said to himself he ""can't sit this one out."" He wanted to come up with a way to make eye-catching campaign signs for the after-dark hours. He and his wife built their very first sign out of battery-powered LED lights and it said simply, ""Recall Walker."" The signs have only gotten more elaborate, and the Overpass Light Brigade, as they're known because they display their signs on bridges after dark, has grown into a routine party. Hall said they'll sometimes have as many as 60 people at their ""bridge parties"" on pedestrian overpasses. ""We started to realize that the power of it is really in the community of volunteers."" State Democratic Party spokesman Graeme Zielinski said those on the left are banking on that same community to show up to vote on Tuesday. Some public polls have given a slight single-digit edge to Walker, but Zielinski says the Democratic base is far from giving up hope. In fact, he says, internal numbers show it's dead even. ""We're too close,"" Zielinski said. ""You're not going to fight for something for 16 months and then give up in the last couple of days."" Team Walker has seen a whole host of rock star Republicans in recent weeks -- Govs. Chris Christie, Nikki Haley, Bobby Jindal -- while Team Barrett only just Friday got some star power of its own in former President Bill Clinton. Zielinski said none of that will matter. ""We love our national friends, we think they're great, but this is a a story right now about Wisconsin."" Regardless of who wins on Tuesday, both sides say they hope the vitriol subsides after election day. But they aren't all that optimistic. Said Paul, the newly minted Sheboygan activist: ""I think the dividedness is not going away anytime soon.""","""Where's the civility,"" says Oriannah Paul, a backer of Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker .

"Angry and frustrated over both the search and rescue operation and the flow of information from South Korean authorities, dozens of relatives of missing ferry passengers intending to march in protest to Seoul were blocked by police from leaving Jindo. Early Sunday around 2 a.m, the family members left their temporary shelter at an indoor gym and demanded they be able to go to the Blue House -- the official residence of the South Korean President Park Geun-hye -- to present their complaints. The residence is located in the capital, Seoul -- some 275 miles north of Jindo. Jindo is the port city where the search, rescue and recovery operation has been based since the ferry, carrying 476 passengers, capsized and sank on Wednesday. Hundreds of passengers remain unaccounted for. A police cordon prevented the planned march from proceeding, witnesses said. A few scuffles broke out but no one was reported hurt. ""We are not getting any help, so we want to go to the Blue House,' said Nam Sa Hyun, an older sister of a student who is missing from the ferry. ""We want to tell the president about our situation."" Transcript of desperate calls released . ""For four days, there is no help. Right now, nobody is giving information on the missing. Our children are in the boat and there is no plan."" Though the police were not aggressive to the protesting families, Nam questioned why there were so many officers at the site of anguished relatives. ""They're not letting us get on the bus, the police are blocking us,"" she said. ""They're not helping us, they're just blocking us."" Several families stayed in the street, attempting to break through police lines in their march. Some families lay down on the ground, sleeping outside in the cold to express their displeasure. In a video sent to CNN, angry parents yelled at officials who were trying to convince the families to go back to the gym, which serves as a temporary shelter for families. ""I can't believe them,"" a woman shouted at the official who was urging them to return. ""Let's go on our way. Why do we sit here and listen to them?'","Families sheltered at a gym attempt to take grievances to South Korean president .

"Hong Kong, as anyone who has lived or worked in the city knows, is simultaneously China, and not China. The complex legal framework that was put in place when the city reverted to Chinese rule in 1997 makes it a unique case, and one which means that the delineations between the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and the mainland are rarely straightforward. The differences between the two provide a wealth of reasons why they are often at loggerheads -- and no more so than now, with tens of thousands of Hong Kongers taking to the streets to protest what they see as Beijing's undue encroachment into Hong Kong's civil affairs and political structure. Certainly Hong Kong's unique history has set it apart. While the former colony was returned to Chinese sovereignty, the British colonial legacy has endured, and with it a set of institutions and historical, cultural, economic, legal and lifestyle differences. Here are just a few of them examined. Historical . Compared with China throughout much of the city's modern history, Hong Kong has been a bastion of peace, prosperity and, in the 1960s and 70s, a haven from the horrors of the Cultural Revolution. The city has welcomed refugees from across China, notably Shanghai, since the civil war and the rise of the Communist party in 1949. Indeed, Chinese migrants to the port city provided the pool of skilled and unskilled labor that made Hong Kong the manufacturing hub that it once was, setting it on the path to economic success. When a British landing party planted their flag at Possession Point on Hong Kong island over 170 years ago, they set in motion one of the most complex political relationships to endure to the present day. While the island of Hong Kong was ceded in perpetuity following the first Opium War, the bulk of Hong Kong's landmass, the Kowloon peninsula and the New Territories, were leased from China. When the New Territories' lease was due to expire, in 1997, it was decided that the former colony would be returned, in its entirety, to China. Since then the city has endured a ""brain drain"" in the 1980s and the early 90s, after Britain and China had agreed the handover of sovereignty, and particularly when the Tiananmen crackdowns in 1989 were fresh in the memories of those Hong Kongers who could find their way out. There are some who fear that clampdowns on civil liberties might mean the city could soon face another exodus: ""I'm worried that people might migrate again,"" Michael Davis, a law professor at Hong Kong University, told CNN's Andrew Stevens.. ""That would be a disaster."" The Basic Law: ""One country, two systems"" Hong Kong's defacto constitution, the Basic Law, states that Hong Kong will co-exist with China as ""one country, two systems"" for 50 years after the handover of power in 1997. Due to expire in 2047, it states that the city ""shall safeguard the rights and freedoms of the residents."" One of the tenets contained in the Basic Law, and reaffirmed by Lu Ping, China's then-top official on Hong Kong, was the right to develop its own democracy. ""How Hong Kong develops its democracy in the future is completely within the sphere of the autonomy of Hong Kong,"" Lu was quoted as saying in the state media People's Daily in March 1993. ""The central government will not interfere."" Beijing, however, has repeatedly reinterpreted the document, and in June of this year released a White Paper reaffirming its ""complete jurisdiction"" over Hong Kong. While the city enjoys many more legal freedoms than China -- including, crucially, the right to assembly -- this can be a brickbat for pro-Beijing voices. ""The stability of Hong Kong is crucial,"" Victor Gao, director of the China National Association of International Studies told CNN from Beijing.  ""There are better channels for people in Hong Kong to express their positions, rather than resorting to illegal means of creating disturbances and counterproductive means of preventing other people... to go along with their lives."" Culture and lifestyle . It is hard to foster a sense of togetherness after almost two centuries of being separate. Linguistically -- Cantonese is the common tongue here -- socially and culturally, Hong Kong and the mainland can seem worlds apart. Sometimes the differences are seemingly minor; one prominent, telling example is of a video, shared on social media, of an altercation over a mainland tourist eating noodles on the MTR, Hong Kong's pristine subway system. But even what appear to be surface differences can explode, and videos like this often go viral here, highlighting the differences between locals and their mainland cousins. Much of the frustration is borne of the impact mainland visitors have in Hong Kong -- crowding locals out of everywhere from maternity wards to high end boutiques, and pricing them out of the housing market. Around the time of the MTR incident, a crowdsourced newspaper ad warned against an ""invasion"" of ""locusts"" -- mainlanders who would figuratively devour everything in their path. For those across the border in the mainland, the perception of Hong Kongers ranges from admiration to a feeling of contempt: Following the media storm that followed the MTR noodle-eating incident, a prominent Chinese academic, Peking University professor Kong Qingdong, called Hong Kongers ""bastards"" and imperialist ""running dogs."" Hong Kong identity . Every six months since the handover in 1997, Hong Kong University has surveyed a sample of Hong Kong residents to gauge feelings of identity in the city. The last poll was conducted in June, when over 40% of those questioned said they identified as a ""Hong Konger,"" rather than ""Chinese"" (amongst other options), a percentage that has crept up in the past 17 years. ""The protesters are unhappy because Hong Kong is becoming more and more like China,"" Chinese tourist, 24-year old Liujing, from Hainan, told CNN at spillover protests in the Mong Kok region of Kowloon. ""I support them because growing up, we always admired Hong Kong. If Hong Kong became like China then that would be a real shame."" ""In the mainland, first of all, we would never hear about something like this because of censorship. In the mainland, this protest would be forcibly dispersed within two hours,"" she said. ""Here it's different. I don't think police will open fire because Hong Kong is a safe place."" ""I'm not sure the protesters will get what they want, but I support them."" Legal . Hong Kong is rightfully proud of the near-universal respect of the rule of law. For many, it is what sets Hong Kong apart from the mainland and its reputation for honesty is one of the reasons that so many multinationals have based their regional headquarters in the city. The police generally have the trust of the population -- although how this trust will be affected by the events of the past few days remains to be seen. It wasn't always thus; until the creation of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), a nongovernmental watchdog in the 1960s, graft was as much of a problem here as it is in China. Hong Kong retains a legal system which closely mirrors the British one, another holdover from the colonial era, but one which prizes transparency and due process and is largely welcomed by the populace. The ruling Communist Party controls all aspects of China's judicial process. However, the Basic Law, guarantees the independence of the SAR's judiciary. Economic . Hong Kong maintains its own currency (which is pegged to the U.S. dollar) and the city's ""capitalist"" system is also enshrined in the Basic Law. China's oft-touted economic miracle is, at least in part, traceable to Hong Kong's influence. Not only was the presence of the city's free market a huge influence on the economic reforms of the late 1970s and 80s, but investment in the mainland from Hong Kong tops that from everywhere else combined. The rest of China has benefited greatly from Hong Kong's ""investment, energy and entrepreneurship,"" Hong Kong University's Michael Davis, says. However, as China's economic clout grows, so does Hong Kong's dependence on it. As a logistics center and the world's ""gateway to China"" the city relies heavily on re-export of Chinese manufacturing, and inwards tourism and retail demand from the mainland is a significant earner for Hong Kong. The mainland's promotion of its own cities as rivals to Hong Kong -- Shanghai as a free trade and financial hub, for example -- could further complicate the relationship between Hong Kong and China.","Hong Kong's ""One country, two systems"" governance guarantees the city a high degree of autonomy .
The relationship between Hong Kong and China is often complex .
British colonial legacy and institutions, as well as historical, cultural, economic, legal and lifestyle differences, remain ."
"New York (CNN) -- After more than 40 years in television, Regis Philbin is retiring from the small screen. Philbin, 79, made the announcement Tuesday at the start of the long-running ""Live with Regis & Kelly."" ""This will be my last year on this show ... but there is a time, there is a time that everything needs to come to an end for certain people on camera, especially certain old people,"" Philbin said. The show, now in its 23rd season in national syndication, began as a local morning show in New York in 1983. Kathie Lee Gifford joined Philbin in 1985 on the show and it debuted three years later nationally as ""Live with Regis & Kathie Lee."" Gifford left the show in 2000 and Philbin was joined by current co-host Kelly Ripa in 2001. A choked-up Ripa said Tuesday after Philbin's announcement, ""I think I can only speak for America and all of us here when I say that it has been a pleasure and a privilege and a dream come true, and I wish I could do something to make you change your mind."" No indication was given as to who may co-host with Ripa following Philbin's departure at the end of the year. ""It will never be the same, there's only one Reg,"" said Gifford, who now hosts the fourth hour of NBC's ""Today"" following her 15-year gig on ""Live."" Philbin has been plagued in recent years by health issues, including undergoing triple-bypass surgery in 2007 and a hip replacement in 2009. In 2001, he was awarded Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Game Show Host for ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and Outstanding Talk Show Host for ""Live."" Philbin got his start in show business as a page for ""The Tonight Show,"" before hosting his own self-titled show out of San Diego from 1961-1965. He served as Joey Bishop's sidekick on ""The Joey Bishop Show"" and took ""A.M. Los Angeles"" from low ratings to No. 1 in its local market -- perhaps a preview to his success on daytime TV with ""Live."" Philbin was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2006 and was given the Daytime Emmy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. ""He's an amazing guy,"" Gifford said Tuesday of her former co-host. ""He is every man to so many people and nobody tells a story like Reg."" ""He's going to be 80 this coming August and I think he just figures it's time,"" she added. Philbin and his wife, Joy, have been married for 40 years.","""This will be my last year on this show,"" he says on ""Live with Regis & Kelly""

"The trial of nongovernmental organizations accused of operating illegally in Egypt is slated to resume Tuesday as the case fuels a diplomatic rift between the United States and Egypt. A total of 43 workers are on trial after authorities targeted 10 NGOs in a series of December raids. The defendants include 17 foreigners -- 10 Americans, three Serbians, two Germans, a Norwegian and a Palestinian. The rest are Egyptians. The employees were charged with operating in Egypt without being officially registered and receiving foreign funding. Egyptian officials said their work contributed to international interference that was stoking continued protests against the government. The case of the NGOs sparked one of the worst crises in Egyptian-American relations at the time. ""We continue to make very clear our objection to what we view as these politically motivated trials, and urge the government to stop trying these individuals and instead resolve any outstanding issues that they may have on this matter on a government to government basis,"" Mark Toner, deputy spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said Monday. A group of American, European and Palestinian defendants had been under a travel ban that was eventually lifted. Most left Cairo after posting about $132,000 each in bail money. They will be tried in absentia. Sixteen Americans were part of the group, including Sam LaHood, the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. American Robert Becker chose to stay in Cairo and face state prosecutors. If found guilty, Becker could face up to six years in an Egyptian prison. But he says it's a risk he's willing to take. ""It's a concern. But again, at the end of the day, the guys that I'm going to be in the cage with are part of my family,"" said Becker, who was working with the National Democratic Institute. ""I keep saying captains stay with their crew. There is no way that I would be able to live with myself being safely in the United States if they were potentially facing a jail term."" Becker has experience as a political organizer, with skills greatly in demand in a suddenly re-politicized Egypt. ""Part of our mandate at the NDI was that we trained and we taught everybody, from Islamists ... nationalists, liberals, socialists"" and supporters of ousted President Hosni Mubarak, Becker said. ""So it was thousands of them."" Becker's colleague, Hafsa Halawa, said she is confident justice will prevail. ""We're not guilty of these crimes,"" Halawa said. ""Regardless of the political issues surrounding the case, people cry it's a bogus charge."" If the trial ends with acquittal, however, victory will be bittersweet for Becker. His employer, the NDI, paid his bail and continues to cover his legal expenses, but terminated his services. The other groups targeted by the raids include Freedom House, the International Center for Journalists and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. A group of American lawmakers have said Egypt's action could mean the end of $1.3 billion in U.S. aid. In a letter to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, 41 members of Congress urged the administration to withhold aid to Egypt until the country's leadership allows the offices of those organizations to reopen and returns seized property.","43 defendants are on trial, many in absentia .

"It was supposed to be a class trip to a resort island that's considered the Hawaii of Korea. Instead, a ferry has capsized in the Yellow Sea, and hundreds of people are unaccounted for. The parents of students from a South Korean high school have been clutching their cell phones, waiting for a call from their children or rescuers. On Tuesday night, more than 300 high school students from the city of Ansan departed on a ferry called Sewol for a four-day trip to Jeju Island.  About 70% of those aboard were from the high school. The Sewol pulled out of the port at Incheon at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, according to JTBC, a CNN affiliate. Survivor accounts . Shortly before 9 a.m. Wednesday, passenger Kim Sung-Mook was eating breakfast in the ship's main hall when he felt a tilt, he told CNN affiliate YTN. At first, ""we thought it was because of the tide,"" he said. The waves had been smooth until the ship suddenly leaned, witnesses said. The ship tilted further, and an announcement blared through loudspeakers warning passengers that moving would be dangerous. Then, he heard a loud bang from inside the ship. Kim said he thought a crane on board had toppled over. When seawater started gushing into the ferry, passengers began to scramble. Elsewhere on the ferry, high school student Lim Hyung Min felt tremors that were strong enough to knock shipping containers off balance. Several of his classmates were flung off their feet as the ferry began to lean. ""The students were falling over and crashing into things and bleeding,"" Lim said. The ship tilted further, to about 90 degrees, passengers said. Back in the main hall, Kim heard the buzzing of helicopters overhead. Cafeteria workers were dashing up to the deck. ""The helicopters arrived. They said they could take five more people, so we sent students,"" Kim said. Footage from South Korean media showed helicopters hovering over a half-submerged ferry with panic-stricken passengers scrambling from the side. Announcements on board: Don't move . Not everyone had made it to the top deck, because ""the announcement asked not to move since it could be dangerous. So everyone stayed where they were. But when the water started coming in, people started moving to the upper level,"" he said. Kim managed to get on a helicopter, but he said he'd seen as many as 30 people still trapped inside the ship. Shortly after his rescue, the ship capsized. ""Unless they broke a window, I think it would have been impossible for them to come out,"" Kim told YTN. It remains unclear how many people have survived and how many are missing as the official numbers from authorities have been fluctuating throughout the day. Inside the ferry, Lim told YTN he stayed in a room until rescuers opened a door and threw life jackets in his direction. He was ordered to jump into the ocean, which he described as ""unbearably cold."" After his rescue, Lim went on air on YTN to list the names of his classmates whom he had seen to reassure their parents that they were safe. Agonizing wait for parents . Meanwhile, parents had gathered at Ansan Danwon High School, clutching their cell phones in an agonizing wait for a call from their children. Officials posted a list of names, and each name was circled after confirmation of a rescue. A woman was immediately swarmed by cameras as she received a call from her child. ""Are you OK?"" she cried out. Although their own phones were lost in the water during the rescue, students have been borrowing rescuers' phones to call their parents.  At one point, the school announced that all students had been rescued but soon rescinded the announcement, to the parents' wrath. The students who fell into the water were ""having difficulties due to their body temperatures dropping, but they have blankets and changed their clothes, so they're feeling better now,"" Lim told YTN. The rescued students gathered in a gymnasium awaiting their parents and teachers. They have since departed the school in buses, according to YTN.

"Confronted by police trying to arrest him for allegedly selling illegal cigarettes, Eric Garner raised both hands in the air and, with passive defiance, told the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, a video shows the officer behind him grab the 350-pound man in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" Garner said repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. The video of the Thursday skirmish shows the Staten Island man lying on the ground motionless after the incident. An asthmatic, Garner was later declared dead at a nearby hospital, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. Police said he suffered a heart attack and died en route to the hospital. ""This is a terrible tragedy that occurred yesterday. A terrible tragedy that no family should have to experience,"" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, calling the video of the incident ""very troubling."" Police told WCBS that 43-year-old Garner, a father of six, had a lengthy criminal history and had been previously arrested for selling untaxed cigarettes in May. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his shield and gun as the New York Police Department continues to investigate the incident, WCBS reported. The chokehold tactic is prohibited by the NYPD. Two EMTs and two paramedics have been suspended without pay, Erika Hellstrom, vice president of development at Richmond University Medical Center, said in an e-mail. In a statement, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick J. Lynch called Pantaleo's reassignment ""a completely unwarranted, kneejerk reaction for political reasons."" He said the move ""effectively pre-judges this case and denies the officer the very benefit of a doubt that has long been part of the social contract that allows police officers to face the risks of this difficult and complex job."" On Saturday, Garner's friends and family rallied alongside the Rev. Al Sharpton in Upper Manhattan, demanding a full investigation into Garner's death, according to WCBS. Garner's wife was set to speak at the rally but found herself too emotional, WCBS reported. New York photographer Joel Graham was at Saturday's demonstration, which lasted for two hours. He shared his photographs with CNN iReport, and says he captured them while walking alongside protesters who traveled from New Brighton Church to the store where the chokehold incident took place. ""This crowd was composed of good, well-meaning people who understood that peace was the only option and were adamant that things remain calm over Eric's death. I have been to protests that have been violent, but this crowd reflected who Eric was,"" he said. Graham, an area resident, had a familiar relationship with Garner. ""I am an urban art photographer, and I will talk to everyone on the streets of New York City,"" he said, explaining that he would occasionally chat with Garner while taking photos near the Staten Island Ferry. ""I had empathy for Eric and how he must have felt trying to catch his breath, and sympathy for the family. This was a heartfelt emotional protest because everyone loved Eric,"" he said.

"Legislators in the capital of China's restive far-western Xinjiang province passed a law Wednesday to prohibit residents from wearing burqas in public, state media reported Thursday, highlighting the government's continued campaign against religious extremism. The new ban in Urumqi was first reported on ts.cn, a Xinjiang government-run website, and later widely published by other state media outlets. The ordinance name suggests it targets outer garments covering someone's full body including the face, which is called a burqa in some Islamic traditions. A spate of recent violent incidents has rocked Xinjiang, a resource-rich region long inhabited by the Turkic-speaking, largely Muslim Uyghurs. The arrival of waves of Han Chinese, the country's predominant ethnic group, over the past decades has fueled ethnic tensions. Chinese officials have blamed the recent attacks on Uyghur separatists -- whom they also label ""religious extremists"" -- seeking to establish an independent state. The ts.cn story mentioned the Urumqi law was submitted to the provincial legislature for final approval before it could be implemented. In August, another city in Xinjiang banned people wearing Islamic-style clothing and large beards from riding public buses during a provincial sporting event, according to state media. News reports at the time said Karamay city authorities targeted veils, large beards, as well as three types of Islamic dresses -- including those with the star and crescent symbol. Dozens of bus stations in the city were said to be manned by security personnel to conduct checks and report violators to the police. While the measures in Karamay didn't openly single out Uyghurs, exiled Uyghur rights groups have condemned them, calling the ban a ""green light"" for racism and discrimination. Those restrictions came a month after authorities in Xinjiang banned students and civil servants from fasting during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. Amnesty International has said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization. Other critics, including exiled Uyghur activists, have attributed the rise of violence in Xinjiang to Beijing's increasingly repressive rule there -- a claim the government vehemently denies. On Monday, a court in Urumqi convicted more than a dozen suspects with Uyghur-sounding names for their roles in two separate violent attacks in the city earlier this year. Eight people were sentenced to death, while five others received suspended death sentences.","Capital of Xinjiang province passes law to ban wearing burqa in public .

"A German skydiver who was participating in a 222-person jump in Arizona was killed Thursday when her main parachute malfunctioned, officials said. Police in Eloy said Diana Paris, 46, of Berlin, was killed Thursday morning. Paris was taking part in a world-record attempt for most skydivers changing from one formation to another in a one jump, according to a blog post by the jump's organizing group, World Team. Her main parachute was released too low to the ground for the reserve chute to work, said the group, which calls itself ""a highly skilled international team of skydivers and support personnel"" on its Facebook page. The group said the fatal accident was not related to the size of the group and no other skydiver was involved. Paris had more than 1,500 jumps, her husband told police. The World Team will do a 221-person attempt instead. ""Our dear friend cannot and will not be replaced. The group will continue to hold the slot open in the skydiver's honor,"" a statement on the group's blog said, adding that it was a difficult decision to continue with the record attempt.","Police identified the skydiver as Diana Paris of Berlin, Germany .

"A large amount of radioactive water has leaked from a holding tank at Japan's troubled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, its operator said Thursday. The leak of an estimated 100 metric tons of highly contaminated water was discovered late Wednesday, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) said in a statement. The tainted water flowed over a barrier around the tank and is being absorbed into the ground, TEPCO said. The plant has shut off the inflow of water into the tank and the leaking has stopped, it added. The company doesn't believe that there was any leakage of the radioactive water into the nearby Pacific Ocean. Since the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit northeastern Japan in March 2011 set off meltdowns at three of the reactors at the nuclear plant, TEPCO has been storing the enormous volumes of water contaminated at the site in a steadily growing collection of containers. The company has struggled to manage the vast amounts of radioactive water, with a number of leaks reported last year. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government vowed to step in to deal with the toxic water crisis at the plant that caused concern in Japan and abroad about the scale of the problem faced by TEPCO. The leak reported Thursday is one of the largest since TEPCO reported last summer that about 300 tons of radioactive water had leaked from a tank. CNN first learned about the latest incident on Twitter.","TEPCO says it discovered highly contaminated water leaking from a tank .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- They filled the grounds in front of the collapsed cathedral in Haiti's capital. To remember. To cope. To pray. Wednesday marked the first anniversary of the earthquake that changed the face of a nation. More than 200,000 people perished last January 12 when the earth shook violently for a few seconds. Houses toppled, swallowing residents alive. Government offices and landmark buildings, including the Notre Dame cathedral, came tumbling down. Five days ago, three more bodies were pulled from the rubble in central Port-au-Prince. Haitians still come to pray at the cathedral every Sunday. On this day, the crowds overwhelmed the small park in front. People embraced one another and cried openly. There was no reason to hide the sorrow that pervades their lives every day. In one neighborhood, a man woke up residents as he walked through the streets at dawn. He carried a Bible and recited prayers. Faith is all that many Haitians have left. For the rest of the world, January 12 is a day to mark the horror that unfolded in Haiti. But Haitians must cope with their memories every day. Jane-Eileen Fourcand says she is avoiding watching television on Wednesday. She does not need reminders. Instead, she will quietly remember the death of her mother, killed instantly in the quake, and her father, who was rescued after being buried for 16 hours but died a month later. Fourcand planned to visit her parents' tomb with flowers in hand and prayers in her heart. And then, she planned to tell a few jokes. ""Why? Because my mother always said, 'When I die, I want you to be happy about it. Don't cry all over,'"" she said. ""I know we have to cry to get rid of the pain. But we're going to make it a little better with these jokes we used to do."" At 4:53 p.m., the time the earthquake hit, Haiti fell silent to pay homage to the dead -- and to the millions of lives that were forever changed in just a few seconds. In some Port-au-Prince neighborhoods, mountains of rubble still stand as they did 12 months ago. The hundreds of tent cities that shelter the displaced were supposed to be temporary. Their continuing existence makes it hard to imagine a year has passed. Many tent city residents have sadly resigned themselves to permanence in those places of squalor. Several hundred members of organizing committees for 17 makeshift camps marched Wednesday on the streets, determined to cast a spotlight on their plight. They carried a sign saying in Creole: ""If I don't stand up, I'm condemned to live in a tent for the rest of my life."" The anniversary of the catastrophe, as the Haitians call it, comes as the Caribbean nation grapples with new crises: a cholera epidemic that has killed more than 3,700 Haitians and a political impasse sparked by allegations of fraud in a presidential election. International monitors from the Organization of American States decided to wait until the anniversary passed to hand President Rene Preval the results of its election review, which suggests that Preval's handpicked successor be eliminated from contention. Preval has grown increasingly unpopular as many Haitians perceive the government response to Haiti's troubles has been inadequate. There is a growing tide, too, of criticism of the thousands of aid agencies that operate in the country. At the United Nations in New York, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon noted that 102 U.N. personnel died in the earthquake. He acknowledged that progress has been slow. ""Haiti's streets are still full of rubble,"" he said. ""International aid and investment has not come as quickly as needed or as promised."" But, he added, ""We are making progress."" He said the number of people living in camps is half of what it was at the peak of the emergency, and clean water is being provided to 1 million people, and food to 2 million people. ""We will help a new government get on its feet and fulfill its responsibilities to its people and, despite the slow start, recovery and reconstruction is finally beginning in earnest."" But earthquake survivors like Michel Clervil wonder why, a year on, nothing has changed in Haiti, why he hasn't seen any of the money the world sent. He lost his house and was forced to find shelter in a camp, where his wife, Eliane, died of disease. Many people are still suffering, he says. ""And we don't know why.""","A year ago, a massive earthquake struck Haiti .

"The sudden, massive flood of refugees fleeing ISIS is unlike any other displacement in the 3½-year Syrian conflict. As many as 200,000 people have left the area surrounding the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, in just four days as ISIS advances into the area, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday. Most have gone into Turkey, the London-based monitoring group said. Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency and the United Nations said 130,000 Syrian refugees have entered Turkey since Friday. But the unprecedented surge that broke loose Friday has slowed, as Turkey  reduced the number of open crossings from eight or nine to just two, said Ariane Rummery, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency. Processing the refugees is also taking time. New arrivals are being searched for arms, receiving medical checks, being identified and receiving ID cards that they can use in Turkey to show their status to local authorities. ""Children are being vaccinated,"" Rummery said. Fight to prevent massacre . Inside Syria, a Kurdish official complained about the border becoming more difficult to cross. ""Now, they stop people and make a procedure before letting them in,"" Idris Nassan said in Kobani. The town is fighting ISIS with determination, he said. ""Every moment of every second of every day, we have clashes ongoing outside the center of Kobani,"" Nassan said. But ISIS, which also calls itself the ""Islamic State,"" has bigger, better weapons than the Kurdish People's Protection Units, known  as YPG, the initials for their name in Kurdish. ""ISIS brought weapons from Iraq and Raqqa. They have tanks, RPGs, cannons,"" Nassan said. Turkish Kurds help . But Kurdish fighters from Turkey are crossing into Syria to help. ""I saw groups of them last night walking inside the city, getting ready to go to the fighting,"" Nassan said. ""Some were experienced fighters and others civilian volunteers to help the resistance.""  New men arrive every day and are eager to join. ""It helps with morale,"" Nassan said. It's making a difference. ""Over the last two days, YPG has been making progress. Before that, ISIS was advancing, and YPG was retreating, but the situation has changed now, and the YPG is making a strong response,"" Nassan said. Kobani may be hanging on, but ISIS has captured some 60 villages in recent days, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The terror group's fighters took 39 villages on Friday alone, as Kurdish forces withdrew from their positions. The fight is no longer about holding on to their hometowns, Kurdish activist Mostafa Baly said from Kobani. ""It is about resisting the attack by ISIS and defending 50,000 Kurds from a massacre."" Turmoil in Turkey . ISIS' offensive is stoking tensions in Turkey. As Turkish Kurds have responded to their ethnic brothers and sisters in Syria, friction has heated up between the Kurdistan Workers Party and Turkish security forces, who used tear gas and water cannons against them in several clashes. The number of Syrian refugees now in Turkey since the beginning of the conflict is approaching 1.6 million, according to the Turkish government. Turkey may now feel freer to join the fight against ISIS. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday that the release of 49 Turkish citizens taken hostage when ISIS took control of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, has removed a barrier to Turkey joining an international coalition to fight the terrorists.","As many as 200,000 people have fled a Syrian Kurdish area, a monitor group says .

"Move over, Lucy: Researchers say Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus may also be in the sky, with diamonds. The atmospheres of these gas-ball planets have the perfect temperature and pressure conditions to host carbon in the form of diamond, say Mona Delitsky of California Specialty Engineering in Pasadena, California, and Kevin Baines of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Their research was presented Wednesday at the American Astronomical Society Division for Planetary Sciences conference in Denver. Previous research had implicated Neptune and Uranus in the hypothetical space diamond business, but Delitsky and Baines performed calculations suggesting that Saturn and Jupiter may host sparkly treasure, too. ""They would be diamonds like we have here, except they would probably be a little more dense,"" Delitsky said. ""They would probably be the same translucent gem that we're all familiar with."" This is all based on theory and modeling, of course. No spacecraft has actually detected diamonds, photographed them or collected them. But the theory didn't come entirely out of thin air. The phases of carbon . You may remember from chemistry class that substances enter different physical states depending on temperature and pressure. For instance, water becomes ice at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and vapor at 212 F, at typical pressures on the surface of Earth. Carbon has more than one form that it takes as a solid. At low temperatures and pressures, carbon is stable as graphite, that soft substance in your pencils. Much more extreme conditions are needed to turn carbon into diamonds, chemically identical to graphite but exquisitely strong, with atoms tightly bound to one another. Scientists know that carbon in the form of methane is found in the atmospheres of Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus -- especially in the latter two. A methane molecule consists of one carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms. Marvin Ross pointed out in a 1981 Nature study that Uranus and Neptune have deep interiors rich in methane, which would be converted into elemental carbon at high temperatures. The extreme temperature and pressure conditions would allow carbon to form diamond. More recently, shock-wave experiments, simulating extreme conditions on other planets, have more clearly shown the temperature and pressure boundaries between the various forms of carbon. Delitsky and Baines combined these latest insights with what is known about the temperatures and pressures in the interiors of the outer planets. From lightning to diamonds . Studying the storm systems on Saturn, Baines noticed that there were patches in the atmosphere, where storm clouds had been, that were darker than regular clouds. He wanted to find out what material would have that effect. The substance that fit the scenario the best was carbon in the form of soot, like the kind you see when you burn wood -- likely as a result of lightning. The researchers published a study on this in 2009. But what happens when these carbon particles sink into the deep interior of Saturn? Planetary researcher Nadine Nettleman at the University of California, Santa Cruz, developed graphs of how temperature and pressure changes with altitude for Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Delitsky and Baines used this data -- much of which is unpublished -- and compared it with the recent insights about conditions for forming diamond. Delitsky and Baines confirmed that diamonds could exist on Uranus and Neptune, and showed that they could also form on Saturn and Jupiter. These planets are all made of gas, so their ""interiors"" are essentially very hot, pressurized gas. Carbon would be soot in the top part of Saturn's atmosphere, but as it falls, it would turn into graphite at around 2,000 degrees Kelvin (3,140 degrees F). Closer to the planet's core, at around 3,000 Kelvin (4,940 F), it would become diamond. ""It's so far down that we cannot observe that region of the atmosphere with spacecraft,"" Delitsky said. The cores of Jupiter and Saturn would melt diamond, but the centers of Uranus and Neptune are cold enough to keep it solid -- a relatively chilly 6,000 Kelvin (10,340 F). Delitsky envisions that there could be ""hand-sized diamonds"" on these planets, although she has not performed those calculations. There could be as many as 10 million tons of diamonds produced from lightning-generated soot on Saturn, the researchers said. Are they really there, and can we get them? Scientists not involved in the project expressed a mixture of interest and skepticism. ""This kind of study shows that we are still far from understanding the composition and structure of Jupiter and Saturn, two planets which are respectively about 300 and 100 times the mass of our Earth and were crucial players when the whole Solar System formed,"" said Tristan Guillot, planetary researcher at the Observatoire de la Cote d'Azur in France, in an e-mail. If there are diamonds, they likely wouldn't be large iceberg-sized ""diamondbergs,"" Guillot said. Any such structures would fall rapidly toward the planet's interior, depleting the outer layers of carbon. That would result in a carbon-poor atmosphere -- which, scientists know, is not the case. It's plausible that carbon in the form of diamond could be stable in the interiors of Saturn and Jupiter, says Peter Read, professor of physics at the University of Oxford, but he's skeptical that diamonds like those on Earth would be found. Rather than chunks of precious stone, there may be instead clouds of condensed diamond material, he said -- but we just don't know. And if there are diamonds for the taking, they'd be in regions in the deep interiors of these planets that are challenging to reach, Read said. The temperatures are enormous, with pressures up to a million times what's observed at the surface of the Earth. This brings up important questions for would-be diamond miners: What would the mining robot be made of in order to withstand such temperatures and pressures? (Delitsky suggests diamonds!) How would the spacecraft be powered? ""There are probably many easier (and cheaper!) ways to obtain diamonds than going to Uranus or Neptune in a heavily reinforced and insulated submarine!"" Read said in an e-mail. Although no diamond-mining space missions are on NASA's docket, we may know more about the likelihood of diamonds soon. The Juno spacecraft will arrive at Jupiter in 2016, and the Cassini spacecraft will dive into Saturn in 2017, collecting information about the gravity fields and magnetic fields of these planets. These spacecraft won't get deep enough to explore the theoretical diamond regions, but they will at least ""be able to check whether we detect signatures of density changes that would occur near where diamond is predicted to form,"" Guillot said. More ambitious explorations of the outer planets may help us determine if these theories about diamonds will last forever.

"NASA says the Cassini spacecraft recorded the aftermath of a massive storm on Saturn that let out an ""unprecedented belch of energy."" Not only was the size of the storm unusual, but what the storm was made of left scientists puzzled. The source of the cosmic burp, which rapidly changed the atmosphere's temperature, was ethylene gas, an odorless, colorless gas that has rarely been observed on Saturn, NASA said. ""This temperature spike is so extreme it's almost unbelievable,"" said Brigette Hesman, the study's lead author who works at Goddard. ""To get a temperature change of the same scale on Earth, you'd be going from the depths of winter in Fairbanks, Alaska, to the height of summer in the Mojave Desert,"" Hesman said in a statement released by NASA. NASA's NuStar gets first look at black hole at the center of the Milky Way . Scientists still haven't figured out from where the ethylene gas came. By comparison, a storm of similar size on Earth would cover North America from top to bottom and wrap the planet many times, researchers said. The Cassini spacecraft first detected the disruption on December 5, 2010, and has been following it since, but researchers said the ethylene gas disruption that followed the storm was unexpected. A storm this size happens once every 30 years, or once every Saturn year, NASA scientists said. Launched in 1997, the Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. A full report will be published in November's issue of the Astrophysical Journal.

"He can't even walk yet but Prince George took a momentous step on Monday in what's set to be a lifetime of royal duties. When he arrived in Wellington, New Zealand, he was carried off the plane by his ever-glamorous mother and greeted by a long a line of dignitaries, including Prime Minister John Key. This was Prince George's first official public engagement and he wasn't in the slightest bit fazed by it, despite the epic journey from London. He was perfectly happy, a natural. This is a family not just born into monarchy, but made for it. And if things carry on like this for the rest of their visit Down Under, the Republican movements in both New Zealand and Australia may have some catching up to do. I was huddled on the runway in a nest of royal photographers who had traveled half way around the world to secure a picture that will be guaranteed a place in history. The weather was dreadful -- windy, wet and cold. Brits are used to that of course, so it wasn't a problem for anyone apart from the photographers who were struggling to prevent history being blurred by the condensation on their lenses. Opinion: New Zealand prepares to go ga-ga over blue-blooded baby . In the background I spotted George's new Nanny, Spanish-born Maria Teresa Turrion Borallo, in what was her first official appearance as well. It must have been a moment of reality for her about what she has taken on. The dresser was struggling to juggle hat boxes and dresses in the wind, and there was the hairdresser and eight other members of the royal entourage who are accompanying sizable support teams in each location on the trip. The ground teams have been organizing logistics, not just for public events but also behind the scenes. A royal source told me they have been speaking to the local authorities about ""all aspects of the tour, which you'll imagine includes the requirements for Prince George and how to accommodate a baby on a royal tour."" As an experienced baby-traveler, I would assume that means everything from cots to nappies to those all-important blackout curtains. There's also the car seat of course, and that's been a big talking point here. It was fitted by New Zealand's national childcare advisory, Plunkett. The problem is, they fitted a forward-facing one when their guidelines tell parents to use rear-facing seats until the age of two. The fact it's even a talking point illustrates the level of public interest there is in the trip. This may be a lot of fuss about a baby, and he has no idea what's going on. But when he does realize, Prince George will look back at these pictures and know that this is where it all officially began.","Prince George arrives in New Zealand for his first public engagement .

"(CNN)Kepler is still on the beat. The NASA spacecraft, which is designed to seek out other worlds but hit a snag when parts failed last year, found another planet thanks to some nifty repurposing by the space agency and its partners, NASA confirmed Thursday. The recently found world is named HIP 116454b and has a diameter 2.5 times the size of Earth's, said NASA in a press release. That would make it smaller than Neptune, the next-largest planet in our solar system. HIP 116454b orbits its star, which is in the direction of the constellation Pisces, in nine days and is too close to support life as we know it, the agency added. It's 180 light-years away. 11 cool space missions you should know about . But it adds another tidbit to our knowledge of the universe -- something scientists didn't think was possible when a part of the craft broke down last year. ""Last summer, the possibility of a scientifically productive mission for Kepler after its reaction wheel failure in its extended mission was not part of the conversation,"" said Paul Hertz, NASA's astrophysics division director, in a statement. Mars has gas, and Curiosity finds organic matter . But scientists and engineers came up with a new strategy that uses pressure from sunlight to take the place of the failed reaction wheel, which helps point the spacecraft in the right direction. Kepler is now free to continue its mission, called K2 by NASA. ""K2 is uniquely positioned to dramatically refine our understanding of these alien worlds and further define the boundary between rocky worlds like Earth and ice giants like Neptune,"" said Kepler/K2 project scientist Steve Howell in NASA's press release.

"Boston marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev suffered multiple and severe gunshot injuries before his capture in April, newly released court documents show. The most serious of the injuries was a gunshot wound that appeared to enter through the left inside of his mouth and exit through the lower left side of his face, said Stephen Ray Odom, a trauma surgeon who treated Tsarnaev at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. ""This was a high-powered injury that has resulted in skull-base fracture, with injuries to the middle ear, the skull base, ... his ... vertebrae ... as well as injury to the pharynx, (and) the mouth."" Odom said in testimony given April 22, three days after Tsarnaev was arrested following the bombing. His testimony, unsealed Monday, does not say whether the 20-year-old college student inflicted the wound on himself or suffered it during his showdown with police April 19. Authorities cornered him in a boat in the backyard of a Watertown, Massachusetts, home after an intense manhunt. The final hours that paralyzed Boston . Another document unsealed Monday said a special team of federal agents were able to speak with the seriously wounded Tsarnaev for about two days without any Miranda warnings being given, under a ""public safety exception.""  The document shows he was read his Miranda rights in the hospital on April 22. Tsarnaev is charged with killing four people -- three spectators who died in the April 15 bombings and a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer ambushed in his cruiser a few days later. At least 264 people were wounded in the double bombings, which took place near the marathon finish line. Controversial Rolling Stone cover of Tsarnaev called a 'slap' to Boston . He is awaiting trial, after having pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges. If convicted, he could receive up to life in prison or the death penalty. His older brother, Tamerlan, is also accused of the attacks. He was killed when Tsarnaev ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him, authorities said. CNN learned in the weeks following the bombing that Tsarnaev admitted to the acts, and said he and his brother acted alone. Sources say he has since stopped talking with the government.

"It was joyful mayhem Friday night in the county clerk's office in Salt Lake City, Utah, after a federal judge struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage, saying the law ""conflicts with the United States Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law."" ""I proposed to my partner of 27 years in June, but I said, 'We're not going to get married until we can get married in Utah,"" state Sen. Jim Dabakis, who is openly gay, told CNN. ""He said, 'So, that's just an excuse never to get married.'"" Not so. As soon as the judge's ruling was reported, ""We ran down here,"" Dabakis said as he surveyed the crowd. ""It's a madhouse down here. There's hundreds of people, wedding certificates are being issued, there's marriages taking place all over the hallways. Everybody's embracing. It's just a warm, wonderful moment in the state of Utah."" In striking down the state law, which voters had approved in 2004, U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby wrote in a 53-page ruling that the state's ""current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason. ""Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional,"" he said. Shelby said lawyers for the state had offered no evidence that opposite-sex marriage would be affected and that their ""fears and speculations are insufficient to justify the State's refusal to dignify the family relationships of its gay and lesbian citizens."" In addition, the Constitution protects the rights of same-sex couples, including their right to marry and to have that marriage recognized by their government, he said. ""These rights would be meaningless if the Constitution did not also prevent the government from interfering with the intensely personal choices an individual makes when that person decides to make a solemn commitment to another human being. The Constitution therefore protects the choice of one's partner for all citizens, regardless of their sexual identity."" The lawsuit was brought by one gay and two lesbian couples in Utah who wish to marry but have been unable to do so because the Utah Constitution prohibits same-sex marriage. The decision was greeted with joy from a spokesman for GLAAD, formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. ""At last, loving and committed couples in Utah will have the opportunity to celebrate marriage equality this holiday season,"" said Wilson Cruz in a posting on its website. ""We are seeing state leaders and more and more citizens recognize that loving and committed couples should not be legally kept apart,"" said Cruz. ""We look forward to seeing that momentum to continue in 2014."" Gov. Gary R. Herbert expressed disappointment at the ruling by Shelby, whom he called ""an activist federal judge."" Herbert said he was working with his legal counsel and the acting attorney general ""to determine the best course to defend traditional marriage within the borders of Utah."" A spokesman for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement that it supports ""traditional marriage,"" while teaching that everyone should be treated with respect. ""This ruling by a district court will work its way through the judicial process,"" Eric Hawkins said. ""We continue to believe that voters in Utah did the right thing by providing clear direction in the state Constitution that marriage should be between a man and a woman and we are hopeful that this view will be validated by a higher court."" The president of the National Organization for Marriage, Brian Brown, called the ruling ""a travesty of justice."" In a statement, he added, ""This trend of vetoing the voters from the bench must be stopped."" That view was not shared by Clifford Rosky, chairman of the board of Equality Utah. ""We think it is a thoughtful and careful ruling that is based on the Supreme Court decision last summer and we expect that it will be upheld ultimately by the United States Supreme Court,"" he said. By early Friday evening, Rosky told CNN he had signed as a witness to multiple marriages among same-sex couples. Though the state has already filed a notice of appeal, the state's lawyers did not file a motion for a stay  in district court, which allowed the marriages to begin at once. ""Why they didn't ask the district court for a stay is a mystery, to say the least,"" Rosky said. ""There are hundreds of people here -- it's past 5 o'clock and the clerk is not closing the door."" Same-sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. But it is legal in 17 other U.S states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Worldwide, 16 other countries (and parts of Mexico) have laws allowing same-sex marriage and domestic partnerships. Most of these are in Europe and South America. Civil unions, which are legal in Colorado, grant couples most of the rights of state civil marriages, but provide none of the federal benefits of marriage, such as Social Security benefits. These rights include spousal support, medical decision-making privileges, access to a partner's insurance, and hospital visitation rights. Though the U.S. Supreme Court has signaled that it is reluctant to issue a national opinion on the matter, lower courts and states have not been so reluctant, said Carl Tobias, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Richmond. ""I'm just struck by how quickly this is all moving,"" he said. ""It just seems like it's picking up steam in terms of challenges."" He attributed the change to a greater acceptance of gays and lesbians, especially among young people. ""They just don't see this as a great moral issue that needs to be something codified as a prohibition in the law,"" he said.

"A student who opened fire Friday inside a suburban Denver high school appears to have been seeking revenge against a faculty member because of a ""confrontation or disagreement,"" the Arapahoe County sheriff said. The shooter, identified as 18-year-old Karl Halverson Pierson, shot one student before turning the gun on himself and taking his own life, Sheriff Grayson Robinson told reporters. The shooting began after the student walked into Arapahoe High School in Centennial with the intention of confronting a specific faculty member, Robinson said. ""The suspect has been found inside the school and he has deceased as a result of what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" Robinson said in one of his first statements after the shooting. Authorities revised downward the number of students wounded in the shooting to one. Two students were previously reported to have suffered gunshot wounds. But Robinson said Friday night that an investigation concluded there was only one after it was discovered that blood on another person was from the sole victim. One person -- a minor -- was taken to Littleton Adventist Hospital with a gunshot wound, Lauren Brendel, a hospital spokeswoman, told CNN. Brendel did not release the age, gender and condition of the minor. But Robinson told reporters that the condition of a  a 15-year-old girl who was shot was in critical condition after surgery. Authorities descended on the school after news of the shooting broke -- on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The shooting also occurred roughly 10 miles from where Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and one teacher in a rampage at Columbine High School in April 1999 before killing themselves. Pierson walked into Arapahoe High School carrying a shotgun and made no attempt to hide it, Robinson said. He then asked other students the whereabouts of a faculty member, he said. A school janitor told CNN affiliate KMGH that he saw a student dressed in tactical gear running through the school. ""It just looked weird,"" the janitor, Fabian Llerenas, said. ""He went in and I heard two pops. That's when I knew. I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'"" Llerenas said he called 911, and he then escorted the targeted faculty member out of the school. ""In my opinion, that was the most important tactical decision that could have been made,"" Robinson said. The faculty member ""left that school in an effort to try to encourage the shooter to also leave the school."" Pierson's body was found later in a classroom, Robinson told reporters. The student appears to have acted alone, he said. In addition to the shotgun, authorities found two Molotov cocktails inside the school, Robinson said. One of the Molotov cocktails detonated, he said. The other was ""rendered safe,"" Robinson said. As part of the investigation, authorities also will be looking at school surveillance video, the sheriff said. Investigators also are searching Pierson's car, his home and another home that he had access to, the sheriff said. High school senior Frank Woronoff told CNN he had known Pierson since they were freshmen together. ""He was the last person I would expect to shoot up a high school. He was honestly incredibly humble and down to earth. He was a little geeky but in a charming way,"" he said. ""So I don't know anyone who hates him really, so it came as a surprise -- to me at least."" The first sheriff's deputies and police officers arrived at Arapahoe and entered almost immediately after the shooting was reported, Robinson said. While authorities hunted for the student gunman inside the school, students were locked in their classrooms. Courtney Leytoldt told KMGH she saw a girl, covered in blood, running down the stairs yelling, ""Help me, help me, there's a shooter."" Leytoldt said she was in yoga class and that her teacher told all the students to get into a closet to protect them. Ninth-grader Whitney Riley was getting ready to grab her computer from her locker when the shooting began. ""We were having fun and laughing and then, all of a sudden, we heard a really loud bang,"" the 15-year-old told CNN. ""My teacher asked what it was and then we heard two more and we all just got up and screamed and ran into a sprinkler system room."" Inside the windowless room were five students and two teachers. ""We were shaking, we were crying, we were freaking out,"" Riley said. ""I had a girl biting my arm."" They soon heard people yelling, and walkie-talkies crackling, and then they heard police asking someone to drop the gun, put the gun down, and hold his arms up, she said. She did not hear another gunshot, though the people doing the talking could have moved farther away, she said. Soon, they heard police ordering them out. Colton Powers told CNN affiliate KDVR that he heard gunfire during his English class. At that point, his teacher turned off the lights and locked the door. ""We ran to a corner so they couldn't see us,"" Powers said. Within about 14 minutes of the initial report, ""we had information on the radio that my deputies believed they had the shooter down inside the school,"" Robinson said. Dozens of students could be seen walking away from the school, with their hands in the air. Some stood in lines at what appeared the high school track field, where they appeared to be undergoing police pat-downs. Students were then taken by bus to a nearby church where they were reunited with their families, Robinson said. The high school, with a student population of 2,229 students, has 70 classrooms. The school, which was built in 1964, is part of the Littleton Public Schools system. Gov. John Hickenlooper called the shooting an ""all-too-familiar sequence, where you have gunshots and parents racing to the school and unspeakable horror in a place of learning."" President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting, according to a White House official.","Authorities identify the shooter as Karl Halverson Pierson, 18 .

"It's graduation day and professor Jonathan Jansen strolls around the campus of the University of the Free State. Every now and then he stops to greet his gown-clad students, standing out amid a crowd of beaming parents and proudly grinning teachers. As rector of the formerly all-white educational institution in Bloemfontein, South Africa, Jansen is about to use his graduation ceremony speech to teach his students one last lesson. ""I urge you, in a country where there's still a lot of rage, never respond by rage, respond through reason and you will have gotten not just a degree, but an education,"" says Jansen, looking into the eyes of his students. Jansen, the first black dean of education at the University of the Free State, is one of South Africa's leading academics and intellectuals. Throughout his long and esteemed educational career, which has taken him from teaching biology in high school classrooms to leading one of South Africa's premier learning institutions, Jansen has been doing everything he can to keep education uppermost in the minds of his students. ""The way out of poverty is through learning and those basic values I have carried with me throughout my leadership,"" says Jansen, who is not only an academic but has a wider audience as author, newspaper columnist and the president of the South African Institute of Race Relations. Read more: Oprah a 'proud momma' as first Academy students graduate . The son of a preacher, Jansen was born in Cape Flats, a violent, gang-infested area on the fringes of Cape Town. Life was tough for the future educator, coming of age in a country plagued by apartheid -- he says that growing up as a black boy in Cape Flats, there was a ""greater chance"" of going to prison than going to university. But despite the disadvantages of his surroundings, Jansen believes he thrived, thanks largely to the example set by his parents -- he described them as ""Old Testament figures -- my father being Abraham, my mother being Sarah."" ""Here you had parents that raised you in a bubble of decency, of this is what you do and don't do, this is the direction out of poverty,"" he says. Even though his parents' families were both materially dispossessed under Apartheid, Jansen says his father and mother raised their children with a strong sense of not being bitter, of being generous to those who are poor and of living a life ""without respect for color."" ""That helped us enormously,"" he says, ""so as I looked outside I could see people killing each other, I witnessed the rape of women, I saw horrible things happening around me, but it was as if it did not happen because in this bubble that Abraham and Sarah raised us, there was an understanding of yourself that was unshakeable -- central to that was education."" Passionate about the transformative power of knowledge, Jansen holds strong opinions about the state of education in South Africa. He argues that years of maladministration left the country with a failing state education system. He is also regularly heard lambasting the country's low teaching standards, which allow students in some cases to pass exams with as little as 30%. ""It's odd for me because it's like we don't get it that in a modern interconnected economy you better be up there playing with the best,"" he says. ""I take this to be another symptom of how we've succumbed to the apartheid message that we can't, that we're inferior, that we need to beg for participation and that does much more damage than any politician can imagine."" Read more: Elite boarding school aims to create Africa's future leaders . A firm believer of the society's responsibility to insist on a qualitative education system, Jansen,  a Fulbright scholar, assumed his current role at the University of the Free State in 2009 after the institution faced controversy over racism and racial integration. In 2008, a video surfaced of four white students at the university urging at least five black housekeepers to eat what appeared to be urine-tainted beef stew. The incident sparked national outcry and shed light over South Africa's racial integration problems. Citing reconciliation ""on a deeply divided campus,"" Jansen decided to invite the students to return to the university and resume their studies, regardless of their legal consequences. ""We decided ... to offer to the boys an institutional message of forgiveness and acceptance, that they could come back in and participate in a process of reconciliation with the people that they had hurt."" The students were fined after pleading guilty to deliberately injuring another person's dignity, but they rebuffed Jansen's invitation to return to the university. Jansen was roundly criticized for that gesture, which only served to contribute to his reputation for being outspoken. ""If in the process of forgiving and reconciling, we enable other transformations to take place, which is exactly what happened, then that is a better way to go than the thirst -- the understandable thirst let me say -- for vengeance,"" he says. Back at the graduation ceremony, Jansen's moral code of reconciliation over retribution returns once again. ""I don't care what else you've learned at the University of the Free State,"" he tells the graduates, ""but you know this is a university that in the world is regarded as a place that chooses reconciliation over revenge, that chooses compassion over striking back, that chooses mercy over retaliation.""","Professor Jonathan Jansen is one of South Africa's top academics .

"Thanks to solar wind blowing out from the sun in all directions at a million miles per hour, material from comets gets whipped back into a formation that looks like a tail. Now, scientists know that our solar system has a tail of its own, with a surprising shape. NASA researchers working with data from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer announced Wednesday they have for the first time mapped the solar system's tail, called the heliotail. Their study is published in the Astrophysical Journal. By ""tail,"" scientists don't mean a furry appendage hanging off Pluto, which is not classified as a planet anymore. Rather, the tail is a stream of solar wind plasma -- charged particles -- and magnetic field, trailing off behind the heliosphere. The heliosphere is a magnetic bubble that surrounds our solar system, as well as the solar wind and our sun's magnetic field. This bubble doesn't stop at the planets -- it extends at least 8 billion miles beyond them. These new observations help scientists better understand the structure surrounding our solar system. ""Scientists had always presumed that the heliosphere had a tail. We've seen it around other stars, we know the sun is moving relative to interstellar gas,"" said Eric Christian, IBEX mission scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ""But this is actually the first real data that we have that gives us the shape of the tail."" If we could look at a cross-section of the solar system's tail, its shape would resemble a four-leaf clover. The ""leaves"" on the side are composed of slow-moving particles from lower energy solar wind, and the leaves on the top and bottom are fast-moving particles from high-speed solar wind. On its ""front,"" the heliosphere is more bullet-shaped, but it is asymmetrical because of the influence of magnetic fields from interstellar space, said David McComas, lead author on the paper and principal investigator for IBEX at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. These magnetic fields from outside the solar system also affect the shape of the heliotail. McComas compares this to putting bungee cords around a beach ball and pulling on them. The force of the magnetic fields squeezes the tail so that its cross-section becomes flattered like an oval. The tail's cross-section also becomes twisted, and turns to align with the magnetic field. Pressure from the interstellar gas and magnetic field causes the solar wind to bend back along the tail. Researchers have not established the length of our solar system's tail, but they believe that it fades at the end and blends in with the rest of interstellar space. Astronomers had previously determined that other stars also have tails around their magnetic bubbles, which are called astrospheres. In order for such a sphere to form, there must be a balance of an inward compression of interstellar gas and a wind from the star that pushes outward. The IBEX probe does not take photographs with light. Instead, it makes use of what are called energetic neutral atoms. Most matter in the universe has an electric charge on it. But sometimes a charged particle, while moving fast through space, picks up an electron from neutral gas, which turns it into a neutral atom. Some of these neutral atoms are pointed back at Earth and are detected when they hit the IBEX spacecraft. ""Because they travel pretty much straight, you can trace them back to where they came from, and make a picture with these atoms instead of light,"" Christian said. ""That's what IBEX does."" There are no space probes currently moving down the tail of our solar system, but the two Voyager spacecraft, which launched in 1977, are still floating further from Earth than any other terrestrial-made objects. The Voyager and the IBEX missions are complementary, McComas said. The Voyager probes are akin to biopsies of the solar system, while IBEX is more like an MRI, understanding the big picture. ""While we have incredibly good and valuable information from those two locations where we have those spacecraft, how to put those into a global context and understand the really three-dimensional global interaction of the sun with the local part of the galaxy is really more a job for IBEX,"" McComas said. According to the latest observations reported in the journal Science, Voyager 1 has traveled more than 11 billion miles from the sun. That brings it closer to reaching the distinction of being the first human-created object to reach interstellar space, which is loaded with material from other stars and a magnetic field from elsewhere in the Milky Way. Scientists say Voyager 1 may take several more months, perhaps years, to fully escape the solar system. Voyager 2 is still relatively closer to home, at 9 billion miles from the sun. IBEX has enlightened scientists as to what the Voyager mission may find at the far reaches of our solar system and beyond, McComas said. Without the interstellar probe, some say they wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of it.

"Authorities nationwide are searching for a Minnesota minister accused of 59 felony counts of criminal sexual conduct with two young girls while they were members of his church. Victor Barnard, 52, was last seen in Spokane, Washington, according to a written statement from the Washington State Patrol. On April 11, prosecutors in Pine County, Minnesota, issued a criminal complaint after a two-year investigation into allegations from two women about Barnard's alleged conduct while he was preaching to a religious group in Finlayson, Minnesota. Lindsay Tornambe is one of the two women, who are referred to as ""B"" and ""C"" in the complaint. Now 27, she lives in Bethesda, Maryland. She wants Barnard to go to prison. ""I definitely don't want him hurting anyone else and ruining other people's lives like mine was,"" she told CNN. The complaint says Tornambe alleges that she was sexually abused by Barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of the River Road Fellowship. Tornambe told investigators that Barnard created a group of 10 young girls and women who were known as Alamoths, or maidens. Her group was sent to what she thought was a summer camp, the document says. Tornambe alleges that Barnard first molested her after he preached to her that he represented Jesus Christ in the flesh. She told investigators that she estimated that Barnard sexually assaulted her one to three times a month until she left in 2010 to be with her parents, who had moved to Pennsylvania. In fall 2011, she was contacted by another former maiden who shared a similar story; she said she was molested by Barnard from the time she was 12 until she was 20, although she said the number of sexual acts varied each month. Tornambe and the other woman went to the police in Minnesota. Barnard had moved to Washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split, the complaint says. Both women said Barnard sometimes became upset with them and was violent. They also said their parents were called to a meeting -- after Barnard allegedly had begun to rape them -- in which he told the parents he might have sex with them. Tornambe's father told investigators that he knew what Barnard was telling them was wrong, but there was pressure to not be exiled from the church and ""lose everything he had."" The ministry operated in a secluded area of Pine County from about 2000 until 2011 or 2012, said Chief Deputy Steven Blackwell of the county sheriff's office. The fellowship vacated the property shortly after a new sheriff was elected and began investigating the ministry, Blackwell said. The Salvation Army now runs a family camp there, he said. In the complaint, an investigating officer with the Washington State Patrol said he spoke with an elder in the church who had two daughters who were maidens. That elder denied that a group had ever been separated from their parents. CNN attempted to reach the man Wednesday night, as well as a man described in the complaint as Barnard's right-hand man, but was unsuccessful. Lt. Shane Nelson, a criminal investigations officer for the Washington State Patrol, said officers were unable to find Barnard, and it was possible he had fled the area. There are no charges against Barnard in Washington, Nelson said. Dan Coon, a spokesman for Washington State Police, added Thursday that a detective is working with the Pine County Sheriff's Office in their search for Barnard.","Victor Barnard was a preacher at the River Road Fellowship in Minnesota .

"The former city manager of Bell, California, was sentenced Wednesday to 12 years in state prison in a corruption case in which he and several other former city council members were accused of turning taxpayer money into a personal ""piggy bank."" Robert Rizzo also was ordered Wednesday to repay $8.8 million in restitution to the city, prosecutors said. In October, Rizzo pleaded no contest to 69 felony counts of public corruption, 46 counts of misappropriation of public funds, 10 counts of falsification of public records, six counts of perjury and six counts of conflict of interest, prosecutors said. In all, Rizzo, another former city official and five former council members -- all of them now convicted -- stole nearly $11 million from the Los Angeles-area city of about 35,000 people, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said. The corruption case drew national attention for its large-scale theft by so many elected and appointed officials in such a small city. The former officials paid themselves exorbitant salaries for little or no work. Rizzo began working for the city of Bell in 1994 as its chief administrative officer, and his council-approved annual salary rose to $300,000 in 2004, prosecutors said. He began taking home $800,000 in ""illegal pay"" by the time he resigned in July 2010, prosecutors said. Former administrator sues for his salary . Rizzo also paid himself an additional $400,000 annually by cashing out unused sick and vacation time that was not council approved, prosecutors said. Rizzo also wrote his own employment contracts and created ""a secret pension fund that would have given him $8 million upon retirement,"" prosecutors said. Former District Attorney Steve Cooley, who initially handled the charges, had called the case a ""feeding frenzy of corruption by Bell officials."" Prosecutors accused the former city officials of turning the city treasury into ""their own piggy bank, which they looted at will."" In a statement, District Attorney Jackie Lacey said ""Rizzo believed he was above the law."" ""His greed and total disregard for the hard-working people of Bell have lasting consequences,"" Lacey said. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy imposed Wednesday's sentence. Last year, former Mayor Oscar Hernandez, former Vice Mayor Teresa Jacobo and former council members George Mirabal, Victor Bello and George Cole were convicted by a jury on several counts of misappropriation of public funds, prosecutors said. The jury, however, acquitted them or were deadlocked on several similar counts, prosecutors said. Prosecutors sought a retrial on those deadlocked charges, but that effort ended this month when the five former council members pleaded no contest to two counts of misappropriation of public funds. Under the plea deal, the five former officials avoided a retrial, but they now could face up to four years in state prison, prosecutors said. The five former elected officials admitted to earning up to $100,000 annually for serving on boards or commissions that never met or convened for only minutes a year, prosecutors said. They also agreed to pay restitution, the amount of which has yet to be determined. Rizzo's former chief administrative officer, Angela Spaccia, was convicted by a jury in December of 11 felony counts for writing her own employment contracts, taking loans without council approval, and creating her own retirement plan, prosecutors said. Spaccia was sentenced last week to 11 years and eight months in state prison, prosecutors said. The sentences for Rizzo and Spaccia together ""represent the longest prison terms for convicted public officials since the Public Integrity Division was established in 2001"" in the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, prosecutors said. Rizzo also ""lavished unauthorized loans on himself and city underlings, including Spaccia,"" prosecutors said.","The former city manager of Bell, California, will repay $8.8 million in restitution .

"A prominent Ukrainian civic activist and journalist was beaten on Christmas Day by a group of men who dragged her from her car outside of Kiev in the latest attack on government opponents, authorities said. In a statement on its website, the Interior Ministry said it had identified three suspects in the beating of Tetiana Chornovol, who was assaulted in the early hours of Wednesday. The ministry said it had arrested two of the suspects. A dashboard camera in Chornovol's car captured part of the attack on the 34-year-old journalist known for her muckraking investigations into corruption among senior state officials, according to the opposition Batkivshchyna party website. A still image from the dashboard camera footage showed the black SUV that struck Chornovol's car moments before the assault. The freelance journalist suffered a broken nose, concussion and numerous bruises, the online newspaper Ukrainska Pravda reported. On Thursday, the U.S. embassy in Kiev sharply condemned the beating in a statement. It called for an investigation, ""which unlike previous such incidents must result in those responsible being held fully accountable under the law."" The embassy alleged that people were being targeted for their involvement in pro-European Union protests. ""These are unacceptable violations of civil liberties that have no place in a modern, democratic society,"" the embassy said. Pro-Western protests . The attack on the activist journalist comes as Russia agrees to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price Kiev pays for its gas -- an economic lifeline from President Vladimir Putin as Ukraine is rattled by protests calling for closer economic ties with Europe instead. Under the deal, Putin said Moscow would buy $15 billion in Ukrainian debt by investing in its national welfare fund. The cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine was cut from more than $400 per 1,000 cubic meters to $268.50. The deal has been criticized by the tens of thousands of protesters who have poured into the streets of the Ukrainian capital for weeks, angry at Yanukovych for spurning a trade deal with the European Union last month and turning to Moscow for help. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius condemned the violence and intimidation against participants in rallies in support of Ukraine's integration into the European Union and calling for the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych, according to the state news agency UKrinform . ""Intimidation and violence against (pro-European Union) activists must be stopped,"" Linkevicius wrote on Twitter. In a post on his Facebook page Wednesday, independent journalist Mustafa Nayyem said supporters of Yanukovych and his administration were complicit in the brutal attack. ""YOU are personally complicit, and you support this disgusting state of affairs,"" he wrote. ""And it's no longer about image, or losing power, or losing influence -- it is about losing a sense of humanity and our entire generation. You no longer have the right to decide things for us. You no longer have the right to determine what country we should live in."" Face battered . Pictures and a video of the journalist posted online showed Chernovol with the right side of her face and her lips swollen and bloody, according to Russian state-run RIA Novosti news agency. Sources on various social media pages said she was hospitalized with a concussion. Yanukovych urged police Wednesday to investigate the attack as quickly as possible, the news agency reported. The attack was the second on a Ukrainian opposition activist in as many days, according to RIA Novosti . Dmitry Pilipets, a civic activist and organizer of protests in the eastern city of Kharkiv, was stabbed four times on the street by two unknown male attackers late Tuesday night. He was hospitalized Wednesday in stable condition, according to the news agency. The latest assault could increase tensions between the state and demonstrators who have braved sub-zero temperatures and set up tents and barricades in the city center to voice their opposition to closer ties with Russia.","U.S. embassy in Kiev condemns the beating .

"Scientists have found what they're describing as a ""lost world"" on the northern tip of Queensland, Australia, hosting at least three previously undocumented species, including a frog that makes love in the rain. The discovered species, which also include a leaf-tail gecko and a golden skink, have been isolated in a remote mountain range on Cape York Peninsula for millions of years, according to James Cook University. The joint expedition between the university and National Geographic in March led James Cook's Conrad Hoskin and Harvard University researcher Tim Laman, a National Geographic photographer, to the rugged range in northeast Australia's Cape Melville, where millions of black granite boulders as big as houses and cars are piled hundreds of meters high. Scientists have previously surveyed the base of the cape mountains, but the hot, dry, boulder-strewn rainforest on the plateau atop them is largely unexplored. A helicopter took Hoskin, Laman and a National Geographic film crew to the uplands. ""Finding three new, obviously distinct vertebrates would be surprising enough in somewhere poorly explored like New Guinea, let alone in Australia, a country we think we've explored pretty well,"" Hoskin said in a statement from the university. 441 new species found in Amazon . The scientists found a ""host of other interesting species"" that may also be new to science, but the three vertebrates, which are described as highly distinct, will be documented in this month's issue of Zootaxa, a peer-reviewed journal for animal taxonomists. Hoskin said the highlight of the expedition was the Cape Melville Leaf-Tailed Gecko, a ""primitive-looking"" lizard that is considered a relic from the days when the rainforest was more widespread in Australia. It can grow up to 20 centimeters (almost 8 inches) long. The gecko is a night hunter and hides in the boulders during the day. At night, the highly camouflaged critter sits motionless, head down, awaiting passing insects and spiders on rocks and in trees. Its big eyes and long, slender body and limbs are likely ""adaptations to life in the dimly lit boulder fields,"" the release said. Hoskin, who said he knew it was a new species as soon as he saw it, named it Saltuarius eximius, meaning exceptional or exquisite, in reference to its distinct appearance. ""The Cape Melville Leaf-Tailed Gecko is the strangest new species to come across my desk in 26 years working as a professional herpetologist. I doubt that another new reptile of this size and distinctiveness will be found in a hurry, if ever again, in Australia,"" said Patrick Couper, curator of reptiles and frogs at Queensland Museum. The Cape Melville Shade Skink is also a lanky fellow, but unlike its gecko neighbor, it can be found hunting during the day, hopping across mossy boulders in search of insects. It has a golden hue and is isolated to the plateau rainforest. It has been dubbed Saproscincus saltus. Saltus means leaping, according to the university's news release. Also discovered was the Blotched Boulder Frog, which is found only in the boulder field at Cape Melville. Its species name, Cophixalus petrophilus, means rock-loving. ""During the dry season the frog lives deep down in the labyrinth of the boulder field where conditions are cool and moist. In the summer wet season the frog emerges on the surface rocks to feed and breed in the rain,"" the news release says, adding that the frog only comes to the surface when it's raining. There are no nearby bodies of water, so the frog reproduces by laying its eggs in the moist rock cracks. The tadpoles develop within the eggs, which the male frog guards until the froglets hatch. ""These species are restricted to the upland rainforest and boulder fields of Cape Melville. They've been isolated there for millennia, evolving into distinct species in their unique rocky environment,"" Hoskin said. Given the discoveries, there will likely be more expeditions -- and more secrets uncovered -- on Cape Melville in the future. ""The top of Cape Melville is a lost world. Finding these new species up there is the discovery of a lifetime,"" Hoskin said. ""I'm still amazed and buzzing from it."" Follow Eliott C.

"Scientists have long predicted that Mars had significant volcanic activity in the first billion years of its history, but images of the planet's surface haven't delivered as much evidence of volcanoes as they expected. New research suggests, however, that scientists may have been looking for the wrong kind of volcanoes. A new study in the journal Nature argues that a handful of geological formations on Mars that were thought of as impact craters were once, instead, supervolcanoes. They never looked like mountains; rather, they formed when the ground collapsed on itself in violent explosions. ""This is a totally new kind of process that we hadn't thought about for Mars, and it changes the way we view the evolution of the planet,"" said lead study author Joseph Michalski of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and the National History Museum in London. The volcanic eruptions likely represented the biggest explosions in the history of Mars, Michalski said. These explosions would have occurred more than 3.5 billion years ago. He and NASA colleague Jacob Bleacher focused on a region on Mars called Arabia Terra, which is speckled with craters. Bleacher could not discuss the study Wednesday, Michalski said, because of the United States government shutdown that furloughed most of NASA's employees. (But Mars rover operations, including driving and using scientific instruments, are continuing this week, a NASA spokesman said). NASA on shutdown: 'Sort it out, humans' The researchers used data from instruments aboard several orbiters: Mars Express, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey. Particularly intriguing to them was a crater called Eden Patera, which did not have features consistent with an impact crater. Instead, it resembled a structure seen on Earth called a caldera, which is a volcano that has collapsed inward (caldera is also the Spanish word for cauldron.) They believe Eden Patera is the best example of a possible ancient supervolcano on Mars. When you think of a volcano, a cone-shaped structure protruding from the ground probably comes to mind. These, such as Mauna Loa in Hawaii, are essentially mountains of lava. But Eden Patera and other supervolcanoes on Mars never looked like that; instead, they represent the inward collapse of Martian terrain. Eden Patera and other supervolcanoes would have been much smaller than Olympus Mons, a shield volcano on Mars about the size of the state of Arizona, and the biggest volcano in the solar system. But while Olympus Mons oozed lava, the supervolcano explosions would have been much more powerful, Michalski said -- they would have thrown material all around the planet. By comparison, Mount St. Helens erupted on Earth in 1980, spewing more than 0.24 cubic miles (1 cubic kilometer) of material over Washington state and surrounding areas. Supervolcanoes can produce eruptions spouting more than 1,000 times more volcanic material than that. Six must-see volcanoes on Earth . How a supervolcano collapses . How calderas such as Eden Patera form is similar to the process that created what is today Yellowstone National Park, Michalski said. A supervolcano there exploded 640,000 years ago; there was no mountain-like structure there beforehand. Had you been there, said Michalski, you would have been standing around in Wyoming and observing a bit of steam coming out of the ground. You would start to feel earthquakes because of the movement of magma underneath you, causing the earth to crack and break. Bigger and bigger earthquakes would have given way to smaller explosions from within the ground. That happens because as the magma produces bubbles, pressure would build up and blows up the terrain; destabilization would lead to more earthquakes and then -- boom! -- a massive explosion. Such explosions would send ash far into the atmosphere, creating lots of heat and gas. The wind would carry away the ash, and while much of it would rain down to form layered materials on Earth, some ash would stay in the atmosphere for years to come . ""By the time you'd get to see that, you'll be dead, because it's quite a massive, violent activity,"" Michalski said. ""No one's really ever witnessed it, because if you did, you wouldn't be here to tell about it."" Water discovered in Martian soil . Why it matters . Supervolcanoes were instrumental in shaping geological formations and the climate on our own planet, and the same goes for Mars, Michalski said. Eruptions would have sent the climate into a tailspin of global cooling or warming, or both, because of competing environmental processes, he said. The volcanic explosions emitted greenhouse gas and unleashed ash into the atmosphere, which blocks out the sun. ""That would have had a strong impact on what the climate and what the environment was like at geologically relevant time scales,"" he said. Understanding supervolcanoes could give scientists new clues into the early Martian atmosphere and explain various features of the planet's geology. Material from the eruptions may even be responsible for some of the rocks that the Mars rover Curiosity has been encountering since it landed on August 6, 2012. Mars may be home to even more ancient supervolcanoes that today look like impact craters, researchers say. Stephanie C. Werner, planetology researcher at the University of Oslo, who was not involved in the study, believes some of the conclusions of this new study are speculative and not based on a firm timescale. More research is needed to better determine whether this supervolcano activity really predates other significant volcanic episodes, specifically, those that occurred in the Tharsis region of Mars, she said. ""One thing lacking in this study is the constraint on the timing of these events, to fully evaluate the impact on atmosphere evolution and impact on climate,"" she said in an e-mail. ""Nonetheless, events related to the formation of these landforms can have significant influence and may be important if no other activity occurred at the same time."" More orbital data would help resolve unanswered questions about the ancient supervolcanoes, Michalski said. Like magma under an active fault, such discussions will continue bubbling among members of the community of scientists who study Mars.

"A federal judge struck down Oregon's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage Monday. ""Because Oregon's marriage laws discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation without a rational relationship to any legitimate government interest, the laws violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution,"" U.S. District Judge Michael McShane said in his ruling. Oregon voters passed Measure 36 in 2004, which amended the state's Constitution to define marriage as between one man and a woman. In February, the state's attorney general said she would not defend the ban in court because it would not stand up to a federal constitutional challenge. ""My decision will not be the final word on this subject, but on this issue of marriage I am struck more by our similarities than our differences. I believe that if we can look for a moment past gender and sexuality, we can see in these plaintiffs nothing more or less than our own families, families who we would expect our Constitution to protect, if not exalt, in equal measure,"" McShane said. ""With discernment we see not shadows lurking in closets or the stereotypes of what was once believed; rather, we see families committed to the common purpose of love, devotion, and service to the greater community."" Same-sex couples camped out in lawn chairs outside a government building in Oregon's largest county while waiting for the news, then cheered as word of the judge's decision spread. Multnomah County began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples minutes later, the county said in a statement. Ben West, one of the plaintiffs who challenged Oregon's constitutional ban, stood beside his fiance and his son as he told CNN affiliate KGW that he was thrilled by the news. ""We're excited. It's surreal. We're part of history. Our family is recognized, I mean, I'm tingling. It's amazing,"" he said. ""It means that my son's family is just as legitimate as the one next door, and that he can grow up proud."" At a news conference shortly after the judge's ruling, activists and attorneys who challenged the amendment celebrated the news. ""Love won today,"" said Marty Rouse, national field director for the Human Rights Campaign. Ten years ago, Rouse said, the first same-sex marriages in the United States were celebrated in Massachusetts. And 45 years ago marked another historic moment, he said. ""Same-sex couples were arrested and sent to jail for dancing together at establishments like the Stonewall Inn,"" he said. ""Today, 45 years later, in 18 states and now including Oregon and the District of Columbia, same-sex couples are dancing together at their own weddings, and they have wedding rings, not handcuffs. History in Oregon. Congratulations."" Meanwhile, the National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, said it had filed a motion with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals asking judges to block McShane's ruling. ""This case is an ugly example of inappropriate cooperation between the Attorney General and the gay marriage lobby, both of whom want to redefine marriage in contravention of the overwhelming decision of the people to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman,"" Brian Brown, the organization's president, said in a statement. ""The people of Oregon are entitled to a defense of their decision on marriage rather than being abandoned in court."" Same-sex marriage now allowed in 18 states . The Oregon ruling continues a near-unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year for supporters of same-sex marriage. Seventeen other states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage within their borders: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Just over a decade ago, there were none. Earlier this month, judges in Arkansas and Idaho ruled that same-sex marriage bans in those states were unconstitutional. Both decisions are being appealed. This month also marks the two-year anniversary of President Barack Obama voicing his public support for the first time of same-sex marriage, citing his own ""evolution"" on the issue. ""At a certain point, I've just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" Obama said at the time. Groups supporting same-sex marriage applauded the Oregon ruling. ""The importance of Judge McShane's decision cannot be overemphasized,"" said David Fidanque, executive director of the ACLU of Oregon. ""Our federal Constitution does not allow any state -- or its voters -- to deny same-sex couples equal protection under the law simply because of who they are and who they love. This type of discrimination is wrong, and it's also unconstitutional."" But court battles over the matter are far from over. About 70 cases dealing with same-sex marriage are now making their way through U.S. courts. Separate federal appeals courts in recent weeks heard challenges to same-sex marriage bans in Utah, Oklahoma and Virginia. Similar appeals will be heard on current bans in Nevada, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio and Michigan. Federal judge orders Utah to recognize same-sex marriages . Also Monday, a federal judge said Utah must recognize the marriages of more than 1,200 same-sex couples who obtained marriage licenses earlier this year after a court struck down that state's same-sex marriage ban. The U.S. Supreme Court days later issued a stay preventing any more same-sex marriages, but that action left those who got married in the interim in legal limbo. The judge's ruling Monday says Utah must give those couples ""all the protections, benefits, and responsibilities given to all marriages under Utah law."" While some details of the Oregon and Utah cases are similar, there's a key difference. In Utah, the state is appealing a judge's decision to overturn its voter-approved ban of same-sex marriage.  Gov. Gary Herbert slammed what he said was a decision by an ""activist federal judge."" In Oregon, officials are taking the opposite tack, praising the judge's ruling overturning their state's same-sex marriage ban. ""Now, finally, all Oregonians will have the opportunity to make a legal commitment to the person they love. Every person and every family in Oregon deserves that chance,"" Gov. John Kitzhaber said in a statement. ""Today is a win for love, for families, and for freedom.""","Plaintiff: ""It means that my son's family is just as legitimate as the one next door""

"(CNN)The measles cases linked to Disneyland are genetically similar to the one involved in a massive outbreak in the Philippines, according to an analysis. The California outbreak likely started when a traveler who was infected overseas with measles visited the amusement park while infectious, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But health officials don't know exactly who the source of the outbreak is. Genetic analysis of the specimens from 30 California patients showed that the measles was of genotype B3, which is identical to the virus circulating in the Philippines. The CDC also cautioned that the same virus type has been found in 14 other countries. The highly contagious disease has been damaging in the Philippines, infecting about 53,000 people and killing 110 people in 2014. The country has not seen outbreaks this year, although there have been a trickle of cases, said Dr. Julie Lyn Hall, the WHO Country Representative in the Philippines. How bad is measles around the world? So far, the United States has 141 reported cases of measles this year -- 98 of them from California. Most of the people who've become sick with measles were unvaccinated, according to the CDC. This is not the first time that measles affecting the Philippines has been linked to U.S. outbreaks. The virus can easily travel internationally -- as was the case of the unvaccinated Amish missionaries who brought back measles from the Philippines. That outbreak in Ohio infected 383 people in 2014. During the same year, 25 U.S. travelers, most of them unvaccinated, became ill with the measles after returning from the Philippines, according to the CDC. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, which means it is no longer native to the country, but continues to be brought in by international travelers. The United States gets imported cases every year, according to the CDC. Visitors may pick up the disease and bring it back to the U.S., potentially infecting infants who cannot be vaccinated because they are too young, or people who intentionally remain unvaccinated. Disney parks are a popular destination for international visitors, with as many as 24 million patrons a year. And it becomes especially busier during the holiday season. The first measles case linked to Disneyland was reported on January 5, in a case involving an 11-year-old unvaccinated child who visited the park, according to the California Department of Public Health. The current outbreak has triggered a fierce debate about parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. Measles was no big deal until my daughter caught it . Countries with the highest measles incidence per 100,000 population . 1. Georgia -- 79.5 . 2. Bosnia and Herzegovina -- 62.9 . 3. Angola -- 59.3 . 4. Philippines -- 58.2 . 5. Namibia -- 41.9 .

Source: WHO, does not include data from all countries . After Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines in November 2013, the country grappled with a massive measles outbreak. In 2013, the country reported 5,799 confirmed cases of the disease. By 2014, that number increased nearly tenfolds to 53,357 cases, according to World Health Organization data. The spread of the virus has been exacerbated by mass migration, with nearly 4 million displaced people. ""Many of those [measles] cases were associated with Typhoon Haiyan as a number of people were moving out of the typhoon-affected area and coming into Manila,"" said Hall of WHO. They arrived into places with low levels of measles vaccine coverage in Manila, triggering a severe outbreak in January and February 2014. The number of cases that year was unusual compared to previous ones, Hall said. The WHO and the Philippines Department of Health conducted vaccination campaigns to immunize 11 million children. ""There's still the measles virus in the Philippines,"" Hall said. ""Despite all the efforts, not all children are protected from measles here. We are still getting reports, but nowhere near the level of the same time last year.""","Genetic testing finds Disneyland cases are similar to virus type in Philippines .

"The FBI is investigating the armed standoff on federal land between the U.S. government and Southern Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy and his supporters, CNN has confirmed. The government is looking into the possibility that federal laws were broken in the April 12 standoff, including threats against law enforcement officers and the use of illegal weapons. Federal authorities are also concerned about the possible involvement of anti-government groups. While authorities are interested in not inflaming the situation, reports of people pointing weapons at law enforcement need to be investigated, a federal official told CNN. Las Vegas television station KLAS reported that pictures and videos from the standoff are being examined and law enforcement personnel involved are being questioned by the FBI to determine if Bundy supporters broke any laws. An estimated 300 people, many toting weapons, joined Bundy when the federal government began to round up his cattle after he refused to vacate federally owned land and pay more than $1 million in fees. The faceoff that began last month is the culmination of a two-decade-long fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management, which says Bundy illegally tends his cattle on taxpayer-owned land about 100 miles northeast of Las Vegas. What made Nevada rancher fight the feds? Bundy became a conservative symbol of government overreach as some high-profile politicians, including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, flocked to his defense. But after he repeatedly made racist remarks, his clout diminished among the political class. The Bureau of Land Management halted the cattle roundup and is considering what to do next, including arresting Bundy for failing to follow the law, seizing his assets through the Treasury Department or sending the case to the Department of Justice.","The FBI is investigating the armed standoff on federal lands .

"Dr. Mehmet Oz, host of ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" faced grilling by senators on Capitol Hill about the promotion of weight loss products on his show. Sen. Claire McCaskill, chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Insurance, led the panel that on Tuesday looked at false advertising for weight loss products. Subcommittee members took issue with assertions that Oz has made on his show about products that don't have a lot of scientific evidence to back them up, such as green coffee beans. ""The scientific community is almost monolithic against you in terms of the efficacy of the three products you called 'miracles,' "" said McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat. She said she was discouraged by the ""false hope"" his rhetoric gives viewers and questioned his role ""intentional or not, in perpetuating these scams."" ""I don't get why you need to say this stuff when you know it's not true. When you have this amazing megaphone, why would you cheapen your show? ... With power comes a great deal of responsibility."" The Federal Trade Commission is in charge of protecting consumers from ""unfair or deceptive advertising and marketing practices that raise health and safety concerns."" In May, the FTC sued the sellers of Green Coffee Beans for deceiving consumers through fake news sites and invented health claims. The commission said that weeks after ""The Dr. Oz Show"" promoted the benefits of Pure Green Coffee, some companies that marketed the product used video from his show to increase sales. The scientific evidence supporting green coffee bean extract as a weight loss supplement is weak. A small study published in 2012 found chlorogenic acid, the main ingredient in green coffee beans, helped 16 human participants lose, on average, 18 pounds over 22 weeks. But another study on chlorogenic acid in mice found that the acid did not help mice lose weight and in fact, increased their insulin resistance. A 2011 meta-analysis of three studies on green coffee extract found the supplement produced, on average, a five-pound loss among study participants. But all three studies were short term and included a small number of participants, leading the meta-analysis authors to conclude: ""More rigorous trials are needed to assess the usefulness of GCE as a weight loss tool."" Oz told the panel that he does use ""flowery language"" to describe certain products on his show but added he believes in them so much he has given them to his family. ""My job, I feel, on the show is to be a cheerleader for the audience, and when they don't think they have hope, when they don't think they can make it happen, I want to look, and I do look everywhere, including in alternative healing traditions, for any evidence that might be supportive to them,"" Oz said. In addition to green coffee beans, McCaskill called out Garcinia cambogia as another weight loss product Oz has promoted. ""Thanks to brand new scientific research, I can tell you about a revolutionary fat buster,"" Oz said on his show in November 2012 with the words ""No Exercise. No Diet. No Effort"" on the screen behind him. ""It's called Garcinia cambogia."" ‎ . A 1998 study of 135 participants found Garcinia cambogia did not significantly help people lose weight any more than a placebo. But a 2013 meta-analysis of Garcinia cambogia studies hedged on the supplement's ineffectiveness, saying its weight loss benefits ""remain to be proven in larger-scale and longer-term clinical trials."" Whether it helps people lose weight or not, the Garcinia cambogia does not seem to be unsafe to use, some other studies say. Oz testified Tuesday that he could not be held responsible for what certain companies say online about the products. He said he's toned down some of his language and will publish a list of products he thinks really can help people lose weight. ""To not have the conversation about supplements at all however would be a disservice to the viewer,"" Oz said in a prepared statement after the hearing. ""In addition to exercising an abundance of caution in discussing promising research and products in the future, I look forward to working with all those present today in finding a way to deal with the problems of weight loss scams."" The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate weight loss supplements. Under current law, companies selling these products do not need FDA approval before marketing them to the public. ""Just because you see a supplement product on a store shelf does NOT mean it is safe or effective,"" the FDA website says. ""When safety issues are suspected, FDA must investigate and, when warranted, take steps to have the product removed from the market. However, it is much easier for a firm to get a product on the market than it is for FDA to take a product off the market."" These weight loss products, even those that claim to be all natural, may contain toxic ingredients, the FDA says, or they may interact badly with other medications. Make sure to check with your doctor before taking any supplement. Hidden dangers in vitamins, supplements? The FTC told Elizabeth Cohen, CNN senior medical correspondent, that there are just ""too many"" weight loss products using deceptive advertising to sue them all. But consumers should be wary of certain phrases that are most certainly false, the FTC said, including any that claim to help you lose weight without diet and exercise. Bottom line -- don't believe everything you see. Do your homework online and make sure any claim about a weight loss product is backed up by scientific evidence.

"It's time for someone in the NBA to show some backbone.  Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, has got to go and he has got to go in a very public fashion. Listen to the audio recording that is alleged to be of his voice spewing vile reproach at his mistress about her associating with black people in public, and taking photos with black people (Magic Johnson and Matt Kemp, in particular). The audio has not been authenticated as Sterling, but he has not denied it. Listen to the entire five minutes of unhinged ranting and you'll hear a man forbid a woman (Sterling's girlfriend, V. Stiviano, TMZ alleges) from bringing black people to NBA games, as well as some very strange, offensive opinions about ""black Jews"" being treated worse in Israel than ""white Jews."" By the way, racial discrimination issues have trailed Sterling for years, with the NBA getting red flag after red flag on this guy and doing nothing about it. There are many questions about the legality of the recording and how TMZ got its hands on it (my money is on Stiviano, who is embroiled in legal troubles with Sterling's wife, is almost 60 years his junior, and also happens to be of mixed race and part black). If the recording is proven to be Sterling, the NBA has a wide open court and one shot to shatter the glass on this dunk.  Forget the short suspension paired with ""pressure"" to sell the team -- a la Marge Schott, who in 1999 was forced out as owner of baseball's Cincinnati Reds after making comments about blacks, Jews and gays. The Players Association's demand that Sterling be barred from all playoff games this season isn't enough. What the players in the league deserve is for Sterling to be suspended for life and publicly--and unprecedentedly--stripped of his franchise rights. If they merely ""suggest"" he sell the team, he'll just complain that he was set up by a crazy mistress and will make out like a bandit.  He bought the team in 1981 for $12 million.  Forbes recently put the value of the team at $575 million. We can admonish Sterling all we want, and there has been plenty of that coming in: from LeBron James (""I couldn't play for him"")  to Michael Jordan (""sickening"")  to the President of the United States (""incredibly offensive"").  But talk is cheap: It's time for someone to be bold. The players have already missed the opportunity to send the NBA, its owners and its fans a powerful message.  Just days after the story broke, the players, most of whom are black, had game four in the league series on Sunday night in Oakland.  They showed up and they got shellacked. They found ways to make statements of protest: turning their practice jerseys inside out, piling their warm-ups in the center court and wearing black socks in solidarity with other teams.  It was noteworthy, but once again, Sterling got a pass.  The players would have done the league, the country and themselves a huge favor if they had just not shown up to the game. With the momentum of this story, and the outrage building, a boycott would have been the principled stance that the league has been missing all these years.  The nation would have been 100% behind the players.  The Clippers jerseys would have been reclaimed by the players as a symbol of power, rather than a reminder of its racist owner. But now there will just be more talk.  Should fans boycott the games?  Should people not wear the jerseys?  The public, the Clippers fans and the players need a way to show their support for the players and their disgust for Sterling. For now, we wait to see what Commissioner Adam Silver and the NBA decide to do.  They might as well play to win.

"Chris Brown's assault trial has been delayed until Wednesday as lawyers regroup after the conviction of the singer's bodyguard, who was to have testified. Prosecutors are considering whether to grant immunity to bodyguard Christopher Hollosy so that he could testify in Brown's trial. Minutes before Brown's trial was to have begun in the same court, D.C. Superior Judge Patricia Wynn on Monday morning found Hollosy guilty of assaulting a man on a Washington sidewalk. Hollosy was not justified in hitting Parker Adams since there was no evidence he was advancing on the singer as he took photos with a fan, the judge said.  Wynn, who will also decide Brown's case, said she believed the testimony of a limousine driver who said Brown hit Adams before Hollosy attacked. Hollosy's case was tried first so that he could freely testify in his boss' defense about the sidewalk fight that landed them both in jail in October. But his attorney said after the guilty verdict that he would appeal the conviction and invoke his client's constitutional rights against self-incrimination. Prosecutors and the defense lawyer began a discussion about granting immunity to Hollosy that would protect the bodyguard from having testimony in the Brown trial from being used against him in his case.  Before the conviction, it was expected that he would testify that he landed the punch that broke Adams' nose and that he did it because it was his job to protect Brown. Although Brown faces a misdemeanor charge, the singer has a lot riding on Monday's assault trial in Washington. He could receive probation in the District of Columbia if found guilty, but a Los Angeles judge is waiting on the verdict before deciding whether Brown, 24, will remain jailed in California. An acquittal would give Brown's attorney a chance to argue that he should be allowed to make his own way back to California for a probation hearing. Otherwise, he'll have to go back the way he came to Washington: on ""Con Air,"" the federal inmate transport system. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial . Hollosy's attorney, Bernard Grimm, argued in the bodyguard's trial that Adams, 20, was ""simply trying to get rich"" by accusing Brown and Hollosy of assaulting him. Howard University student Jalen Garrison testified in the Hollosy trial that she and a friend were posing for photos on the sidewalk with Brown when Adams, her boyfriend, tried to snap his own photo with Brown. Brown got upset, telling Adams, ""I don't like that gay s***,"" Garrison testified. Brown lunged at Adams, hitting him in the face, she testified. A limousine driver testified he witnessed Brown and Hollosy hit Adams. The bodyguard pulled Brown away before throwing his own punch, he said. Adams did not hit back, he said. When asked to rate the power of Brown's punch on a scale of one to 10, Adams scored it a six. Hollosy, he testified, packed a 10. Adams, who said he earns about $200 a day working at a restaurant, acknowledged that he's suing Brown, potentially seeking millions of dollars for the assault. The lawsuit was filed ""because family knew a lawyer in church and that justice should be served,"" he testified. Brown's mother and aunts, who live in Virginia, along with his girlfriend, Karrueche Tran, and rapper Bow Wow were in court expecting Brown's trial to start. Wynn delayed it, however, saying she needed more time than expected to decide Hollosy's case. Brown's legal troubles began five years ago when he beat Rihanna as the two were in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years' probation and 1,400 hours of community ""labor-oriented service."" Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center, a probation report said. Brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. Brown proceeded ""to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. His probation was revoked in November, but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90-day anger management and drug rehab program. Although he completed that program last month, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu, California, treatment facility until another hearing April 23. Brown's probation officer reported at a February hearing that the singer ""continues to make great improvement"" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for the assault charge in Washington. If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide at a hearing Wednesday whether Brown should complete his probation in jail. He was sent to jail on March 14 after he was kicked out of the second rehab program for rules violations. The judge said he was concerned about a ""provocative"" statement counselors said Brown wrote on a card at the Malibu rehab center. ""I am good at using guns and knives,"" according to a document read in court. The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said. Brown refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient, according to the document. Brown had been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. With his community labor work now on hold, his probation is expected to extend into 2015.","Prosecutors consider giving bodyguard immunity to testify in Chris Brown trial .

That's the question many are asking after a 15-year-old boy sneaked into the wheel well of a Boeing 767 and flew from San Jose, California, to Maui, Hawaii. The city of San Jose, which owns and operates Mineta San Jose International Airport, is not planning to pursue criminal charges against the teen, said Rosemary Barnes, a city public information manager. Immediately after the incident became known, many pointed the finger at the Transportation Security Administration. While the TSA does play a part in an airport's overall security, its role is largely limited to inside the airport building -- the checkpoint security. Local and airport police handle the outside -- the perimeter security. ""Perimeter security is a shared security,"" John Sammon, a top TSA administrator, said at a congressional subcommittee hearing in 2011. The TSA depends on local police and airport personnel to play the lead role, he said. Against this backdrop, Sunday's incident has one California state lawmaker calling for better safety. ""I have long been concerned about security at our airport perimeters,"" state Rep. Eric Swalwell tweeted. ""#Stowaway teen demonstrates vulnerabilities that need to be addressed."" 'No system is 100%' In the case of San Jose International Airport, security responsibilities lie not just with the TSA, but also with airport and city police. Six miles of chain link fence enclose the airport. Much of it, according to CNN affiliate KGO-TV, is only 6 feet high, topped with barbed wire. Security cameras offer added surveillance, and ""many eyes and ears"" monitor the grounds, Barnes said. The airport has surveillance video showing an unidentified person walking on the airport ramp in the dark and approaching a Hawaiian Airlines Boeing 767. But ""we do not know at this time if this is the teenage stowaway,"" Barnes said. Federal investigators who interviewed the teen in Maui said he scaled the airport fence in San Jose, Barnes said. ""No system is 100%,"" Barnes said. ""And it appears that this teenager scaled a section of our perimeter and was able to proceed onto our ramp under cover of darkness and into the wheel well of an aircraft."" Hawaiian Airlines defended its inspection process. ""Before an aircraft is put into service, safety and security inspections are conducted by Hawaiian Airlines vendor maintenance personnel to visually review any compartment accessible from the ground, including the wheel well. This is standard operating procedure. ""Cockpit crews also conduct exterior walk-arounds at the gate to perform system checks prior to departure. The wheel well is not included as part of this checklist. At this time, the wheel well doors are closed and the area is not visible. ""Our process meets or exceeds TSA requirements and industry standards,"" the airline said. CNN aviation expert Michael Kay said it was a ""physical feat"" that the boy got past all sorts of people, apparently unnoticed. ""Clearly there's a big security breach here, which in the post-9/11 world order is a concern."" Reevaluating protocols . The boy landed in Maui on Sunday and told authorities he ran away from home in Santa Clara, California. He didn't have any ID; all he had was a comb. He told investigators he crawled into the wheel well and lost consciousness when the plane took off. An hour after the plane landed at Kahului Airport, the boy regained consciousness and was captured on security footage crawling out of the left main gear area of the plane. Officials at Kahului said they were re-examining their safety protocols to avoid a repeat. Maui airport district manager Marvin Moniz  told CNN affiliate KHON that people have scaled the barbed wire fence and gotten onto the tarmac before, but none of them ever got onto a plane. ""We went out, we did our rounds, did our checks, and it did not appear at any one point that there was entrance onto the airfield,"" he said. The airport has multiple levels of security, he said: more than 200 cameras, a private security firm, airport police and the TSA. ""What we can't catch with cameras, we do vehicle patrol. We do foot patrols,"" he told reporters. Not the first time . Plenty of people have hitched a ride on a plane by holing up in a wheel well. Most don't survive. In February, crews at Dulles International Airport in suburban Washington found the body of a man inside the wheel well of an Airbus A340 operated by South African Airways. In 2010, a 16-year-old boy died after he fell out of the wheel well of a US Airways flight bound for Boston from Charlotte, North Carolina. A report detailing his death found there were not enough security officers at the Charlotte Douglas International Airport, one of the fastest-growing airports in the country. The most recent known case of someone surviving was on a short domestic flight in Nigeria. A 15-year-old boy sneaked into the wheel well of a flight from Benin City to Lagos, thinking it was a flight to the United States, according to an FAA report. The ride lasted only 35 minutes. Stowaway risk . Apparently, some airports have a greater risk of stowaways than others. Many incidents involve people desperately trying to escape their countries. After speaking with some Boeing 767 captains, Kay said, ""There are designated airfields around the world that various airlines have put a designation of stowaway risk."" ""What that means is that when the aircraft lands -- Accra in Ghana, for example, in West Africa ... what the engineers will do is they will drop those doors,"" Kay said. ""So when the pilot or the first officer does their walk-around, they can actually look up and see the enormity of the undercarriage bay."" But those checks aren't mandated worldwide. Physical feats . It's not difficult to climb inside a wheel well, said Jose Wolfman Guillen, a ground operations coordinator at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. ""You can grab onto the struts and landing gear assembly kind of like a ladder, and you just jump on the tire and climb into the wheel well."" But after takeoff, many scenarios could kill a stowaway hiding in the landing gear wheel well. Inside, there's not much room -- even less than in the trunk of a car, Guillen said. A stowaway would need to guess ""where the tire is going to fold in when it closes after takeoff. There's a high risk of getting crushed once the gear starts going in."" The boy's survival is ""dumb luck, mostly,"" said Dr. Kenneth Stahl, a trauma surgeon at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. The temperature outside the airplane could have been as low as 75 or 80 degrees below zero, said Stahl, who is also a pilot. ""Those are astronomically low temperatures to survive."" The boy was probably so cold that ""he was essentially in a state of suspended animation,"" he said. Being young probably worked in his favor, too. ""No adult would have survived that,"" Stahl added. The boy could face permanent brain damage from the experience -- in fact, it's ""more likely than not,"" he said. He could face neurological issues, memory problems or a lower IQ. The teen also could have frostbite or a kidney injury because when the body freezes, particles of muscle enter the bloodstream and damage the kidneys, Stahl said. Concerns about safety . The FBI dropped out of the investigation once it was confident the teen didn't pose a threat. But the boy wasn't the only lucky one on this journey; so were the passengers and officials. ""If someone can climb inside here, then someone can put something a little more sinister in there,"" Kay said. ""And that's the connection that security officials need to make."" 5 stowaway attempts that didn't end tragically .","""Our process meets or exceeds TSA requirements,"" Hawaiian Airlines says .

"It's a bust for actor Ben Affleck at one Las Vegas casino. The actor was ""banned from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock casino in Las Vegas,"" a source close to Affleck told CNN on Friday. Affleck was ""not booted"" from the casino as other reports have indicated, the source said. Rather, the source says, he was asked to leave after casino security told him: ""You are too good at the game."" The actor was told he could play other games at the casino, the source said. The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment about the Tuesday incident. The source did not say whether casino security accused Affleck of card counting, which is not a crime. It is frowned on by casinos, and it can lead to a ban by a gambling establishment. Affleck was in Las Vegas with his wife for a quick getaway before the actor begins shooting ""Batman vs. Superman,"" the source said. Affleck has been cast as Bruce Wayne in the upcoming film.","Ben Affleck was banned because he was too good, a source close to the actor says .

"Who knew bigotry could bring in big dollars? Hey Donald Sterling, we know you refused to rent your apartments to blacks and Hispanics, but can you spare some change to help us fight for civil rights? That's essentially what transpired in Los Angeles between Sterling and the local chapter of the NAACP. Surely the organization knew Sterling was the subject of a Justice Department investigation into discriminatory housing practices. And surely it knew Sterling agreed to pay one of the biggest fines of its kind in history. It wasn't enough for the Los Angeles NAACP to shun Sterling. On the contrary, the NAACP awarded Sterling a lifetime achievement award. That was in 2009, just before the Donald T. Sterling organization gave the NAACP $5,000. ""The NAACP airbrushed this away and simply said that Sterling has been a gem in giving oodles of tickets away to needy inner city kids and ladling out some cash to charities and sports camps for them,"" wrote Earl Ofari Hutchinson on Thehutchinsonreportnews.com. He's a sociologist who has written nine books on African-American politics, following the 2009 award. But, that was then. Except it's not. The local chapter of the NAACP was about to grant Sterling another lifetime achievement award until that pesky racist rant became public in the past few days. The rant where he berates his biracial girlfriend for posting an Instagram of herself with Magic Johnson, now a part owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. ""In your lousy f----g Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" he says. Now the group is returning Sterling's money. He also won't be gracing the stage alongside another of their winners, ""Person of the Year,"" the Rev. Al Sharpton. Today Sharpton asked the NBA to meet with civil rights organizations, including the national NAACP, about his former co-honoree. As for whether the LA chapter will do business again with Sterling? President Leon Jenkins says yes. ""At some point when there has been proof, I think that would be a legitimate time for the NAACP to sit down with Sterling and try to work out how and why he did what he did and what is he going to do in the future. God teaches us to forgive. And the way I look at it, after a sustained period of just proof to the African-American community that those words don't really reflect his heart, I think there's room for forgiveness."" Jenkins' remarks struck a nerve. ""That dude needs to be fired."" CNN contributor and ESPN Senior Writer LZ Granderson, a guest on my show, did not stop there. ""He sounds like a fool. I'm just going to come to you straight up. To even suggest that somehow a sit-down with Donald Sterling now, when if anyone should have known about his racist past, (it) should have been a local chapter of the NAACP. First lawsuit was 2003. To pretend they'll sit down with him now and see if that's really in his heart when he's been sued by the Department of Justice, that man needs to resign or be fired."" Before you jump on Granderson's bandwagon, it's worth noting that at least Jenkins returned Sterling's donation. Consider what's happening with the other contributions from the Donald T. Sterling Charitable Foundation of Beverly Hills. He donated $50,000 each to the LA Black Business Association and the United Negro College Fund. Anthony Owens, from UNCF, said the organization did not plan to return the money, which has already been passed along in the form of student scholarships. He also gave $30,000 to the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles, which teaches about the Holocaust and seeks to enlighten visitors about all forms of discrimination. Keep in mind that on that now infamous tape, Sterling is also alleged to have said, ""There are white Jews and black Jews."" He then goes on to infer black Jews are ""less than"" white Jews. Still, the Simon Wiesenthal Center will not be giving back that $30,000. ""The funds were used to combat racism and teach tolerance. We aren't going to return money of his that was used to do the very opposite of what he said on that tape."" said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance. He said his organization didn't know about the housing discrimination allegations when it received the money. He said his staff is not large enough to do that kind of research. (A Google search would have done the trick). Oh, there's more. It seems Donald Sterling was a giving machine, despite his remarks showing disdain for African-Americans and black Jews. In an article in the Beverly Hills Times, his foundation boasts of giving $5 million in grants and scholarship money at a fancy party at Spago. That's twice the fine he is to pay the NBA. Thirty charities and eight high schools got checks at his gala after hearing a benediction from Rabbi David Baron and songs from Debbie Boone, of ""You Light Up My Life"" fame. Recipients included a smorgasbord of diverse organizations like 100 Black men, Nuevo Amanecer, Para Los Ninos, the Special Olympics, Yeshiva Gedolah and Junior Blind of America. Tuesday those organizations told CNN they were asking themselves what his intentions were, but none had resolved the issue of whether to return the money. (An organization not involved in that event, UCLA said in a statement Tuesday that it was rejecting a $3 million pledge from Sterling.) Para Los Ninos, which works to get a better education for impoverished children, said it didn't want his money any more. ""We have asked them to take our pictures off their full-page ad. We will not be accepting their money, or any more money going forward from the Donald T. Sterling Foundation,"" said Celeste Anlauf, director of major gifts and communications. ""We were among a number of organizations that got money from him and up until this moment we had not had an organizational conversation about his ethics. We knew there were some questions but we had every hope that he had the best of intentions."" Perhaps Sterling did have ""the best of intentions."" But, ""hoping"" doesn't cut it. I certainly understand how difficult it is to raise money, but is selling your soul worth it? Apparently the NAACP thinks so.  Derek Turner, the spokesperson for the national NAACP, notes that Strom Thurmond, the onetime pro-segregationist senator, was a member of the NAACP. ""I'm sure they try to buy favor by supporting the NAACP. Strom Thurmond was a member of the NAACP. We certainly didn't go easy on Strom Thurmond and any of the politicians who support us."" But in the Sterling case -- it did. CNN Political Analyst and HuffPost Live Host Marc Lamont Hill put it best: ""You know what it is? We like sexy forms of racism. Someone is on the phone talking to their girlfriend about not letting black people at the game. Denying black people housing is far more damaging than the phone call he made."" I could not agree more.","Carol Costello: Donald Sterling made charitable gifts to civil rights groups .
She says he had history of housing discrimination, but organizations took his money .

"Pulitzer Prize-winning author Oscar Hijuelos has died, his agent said Sunday. He was 62. Hijuelos was the first Latino to win the prestigious award for fiction for his 1989 novel, ""The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love."" He died Saturday from sudden cardiac arrest, according to his literary agent, Jennifer Lyons. ""I never even thought that book would get published when I first wrote it,"" Hijuelos told CNN's Don Lemon in 2009. ""And because of that -- having been poor in the first place -- I had nothing to lose. And not having expected it to be published, I had felt enormous amounts of freedom."" He said his book seemed to help open doors for other writers. ""The truth is that before that period, that book really, there were very few publishing houses in New York City dealing or publishing main -- you know, Latino writers. I mean, it was a very -- I can barely think of any titles. Most Latino authors were being published out of university presses or small presses,"" he said. Hijuelos was born in New York to Cuban parents in 1951. As a child, he traveled with his mother to eastern Cuba to visit family. There, he contracted an infection that grew into a kidney disease and landed him in hospitals for a few years. ""I was, like, 3, or 4, or 5 at that time, and I was separated from my family, and that separation from identity, ironically enough, having to do with Cuba itself, has always been, like, one of the subthemes going through my work -- which is what is an identity about?

"Choosing healthier foods at the grocery store may soon be a little easier. The Food and Drug Administration is proposing several changes to the nutrition labels you see on packaged foods and beverages. If approved, the new labels would place a bigger emphasis on total calories, added sugars and certain nutrients, such as Vitamin D and potassium. The FDA is also proposing changes to serving size requirements in an effort to more accurately reflect what people usually eat or drink. For example, if you buy a 20-ounce soda, you're probably not going to stop drinking at the 8-ounce mark. The new rules would require that entire soda bottle to be one serving size -- making calorie counting simpler. This is the first overhaul for nutrition labels since the FDA began requiring them more than 20 years ago. There has been a shift in shoppers' priorities as nutrition is better understood and people learn what they should watch for on a label, administration officials said. ""You as a parent and a consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store, pick up an item off the shelf, and be able to tell whether it's good for your family,"" first lady Michelle Obama said in a press release.  ""So this is a big deal, and it's going to make a big difference for families all across this country."" The proposed labels would remove the ""calories from fat"" line you currently see on labels, focusing instead on total calories found in each serving. Nutritionists have come to understand that the type of fat you're eating matters more than the calories from fat. As such, the breakdown of total fat vs. saturated and trans fat would remain. Put down that doughnut: FDA takes on trans fat . The proposed labels would also note how much added sugar is in a product. Right now, it's hard to know what is naturally occurring sugar and what has been added by the manufacturer. ""Now when Americans pull a product from the supermarket shelf, they will have a clear idea of how much sugar that product really contains,"" American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown said. Chemically, added sugar is the same, but studies show many Americans eat more sugar than they realize. The American Heart Association recommends you limit added sugar to no more than half your daily discretionary calories. That means for American men, about 150 calories a day, or nine teaspoons. For women it's a smaller amount -- no more than 100 calories per day from added sugar, or about six teaspoons of sugar. The FDA also plans to update the daily values for certain nutrients such as sodium, dietary fiber and Vitamin D. For instance, the daily limit for sodium was 2,400 milligrams. If the new rules take effect, the daily value  will be 2,300 milligrams, administration officials said. Food and beverage companies would also be required to declare the amount of Vitamin D and potassium in a product, as well as calcium and iron. Research shows Americans tend not to consume enough Vitamin D for good bone health. And potassium is essential in keeping your blood pressure in check. Vegetarian diet could help lower your blood pressure . Administration officials said about 17% of current serving size requirements will be changing, and the FDA is adding 25 categories for products that weren't commonly around 20 years ago (think pot stickers, sesame oil and sun-dried tomatoes). Most of the required serving sizes will be going up; no one eats just half a cup of ice cream, for instance. Others, like yogurt, will be going down. ""This will help people better understand how many calories they actually consume, especially if they plan to eat all the food in a container or package,"" Brown said. While the American Heart Association and advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest commended the FDA's changes, they noted that there was more to do. Both organizations said the FDA's sodium recommendation was still too high. Brown said the association will continue to recommend sodium intake be limited to 1,500 milligrams a day. CSPI said it will also request that the FDA include a daily value of 25 grams for added sugars. ""Thus, the Nutrition Facts label for a 16.9-ounce bottle of soda would indicate that its 58 grams of added sugars represents 230 percent of the DV,"" the group said in an e-mail. With this announcement, the FDA has opened a 90-day comment period, during which experts and members of the public can provide input on the proposed rules. The FDA will then issue a final rule. Officials said they hope to complete the process this year. Manufacturing companies will then have two years to implement the changes. Nutrition labels have remained pretty much the same for decades. It wasn't until the late 1960s that most food labels listed any nutrition information. At the time, labels with calorie or sodium counts were mainly used on products the FDA considered to have ""special dietary uses,"" for people with high blood pressure who were watching sodium, for instance. Most people were making meals at home then, so there wasn't a huge demand for this information. That changed as more people started eating processed foods. Noticing the trend, the White House pulled together a conference of nutritionists and food manufacturers in 1969.  Nutrition labeling was voluntary at first. It wasn't until 1990 that the FDA required nutrition labels for most prepared and packaged foods. Labels for raw produce and fish remain voluntary. More Americans today are interested in what's on these nutrition labels, research shows. A USDA study released last month showed 42% of working-age adults between 29 and 68 looked at these labels most or all of the time when shopping. Some 57% of Americans older than 68 did as well. That's up from 2007, when 34% of working-age adults looked at the label, and 51% of Americans older than 68 did. The increase is good news as the United States struggles with an obesity epidemic. Some studies have shown that people who read labels eat healthier. More than a third of all Americans are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity rates drop for 2- to 5-year olds .","The Food and Drug Administration is proposing changes to nutrition labels .
New labels make calorie counts easier to read and highlight added sugar .
FDA also wants to change required serving sizes in some products, such as soda .

"The man's anger at authorities giving a briefing on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could not be contained. He screamed at the screen as a promised video conference with Malaysian authorities became the latest part of the aftermath of the plane's disappearance to encounter technical difficulties. ""You're all bloody liars, and you're lying to us again,"" the Chinese man said, according to a translation. Families of the passengers on the missing plane in attendance at the Beijing briefing Wednesday exploded in anger and stormed out. ""We will request their team of experts to come to Beijing to conduct face-to-face communications and fulfill their commitment,"" said Jing Hui, a spokesman for some of the families. ""What Is the truth? What problem do they want to cover up?"" The families have 26 questions they want answered now. The queries were posted on the social media site Weibo by a committee representing some of the passengers' relatives. Some of the ""questions"" are requests that evidence be shared with them, including the flight's logbook and recording of air traffic control on March 8, the night the plane disappeared with 239 people aboard. Most of the people on the plane were Chinese, and their families have become very distrustful of Malaysian government authorities and officials with the airline. That was apparent in the request for MH370's log book. John Goglia, a former member of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, told CNN the log is usually on the plane and even if it wasn't, investigators wouldn't reveal specific information from it. He also said a request for phone numbers of investigators would be denied. But the other 24 questions and requests? ""These are not state secrets so the families should have access to all of that kind of information,"" he said. Many of the 26 questions focus on technical issues involving emergency locator transmitters, or ELTs, and ""black boxes."" With an apparent in-depth understanding of how these work, the families ask about the specific technology on the missing plane. ELTs are designed to activate after a crash and send a signal to a frequency monitored by air traffic controllers. ""Black boxes,"" or voice and data recorders, could shed light on what went on in the plane's cockpit and other crucial flight information. The families' final seven questions involve ""protocol,"" including this: What did Malaysia Airlines do when the flight went missing? The families also ask whether search and rescue teams have final results from searched areas, and whether the Malaysian government could specify the rights of family members ""to know the facts of cases or the details of an incident."" Malaysia Airlines has said it shares all the information it has with appropriate authorities. In a video message this month, Hugh Dunleavy, the airline's commercial director, said the company shares the same ""fundamental requirement"" as the families: to find out what happened. Malaysian authorities have come under criticism repeatedly for their handling of the investigation.  But the government has insisted it's doing what it can to get to the bottom of what happened and support the families. ""We understand that it has been a difficult time for all the families.  And we appreciate that many families want to see physical evidence before they will accept that MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean,"" acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at the end of March.  ""... The question that the families principally want answered, is the question we simply do not have the answer to -- namely, where their loved ones are, and where is MH370."" A week earlier, Hishammuddin made a pledge to the families: ""We will do everything in our power to keep you informed."" Bluefin-21 completes 'full search' After two previous setbacks that officials called minor, an underwater vessel searching for traces of MH370 resurfaced Thursday morning after completing what search officials called a ""full mission."" The Bluefin-21 has now searched a total of 90 square kilometers (34.7 square miles) in its first three trips to the ocean floor. On its second trip the Bluefin was forced to resurface after 11 hours because it needed to have a technical issue addressed. Part of the equipment designed to help the Bluefin-21 move deeper and avoid seepage was low on oil.  Officials replenished the supply and redeployed the vessel. The Bluefin-21 has its electronics sealed in bottles so they are protected from saltwater.  As the probe moves deeper and the pressure increases, the operating system pushes oil into these bottles.  The oil counters the pressure and prevents saltwater from seeping in. If oil fills the container, there's no space for saltwater. ""In no way should this suggest that (the AUV) is not 'hardy' enough to be working at this depth.  On the contrary, it is absolutely the best piece of equipment for the job we are doing,"" a source close to the operation said, adding that technical issues are common at great depths. Data from its second and third mission have been downloaded, the Australian Joint Agency Coordination Centre said. There were no ""significant detections"" during the second search. 24-hour mission . Bluefin-21 takes two hours to get near the ocean floor and another two hours to return to the surface. It aims to map the ocean floor for 16 hours to retrieve data, which then take four hours to analyze. The vessel searches maximum depths of 4,500 meters (14,764 feet), and before the technical interruption, it was scheduled to complete its second dive about 10 a.m. ET, a source said. The U.S. Navy has determined the seafloor in the search area reaches a maximum depth of 4,600 meters (15,092 feet). The Bluefin operators said they can reprogram it to operate at 5,000 meters (16,404 feet), meaning it can search the originally designated area, which is thought to have yielded the most promising clues. It is where a second audio signal that searchers thought was manmade and the right frequency to belong to the flight data recorder's emergency beacon. The quality of the ""ping"" led authorities to focus the underwater search in the area. An oil sample taken from a slick on the surface in that section of the ocean is at a lab being analyzed to see if it is an aviation or maritime fluid. 'Garbage patch' ""We have known a long time that especially the recent search area, the new search area they are looking at now, there's a lot of debris there because it is close to what we call the garbage patch, and that's where all of the garbage accumulates,"" said Erik Van Sebille, a physical oceanographer at University of New South Wales. ""There are five in each basin and one in the Indian Ocean. Everything that has been thrown in the ocean in the last 50 years and still floating is somewhere in this garbage patch."" Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing. With no debris found after weeks of searches and no possible pings from the plane's ""black boxes"" detected in a week, officials said it's time to focus the search underwater. While air and sea surface searches continued Thursday in a zone centered about 2,170 kilometers (1,348 miles) northwest of Perth, those searches are probably nearing an end. Still, Thursday's surface search area grew significantly to 40,349 square kilometres (15,578.8 square miles).","Ocean is a depth the Bluefin probe should be able to handle, U.S. Navy indicates .

"With every attack by Islamist militants in northern Nigeria, Daniel Ayuba relives a nightmare. Two years ago, attackers planted a bomb near a car wash in Maiduguri. The explosion shattered his leg and left 80% of his body covered in shrapnel. It also flattened cars and motorbikes, and left an entire neighborhood smoldering. ""I looked around me and there was fire burning, houses blown up and dead people,"" said Ayuba, the scars still visible on most of his body. ""I  kept on crying, crying for someone to come help me, but no one would come."" Ayuba is among a fast-growing list of Boko Haram victims. The Islamist militants have intensified their wave of terror targeting the north and beyond. And every attack gets more brazen. They swoop in on foot, motorcycles and car convoys. They hurl bombs and pull guns with lightening speed. In April the terrorist group attracted worldwide attention -- and condemnation -- when it abducted an estimated 276 girls in April from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing. A few days earlier, the militants bombed a bus station, killing at least 71 people on the outskirts of the capital of Abuja. ""When I heard the news, I started crying,"" Ayuba said.  ""I said to myself, 'What's wrong with these people?'"" Father ambushed, killed . In his case, the car wash bombing was not his first brush with the militants. Years before that, members of the terror group ambushed his father, a police officer, and sprayed his car with bullets. ""When my father arrived ... they came out, one of them shot him"" in the head, he said. His father died. The lawless Borno state, whose capital is Maiduguri, is a major hot spot for the militants. So much so, it had banned motorbikes a few years ago to prevent drive-by attacks by Boko Haram. The group is known to use gunmen on motorbikes to kill. Ripple effects . For nearly a year,  Borno, Yobe and Adamawa states have been under a state of emergency due to the relentless assaults. The Islamist militant group has bombed churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders. Boko Haram -- whose name means ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language -- says it wants to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law. Violence related to the group killed 1,500 in the first three months of this year alone. As the Nigerian military battles the brutal militants, it's breaking the rules as well.

"Call them drones; call them toy airplanes with digital cameras dropped into their girths. Either way, South Korean defense officials said on Friday they were sure that they came from North Korea and that they were up to no good. Three diminutive single-engine unmanned propeller planes that look like they could have come from a hobby shop were found on the ground in March and April in parts of the South near the border with the northern Communist regime. Though the low-tech buzzers don't seem to represent a major danger, they come in the shadow of North Korean missile launches and the impending countdown to the test of a nuclear device. And they made it through South Korean air defenses. Ministry of National Defense officials in Seoul immediately suspected that the sky-blue colored fliers belonged to Pyongyang. They formed an investigation team with the United States in mid-April to analyze the ""travel log file"" and photos taken by the drones and announced the results on Friday. Scientists found a ""smoking gun that all three were sent from North Korea and are programmed to return to North Korea,"" South Korean defense spokesman Kim Min-soek said. Photos the drones took along on their journey corroborate their flight path, he said. Precarious cargo . Had the mechanical carrier pigeons made it back home, they would have delivered precarious cargo, but it would have been far from precious. Japanese-made digital cameras, which look like they could be of the consumer variety, were inserted into the bellies of the drones and had taken aerial photos of the South from around the border region. All three were programmed to fly over military facilities, and two of them had images of targets of military interest -- strategically important islands near the demilitarized zone, and the Blue House, residence and office of South Korea's President Park Geun-hye. Images from the third drone were not available to South Korean investigators. A wild ginseng digger had stumbled upon the plane and had deleted its memory card so he could use it himself, the Korea Times reported. The planes were not capable of transmitting images back to North Korea in real time, and the photos themselves were no better than what one might see on a service akin to Google Earth, Kim said in a previous briefing. Limited capabilities . There is little danger the drones could have made it far into South Korea. The type of drone is not used for long-range missions, a defense analyst said. Instead they're better suited to see what the enemy is up to on the other side of a hill or wall. ""It has quite a small range, it doesn't have very long endurance so it would only be up there for a few hours. You would use those to see what the other guys are doing in a battlefield environment,"" said James Hardy, the Asia Pacific editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly magazine. ""They're very much closely built off a remote-controlled aircraft that you can buy in a toy store. They're just a militarized version of that,"" Hardy said. The Korean drones are nowhere near as sophisticated as those used by the United States in Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan, he said. They would also not make much of a weapon, if someone decided to stuff explosives into them, Kim has said. ""Even if they are to be used for future attacks, (they) can only carry 2-3 kilograms of TNT and cannot cause huge damage."" North Korea has flaunted similar, larger UAVs at military parades in recent years, and some of them have been spiked with explosives, Hardy said. Video footage shows North Korean exercises using them as missiles, but it's an expensive way to build a bomb, he said. And it could only take out a single vehicle or ship. 'Tis the season . Spring is traditionally a time of high tensions between Pyongyang on the one side and Seoul and Washington on the other. Annual U.S.-South Korean joint military drills, that ended on April 7, drew criticism from North Korea, which views the exercises as ""dress rehearsals for invasion,"" according to analyst James Person from the Woodrow Wilson Center. In March, Pyongyang fired two mid-range ballistics missiles off its eastern coast, in an apparent response to the drills. Days later, the two sides fired hundreds of shells across the Northern Limit Line, their disputed maritime border. The shells were shot into the sea, not at hard targets. North Korea also warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device. ""It's all good stuff because it allows the North Koreans to do something provocative and slightly annoying which might embarrass South Koreans, but it's not provocative enough to create a proper military response,"" Hardy said. Slipping through . The drones would fit well into that category, since they slipped through South Korean air defenses. They are made of polycarbonate, which is difficult to detect with radar, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. They fly at an average speed of about 110 km per hour (68 mph) at an altitude of 1.3 km (.8 miles). They were launched in North Korea from three locations, South Korea's defense ministry said: Near the Kaesong area, 27 kilometers southeast of Haeju and 17 kilometers from Pyonggak. South Korea's defense ministry called the intrusion by the drones a violation of the truce that ended the bloody conflict between North and South Korea in 1953. Kim said Seoul will send a warning via the United Nations to Pyongyang and tighten air defenses as a response to the drones.","Three diminutive single-engine unmanned propeller planes were found in March and April .

"The Chinese air force has a new secret weapon: monkeys. The People's Liberation Army Air Force has trained macaques to keep its troops safe by discouraging birds from nesting near the air force base, the PLA's website reported earlier this week. The monkeys are used in an unidentified air force base in northern China, which is situated right on a major migratory route for birds. When swarms of birds fly around the base, it poses a threat to military planes that are in mid-flight. The birds could potentially get sucked into plane engines, endangering the lives of both birds and pilots. ""Don't worry, we now have a secret weapon!"" Su Chuang, a high-ranking officer, was quoted as saying on the PLA website. The officer was referring to the specially-trained monkeys that answer to the sound of a whistle. When the nests of birds are discovered in tree tops, the monkey army is deployed to remove them. The PLA have tried many different methods to remove the nests in the past, including opening fire on the nests, using long bamboo poles to topple them out of trees, and having soldiers climb the trees to pick them out. None of these methods were very effective. Apart from being time-consuming and dangerous for the officers who had to climb the trees, the birds kept coming back. However, when monkeys remove the nests, the birds do not return, as the macaques leave a scent on the branches that discourage the birds, according to the PLA's web posting. ""The monkeys are loyal bodyguards who defend the safety of our comrades,"" said the web report.","Birds pose a hazard to Chinese planes in the air .

"It's been a week since the world learned that Donald Sterling had made racist remarks on audio recordings, casting a cloud over the professional basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers. On Saturday, the team had two wins to celebrate. First, the NBA announced it will appoint a new chief executive officer to oversee the team's operations. The appointment will be made in consultation with the Clippers management. ""The best way to ensure the stability of the team during this difficult situation is to move quickly and install a CEO to oversee the Clippers organization,"" NBA Executive Vice President Mike Bass said in a statement. ""The process of identifying that individual is underway."" Second, the team showed that it had truly shaken off the non-basketball distractions. The Clippers defeated the Golden State Warriors 126-121 to win its first round in the NBA playoffs. The Clippers now advance to face the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday. But the Sterling story won't go away any time soon. After dodging the media for days, the woman who recorded Clippers' owner Donald Sterling making racist remarks urged him to apologize. In an exclusive with  ABC's Barbara Walters on Friday, V. Stiviano said Sterling is hurting after the scandal that turned him into a sports pariah. ""I think he feels very alone. Not truly supported by those around him,"" Stiviano, 31, said. ""Tormented. Emotionally traumatized."" But, she told Walters, this is not the first time they've discussed race. ""There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one,"" she said. ""Part of what the world heard was only 15 minutes. There's a number of other hours that the world doesn't know."" One audio of Sterling's conversation released last month triggered a firestorm that led to his NBA lifetime ban and a $2.5 million fine. In the audio, Sterling tells Stiviano not to ""promote"" her relationship with black people or bring them to games after she posted a picture on social media with NBA legend Magic Johnson. Stiviano said Sterling should apologize for the comments and has discussed it with him. ""God only knows,"" she said when asked if he will apologize. Whether or not he does, Sterling is already paying the price. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver gave him a lifetime ban, ordered he pay a $2.5 million fine and said he'd push to ""force a sale"" of the Clippers. Was it legal to record and release Sterling's racist rant? 'In the heat of the moment' Despite their numerous conversations, including the ones that led to Sterling's punishment, Stiviano does not consider him a racist. ""No, I don't believe that in my heart,"" she said. "" I think the things he says are not what he feels. Anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment. ""I think he comes from a different generation ... he was brought up to believe these things ... segregation, whites and blacks. But through his actions, he's shown that he's not a racist. He's shown to be a very generous and kind man."" She said he slammed her pictures on social media because of pressure from naysayers who criticized her and questioned why she's always around him. ""I think he was generalizing,"" she said. "" I think the focus of the subject at that time was just black people, but I think he referred to everyone, not just black people, when he made that statement."" 'His silly rabbit' During the exclusive, Stiviano also addressed the nature of her relationship with the Clippers owner. ""I love him just like a father figure,"" she said, adding that she plays a crucial role in his life. ""I'm Mr. Sterling's right-hand man, arm/man,"" she said. ""I'm Mr. Sterling's everything. I'm his confidant, his best friend, his silly rabbit."" She said she calls herself his ""silly rabbit"" because she does not take things seriously and makes him laugh. She said the two are not involved romantically and have a financial arrangement. ""He at first started paying me as an employee, and then he started paying me off the books,"" she said. NAACP L.A. chapter head resigns over scandal . Sterling's fall . NBA owners, players and others called for swift, firm punishment after TMZ posted the audio featuring the racist comments purportedly made on April 9. The league's commissioner, Adam Silver, heeded their call, issuing sweeping sanctions against Sterling on Tuesday. He fined the Clippers owner $2.5 million and banned him from any association with the team for life. Under the lifetime ban, Sterling is prohibited from NBA games or practices, stepping foot inside any Clippers facility, taking part in business or personnel decisions or having a role in league activities such as attending NBA Board of Governors meetings. If Sterling does sell the team, he'd profit considerably. He bought the Clippers for $12 million in 1981, and the team is now worth $575 million, according to Forbes magazine. Stiviano's attorney has said she did not leak the audio tape. Opinion: Sell the Clippers to the people .","Clippers advance in NBA playoffs by beating Warriors .

"I think of myself as an ""impatient optimist."" There are times, however, when it's harder to muster the optimism, and the impatience takes over. That's how I felt when I read about the hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped by the extremist group Boko Haram to be married off or sold into slavery. It's difficult to pinpoint the worst aspect of this atrocity.  And it's pitiful that this is nothing new. Treating women as spoils or weapons of war has been a common practice for thousands of years. Boko Haram has sought to justify its actions as consistent with Islamic teachings, and this is an insult. Many influential voices in the Muslim world have rebuked the group's actions. (To cite just one example, Sheik Ahmed el-Tayeb of the Cairo-based Al-Azhar, one of Sunni Islam's most prestigious theological institutions, said the kidnappings ""completely contradict Islam and its principles of tolerance."") It's frustrating that the Nigerian government, despite an intensifying effort to find the girls, has been unable to locate them.  And it's horrifying that hundreds of girls, their parents and thousands of their relatives are living each passing moment in escalating fear -- with no idea whether they'll ever see each other again. My heart breaks for these mothers and fathers. But perhaps the most awful part of the story is that Boko Haram stands against a better future for ordinary Nigerians. Boko Haram is committed to the idea that women are the property of husbands and mere instruments of reproduction. They are particularly opposed to the idea that girls ought to be educated, which is why they target schools. In fact, when girls are educated and free to pursue their passions, they contribute more to a thriving society. When women have a voice, they raise it to demand a life that is greater than what they've been told they have a right to expect. And these demands change the future for everyone. Nigeria has a population of 170 million. Its economy is the largest on the African continent. The future holds nearly boundless promise, as represented, in part, by the fact that the World Economic Forum is meeting in Abuja right now. But if the country's 85 million women and girls don't have the opportunity to seize their potential, then neither will Nigeria. There are countless examples of places around the world where women and girls are gaining power and autonomy, where the future looks brighter because women and girls are slowly wiping away the old gender norms. The impressive outpouring of support for the girls -- both within Nigerian communities and around the world -- is an encouraging sign that most people want the version of the future that empowered women and girls will create, not the version that Boko Haram is trying to impose. It doesn't help the Nigerian schoolgirls now, but thinking about the women and girls everywhere who are strong and getting stronger is one way to maintain some of the optimism that must go along with our collective impatience.

"Before his family urged him to flee the fighting in Syria, 17-year old Firas saw a bullet strike his sister in the head while they were in a car together. Maher, 16, has not seen his father for nearly two years, ever since he was detained and tortured alongside him before being released. These young boys, separated from loved ones, are among the many thousands of children who've escaped the shelling in their native Syria.  But they now face the daily hardships of refugee life in neighboring Lebanon and Jordan. Starting a new life away from the old comforts of home, many are growing up in fractured families and are often the household's main breadwinners, according to a report released Friday by the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR. Scarred by the horrors of war, they suffer from psychological distress, live alone or separated from their parents, receive no education or are thrown into illegal child labor, the agency said. ""Our lives are destroyed,"" the report quoted 14-year-old Nadia, a newly arrived refugee in Jordan. ""We are not being educated, and without education there is nothing. We're heading towards destruction."" Syria's ongoing conflict has torn countless families apart. Entire communities have been uprooted, scattering large populations within Syria and driving more than 2.2 million people into surrounding countries. Children have been particularly affected. In its first in-depth survey of Syrian refugee children since the conflict began in March 2011, UNHCR spoke to those now living in  Lebanon and Jordan.  But there are many others who fled to other countries such as Turkey and Iraq. The report found that more than 70,000 Syrian refugee families live without fathers and over 3,700 refugee children are either unaccompanied by or separated from both parents. In many cases, not only are their fathers absent, but many children have no idea where they are. ""If we do not act quickly, a generation of innocents will become lasting casualties of an appalling war,"" U.N. high commissioner for refugees Antonio Guterres said in a statement. Isolated and insecure . The report, entitled ""The Future of Syria -- Refugee Children in Crisis,"" paints the picture of a painful life -- one of isolation, exclusion and insecurity for many refugee children.  Scars are both emotional and physical. In Jordan's Za'atri camp, more than 1,000 children have been treated for war-related injuries over the past year. Anger and other emotional responses were also common, UNHCR said, adding that some refugee boys had expressed a desire to return to Syria to fight. Researchers also heard a report of boys being trained to fight in preparation for return to Syria, UNHCR said. Of the refugee children researchers interviewed, 29% said that they left their home once a week or less -- home is often a crammed apartment, a makeshift shelter or a tent. In many cases, refugee families lacking a financial income send their children to work, to survive. Abdallah, 13, said he wakes up every morning at 7 a.m. to buy dry bread from other refugees living in the Za'atri camp to help sustain his family. They then sell the bread to a Jordanian man who uses it to feed his animals. ""If people didn't work, how would they survive?"" the young boy said in a video released by UNHCR. ""I feel like a man because I am working. I put food on the table for my family."" In such tough conditions, there are more Syrian child refugees out of school than in. More than half of those in Jordan are not in school. In Lebanon, it is estimated that some 200,000 school-aged Syrian refugee children could remain out of school at the end of the year, UNHCR said. Many babies are also born in exile without birth certificates -- an essential document in the battle against statelessness. UNHCR says there are more than 1.1 million Syrian refugee children, most living in neighboring countries. ""The world must act to save a generation of traumatized, isolated and suffering syrian children from catastrophe,"" Angelina Jolie, UNHCR special envoy, who has worked to shine the spotlight on Syria's refugee crisis, said in a statement. Syria's conflict began after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement.  It has now become a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the fighting.

"There is a second confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome imported into the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday. Officials from the CDC and the Florida Department of Health are investigating. The first U.S. case was reported this month in Indiana. That patient was released from a hospital Friday into home isolation, according to state health officials. The Indiana patient was an American health care provider who had been working in Saudi Arabia and was on a planned visit to Indiana to see his family. The Florida patient is also a health care provider who lives and works in Saudi Arabia, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, assistant surgeon general with the U.S. Public Health Service and director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. However, the Florida case is not linked to the Indiana case, she said. The ""risk to the general public remains very low,"" Schuchat said. In some countries, the virus has spread from person to person, but only in close contact, such as a person who was caring for an ill person. ""This virus has not shown the ability to spread easily from person to person in community settings,"" she said. The 44-year-old Florida patient traveled on May 1 from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to London, then from London to Boston; Boston to Atlanta; and Atlanta to Orlando. MERS: 5 things to know . The man began feeling unwell on the flight from Jeddah, and continued feeling ill on subsequent flights, with symptoms including ""fever, chills and a slight cough,"" Schuchat said. On May 8, the man went to the emergency department of Orlando's Dr. P. Phillips Hospital. The hospital said the man is ""in good condition and continuing to improve."" Dr. Antonio Crespo, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital, said officials ""believe the risk of transmission from this patient is very low since his symptoms were mild and he was not coughing when he arrived at the hospital."" The man was visiting family and did not visit any theme parks in the Orlando area, said Dr. John Armstrong, Florida's state surgeon general and secretary of health. As in the Indiana case, officials were attempting to contact people -- in this case, more than 500 -- who may have come in contact with the person during travel, both in the United States and abroad. In addition, 16 staff members at Dr. P. Phillips Hospital have been notified of possible exposure and are being tested for the virus. Testing of people who have come in contact with the Indiana patient continues, and no additional cases have been seen, said Dr. Tom Frieden, CDC director. The CDC has dispatched a team to Saudi Arabia in conjunction with the WHO, Frieden said. MERS first emerged in 2012, with the first cases being diagnosed in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. As of Friday, there have been 538 cases in 17 countries, including 145 deaths, according to the WHO, said Schuchat. The virus is also known as MERS-CoV, since it is a coronavirus, the same group of viruses as the common cold. It attacks the respiratory system, according to the CDC. Symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure. Testing for MERS involves looking for the virus's molecular structure in a patient's nose or blood. While the patient in Indiana was the first MERS case on U.S. soil, the CDC has been preparing for such a scenario and had been conducting an awareness campaign with hospitals and doctors since MERS emerged. There are no travel restrictions to the Arabian Peninsula; however, the CDC suggests that people who visit there monitor their health and watch for any flu-like symptoms. If you do feel unwell after such a trip, be sure to tell your doctor about your travel. There is no vaccine or special treatment for MERS. Doctors say they believe the Indiana patient's quick diagnosis and care dramatically increased his chances for getting better. MERS mystery: Virus found in camels . No one knows exactly how this virus originated, but evidence implicating camels is emerging. In a recently published study in mBio, researchers said they isolated live MERS virus from two single-humped camels, known as dromedaries. They found multiple substrains in the camel viruses, including one that perfectly matches a substrain isolated from a human patient. The same group of researchers reported in February that nearly three-quarters of camels in Saudi Arabia tested positive for past exposure to the MERS coronavirus.","The patient traveled from Saudi Arabia to Florida on May 1 .

"Thousands of protesters surrounded Bangkok's Government House on Friday seeking the removal of Thailand's embattled caretaker government amid soaring political tensions following the ouster of former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The People's Democratic Reform Committee, which has been protesting the government since November, is pushing to replace the caretaker administration with an unelected interim government. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban told those gathered: ""We will sleep here tonight, we will eat here."" The PDRC has been seeking to rid Thai politics of the alleged influence of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin is Yingluck's brother and a telecommunications tycoon who was overthrown in a 2006 military coup. He has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction. ""If the speaker is a slave of Thaksin, there will be one treatment; if not, there will be another treatment for them,"" Thaugsuban said. Some 20,000 protesters massed in the capital and split into groups. About 4,000 or 5,000 gathered outside Government House. That is the former prime minister's residence, but Yingluck has already vacated it. Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, security adviser to the government, told CNN the PDRC had mobilized supporters from the countryside to join the protests in the capital. He said smaller groups also gathered at Bangkok television stations and other locations around the city. ""We are monitoring (the situation) closely,"" he said, adding that 60,000 security forces were on standby. At the Royal Thai Police Club, command center of the temporary security task force, the Center for the Administration for Peace and Order, police used tear gas and water cannon on protesters who attempted to enter the complex, said Paradon. Four people were injured. At Government House, stalls were erected and free food and drinks handed out to the protesters. The protest was peaceful, with music and dancing. A moment of silence was held for those killed in the country's longstanding political conflict. 'Judicial coup'? The rally comes at the end of a week of political chaos in Thailand, which saw Yingluck and nine Cabinet ministers removed from office by a top court on Wednesday in what her supporters saw as a ""judicial coup."" Her supporters plan their own mass rally on Saturday. Members of the National Anti-Corruption Committee unanimously indicted Yingluck, 46, on Thursday for dereliction of duty over her government's controversial rice subsidy scheme, committee member Wicha Mahakun told reporters in Bangkok. The Senate will now vote on whether to impeach her. Asked how that could impact her since she's already out as prime minister, Wicha said the case still needed to be reviewed by the Senate and that she could be banned from political office for five years, if impeached. Analysts had speculated the commission might also indict Yingluck's replacement as caretaker, the deputy prime minister and commerce minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan, creating a political vacuum. But Wicha did not announce any measures against the new head of government. An committee also considered whether to file criminal charges against Yingluck, but had not yet found sufficient evidence for that, he said. The rice subsidy program, introduced in 2011, pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crop, but has run into financial problems. Critics say it has wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters, hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it can't sell without losing money. Yingluck has previously said she was only in charge of developing policy around the scheme, not its day-to-day implementation, accusing the commission of unfair treatment. READ MORE: Yingluck denies corruption allegations over rice program . 'Political freefall' Analysts warn the week's developments could lead to more political turmoil and a resumption of violent clashes. ""The post-Yingluck polarization is likely to deepen and intensify,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. ""We are now looking at a political freefall. ... Much worse looks likely in the near term, before we can hope for improved circumstances in the longer term."" Officials confirmed Thursday a grenade had been thrown at the house of one of the Constitutional Court judges whose ruling forced Yingluck from office. Paradon told CNN nobody was hurt in the early morning attack on the home of the judge, Jumpot Kaimook. ""It landed on his garage,"" he said. The court removed Yingluck, who was elected in 2011 and had been serving as caretaker prime minister until elections could be held, after finding her guilty of violating the country's constitution for reassigning a senior security official. The official was replaced by the then national police chief, whose role in turn was given to Priewpan Damapong, a relative of Yingluck. Damapong is the brother of Thaksin's ex-wife. 'Polarization to intensify' Analyst Paul Quaglia, director at PQA Associates, a Bangkok-based risk assessment firm, said the court's removal of an elected prime minister on what he described as ""fairly weak"" grounds was viewed by the government's supporters as a case of politically motivated judicial overreach. ""They consider it a way to usurp democratic elections,"" he said. Yingluck is the third Thaksin-linked prime minister to be dismissed by the Constitutional Court, which also dissolved Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai political party in 2007, raising suspicions among government supporters that the institution was biased against them. Thitinan said the appointment of Niwatthamrong, seen as closely affiliated to Yingluck and her brother, was poor judgment, especially when another deputy prime minister, Pongthep Thepkanchana, would have been a more acceptable compromise candidate. ""He lacks the stature and networks to see through an interim caretaker administration,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, no matter who comes in as the new caretaker, the tensions will mount."" Widening divide . Thailand's widening political divide pits anti-government, predominantly urban ""yellow shirt"" protesters against the pro-government, mainly rural and working class ""red shirts."" The anti-government protesters, drawn mainly from Bangkok's middle class, royalist establishment, allege that Yingluck is her brother's puppet and seek to rid Thai politics of her family's influence. Led by the PDRC, they began their protests in November, outraged by her government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for the return of Thaksin to the political fray in earnest. Parliament was then dissolved in December ahead of a snap February general election that was disrupted by anti-government protesters, and subsequently ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court. The protesters are seeking a new government -- but not through elections, which the opposition Democrat Party has boycotted, arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held. ""They claim the Thaksin clan as they call (it) is corrupt and has dominated the country's politics, and the only way forward is to remove the Thaksin influence from politics and not have elections,"" said Quaglia. Suthep, a former deputy prime minister for the Democrat Party, has instead called for power to be transferred to an unelected ""people's council."" But Quaglia said the opposition's real motivation for avoiding elections was clear. ""The Democrat Party say 'No, we can't have elections,' because they know they will lose those elections."" In contrast, the red shirt supporters of Yingluck and her brother, many of whom hail from the north and northeast of the country, accuse the court of bias against their side. PDRC spokesman Akanat Phrompan told CNN his movement did not recognize the legitimacy of the caretaker government. ""Currently there is no government to govern this country, so we must find a way to appoint a new government."" 'Breaking point' Meanwhile, the red shirts are planning their own rally in Bangkok Saturday to protest what Quaglia said they saw as ""a judicial coup."" In the wake of the court's ruling Wednesday, supporters at the red shirts' Bangkok headquarters were defiant. ""This is the breaking point now, everything is leading up to the breaking point,"" Kanthira Ketawandee, a Bangkok piano teacher and Yingluck supporter told CNN. ""I would say Yingluck has died (in) her duty for democracy."" Thida Thavornset, a red shirt leader urged supporters to join Saturday's rally. ""We won't give up until we win."" Elections are scheduled for July 20, but Thitinan said he believed it was ""unlikely"" that a vote would proceed in the wake of recent developments. ""The PDRC appears intent on pressing on for an appointment government of its preference, which can only galvanize red shirt protests,"" he said. ""A showdown is looming.""","Officials expect up to 60,000 at the anti-government rally .

"In a yet another audio recording, Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling purportedly explains why he infamously told a woman not to bring black people to his games: He was jealous that she was with black men. The recording released Friday -- the second in two days unveiled by RadarOnline.com -- allegedly reveals Sterling trying to add context to racist comments that got him banned from the NBA last month. That context, he purportedly says, was that he was trying to sleep with the woman he was talking to. ""The girl is black. I like her. I'm jealous that she's with other black guys. I want her. So what the hell, can I in private tell her, you know, 'I don't want you to be with anybody'?"" the man purported to be Sterling says in the new tape, according to RadarOnline. ""I'm trying to have sex with her. I'm trying to play with her,"" the man also says. ""You know, if you (are trying) to have sex with a girl and you're talking with her privately, you don't think anybody's there. You may say anything in the world. What difference does it make? ""Then if the girl tapes it and releases it, my God, it's awful."" The new recording is of a phone conversation between Sterling and an unidentified person, made after the controversy over racist comments erupted last month, RadarOnline said. CNN's attempts to verify with Sterling's representatives that he is on the tape were not immediately successful. Sterling, an 80-year-old married lawyer and billionaire real-estate investor, has not released a public statement since celebrity gossip website TMZ posted a 10-minute audio recording in which he chastised a woman named V. Stiviano for posting pictures of her posing with African-Americans, including basketball Hall of Famer Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. Sterling made the comments during an argument with Stiviano, 31, on April 9, according to TMZ. ""In your lousy f***ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" he says. ""If it's white people, it's OK?"" responds Stiviano, who is part African-American, according to the recording. ""If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?"" Although the latest recording claims that Sterling was jealous, the tapes released last month by TMZ purportedly reveal Sterling being OK with Stiviano sleeping with black men. Referring to Johnson, Sterling purportedly said: ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games."" Sterling also said, according to TMZ: ""You can sleep with (black people). You can bring them in; you can do whatever you want.  The little I ask you is not to promote it on that ... and not to bring them to my games."" One apparent source of friction, according to the pair on the TMZ tapes, was the man's view that she ""was perceived as either a Latina or a white girl,"" and that people were calling him with negative reactions to her pictures with black people. ""People call you and tell you that I have black people on my Instagram, and it bothers you,"" the woman said. ""Yeah, it bothers me a lot if you want to ... broadcast that you're associating with black people. Do you have to?"" the man TMZ identified as Sterling responded. The TMZ release triggered a firestorm that led to Sterling's lifetime ban from the NBA and a $2.5 million fine. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has asked the other 29 owners to force Sterling, the longest-tenured owner in the league, to sell the Clippers. More from Friday's tape: 'I know I'm wrong' In the new tape, the man RadarOnline identifies as Sterling says he was wrong. ""I know I'm wrong, what I said was wrong. But I never thought a private conversation would go anywhere out to the public,"" the man says. ""I didn't want her to bring anybody to my game because I was jealous. I mean, I'm being honest,"" he continues. In a recording that RadarOnline released Thursday -- again featuring someone it says is Sterling talking to an unidentified man -- Sterling allegedly denies he's a racist. ""You think I'm a racist?"" a man purported to be Sterling says. ""You think I have anything in the world but love for everybody? You don't think that. You know I'm not a racist."" A second man in that tape says, ""they're trying to force you to sell."" ""You can't force someone to sell property in America,"" Sterling purportedly says. ""Well, I'm a lawyer; that's my opinion."" The matter of the team's sale is with the NBA's Advisory/Finance Committee, which met Wednesday in a conference call. Members discussed the ""termination of Mr. Sterling's ownership of the team,"" the NBA said in a news release. The committee will meet again next week, the statement said. If the case proceeds to a full vote, 75% of the owners would have to approve the forced sale. Wife wants to retain her ownership share . However, an attorney for Donald Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, said Friday on CNN's ""Situation Room"" that she wants to keep her 50% stake in the team and they have been talking by phone with NBA officials. ""She wants to remain a passive owner,"" said attorney Pierce O'Donnell. ""She's not going to want to manage the team. She's going to want a very skilled, professional, well-heeled new owner to come in and replace Donald,"" O'Donnell said. ""She only wants to own the team in her lifetime. She's 79-years-old. At this point, she's earned it. She's been an owner for 33 years, and she's an avid fan."" Technically, the team is now owned by the Sterling family's trust, with Donald and Shelly Sterling serving as co-trustees. Their two children are named as beneficiaries. During a news conference announcing Sterling's lifetime ban, the NBA's Silver was asked whether there would be sanctions against Shelly Sterling. ""No, there have been no decisions about other members of the Sterling family, and I should say that this ruling applies specifically to Donald Sterling and Donald Sterling's conduct only,"" Silver said. Shelly Sterling hasn't done anything wrong and will fight any effort to try to force her to sell her stake in the team, O'Donnell said. She has not violated the ""the bylaws and constitution of the NBA,"" he said. ""...The last thing I saw that being a wife of a reviled co-owner is not one of them."" He described the calls by fans and players to force his client to sell her share as ""mob psychology."" ""I think it's preposterous to think that players under contract who make tens of millions of dollars a year are going to boycott because a 79-year-old woman, a passive owner of the team who doesn't manager, is sitting in the stands,"" O'Donnell said. ""It's ridiculous."" O'Donnell said Shelly Sterling has denounced her husband's comments. The Sterlings have not lived together for more than a year. Shelly Sterling is ""weighing her options"" as to whether she wants a divorce, O'Donnell said. He also said she categorically denied making any racist statements, as alleged in court documents filed when the couple was sued for discrimination at their apartment buildings. O'Donnell said those allegations were retracted, and the court ultimately decided in favor of the Sterlings. Although her husband is banned from NBA arenas, Shelly Sterling has attended some of the Clippers playoff games since the scandal unfolded.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Art Capital Group has withdrawn its lawsuit against celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz and extended the due date for repayment of her $24 million loan, the two sides announced Friday. Annie Leibovitz appears before her photo of Demi Moore during an exhibition of her work in June in Madrid, Spain. It is part of an agreement reached between Leibovitz and Art Capital Group, which restructured her debts, according to a joint statement from the two sides. Under the agreement, Art Capital also agreed to extend the maturity date for the loan it provided to Leibovitz, which was originally due on Tuesday. The statement did not say when the loan is now due. In addition, Leibovitz bought back from Art Capital the rights to act as exclusive agent in the sale of her pictures and her property, the statement said. ""Ms. Leibovitz will therefore retain control of those assets within the context of the loan agreement which shall prevail until satisfied,"" it said. Art Capital Group said Leibovitz initially approached the company, an adviser to artists and art owners, around June 2008 regarding her ""dire financial condition arising from ... mortgage obligations, tax liens and unpaid bills to service providers and other creditors,"" the complaint said . In July, Art Capital filed a complaint with the New York Supreme Court, asking it to uphold the sales agreement it signed with Leibovitz, including its right to sell her art and real estate. Leibovitz, who has photographed everyone from the Rolling Stones to Queen Elizabeth, put her art, intellectual property and even real estate assets up for collateral last year when she consolidated her massive debts. ""In these challenging times, I am appreciative to Art Capital for all they have done to resolve this matter and for their cooperation and continued support,"" Leibovitz said in the joint statement. ""I also want to thank my family, friends, and colleagues for being there for me and look forward to concentrating on my work."" The tone of the agreement differed markedly from that of a complaint filed July 29 in New York Supreme Court by Art Capital Group, in which the company accused the photographer of ""willful and flagrant"" breaches of her agreement, adding: ""It appears that Leibovitz entered into the sales agreement with no intention of performing or permitting performance under it."" One of Leibovitz's best-known photos is of John Lennon with his wife, Yoko Ono, shortly before the Beatles star was assassinated in 1980. She is no stranger to controversy. In 1991, Leibovitz photographed a nude and extremely pregnant Demi Moore for the cover of Vanity Fair. The issue, considered scandalous at the time, was sold in many places nationwide with a sheath of white paper.  Watch more about the suit she faced, controversy she's stirred » .

"On Wednesday, when New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. told his staff that he had dismissed executive editor Jill Abramson, he cited an ""issue with management in the newsroom"" and said he wouldn't get into the details. On Saturday, he concluded that he had to -- and he sent a detailed 475-word statement to the press that listed Abramson's shortcomings. The unsparing statement came after days of news reports that questioned whether Abramson was the victim of sexism. Allies of Abramson told The New Yorker that she had spoken up after finding out that she'd been paid less than her predecessor in the job, Bill Keller. On Saturday, Sulzberger acknowledged that her firing had been ""cast by many as an example of the unequal treatment of women in the workplace."" ""Rather than accepting that this was a situation involving a specific individual who, as we all do, has strengths and weaknesses, a shallow and factually incorrect storyline has emerged,"" Sulzberger said. He asserted that her total ""pay package"" -- not just her salary, but stock and other compensation -- ""was comparable with Bill Keller's; in fact, by her last full year as executive editor, it was more than 10 percent higher than his."" Then he listed what he said were the management issues that led him to abruptly replace her with Dean Baquet, who had been managing editor for news. The statement came as a surprise because until Saturday, it appeared that both sides had agreed not to speak publicly about her departure. ""Jill is an outstanding journalist and editor, but with great regret, I concluded that her management of the newsroom was simply not working out,"" Sulzberger said in the statement. ""During her tenure, I heard repeatedly from her newsroom colleagues, women and men, about a series of issues, including arbitrary decision-making, a failure to consult and bring colleagues with her, inadequate communication and the public mistreatment of colleagues."" Sulzberger said he ""warned her"" that she ""risked losing the trust of both masthead and newsroom"" if she did not improve. ""She acknowledged that there were issues and agreed to try to overcome them."" The Times reported earlier this week that Abramson had retained a consultant to ""help her with her management style."" Sulzberger said ""it became clear, however, that the gap was too big to bridge and ultimately I concluded that she had lost the support of her masthead colleagues and could not win it back."" He did not specify when this became clear. He reportedly met with Baquet and listened to concerns about Abramson earlier this month. Through a spokeswoman, Sulzberger declined a followup interview request on Saturday. Abramson has not responded to interview requests since Wednesday.

"It seemed as if billionaire Donald Sterling apparently didn't have enough money left after buying apartments, cars and dresses for V. Stiviano to pay for appropriate legal or communications advice before his exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. We don't know for sure, but that's the only conclusion one can draw from the Los Angeles Clippers owner's disastrous attempt at exoneration that aired Monday night on ""AC 360."" Sterling broke just about every rule of crisis communications during his taped and edited interview with Cooper, starting with issuing an obviously half-hearted apology for his racially offensive remarks surreptitiously recorded by Stiviano during a private discussion. Channeling Richard Nixon, Sterling three times declared unconvincingly ""I am not a racist,"" when fumbling for an explanation for why he ranted in an audio recording about his disapproval of Stiviano being seen with black men at Clippers home basketball games. ""Twenty-five percent of my whole game are black people and I love them. I can't explain some of the stupid, foolish uneducated words that I uttered."" Opinion: Sterling apology was an epic fail . The interview went downhill from there, with Sterling rambling from subject to subject, with no apparent goal except to somehow look sympathetic to viewers. Obviously he failed. Here are some of the most important rules of crisis communications he broke during his time on camera: . 1. Apologize sincerely, then move on to say what you are doing to ensure the transgression never happens again. Announce that you are entering rehabilitation, meeting with the group you have offended to make amends or taking sensitivity training. But you must demonstrate that you are taking concrete steps to correct your future behavior. Sterling apologized to his 29 fellow NBA franchise owners and to Commissioner Adam Silver, yet he neglected to say what he would do to improve. 2. Make a sacrifice. Whether you are wealthy or not, you must give something up as a gesture of your commitment to seek forgiveness from the people you have offended. If you offend the African-American community, a generous contribution of money and your personal time to an inner-city charity may be in order. If you offend a religious group, a donation to a church or charitable group is appropriate. And the bigger the offense, the larger the gift should be. In Sterling's case, we're probably talking millions of dollars and hundreds of hours. 3. Ask forgiveness of those whom you have offended. Sterling assumed that NBA players, owners, fans and everyone in America would understand his plight and give him a pass because he is a well-intentioned 80-year-old billionaire with a big mouth. He skipped a major step when he forgot to even ask. 4. Never blame others for the crisis you have created. First, Sterling claimed Stiviano baited him into making his racially offensive comments. Then he said she wasn't really a bad person and moved on to gratuitously criticize NBA Hall of Famer, philanthropist and businessman Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson. ""What does he do for the black people? He doesn't do anything. He acts so holy. He made love to every girl in every city in America and he had AIDS,"" Sterling said. ""Is he an example to children? Because he has money, he is able to treat himself. ... He should fade into the background."" With these statements, Sterling created another crisis for himself and for the NBA. 5. Never blame the news media. Sterling claimed that NBA players and owners still like him and that he has received ""thousands of phone calls"" of support from friends and colleagues. Who then is attacking the Clippers owner for his remarks? ""It's the media that's out to get me,"" Sterling said. Cooper and every other journalist watching the interview or seeing the news reports afterward is now his foe, whether or not they were before he made that comment. Appearing on CNN immediately after the jaw-dropping interview, African-American film maker Spike Lee perhaps captured it best for all communications experts when he said of Sterling: ""Why do they let him speak? Who's around him?"" Who indeed.","Gene Grabowski: Did anybody counsel Donald Sterling on how to behave in interview?

"Under withering criticism, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki told a Senate committee on Thursday that he was ""mad as hell"" about allegations of deadly waiting times and coverup at VA hospitals but he doesn't plan to resign. The retired Army general faced angry legislators and then aggressive journalists with a consistent message, arguing it was too soon to cast blame and vowing decisive action if an inspector general's investigation finds proof that VA workers manipulated waiting lists to cover up long delays for veterans seeking health care. Last month, CNN revealed that at least 40 veterans died waiting for appointments at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system, according to sources inside the hospital and a doctor who worked there. Many were placed on a secret waiting list, the sources said. A fatal wait: Veterans languish and die on a VA hospital's secret list . Since November, CNN has uncovered delays in care at VA facilities across the country where numerous VA staffers have stepped forward to allege dangerously long wait times and efforts by agency officials to cover them up. Calls for dismissal . Critics cite reports and complaints of excessive waits for care going back several years, with some calling for Shinseki's resignation or dismissal over the continuing and allegedly worsening problems. President Barack Obama has so far backed Shinseki, but he appointed a top aide on Wednesday to work with the embattled Cabinet secretary to review the situation. At his first congressional hearing since the CNN reports drew national attention to the issue, Shinseki told the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee that he was reviewing all VA operations and also cooperating fully with the independent inspector general's investigation. ""Any allegation, any adverse incident like this makes me mad as hell,"" he said, urging the legislators to wait for the investigation's finding before trying to resolve a complex set of problems. His assurance that ""we will act"" on any substantiated allegation angered senators from both parties who insisted the problems are real and need immediate action. Some pointed to a policy implemented by Shinseki that set a 14-day limit to provide care for veterans applying for the first time, saying a deadline they labeled as unworkable resulted in VA administrators devising ways to cover up months-long delays. Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina questioned why Shinseki, who has been Obama's only veterans affairs secretary, failed to act sooner on problems long cited by veterans, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and others. ""With the numerous GAO, IG and Office of Medical Inspector reports that have been released, VA senior leadership, including the secretary, should have been aware that VA was facing a national scheduling crisis,"" Burr said. ""VA's leadership has either failed to connect the dots or failed to address this ongoing crisis, which has resulted in patient harm and patient death."" Demands to fix the problem . Shinseki labeled possible links between long waits and veteran deaths as allegations, and acting inspector general Richard Griffin said  nothing his investigation has found so far proves a causal relationship. ""It's one thing to be on a waiting list, and it's another thing to conclude that as a result of being on the waiting list, that's the cause death,"" he said. His assistant, Dr. John Daigh, said frequent delays occurred, as well as deficient quality standards that caused patient harm in some cases. ""But to draw the conclusion between patient harm and death has so far been a tenuous connection,"" Daigh told the committee. The hearing touched on deeper policy and political ramifications involving veterans affairs, with Republicans seeking to target Shinseki for failing to take action while some Democrats emphasized the increasing health care demands of veterans that lag behind funding levels. At the same time, Democrats also called for a thorough probe of what was going on and immediate changes to fix the problems. Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut urged Shinseki to include law enforcement agencies in the current investigation because of ""evidence, not allegations,"" that records were falsified in scheduling practices described by some as ""cooking the books."" Later, Griffin told the panel that federal prosecutors are working with his investigation. He said his office intends to complete its report no later than August. When Committee Chairman Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont asked Shinseki if ""cooking the books"" was a problem in the VA health system, the secretary said: ""I'm not aware, other than in a number of isolated cases"" that there was evidence of that. Shinseki says overall VA is good . Overall, Shinseki said, the VA system is good and he advised waiting for the inspector general's report before legislating solutions, a position backed by Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Senate's majority Democrats. Shinseki has put three employees, including two senior executives, on administrative leave at the request of the Inspector General's office, but some members of Congress and the American Legion have called for his resignation or dismissal. Asked at one point if he should resign, Shinseki said caring for fellow American veterans was a mission, not a job, and he intended to continue working until he achieves his goal of improved care ""or I am told by my commander in chief that my time has been served."" In appointing White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors to assist Shinseki in reviewing what happened, Obama said he asked Shinseki to review ""practices to ensure better access to care."" ""While we get to the bottom of what happened in Phoenix, it's clear the VA needs to do more to ensure quality care for our veterans,"" Obama said. Shinseki said he welcomed the perspective of Nabors. Republicans went after Shinseki at the hearing and from the floor of the full chamber. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell questioned if the VA problems were part of a ""systematic, administration-wide crisis."" First on CNN: An 'angered and saddened' Shinseki to testify . The most disturbing and striking problems emerged in Arizona last month as inside sources revealed to CNN details of a secret waiting list for veterans at the Phoenix VA. After Phoenix, allegations emerge nationwide . But even as the Phoenix VA's problems have gained national attention, numerous whistleblowers from other VA hospitals across the country have stepped forward in recent weeks. They described similar delays in care for veterans and also varying schemes by officials at those facilities to hide the delays -- in some cases even falsify records or ""cook the books."" The secret waiting list in Phoenix was part of an elaborate scheme designed by Veterans Affairs managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources who spoke exclusively to CNN. ""The scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the VA's own internal rules,"" said Dr. Sam Foote, a 24-year Phoenix VA physician who just retired this year and who appeared in an interview for the first time on CNN last month. The VA requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner, typically within 14 to 30 days. Phoenix VA officials ""developed the secret waiting list,"" said Foote. He told CNN that the elaborate scheme in Phoenix involved shredding evidence to hide the long list of veterans waiting for appointments and care. Foote and the other sources said officials at the VA instructed their staff to not actually make doctor's appointments for veterans within the computer system. Instead, Foote said, when a veteran is seeking an appointment, ""they enter information into the computer and do a screen capture hard copy printout. They then do not save what was put into the computer so there's no record that you were ever here,"" he said. According to Foote and the sources, the information was gathered on the secret electronic list and then the information that would show when veterans first began waiting for an appointment was actually destroyed. ""That hard copy, if you will, that has the patient demographic information is then taken and placed onto a secret electronic waiting list, and then the data that is on that paper is shredded,"" Foote said. ""So the only record that you have ever been there requesting care was on that secret list,"" he said. ""And they wouldn't take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than 14 days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times, when in fact they were not."" From the Phoenix VA officials: Denials of a list . Phoenix VA officials denied any knowledge of a secret list, and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times. They acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there, but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans may have died. The number of veterans who died recently waiting for care in Phoenix is at least 40, said Foote and the sources. At Thursday's hearing, however, Griffin said lists compiled so far by investigators indicated 17 such deaths. Months before revelations of what happened Phoenix came to light, CNN had reported about other veterans who died or were injured while waiting for care at different VA hospitals.

"The Islamist terrorist organization Boko Haram has been active as a violent group since 2009 and in recent months has killed Nigerians, both Christian and Muslim, at rates frequently exceeding a hundred people weekly. It is puzzling how little attention this has received in world media, especially in comparison to, say, the attack of Islamist militants on the mall in Kenya in September, resulting in 67 dead. That is, until now. The abduction of a reported 276 schoolgirls from Chibok village in the northeastern Borno state has shocked people around the world. A deeper examination of Boko Haram provides a revealing prism of the conflict in Nigeria. Boko Haram translates as ""Western education is sin."" Rarely has the name of a terrorist organization revealed so much, but it does in ways beyond the surface interpretations sometimes portrayed in the media. In Boko Haram, we see a total storm coming together: Globalization has brought Western ideas and imagery, especially around issues of women and sexuality, into the most patriarchal corners of the world. Globalization, through Internet and broader interconnectedness, has facilitated and favored global ideologies, including globalized versions of Islam, some of which are extremist. Melinda Gates: Boko Haram kidnaps a nation . New media have shined a light on poor governance, including that of the corrupt Nigerian government. The impact of Wahhabi Islam, actively promoted by Saudis and Gulf Arabs, has had such an impact that in northern Nigeria, even Arabic street signs and Middle Eastern dress are seen together with Saudi-funded mosques. But Boko Haram's rise is not only driven by global trends in themselves but by how globalization has melded with the internal dynamics of Nigerian education. The Christian South in Nigeria is much more prosperous than the Muslim North, and that economic gap is growing rapidly. The roots go back to the British colonial period from the late 19th century to independence in 1960. The British ruled the South directly, which was also being rapidly Christianized by missionaries. Missionaries ran many of the schools. Malala: Kidnapped girls are 'my sisters' In the Muslim North, the British practiced ""indirect rule,"" governing through the clerical and traditional elites and allowing local religious institutions to operate autonomously (with some limitations, for example, banning slavery). The impact of missionary schooling was to bring Western education into Nigeria, and this has had direct bearing on economic development for the regions where such schools predominated -- and this legacy is with us to this day. Access to Western-style education has been key for enabling people to adapt to a modern economy. In the north, some missionary schools were established, but traditional elites always resisted them for obvious religious reasons and because those schools threatened to generate an alternative elite. Instead, the schooling that predominates in the north of Nigeria consists of religious schools, or the al-Majiri education system -- often informal, with students congregating under a tree. These students are completely unequipped to work in a changing economy (and overall, Nigeria is economically growing rapidly). Some of these schools have dubious teachers who exploit the usually impoverished students by getting them to beg in the streets for the teachers' own gain. John Sutter: 'We can't let this be the new normal' In the wake of September 11, there was extensive discussion of Muslim schools and the extent to which some were inculcating extremism, for example madrassas in Pakistan. Some have claimed that Muslim education, properly taught, would provide an inoculation against extremism. But that debate lost sight of a larger issue, whatever the theology of such schools. The graduates of those schools are often adrift in globalized economies without marketable skills and modern education, and more vulnerable to at least tolerating extremism. Which brings us back to the language of Boko Haram. The leadership has ranted against any form of secular education. It teaches that European colonists introduced modern secular education into Islamic societies in a conspiracy to maintain colonialist hegemony over Muslim societies: The West aims to corrupt pure Islamic morals with liberal norms. Likewise, the leaders believe that the West wants to replace proper gender roles with sexual permissiveness. Secular subjects like chemistry, physics, engineering, meteorological explanations of rain, the theory of evolution are all denounced as contrary to the Quran. In our research in the area, and in other surveys, it is evident that students coming out of the religious schools are more likely to sympathize with Boko Haram, significantly even those who are not particularly religious in practice. Equally significantly, religiosity as such does not necessarily bring with it a tendency to back Boko Haram. The issue is the education system, not religious belief. In the eyes of Boko Haram, the abduction of schoolgirls is a triple strike against what they view as Western depravity: against Western schools, against ""the obscenity"" of having girls in school at all and against Christianity, to the degree the schoolgirls are Christian. If northern Nigeria is to have a more stable and prosperous long-term future, it is essential to develop an education system that prepares students for a modern, globalized economy. This is especially the case in the northeast, where Boko Haram is most active. Nigerians in northeastern Nigeria, who in part may sympathize with Boko Haram's fight against corruption, are however alienated by Boko Haram's bloodlust. And most will support developing an education system that provides the foundation to make a living.","Boko Haram has killed hundreds of Nigerians each month .

"Some veterans injured in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan are being made to wait for months in the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System despite a national mandate they be given priority access to medical care, a VA doctor told CNN. Dr. Katherine Mitchell, medical director of the Phoenix VA's post-deployment clinic, outlined the allegations in a report that aired Wednesday night on CNN's ""AC 360°."" She accused the Phoenix VA -- up until at least three weeks ago -- of not following a mandate that the highest priority be given to new or injured veterans for scheduling appointments. Wait lists in Phoenix for veterans injured in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan can be ""six months, nine months or longer,"" Mitchell said. ""People that are 100% service-connected that are polytrauma were waiting anywhere from six to 10 months to get into a new appointment when I found out about 'em,"" she said. ""We're talking about people that were injured by being blown up by IEDs. We're talking about people who had a mental breakdown and have severe PTSD and ...are having trouble functioning."" Mitchell told CNN that in some instances because of those wait times, case managers in her clinic and patient advocates ask: ""This guy can't wait. Can you see him?"" The doctor said she reported the alleged practice to the VA's Office of the Inspector General. The VA did not directly respond to Mitchell's allegations, referring CNN instead to the testimony of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki before a Senate committee looking into the allegations: ""It is important to allow OIG's independent and objective review to proceed until completion, and OIG has advised VA against providing information that could potentially compromise their ongoing review."" Mitchell's claims are the latest in a rapidly unfolding scandal amid allegations of scheduling tricks and secret lists to hide monthslong waits for care. These accusations have mushroomed since CNN first reported the problem in November in an investigation examining several VA hospitals. Read the story that helped expose the problem . The most disturbing problems emerged at the Phoenix VA, with sources revealing details of a secret waiting list. According to the sources, at least 40 American veterans died while waiting for care at the VA there. The allegations have been followed by news of investigations at more than two dozen facilities across the nation. The problem, according to Mitchell, has to do with the VA not having enough medical providers to care for veterans. There are a few reasons for this, she said: low pay, lack of qualified professionals applying to work at the VA and a slow hiring process. ""As a result, you've got a lot of patients and not enough providers,"" she said. ""It's not just Phoenix VA. It's across the country, which is why everyone is hiding a backlog."" Mitchell's allegations came the same day President Barack Obama vowed to hold accountable anyone who manipulated or falsified records at VA facilities. He also said he was sending his deputy chief of staff, Rob Nabors, to visit the Phoenix facility and interview the VA office's interim director.

"Actor Michael Jace has been formally charged with one count of murder with a gun in the shooting death of his wife, the prosecutor's spokeswoman said Thursday. April Jace, 40, died from ""multiple gunshot wounds,"" according to preliminary autopsy results. The death was ruled a homicide by the Los Angeles County coroner, Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. Jace, 51, made his first appearance in a Los Angeles courtroom Thursday afternoon. Bail was set at $2 million, and his arraignment was continued until June 18 at the defense's request. ""He's doing as well as somebody who is in custody,"" said Jason Sias, Jace's lawyer.  ""It's emotional. He wants to see this through. He's just thinking about his children."" Los Angeles police detectives presented their evidence against Jace, who played a Los Angeles cop in TV's ""The Shield,"" to the district attorney Thursday morning, according to spokeswoman Jane Robison. Police found April Jace shot to death in her south Los Angeles home Monday night, Det. Lyman Doster said. Michael Jace called  911 to report that his wife had been shot, Det. Dean Vinluan said, adding that he ""was on the phone with the operator."" Neighbors who heard gunshots also called 911, he said. ""At this moment, the motive of the murder is believed to be domestic violence,"" a police statement this week said. Investigators detained Jace at the couple's Hyde Park-area home Monday night and booked the actor on a homicide charge early Tuesday, according to Doster. Two children were in the home when their mother was shot, Vinluan said. The children, whose ages he would not reveal, were taken to a police station and then handed over to a representative of California's Department of Children and Family Services, he said. Investigators have found no reports of domestic violence between the husband and wife at their south Los Angeles residence, another LAPD detective said. A woman described as a close friend of Jace's first wife said in a sworn statement that she witnessed Jace physically abusing his wife in 1997. The declaration was in court records from Jace's 2005 custody case concerning his son with Jennifer Bitterman. Jace ""choked and hit"" his wife and ""slammed her against the wall while (their infant son) screamed in his crib next to her,"" Maria De Le Vegas said in the sworn declaration obtained by CNN. Jace ""was raging and out of control, and seeing the extent of his anger was one of the most terrifying things I have ever seen,"" she said. Jace appeared to be suffering severe financial strain in recent years, according to court documents obtained by CNN.  The actor filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2011, citing $500,000 in debts and an annual income of around $80,000 from residuals from his TV and film work, the documents said. Jace had defaulted on the $411,000 mortgage on the south Los Angeles home where his wife died, according to the documents. He married April Jace in June 2003, a year after divorcing his first wife, with whom he shared a son who is now a teen. The FX police drama ""The Shield"" was the biggest and longest-running role in Jace's 22-year acting career. He appeared in 89 episodes as Julien Lowe, who started as a rookie officer in an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct in 2002 and rose through the ranks to become a detective before the series ended in 2008, according to the Internet Movie Database. He acted on several episodes of ""Southland,"" another TV drama about Los Angeles police, between 2009 and 2012. Jace often played a law enforcement or military officer on television shows. He is credited with roles in ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"" ""Private Practice,"" ""The Mentalist,"" ""Burn Notice"" and ""NYPD Blue."" He had the title role of Michael Jordan in the 1999 TV movie about the NBA star, ""Michael Jordan: An American Hero."" Jace played Officer Brown in Russell Crowe's 2009 film ""State of Play,"" and he portrayed a Black Panther member in the 1994 blockbuster movie ""Forrest Gump."" April Jace had worked for the past year as a financial aid counselor at Biola University, a private school in La Mirada, California, according to the school. ""We are obviously shocked and saddened by this terrible news, to lose a wonderful colleague, mother and friend,"" Biola President Barry Corey said in a written statement. ""April's radiant personality brought great energy to the financial aid office,"" financial aid director Geoff Marsh said. ""Her love for helping students and families and her great work ethic earned the respect and love of her coworkers. Her smiling face and helpful spirit will be missed by all.""

"Donald Sterling wants a second chance. While most people want him to take his ball and go home, the embattled Los Angeles Clippers owner told CNN that he hopes for forgiveness from his fellow NBA owners -- and the people he has offended. But why not walk away from a league that has banned him and is trying to force him to sell his team? ""I want to show all of the people that are associated with basketball and the world I'm not a racist,"" he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" in an exclusive interview, the second part of which aired Wednesday evening. In Wednesday's portion of the 80-minute interview, Sterling also touched on the subject of racism, saying he doesn't think that it is that bad in the United States. He thinks Americans deal with race relations better than other countries. ""I don't see it. I'm not an African-American,"" the 80-year-old lawyer and billionaire real estate investor, said. ""You know, take Judaism ... I don't think the Jews have any problem. I mean there's a couple of people that they killed that are Jews coming out of a synagogue."" He apparently was making a reference to the shootings at two Jewish centers near Kansas City, Missouri, last month. Sterling used working with other lawyers as an example of when he doesn't think race is a barrier. He judges other attorneys by their work, he told Cooper. ""I wouldn't think he (a black attorney) was any different than a white lawyer. ... I think America has worked well with that. Maybe not as well as the African-Americans would like, but I'm a Jew. I watch what's going on with us, too. ""I think it's better than it's ever been. Doesn't mean there isn't anti-Semitism, there is ... a lot of it, especially in the South. But it doesn't matter."" Sterling repeatedly apologized and denied accusations that he's racist, claiming he'd been ""baited"" into making what he called ""terrible"" remarks by his friend V. Stiviano. In the recording, which drew widespread condemnation from fans, players and the league after it appeared on TMZ, Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures online of her posing with African-Americans, including NBA legend Magic Johnson. He tells her not to bring Johnson to Clippers games. Sterling insists he's no racist, still slams Magic Johnson . ""Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me,"" he said. Sterling told Cooper he has pledged millions to minority causes. ""I support minorities, God has been so good to me,"" he said. ""I'm so lucky, and so I want to give, and that's what my life is all about. Giving and helping wherever I can."" The man who has owned the Clippers since 1981 told Cooper that he is taking a wait-and-see approach as a committee of 10 NBA owners meets each week to discuss forcing him to sell the team. Sterling wants to convince all his fellow owners he is sorry for making racist remarks to Stiviano that were posted on TMZ, a celebrity gossip website. ""I'm apologizing and I'm asking for forgiveness,"" he said. ""Am I entitled to one mistake? After 35 years. I mean, I love my league, I love my partners. ... It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again."" He called his punishment -- a lifetime ban from the NBA and a $2.5 million fine -- ""a little bit harsh,"" but wondered if one day he could be back as an active owner of the Clippers. Cooper asked him how that could happen. ""I don't know. I guess I have to, you know, look into the heart,"" Sterling said. ""You know and maybe give me a chance. Give me another chance."" ""Maybe it's fair,"" Sterling said about the punishment. ""I mean, for all of the aggravation, all of the embarrassment, all the humiliation I caused them."" Magic Johnson: I'm going to pray for Sterling . Player walkout not a concern for Sterling . Sterling said he thinks that if he is able to keep his team, he won't have to worry about an NBA players strike next season. ""That's talk, the media pushes that,"" the banned owner told Cooper. ""Why would they do that? If they get their salaries, they're going to play."" The idea of a league-wide walkout gained traction for a few hours Wednesday when the vice president of the National Basketball Players Association, Roger Mason Jr., told a Showtime cable network show that LeBron James might lead a strike if Sterling is still the controlling owner of the franchise when the new season begins in the fall. Mason clarified his earlier statement, telling CNN: ""I was using LeBron as an example as I talk about many of our players in our league.  We unified and we're united, and we want to do what's right."" Sterling's claims vs. reality . Mason said he was referring to remarks by James that people like Sterling have no place in the league. James himself told Rachel Nichols of CNN and TNT that the players are pleased with the league office. ""The direction Adam (Silver) is going and the NBA is going, there shouldn't be a need for (a strike),"" he told Nichols. ""We trust those guys, and we know that they're going to take care of what needs to be done for our league, and we understand that it's not going to be tomorrow."" The NBA advisory committee is still discussing the matter of a forced sale and no vote has been taken. Three-quarters of the league's Board of Governors, representatives of each of the other 29 ownership groups, would have to vote to terminate the Sterlings ownership. Sterling told Cooper that people have the wrong impression of him. He's not a monster who deserves to lose his team, he said. ""What am I, a Frankenstein? What am I, some kind of an ogre?"" he asked. ""I'm a good person, I'm a warm person. I say hello to everybody who comes to the team."" Sterling, who told Cooper in Monday's portion of the interview that he is still loved by the players and fans, wondered why people turned on him so quickly. ""One day, they all love you, and the next day, you make a mistake and say something, and suddenly they hate you -- is that the way it is? "" he said in part two on Wednesday. ""What if a player said, 'I don't like working for that Jew.' What would we do? ""I wouldn't do anything. I would ask him, 'Why? Why?' I want to make you happy. If you want more money, more attention, more love?"" What has Magic Johnson done? Quite a lot, actually . Sterling contemplates end of marriage . Sterling believes his long marriage is near its end. He said he thinks his estranged wife, Shelly, has filed paperwork to begin divorce proceedings. ""I've destroyed her life,"" he said. ""I like her attorneys. They are all very good. They all want to be separate. They want her to divorce me forever and sever the relationship."" Sterling, who said Magic Johnson should be ashamed for being promiscuous and contracting HIV, tried to explain his own behavior. ""I guess I was bad committing all of those terrible ...  I don't even want to say it,"" he said. ""But you know, people say, 'How do you commit adultery?' You justify things. ""You say, well, every man in Paris or France has a mistress. I mean, it may make you smile, but when you're so old, you don't think it's wrong anymore if you have a little bit of fun."" He said he wanted someone to love him. ""You want to be cared for. Everybody wants to be cared for,"" he said through tears. ""I made such a mistake. I thought that woman (Stiviano) really cared for me."" He thinks Shelly should keep her 50% stake in the team. ""One wife, 58 years,"" he said. ""And she loved the team and always helped me with everything. If for some reason I can't have the team, I think that she should have her interest. She didn't do anything. I brought all of this on her."" Opinion: The 5 apology rules that Sterling broke .

"Karl Rove's suggestion that Hillary Clinton suffers from a brain injury prompted Democrats to come to her defense. And now, her husband is speaking up, saying ""she's strong and working out."" Rove, the mastermind behind George W. Bush's two presidential election victories, appeared at a conference last week, where he discussed a 2012 incident that sent the then-secretary of state to the hospital, according to the New York Post's Page Six gossip column. ""Thirty days in the hospital?"" asked Rove, a Fox News Channel contributor, according to the report. ""And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that."" Clinton, who's seriously considering a second bid for the White House, suffered a blood clot in December 2012, after falling. After first going to the hospital for testing, Clinton later was admitted for a three-day stay at a hospital in New York. The incident prevented her from testifying before Congress about the deadly 2012 terror attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, raising questions from some Republicans. She eventually appeared before lawmakers in January 2013. Should Clinton, 66, decide to seek the presidency, her health likely would be raised in the same context as any other candidate. Clinton: No need for new Benghazi committee, but GOP 'calls the shots' in the House . Democrats and others were quick to slam Rove. The Democratic National Committee put out a statement saying, ""It appears Karl Rove's medical diagnoses are about as solid as his election night prognostications."" The statement refers to Rove's prediction that Mitt Romney would win the 2012 presidential election. Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said ""Karl Rove has deceived the country for years, but there are no words for this level of lying."" As for Clinton's health, Merrill added, ""She is 100%. Period."" Former president weighs in . On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton said he was ""sort of dumbfounded"" by the comments. ""Look, she works out every week, she is strong, she's doing great. As far as I can tell she's in better shape than I am. She certainly seems to have more stamina now,"" he said. Clinton also joked about Rove. ""I got to give him credit, you know, that embodies that old saying that consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds. First they said she faked her concussion. And now they say she's auditioning for a part on the Walking Dead,"" he said. Rove defended his comments on Tuesday on Fox News Channel, saying that it's legitimate to ask about a potential presidential candidate's health. ""No, no. I didn't say she had brain damage, she had a serious health episode and my point was that I think it was from the 7th of December in 2012 through the 7th of January of 2013, she underwent, first she had apparently a serious virus. ""They announced then on the 15th of December that she had at some period in the past week fallen. They didn't say when, they didn't say where. She was recovering at home. On the 30th of December she goes in and turns out to have had a blood clot. They won't say where. ""The next day they say it is between her skull and her brain behind her right ear. She is in the hospital for four days. She goes home, is back in the office on the 7th and testifies on the 25th wearing special glasses that allow her to deal with the double vision that this episode caused,"" Rove said . While she was hospitalized, Clinton's doctors said they were confident that she would make a full recovery. Clinton has increasingly come under attack by Republicans as she seriously considers a presidential bid. If she decides to run, she would instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. At the same time, Clinton is keeping up a very demanding speaking schedule that includes lots of travel. Hillary Clinton edges down slightly in new CNN/ORC 2016 poll . Stepped up attacks . While she mulls her decision, the GOP and pro-Republican outside groups have stepped up their attacks on Clinton, on everything from the Benghazi incident to the 1990s Monica Lewinsky scandal. Rove said Clinton's health will be a factor if she runs. ""My point was that Hillary Clinton wants to run for president, but she would not be human if this didn't enter in as a consideration. My other point is this will be an issue in the 2016 race whether she likes it or not. Every presidential candidate is asked for their health records,"" Rove added Tuesday. Following Rove's appearance on Fox News, Merrill released a new statement. ""From the moment this happened 17 months ago, the Right has politicized her health. First they accused her of faking it, now they've resorted to the other extreme -- and are flat out lying. Even this morning, Karl Rove is still all over the map and is continuing to get the facts wrong. But he doesn't care, because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, and he's succeeding. It's flagrant and thinly veiled,"" Merrill said. The 2012 incident was not the first time Clinton dealt with blood clots. She told the New York Daily News in 2007 that while campaigning for Sen. Chuck Schumer in 1998 she suffered a large blood clot behind her right knee and had to be rushed to Bethesda Naval Hospital. Clinton also fell and fractured her right elbow as secretary of state in 2009 and was treated at George Washington University Hospital. Age an issue in presidential elections . Rove pointed out that some Democrats in 2008 made Republican presidential nominee John McCain's age an issue during the campaign. The age attacks were not limited to outside groups, either. Then-Sen. Barack Obama said McCain had ""lost his bearings"" while pursuing the Republican nomination, a line that was seen as a subtle attack. Age is often made a campaign issue. Bill Clinton's campaign portrayed incumbent George H.W. Bush as old and out of touch during the 1992 presidential race. Then-President Ronald Reagan famously turned the issue on its head in 1984 by telling voters during a debate with challenger Walter Mondale that ""I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.""","Karl Rove suggested that Hillary Clinton suffers from a brain injury .

"(CNN) -- When origami enthusiast Uyen Nguyen discusses her art, you quickly understand that it is about a lot more than folding paper. ""In many ways it has been therapeutic,"" she says. ""I find the process of folding paper to be almost meditative. ""Origami can be used to create incredibly realistic forms, not just to the likeness of say, an insect, but down to the exact species of that particular insect with proportions of its body segment true to real life. At the other end of the spectrum, you can mold paper to create the most abstract of forms beautiful because of their inherent structure instead of their likeness to real life forms. As someone interested in both science and art, I love that origami bridges the two."" Worldwide movement . Now Nguyen is bringing her passion to the people of New York City. For the exhibition Surface to Structure: Folded Forms, which will take place at New York's Cooper Union from June 19 to July 4, Nguyen has gathered more than 130 works from 88 artists around the world. The exhibition includes adorable rabbits folded by Malaysian origamist Ng Boon Choon, and a realistic rendering of a field mouse by American Bernie Peyton. But it also includes ""St. Michael -- The Archangel"", a more ominous work by Vietnamese origamist Tran Trung Hieu. It shows a winged angel carrying a sword. The exhibition marks the 55th anniversary of the 1959 exhibition Plane Geometry and Fancy Figures -- the first origami exhibition held in the United States, which also took place inside Cooper Union. So far Nguyen has raised more than $24,000 of the $32,000 she needs to cover the cost of shipping the works, organizing security and building display cases. Collectively the works demonstrate how origami artists are pushing the boundaries of technique and style. Transcending language barriers . In the 1950s, Japanese organist Akira Yoshizawa helped popularize the art by creating a universal system of diagramming, which involved arrows and illustrations rather than words. His book allowed people across the world to learn the craft and to easily construct pre-existing designs. But today artists have moved beyond that, with many using software that helps them dream up and then fold their elaborate works. ""Most origami involves folding one sheet of paper into some final form,"" Nguyen says. ""Modular origami uses multiple sheets of paper, folded into identical units, and takes these units and interlocks them, without cuts or adhesive, to obtain a final form that is usually very angular and representative of geometric solids. A couple of my designs add embellishments onto the surfaces of these polyhedra."" Regional variations in the art are becoming smaller and smaller as more people learn about origami via the Internet. However, Nguyen says that she observed a few patterns among artists while curating her exhibition. Vietnamese artists tend to be masters of wet folding, which creates soft, gentle bends rather than sharp creases. ""Their styles can be somewhat minimalist, and there is so much beauty in their simplicity,"" she says. ""The Japanese tend to be more calculated and precise with their folding, which can allow for a huge amount of detail and complexity. I think the European style of origami lies somewhere between these two extremes."" Read more: Origami -- a perfect blend of math and art . Read more: Amazing technicolor coats of Sydney Opera House .

"Animal rights activists in Canada say a dog walker should be charged with animal cruelty after six dogs died inside her truck on a hot day. Originally, the dog walker told the pets' owners that they had been stolen on May 13, the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said in a statement released Monday. But she later admitted they'd died in her care, the SPCA said. The SPCA, which is leading the investigation into the alleged mistreatment of the dogs, will recommend that authorities pursue animal cruelty charges, said Marcie Moriarty, the organization's chief prevention and enforcement officer. For days, the search in Langley, British Columbia, for the missing dogs -- Buddy, Teemo, Oscar, Mia, Salty and Molly -- drew attention online and in media reports as owners asked the public for help tracking them down and tried to raise money for the cause. The dog walker at first told police that they'd gone missing after she left them in the vehicle while she was inside a bathroom at the dog park, Canadian public broadcaster CBC reported. She later confessed to private investigators that they'd died in her vehicle. The dog walker admitted she was inside a business for about 45 minutes and left the dogs inside her vehicle, said Alesha MacLellan, a spokeswoman for Petsearchers Canada, a  detective agency brought in by owners to help find missing animals. ""The dog walker said she panicked and disposed of the dogs, then made up story about them being stolen,"" MacLellan said. ""After she disposed of the dogs, she drove to a park,  where she was supposed to have taken the dogs originally, and said the dogs were stolen from the park."" All six dogs perished from heatstroke, the agency said. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed the dogs' deaths last week and said that they were still investigating, adding that no charges had yet been filed. Prosecutors will have the final say on whether to charge the dog walker, Moriarty said. On a Facebook page and fund-raising site dedicated to the dogs, owners said they were planning to hold memorials for their pets. ""These dogs were our worlds and now we are all devastated and heartbroken. I am not sure if we will ever truly mend from this,"" wrote Jenn Myers Ortner, whose black and white Boston terrier Buddy was among the dogs who perished. ""The tears just won't stop.""","The SPCA says it will recommend animal cruelty charges against a dog walker .

"Police have taken into custody a Beijing-based scholar known for his criticism of China's policies in the restive western region of Xinjiang, his wife told CNN Friday. Ilham Tohti, a prominent economics professor belonging to the Uyghur ethnic group, was taken by police on Wednesday afternoon, Guzaili Nuer said, adding that she has not heard from police since and has no idea where her husband is. In a six-hour operation, around 30 policemen raided their home seizing computers, cellphones, a hard disk, bank cards and Tohti's passport, she said. Police did not respond to requests for comment. The U.S. State Department said Tohti, who has been outspoken in support of human rights for China's ethnic Uyghur citizens, had been taken into custody along with at least six of his students. Q&A: Who are the Uyghurs? His detention appeared ""to be part of a disturbing pattern of arrests and detentions of public interest lawyers, Internet activists, journalists, religious leaders and others who peacefully challenge official Chinese policies and actions,"" said Jen Psaki, a State Department spokesperson. ""We call on Chinese authorities to immediately account for the whereabouts of Mr. Tohti and his students and guarantee Mr. Tohti and his students the protections and freedoms to which they are entitled under China's international human rights commitments, including the freedom of expression."" Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Hong Lei said at a regular briefing on Thursday that Tohti ""is suspected of violating the law and committing a crime"" and that police have placed him under criminal detention. Last year saw several outbreaks of violence in Xinjiang, a large, resource-rich region that is home to the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. In December, police shot and killed eight people who attacked police station in western Xinjiang, and a separate clash left 14 Uyghurs and two police officers dead. Chinese authorities have also blamed Uyghurs for a vehicle attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October that killed five people -- including the three in the vehicle -- and wounded 40 others. The arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. Chinese authorities have cracked down heavily on violence involving Uyghurs, deepening resentment.","Police detain a Beijing-based scholar known for his criticism of China's policies in Xinjiang .

"A Marine Corps reservist says he accidentally drove his truck across the U.S. border into Tijuana, Mexico, where he was arrested and charged with possession of three firearms and ammunition. All of the guns were legally registered in the United States. Surprisingly, however, in Los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, firearm possession is almost completely outlawed. Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi, a decorated Marine who served two tours in Afghanistan, had a shotgun, a handgun and a rifle  -- all illegal in Mexico. He also had 400 pieces of ammunition. He is being held on weapons charges in a prison outside a town near Tijuana. I can imagine what some people might be thinking upon hearing this news. Wait -- Mexico has strict gun control laws? And anyone from the Southwest, or anyone who has ever been to Tijuana, might have followed that up with: . Wait -- Tijuana has laws? After all, many 19-year-old Americans go to Tijuana specifically because of the border town's legendary, shall we say, ""relaxed"" legal approach to minimum drinking ages and competitively priced prostitutes. But it's true: Although the Mexican Constitution is similar to the U.S. Constitution in that it guarantees some right to arms, Mexico's statutory ownership and permit laws have essentially regulated this ""right"" into a theoretical one.  That's right, Mexico is actually tough on guns. Well, sort of. The controlling law is Ley Federal de Armas de Fuego y Explosivos (LFAFE), or the Federal Firearms and Explosives Law. (For a terrific translation of the text into English, as well as an academic analysis of Mexican gun laws, check out David Kopel's Mexico's Gun Control Laws: A Model for the United States?) The short version: Tahmooressi, who has been held more than two months, faces some serious penalties for the firearms in his truck.  Even possessing ammunition without prior authorization is prohibited in Mexico by federal law, with penalties of up to 30 years in prison. Mexico's message is clear: Firearms? No bueno. The incident has triggered a groundswell of support for the sergeant in the States. This raises an interesting issue, however.  If Tahmooressi wasn't such a sympathetic figure, in fact, if he was anything other than a war hero, many of us might be asking different questions. Questions such as: . Who accidentally drives into Mexico with a truck full of firearms? Because if you strip away the good character, the remaining facts are not so good for Tahmooressi, especially from a criminal defense perspective.  A Mexican prosecutor could focus on the basic facts: First, Tahmooressi drove his car across the border into Mexico; second, with firearms and ammunition in his truck.  In Mexico, that's a clearly defined crime. On the defense side, it's been widely reported how easy it is to accidentally drive into Mexico at the San Ysidro border crossing.  This could help negate his intent. Then there's the issue of Tahmooressi's war-related conditions, which may have contributed to his unfortunate choice of highway ramps.  Tahmooressi suffered a severe concussion when a homemade bomb seriously damaged his vehicle in Afghanistan. His mother has said he suffers from ""directional dysfunctionality,"" which means he frequently gets lost, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and hypervigilance -- conditions acquired during, and because of his service. And more to his credit, this Marine did make law-abiding decisions: His firearms were lawfully registered in the U.S., and he immediately called 911 from his cell phone for guidance when he'd realized his mistake.  This country has rallied around Tahmooressi because he's exactly the kind of figure America rallies around: a good person caught in a bad situation. But what if this happened to someone else?  What if this were just a trust-fund frat boy on spring break, who took a wrong turn in his parents' Volvo with an AK-47 in the passenger seat?  Would there be the same outpouring of sympathy, if other facts remained the same? Apply the same facts to the fictional spring-breaker above, or one of the Jackass guys, or -- dare I say it -- Justin Bieber.  Do you think most of America would be so mobilized? Whether we admit it or not, the level of popular support is often driven by the character of the person involved, and not the underlying facts.  If ""The Biebs"" had made this wrong turn, we'd be saying good riddance -- and we wouldn't care what his mental health status was at all. Don't get me wrong: If I were president, I'd have already sent in Blackhawk helicopters to extract Tahmooressi -- but mercifully for the U.S., I'm not the President. He even attempted a prison escape. Of course, attorneys are ethically forbidden to counsel a crime like a prison escape, but I'm pretty sure we can silently root for one—especially when it's in a foreign jurisdiction. Mexico should be equally praised and criticized for its gun control legislation. In theory, as written, the statute attempts to restrict gun ownership to only the most responsible owners, or the most necessary purposes.  In practice, however, we all know Mexico is hardly a gun-free, crime-free utopia.  Tahmooressi is a responsible gun owner whose ownership did not comply with Mexican law.  Now, his freedom depends on three factors, unrelated to the facts: . First, the Mexican government can choose not to prosecute. Prosecutors in the States have  discretion to withdraw prosecution in the interest of justice. I hope their Mexican counterparts have similar interests: to secure justice rather than victory.

"Thailand is now under military control -- with its military chief in power, its constitution tossed, its political leaders detained, its citizens under martial law -- thanks to a coup that capped months of unrest. Thursday's announcement, in a televised address by the Asian nation's military chief, followed a last-ditch meeting purportedly aimed at resolving the crisis. Leaders of the governing Pheu Thai Party, the opposition Democrat Party, the anti-government protesters, pro-government ""Red Shirts"" as well as the military were among those in attendance. But only one faction walked out free. Troops escorted the political party leaders from the meeting; a lawyer for the ""Red Shirts"" later confirmed they'd been detained. That left Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the head of the Asian nation's military, in charge. The military released a statement saying Prayuth now has the powers to act as Prime Minister until a new one takes office. How exactly the government will operate is in question, given that the military also has thrown out the 2007 constitution, except for Section 2,  which acknowledges that the king is the head of state. The last six months have been marked by protests, both by those backing the government and those against. There has been deadly violence in the streets. Schools will be closed nationwide between Friday and Sunday, the de facto military government ordered. A curfew is in place for between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. (11 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET) And all state-run, satellite and cable TV providers have been ordered to carry only the signal of the army's television channel; CNN is among those networks that have been taken off the air. In a speech hours after the meeting with political party leaders, Prayuth explained that these actions were necessary to restore order and push through needed reforms. He said there will be security provided for foreigners, including vacationers and diplomats. As to Thai citizens, Prayuth urged them to go about their business as usual -- including civil servants and officials, who should report to work. And in many ways, this is normal for Thailand. Thursday's sudden transfer of power is the 12th time the military has taken over since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. It's the second coup for Pete Kraisittipong, a lifelong Bangkok resident and CNN iReporter. While there are noticeable differences -- like closed convenience stores -- he said most people don't seem too taken aback but the sudden, if hardly unprecedented, political shift. ""People associate this as the silent coup. They just go home and don't go out after 10,"" he said. ""... People just live their normal lives."" Amnesty bill furor spirals into more unrest . In a way, if not years in the making, the latest coup has been in the making since November. That's when then-Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra tried to push through an amnesty bill to allow the return of her brother Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister who lives in exile. A military coup deposed Thaksin in 2006. Groups opposed to the government seized on the amnesty bill furor and began large-scale protests in central areas of Bangkok. Trying to defuse tensions, Yingluck called early elections. But the Democrat Party boycotted the February race, and Yingluck's foes blocked voting in enough districts to prevent a valid outcome. Yingluck, who first took office in 2011, stayed on after the disrupted election as a caretaker Prime Minister. But the Constitutional Court forced her from office two weeks ago, finding her guilty -- despite her professions of innocence -- of violating the constitution over the appointments of top security officials. She is now wanted, along with three of her relatives, having been summoned to report to military authorities late Friday morning, an army spokesman said. The situation hasn't calmed much since Yingluck's departure from office. Demonstrators on all sides of the fight remained active in the streets. And attempts to resolve differences through negotiations -- such as Thursday's meeting, the second in two days -- seemingly went nowhere. On Tuesday, the military stepped up its involvement by declaring martial law. At the time -- even as an aide to interim Prime Minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan insisted it had taken ""this action unilaterally"" -- the military insisted this wasn't a coup. Thailand martial law: A cheat sheet to get you up to speed . Not anymore. U.S. suspends 'military engagement and assistance' The developments have caught the attention of world leaders, including U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who appealed ""for a prompt return to constitutional, civilian, democratic rule and an all-inclusive dialogue,"" according to his spokesman. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressed disappointment and concern about the detention of political leaders, the shutting down of media outlets and the suspension of the Thai constitution. ""There is no justification for this military coup,"" Kerry said in a statement. ""... I urge the restoration of civilian government immediately, a return to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."" American officials have tried but -- as of Thursday afternoon -- failed to contact Thai military officials to urge them ""to immediately restore democracy and civilian rule,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. The State Department and USAID send approximately $10 million annually to Thailand, according to Psaki. In light of everything, there is ""a comprehensive review"" of all such ties between the two countries, including militarily.

"Space travelers, get ready for a new ride. The Dragon V2 got its grand reveal Thursday night by SpaceX founder Elon Musk, who showed off his company's new spacecraft in a live webcast. While the California-based company has already made its mark on its industry in its 12 years in business, Dragon V2 marks a major milestone as SpaceX's first spacecraft capable of bringing humans to the International Space Station then taking them back to Earth. ""It's all around I think a big leap forward in technology,"" Musk said. ""It really takes things to the next level."" The storied entrepreneur -- who also founded the Tesla car company and whose personality is thought by some to be the inspiration for Robert Downey Jr.'s take on Tony Stark, or ""Iron Man,"" in recent movies -- said that ""Dragon Version 2,"" as he called it, can transport as many as seven astronauts for several days. One big upgrade from earlier models is that Dragon V2 will be reusable, which will cut down on costs and open up opportunities for humans to explore. Thanks to propulsion and other technology to slow its re-entry into Earth's orbit and control its descent, Musk said the spacecraft should be able to land most anywhere much like a helicopter. ""As long as we continue to throw away rockets and spacecraft, we will never have true access to space,"" Musk explained. ""It will always be incredibly expensive."" There are a series of back-up systems as well. That includes the recently unveiled Superdraco engine, two of which will be in each Dragon V2. With 16,000 pounds of thrust, these engines will help allow the capsule to safely land. If one stops working, the other can take over; if both stop, a parachute can be deployed to allow astronauts to float safely back down to Earth. As evidenced by the fact it is ""Version 2,"" the new spacecraft builds off existing technology developed by SpaceX. Already, SpaceX has embarked on three of its 12 scheduled missions to the International Space Station as part of its $1.6 billion contract with NASA. That includes the first ever connection between that orbiter and a private spacecraft in 2012. But all its trips so far -- including back to Earth, when the SpaceX craft parachuted into the Pacific Ocean -- involved only cargo and were unmanned. Dragon V2 aims to change that. Thursday's event included a dramatic unveiling of the new spacecraft, which stood about 15 feet tall, with a rounded, cone-shaped top. At one point, Musk even went inside and sat in one of its four reclined seats. While such an undertaking likely has been in the works for some time, it comes at a pivotal, uncertain time for the International Space Station and space travel, generally. NASA's agreement with SpaceX -- plus its $1.9 billion deal with Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corporation for eight missions -- takes on increased importance given Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin's announcement earlier this month that his country does not plan to use the manned orbiter beyond 2020. That announcement as well as ratcheted-up tensions between Russia and the West has raised concerns about the space station's future, especially since Russian Soyuz aircraft have become the only way astronauts have been able to get to-and-fro since the end of the U.S. space shuttle program. This comes after President Barack Obama, in 2010, pushed for the expansion of private-sector and commercial space industries as part of his reimagining of the U.S. space program. ""We will actually reach space faster and more often under this plan,"" Obama said, adding this approach would send more astronauts into space over the next decade than previously planned. ""By the mid-2030s, I believe we can send people to orbit Mars and bring them safely back to Earth,"" Group aims to send 2 humans near Mars . Yet SpaceX isn't alone in its ambition to ferry people into space. In addition to various efforts to take people to Mars -- including one from the Paragon Space Development and the Inspiration Mars Foundation, which has vowed to launch a spacecraft in 2018 with two humans heading toward the Red Planet -- SpaceX has competition in its efforts to go to the International Space Station as well. It is one of three private companies -- along with Boeing and Sierra Nevada Corporation Space Systems -- who have completed the first step of NASA's certification process to haul astronauts to the space station, the space agency announced Friday. NASA noted that it awarded $30 million contracts to all three companies along these lines in December 2012. ""We're making great strides toward returning human spaceflight launch capability to U.S. soil,"" NASA official Phil McAlister said in a press release Friday. ""This certification is important to ensuring our crew members have reliable transportation to and from the space station where they are conducting research essential to advancing human exploration farther into the solar system.""

"A group of female students are outraged that their Utah high school digitally edited their photographs in the 2014 yearbook for apparently violating a dress code and failed to apply that policy to other apparent violators. Intensifying the controversy are comments from the leader of the Rape Recovery Center in Salt Lake City, who called for a school district investigation Thursday into the clothing policy, which she says is an example of a culture that shames girls and women. School leaders stood by the dress code Thursday but admitted inconsistency in the digital editing, for which the superintendent apologized. At issue is a dress policy that Wasatch High School in Heber City says it posted on yearbook picture day last fall: No tank tops. No low-cut tops. No inappropriate slogan on shirts. Violations would result in the students' portraits being edited, the school said. Now that the yearbook has been distributed, several female students are complaining that their pictures were altered to show less skin without their knowledge, according to CNN affiliate KSTU. No boys' photos were digitally edited, the girls argued. ""They didn't tell you before they edited it, and they didn't give you an option to fix it, so you look funny in your yearbook picture,"" sophomore Shelby Baum  told the news outlet. But the high school asserts that a large sign -- 4 feet by 5 feet -- warned all students of the policy at picture day last fall, the school said on its Facebook page. In response, the female students say that the pictures of some girls who apparently violated the dress policy weren't edited at all -- an accusation that prompted the superintendent's apology and a school promise to review its editing practices. ""I feel like they put names in a hat and pick and choose who,"" sophomore Rachel Russel told the affiliate. ""There were plenty of girls that were wearing thicker tank tops, and half of them got edited and half of them didn't."" Indeed, Rachel's photo was clearly edited, according to images she showed the news station. Her original photo shows her wearing a low-cut top, but in the yearbook, her neckline is raised and covers a tattoo near her clavicle, the station reported. Superintendent Terry E. Shoemaker of the Wasatch County School District defended the policy, but he apologized ""in the sense that we wanted to be more consistent with what it is we're trying to do,"" he told the affiliate. On its Facebook page, the school acknowledged that errors were made. ""In the application of these graphic corrections, the high school yearbook staff did make some errors and were not consistent in how they were applied to student photos and the school apologizes for that inconsistency,"" the school said. ""Wasatch High School and Wasatch County School District are evaluating the practice of photo editing of pictures as it now stands and will make a determination on further use of the practice."" But the Rape Recovery Center in Salt Lake City raised broader issues, noting how female survivors of sexual violence ""almost always blame themselves for wearing the wrong clothing or somehow encouraging men to rape them through their reckless behavior,"" the center said on its Facebook page. Holly Mullen, the center's executive director, says the school district should investigate the policy and the school's digital editing of yearbook photos. The center is Utah's only independent, non-profit agency providing full-time services to survivors of sexual violence ages 14 and older. ""This action, a decision made by a few school officials with no apparent consultation with students or parents, is just unacceptable,"" Mullen said in a statement. ""It is a keen example of how our culture, and especially those in power to make such random decisions, shame young women into thinking they must dress and act in one narrow, acceptable way. ""This is the start of a continuum that nurtures and even encourages control over girls and women. What is more personal than their clothing choices? This is not about setting school dress codes, which schools certainly have the right to do. These were photos the girls paid for, yearbooks they bought with their own money. This is a public school, supported with tax dollars,"" Mullen said. Shoemaker wasn't immediately available for comment on Mullen's accusations. For now, students will have to live forever with what they describe as unflattering photos in their yearbook. ""I was upset because my shirt was a cream color and the color of the cover-up was completely white. It looks like white-out on my skin,"" sophomore Kimberly Montoya told KSTU.","A group of girls say their yearbook photos were edited badly and unfairly .

"A separatist leader declared Monday that eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region was not only independent, but also would ask to join Russia -- a day after referendum organizers claim voters in the region chose to break away from Kiev. Denis Pushilin, self-declared leader of the Donetsk People's Republic, told a crowd that no further referendum was needed to ask Russia to annex it. Pro-Russian separatists held a referendum Sunday asking residents of the Donetsk region whether it should declare independence from Ukraine. Nearly 90% of voters in the area favored secession, an election official said Monday. A similar question was put to voters in Luhansk. Preliminary results were expected Monday, officials said. But a new poll for CNN suggests that support for alliance with Russia is much weaker than pro-Russian separatists say, even in the east. Just over a third (37%) of Ukrainians in three eastern regions favor an alliance with Russia, while 14% of the region backs an alliance with the European Union and about half (49%) say Ukraine would be better off if it did not ally with either, the poll found. ""Eastern Ukraine"" includes the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv. Neither Ukraine's government nor the European Union immediately reacted to Pushilin's overture to Russia, though both dismissed Sunday's votes. ""This propagandist farce will not have any legal consequences, only criminal responsibility of its organizers,"" acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said in a statement Monday. ""That farce the terrorists call a referendum is nothing else but a propagandist cover for killings, kidnapping, violence and other grave crimes,"" he said. He reiterated that his government will continue fighting against ""terrorists, saboteurs and criminals"" but will negotiate with those in eastern Ukraine ""who do not have blood on their hands and those who are ready to defend their goals and beliefs in a legal way."" A vote for autonomy is a vote for the self-destruction of the east, Turchynov has said. It would cut residents off from the national economy and social programs, he said. ""It is a step (to) nowhere for these regions. It is euphoria that may lead to very complex consequences, and many people can already feel them."" Polls close amid allegations of fraud and double-voting . Pushilin's announcement is reminiscent of separatists' moves in the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia annexed after Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in a March 16 referendum. Nationwide, the ComRes poll for CNN poll found that 56% of Ukrainians feel a stronger sense of loyalty towards Europe, 19% towards Russia, and 22% towards neither. The CNN findings come from a poll by the agency ComRes of 1,000 adult Ukrainians contacted by telephone in Russian and Ukrainian between May 7-11. Three percent said they didn't know. The poll's margin of error is 3.1 percentage points. Reactions from Russia, NATO, European Union . Russia welcomed Sunday's votes. ""Moscow respects the will of the population of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, and hopes that the practical implementation of the outcome of the referendums will proceed along civilized lines, without repeat outbreaks of violence,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday that ""those referendums don't count."" He called the vote ""illegal."" The referendum was ""organized in a chaotic manner with dubious and ambiguous questions,"" he said, adding that the only ""thing that counts"" is Ukraine's planned presidential election on May 25. ""I urge all actors to make sure that those general elections can be conducted in an orderly manner,"" Rasmussen said. He said that he feels NATO and its allies have sent a ""very clear message to Moscow"" and assured its allies. Recently, U.S. Army forces have been deployed to Poland and three Baltic states. Amanpour challenged Rasmussen, asking him whether he thought that was enough to demonstrate ""heft."" Rasmussen responded that NATO is ""considering further steps."" ""Those further steps might include an update of existing defense plans, development of new defense plans, enhanced exercises and also appropriate deployment,"" he said. It's too early, he said, to describe anything more specifically, ""but we will not hesitate to take further steps if needed,"" he said. U.S. exercises in Poland: What's the message? German Chancellor Angela Merkel also described the referendum as illegitimate and said the focus should be on the May 25  presidential election in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the European Union imposed sanctions related to the Ukraine crisis on another 13 people, bringing the total number to 61, an EU diplomat said Monday. Details about the sanctions given to the 13 weren't immediately available, but previously announced sanctions included asset freezes and visa bans. The diplomat did not name the newly sanctioned people or reveal their nationalities. Previous targets included Dmitry Kozak, Russia's deputy prime minister; Valery Gerasimov, Russia's military chief; and pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine, including Pushilin. The EU also has imposed sanctions on two entities in Crimea, the diplomat said Monday. Merkel and French President Francois Hollande have warned that Russia could face more consequences if the Ukrainian presidential vote does not go ahead as planned. ""If no internationally recognized presidential election were to take place, this would inevitably further destabilize the country,"" Merkel said. In that case, she said, ""we are ready to take further sanctions against Russia."" Merkel and Hollande also said that Russian troops along the Ukrainian border ""should undertake visible steps to reduce their readiness."" Putin announced a troop pullback Wednesday, but NATO says it has seen no signs of a withdrawal of Russian forces from the border area. Russia annexed the southern region of Crimea after announced results in a separatist referendum showed more than 90% in favor of joining Russia. In an independent survey by the Pew Research Center, 54% of Crimea residents showed support for secession. The Kremlin has said that it has no interest in annexing other parts of Ukraine. But it is pushing for the country to adopt a constitution that would give regions where Russian is widely spoken a larger voice in policy-making. Critics fear that the creation of autonomous pro-Russian regions in Ukraine would cement alliances with the Kremlin that would give it essential control over them.","A CNN poll out Monday finds backing for Russia much lower than the vote tally .

"Obama administration officials showed a so-called ""Proof of Life"" video of Bowe Bergdahl at a classified Senate briefing on Wednesday, but the session failed to convince numerous skeptics that swapping Taliban terror detainees for the captured Army sergeant was the right thing to do. ""I remain as deeply skeptical about this as I did before this conversation that we just had with the administration. For two days now, we've asked questions, many of which have not yet been fully answered,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida, told CNN after the briefing. Since announcing Bergdahl's release this past weekend, administration officials have said they fast-tracked the operation over concerns about his health and safety, which appeared to be in jeopardy. A senior defense official said on Wednesday that recent intelligence, in addition to two proof-of-life videos released in recent months, underscored the concerns. CNN has reported on the existence of the most recent video, believed to be recorded last December, which U.S. officials have said showed a marked deterioration in Bergdahl's condition. Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl . Lawmakers emerging from the closed session had mixed reaction as to whether his health was evidence that he needed to be immediately freed. Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, said Bergdahl ""didn't look good. I understand the emotional power the video had on the President."" President Barack Obama has defended his decision to get Bergdahl back now, saying he was not going to leave him behind with the United States in the final stage of its Afghanistan operation. Opinion: Bergdahl's release: Motives, mistakes and excuses . Bergdahl was the only remaining U.S. military captive from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The video was short, and Bergdahl spoke English, said Kirk. He spoke softly and slowly, almost slurring. There were references to the recent death of Nelson Mandela in the video. Kirk said there was no new information from the officials who briefed the senators on what Bergdahl's ailments were. ""His condition in the video made it clear he was not in good condition and this was a proof of life video we insisted on before negotiations commenced. Once having seen it, as we saw it, I'm sure there was great concern about his condition,"" Democrat Richard Durbin of Illinois said. Taliban video shows Bowe Bergdahl's release in Afghanistan . Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, like several other senators, was skeptical the video provided enough evidence to warrant the extraordinary prisoner swap that some lawmakers called too open ended and could possibly have repercussions for American security down the road. ""You could tell he had been drugged and he was in a different state,"" Manchin said. Adding later:  ""That did not sell me at all.  The proof of life was five months ago, December ... That was not the person who was released here.  He was not in that dire situation when he was released."" Opinion: Five tough ethics issues in Bergdahl swap . Others noted that it took five months for the White House to cut a deal to free Bergdhal after seeing the video. Complex negotiations were conducted through the government of Qatar, which accepted the transfer of the five Taliban prisoners who had been held for years at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Who was swapped for Bergdahl? Several senators said the video should be made public. It's not clear if that will happen. The administration officials told the senators that none of the detainees in question were involved in attacks against the United States. ""I'm a little bit more reassured"" of the President's decision, Kirk said, adding, however, that the administration could not guarantee that the former detainees wouldn't return to the battlefield. Republicans and Democrats raised serious concerns more than two years ago with the administration about the possibility of such a swap but said promised consultation never materialized. In all discussions and the private communications about such a step, there were exchanges about possible conditions placed on the detainees -- including renouncing al Qaeda and violence in the region. But those terms were not included in the final deal. Celebrated at first, Bergdahl's release raises questions . Fellow soldiers call Bowe Bergdahl a deserter, not a hero .

"The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a long-standing appeal from scientists who tried to block funding of stem cell research on human embryos. The brief order from the justices is a victory for supporters of federally funded testing to combat a range of diseases and illnesses. Federal courts had previously lifted an injunction on continued funding, and this latest high court action probably means the lawsuits will be ultimately dismissed. The field of embryonic stem cell research has been highly controversial, because in most cases, the research process involves destroying the embryo, typically four or five days old, after removing stem cells. These cells are blank and can become any cell in the body. Because of the destruction of embryos, most opponents believe this is a moral issue. Supporters of the research point to the potential for saving lives. Legislation passed in 1996 prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars in the creation or destruction of human embryos ""for research purposes."" Private money had been used to gather batches of the developing cells at U.S.-run labs. That congressional ban had been renewed annually. Stem cells vs. heart attacks . The current administration had broken with the Bush White House and issued rules in 2009 permitting those cells to be reproduced in controlled conditions and for work on them to move forward. Obama administration officials have been at odds with many members of Congress over whether the National Institutes of Health research causes an embryo's destruction, as prohibited by the Dickey-Wicker Act. In opposing the lawsuit, the government had argued that an extensive list of research projects outlined by the government health research agency would have to be shelved if the courts blocked further funding. Some scientists say that embryonic stem cells could help treat many diseases and disabilities because of their potential to develop into many different cell types in the body. In 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia lifted an injunction originally issued by a federal judge, who said, at the time, that all embryonic stem cell research at the research agency amounted to the destruction of embryos, in violation of congressional spending laws. The appeals panel later reversed, concluding the plaintiffs bringing suit ""are unlikely to prevail because Dickey-Wicker is ambiguous and the NIH seems reasonably to have concluded"" that the law does not ban research using embryonic stem cells. Stem cells help deaf gerbils hear . The White House at the time applauded that ruling. ""While we don't know exactly what stem cell research will yield, scientists believe this research could treat or cure diseases that affect millions of Americans every year,"" said Stephanie Cutter, a deputy senior advisor to the president. ""That's why President Obama has long fought to support responsible stem cell research."" The case began with a lawsuit against the National Institutes of Health by James Sherley and Theresa Deisher, scientists opposed to the use of embryonic stem cells, who worked with a group that seeks adoptive parents for human embryos created through in vitro fertilization, including the nonprofit Christian Medical Association. Embryonic stem cell research differs from other kinds of stem cell research, which do not require embryos. The current case does not deal with separate research on adult stem cells, which is permissible under federal law. In 2001, when President George Bush first approved federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research, 64 existing stem cell lines that were created before August 9, 2001, qualified for federal funding. But of those, only 21 were usable by scientists. Bush later rescinded the funding. Under the Obama administration's rules, at least 75 stem cell lines qualify for federal funding, according to the National Institutes of Health. The NIH has invested more than $500 million in human embryonic stem cell research. Scientists conducting such research say continued federal funding is necessary, because they would have greater flexibility to work collaboratively within labs, across labs and around the world on the latest treatments and breakthroughs. Supporters of embryonic stem cell research say their studies have shown promise in treating a range of debilitating conditions, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, cancer and spinal cord injuries. The case is Sherley v. Sebelius (12-454).","Court dismisses appeal that tried to block funding of stem cell research on human embryos .

"It's a love song to a creepy, scale-covered mammal that kind of looks like the cross between a dinosaur and a pine cone. And I kinda-sorta love it. It's ""My pangolin friend [official music video],"" uploaded to YouTube by New York songwriter and actor Max Demers. Demers, a 30-year-old waiter and self-described ""starving artist,"" made the video in response to my Change the List story on pangolin trafficking in Southeast Asia. The pangolin is thought to be the most trafficked mammal, by numbers, in the world. This unknown underdog is sold illegally and by the ton for its scales, which are used in bogus medicine, and for its meat, which is a super-high-end delicacy in Vietnam and China. Demers read the story and, he told me in an e-mail, decided to write a semi-vulgar love song to this strange animal, which he'd never heard of before. ""There are a ton of animals out there in dire need of help"" he told me, ""but a lot of them have entire armies of activists fighting on their behalf. I loved the idea that I could have a small part (in) drawing some more attention to an animal that hasn't gotten enough of it."" Digital doc: Inside the pangolin trade . The result is charming and weird and offensive and awesome. The chorus -- which croons, ""please don't eat myyyyy ... pang-o-lin friend"" -- is seriously catchy. Then Demers writes about how the pangolin secretes gross-smelling stuff out of its anal glands -- which is true, sometimes -- and also about how people eat its fetuses to supposedly boost sex drive. So, yeah. It gets a little weird, but it's for a good cause. In Vietnam and Indonesia, where I went to report the story that inspired this song, the pangolin is both mysterious and valuable. Its scales, which are made of fingernail-type material, are supposed to help women lactate. A group meal of pangolin at a restaurant in Hanoi could run $2,000 -- partly because the meat is a status symbol. Related: 7 ways to save the pangolin . So I applaud this effort to catch peoples' attention about a strange and shy little animal that desperately needs all of our help. I also am still just thrilled that so many of you donated a total of $17,000 to Education for Nature Vietnam, which is going to make a pangolin-focused PSA to air in that country because of your generosity. Take a look at Demers' video (as well as this one from that ""honey badger"" guy), and read this lightly edited version of our e-mail convo below. Oh -- and please please don't eat his pangolin friend. Me: What do you like most about the pangolin? Guy who makes pangolin music videos in his spare time: I am amazed by so many things about this animal, such as their gentle, almost friendly demeanor (like an ugly-cute version of my cat Sasha), their crazy long tongues that wreak terror on unsuspecting ant colonies, and their unbelievably versatile tails, used for things like hanging from tree branches and even walking on their hind legs. I'd have to say my favorite characteristic, though, is its defense mechanism of rolling into a tight ball to ward off predators. While researching, I found this amazing video online of a pangolin that withstood an attack by eight lions by rolling itself up into this tight little ball. After something like three hours, the lions finally gave up and the pangolin just sauntered off into the woods again. Unreal! Me: How did you get interested in pangolins? Pangolin guy: I've always been a lover of all things nature. I grew up spending summers at camp in New England, camping and hiking throughout the White Mountains; and in 2008 I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail. I'm an avid animal lover (presently going strong on my third attempt at vegetarianism!); but I am also an actor in New York City, and escaping the urban lifestyle can sometimes feel impossible. Every once in a while, however, an opportunity comes along that allows me to combine the two lifestyles. A few months ago, that was the case when I was hired by maxanimal.com to write a humorous song about an animal to be featured on their website. I had no idea what to write about, so I started reading, a LOT. My friend Blaire Carson, who is featured in the video with me, and a regular host on maxanimal.com, sent me an email with loads of links to articles about animals, including one about a woman who keeps 200 sloths at her house, and another about giant rats. But I was instantly drawn to your article on CNN.com, ""The Most Trafficked Animal You've Never Heard Of."" It felt important, and the pangolin's struggle felt desperate. The deciding factor for me was the that I had never heard of the pangolin before. There are a ton of animals out there in dire need of help, but a lot of them have entire armies of activists fighting on their behalf. I loved the idea that I could have a small part (in) drawing some more attention to an animal that hasn't gotten enough of it. Me: Tell about how you wrote the song? Dude who sings about anal glands: This song came surprisingly easy. As per my assignment, the song had to be humorous, which was a little intimidating at first, for two reasons: 1. Being told to be funny SUCKS, and 2. The survival of a species is a serious subject, and I didn't want the real issue to be overshadowed by male anatomy references and poop jokes. The turning point was when I thought to write the song as a love letter to the pangolin. Once I embraced that idea, I was able to balance the the dirty jokes with genuine love and concern for this animal, and the punch lines felt somehow more poignant and less offensive. Me: What's up with the format for the video -- where did you get the idea? Our resident pangolin enthusiast: The video was shot at a studio in Brooklyn.  I went in with the song, and the amazing team at maxanimal.com shot the video.  Over the next couple of weeks, their editor, Grannell Knox, edited and sent out rough cuts, and we all weighed in on the best ways to visually entertain people while also preserving the integrity and message of the song.  One challenging aspect was that it was nearly impossible to find high definition footage of pangolins that we could use on such a limited budget. Me: Who's that in the video with you? Guy from the video: My dear friend Blaire. She is a frequent host on the website, and recommended me to the team when they mentioned adding a musical aspect to the site. Me: What's your favorite line for the song? Indecisive songwriter: I feel like I HAVE to give two answers to this question: 1. ""This little girl's got a heart of gold, and she'll love you just as long as she's alive.""  This line is the song. And 2. ""Please don't eat my pangolin friend, it's cheaper to sit hookers on your face."" I love this joke because it's true! The amount of money people pay to kill and eat this harmless and beautiful animal is absurd! And for what?  False promises. You stand as much of a chance of getting an erection by chewing on your fingernails (as getting one from eating a pangolin, which is seen by relatively few people as an aphrodisiac.) Me: What do you do when you're not making semi-vulgar videos about scale-covered mammals? Possibly offended artiste: I am an actor and a musician. Trained in musical theatre (sic) at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy and The New School in New York, I live the typical starving artist's life. I wait tables at Ellen's Stardust Diner to pay the bills; and when I'm not serving burgers and fries, I write music, audition and hit the stage any chance I get. Me: Do you write other music? Marketing-savvy musician: YES! Please check out my band, Astoria Boulevard, and our album This is Astoria Boulevard, available on iTunes, Spotify, CDBaby, and all that good stuff. I also have more tunes coming soon to YouTube and maxanimal.com.","Max Demers writes a song about the pangolin in response to CNN article .

"In horse racing, there's the trifecta. In entertainment, there's the EGOT for winners of the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards. Maybe in the future there will be something called the Seacrest -- for holding down hosting gigs with all four major American broadcasters. The superfecta was trumpeted on Tuesday when CBS confirmed that Ryan Seacrest will host and produce ""Fashion Rocks,"" a two-hour special that airs on the network in September. Seacrest has existing relationships with ABC, to host ""New Year's Rockin' Eve,"" with Fox, to host ""American Idol,"" and with NBC. In other words, CBS was the only broadcaster left. (Unless you count the Spanish-language Univision network; Seacrest, are you boning up on your Spanish?) Seacrest's new deal with CBS, and an extension of his existing deal with NBC, were first reported by The Hollywood Reporter. NBC subsequently confirmed that Seacrest has re-upped for one year. ""This new deal will include hosting and producing 2015 Live from the Red Carpet events for E!, contributing to E! News, as well as hosting and producing specials for E! and NBC,"" a network spokeswoman said. There had been speculation that Seacrest would stop hosting the red carpet shows. What's missing from the extended deal instead are NBC News and NBC Sports. When the deal was originally struck in 2012, Seacrest was named a ""special correspondent"" on the ""Today"" show, which is a part of the news division, and a contributor to NBC's prime time coverage of the Olympics, which is a part of the sports division. Seacrest told The Hollywood Reporter that ""he'd like to try to continue working with both divisions and has already had conversations with NBC Sports about collaborating on the Olympics coverage in Rio in 2016, as he did the London games in 2012. 'Today' is less likely, given a morning radio schedule that has him in Los Angeles while the NBC show broadcasts out of New York.""","Ryan Seacrest signed a new hosting deal with CBS .

"More than 100 undocumented children without families were expected to arrive in Arizona from south Texas on Sunday as part of a federal transport of underage immigrants to the state by the Department of Homeland Security, a spokesman said. Last week, nearly 1,000 ""unaccompanied alien children"" had already arrived in Tucson and Phoenix from places like McAllen and El Paso, Texas, as part of a resettlement process of the minors, most of whom come from Central America, to their native countries. Unlike a Mexican immigrant who arrives to the United States, a Central American immigrant cannot be processed as quickly because of proximity to their native country. Homeland Security is prohibited from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico, causing the backlog of immigrants in U.S. detention centers. Facilities in Texas were at or near capacity for the immigrants because of a ""record increase in underage migrants,"" which led to the transfer of hundreds to Arizona, a spokesman said. Although children crossing the border alone has long been an issue, the recent spike could be attributed to better weather or worsening economic conditions in their home countries, officials said. Others simply want to be reunited with their parents, who may have left them with relatives in their native countries. Separate from unaccompanied children being sent to the state, family groups were also being sent by the federal government to Arizona, a process that has outraged Arizona lawmakers, including Gov. Jan Brewer. She released a statement Friday saying that DHS was transporting ""thousands of illegal aliens and releasing them at bus stations in Tucson and Phoenix."" ""I am disturbed and outraged that President Obama's administration continues to implement this dangerous and inhumane policy, meanwhile neglecting to answer crucial questions our citizens demand and deserve,"" Brewer wrote. ""Not only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy, it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here,"" Brewer added. As of late last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was no longer releasing ""large family groups"" at the bus stops in Arizona, a DHS spokesman said, but children under age 17 are continuing to be transferred to the state. ""The situation with the kids are they came by themselves, they have no relatives here, and the consulates can't keep up. They're in limbo. There's no one (back home) to deport them to,"" a DHS spokesman told CNN. Raising a larger humanitarian concern are the conditions to which the immigrant children are arriving. A facility in Nogales, Arizona, with capacity for about 1,500, does not have enough food or beds to accommodate the current demand, a spokesman said. There are currently no showers for the immigrants, either, but those were expected to be in place by Tuesday, according to a spokesman. ""The Nogales processing center is equipped and used for processing apprehended individuals. The Tucson Sector has secured additional services such as a Health and Human Services medical screening area, additional bedding, shower areas and laundry facilities. Vendors have been contracted to provide nutritional meals, FEMA will be providing counseling services and recreational activities,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. ""Upon completion of CBP processing...custody determinations will be made on a case-by-case basis,"" the statement said. The record spike in migrants coming from Central America and crossing into the United States via Mexico is not expected to slow down, a spokesman told CNN. More than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles are expected to cross in 2014, said Chris Cabrera, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council in the Rio Grande Valley, a U.S. Border Patrol workers union. ""We are seeing numbers that we've never seen before in this part of the country,"" Cabrera told CNN last month. ""Yesterday, we had 60 minors in one station alone. You're talking kids from 17 years old, on down to some that are 5 or 6 years old, traveling by themselves."" Last year, roughly 10% of people caught by Border Patrol agents were minors, according to a Border Patrol official. States work around Obamacare to help undocumented immigrants .

"The recent and ghastly botched execution of a man in Oklahoma has rekindled my thoughts on capital punishment -- a practice outlawed in most civilized countries. Indeed, most of the industrialized world looks with horror on the United States, in this regard, as a primitive and backward country. Just in passing fact, capital punishment was banned in the Netherlands in 1870, in Costa Rica in 1877, in Colombia in 1910. In allowing the death penalty, the United States stands with Libya, Uganda, Cuba, Egypt and Equatorial Guinea, among our other peers. It's a sad commentary on justice in this country that, in a nation so plagued by capital murder, we should make it a state practice as well. Do we not see the connection? You would guess that a nation obsessed with guns and violence -- just read the papers -- might at some point notice that when the state participates in this brutality, there is a tacit agreement that the most complete response to provocation is death. Two of the greatest writers of the19th century, Charles Dickens and Leo Tolstoy, passionately opposed the death penalty. Both were also Christians, and they understood perfectly well that the Sermon on the Mount makes it clear that, under the old dispensation, an eye for an eye was appropriate. But Jesus said bluntly that not only should we never kill anyone, but we must turn the other cheek, resisting evil in a nonviolent way. This wasn't something Jesus imagined was up for grabs. Dickens, the Shakespeare of the novel, argued against capital punishment on many grounds, but he was especially concerned about the matter of determining guilt in such an absolute way. Can we ever really know for sure that someone did something? The death sentence is inevitably delivered by ""men of fallible judgment, whose powers of arriving at the truth are limited, and in whom there is the capacity of a mistake or false judgment."" Tolstoy wrote a stirring essay in 1908 called ""I Cannot Be Silent"" in which he described a multiple hanging, and found it repulsive on every level. He noted the priest who attended the execution and how he mumbled something about God and Christ to the condemned. After a vivid account of the hanging, he says with an ironic twang: ""All this is carefully arranged and planned by learned and enlightened people."" He notes that the government who commits this killing is involved in the process ""from the lowest hangman to the highest official -- all support religion and Christianity, which is altogether incompatible with the deed they commit."" Incompatible indeed. It has always struck me as bizarre that many of those who object most strenuously to abortion because it involves taking a life will quite happily condone capital punishment, as if this is somehow not taking a life. Does it make it less immoral for the individual, in its collective guise as ""the state,"" to kill someone?  Killing is killing, and when you give this ugly deed an official name -- capital punishment -- it's still killing, and is grotesque for a supposedly humane nation to condone such a practice. As if we needed reminding, our Constitution bans punishments that are deemed ""cruel and unusual."" In the eyes of the civilized world, murder is cruel and unusual punishment, best left to vigilante outlaws, the criminally insane and rogue states. State-sponsored murder fosters a culture of violence that permeates our society, creating a punitive state of mind that does nobody any good. And it has surely proven ineffective in preventing further killings. Indeed, it generates them.","Jay Parini: Botched Oklahoma execution reminder that few civilized countries do this .
He says state-sponsored killing fosters a culture of violence in U.S.
Parini: Dickens, Tolstoy found death penalty repulsive, hypocritical, unchristian .

"While architect Philip Freelon imagined designs for Atlanta's new National Center for Civil and Human Rights, he did the usual research into the past, scanning images of the civil rights marches and protests it would surely address. Around the same time, he couldn't help but notice the front pages of modern newspapers that showed protesters around the world resolutely fighting their own battles. They were in different times, different worlds, but always, he saw the same image: People united, their arms interlocked or fingers woven together. The gestures became the foundation for the design his team created, one that's visible today as the new museum opens in downtown Atlanta. Even after the recession and planning decisions edited the grand space to less than half the size originally proposed, the symbol endured. The building evokes two linked hands; its exterior walls feature a mix of earthy shades that suggest different races coming together. Inside, exhibits in the nearly 43,000-square-foot museum link the historic stories of the American civil rights movement and modern human rights struggles around the world. The Atlanta center is one of several museums tied to civil rights recently opened or in the works. Around the country, they serve as memorials, meeting spaces, tourist attractions and time capsules, all trying to reveal their stake in history while drawing a young, tech-savvy audience. ""The vision and mission of the institutions are different. What's similar are those words, civil rights -- segregation, violence, reconciliation, resilience, jubilation,"" said Freelon, who created designs for civil rights-related museums in Washington, Mississippi, North Carolina and elsewhere. They aren't just places to preserve history or tell the story of a single race, said Ford Bell, president of the American Alliance of Museums. Museums and libraries have long been places where communities explore curiosities and conversations of the moment, he said; it's why the United States saw a wave of natural history museums in the early 20th century, then science and technology centers and more recently, children's museums. The rise of high-profile civil rights museums comes as communities recognize old wounds that need to heal and fresh cuts that require care, he said. Why I'm tired of hearing about 'that' civil rights movement . ""Museums are the way that we often address important issues in our society, where we talk about them together,"" Bell said. ""We as a society are still wrestling with issues related to human rights and civil rights, and a painful history."" 'Stories are the most powerful tools' Work on a civil rights museum in Atlanta began more than 10 years ago, when former United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young and civil rights activist Evelyn Lowery approached then-Mayor Shirley Franklin with the idea. The city was already home to memorials and historic sites honoring Atlanta native Martin Luther King, Jr., but they intended this space to go beyond the King legacy, or even civil rights history. ""It became really clear that they believed ... it was important to connect it to the current issues of the world and the United States,"" said Franklin, the board chairwoman of the National Center for Civil and Human Rights. ""Atlanta has claimed a position for itself, historically, as a place where people grapple with human issues, fairness issues, justice issues. Atlanta has claimed its history for itself."" The links weren't so clear to everyone. It took time to convince people -- including other civil rights activists and potential donors -- that the voting rights marches and church bombings of the 1960s were tied to modern, global issues like slavery and immigrant rights. The $103 million museum contains large galleries devoted to both, and space to grow as the stories evolve, center CEO Doug Shipman said. Through original artworks and interactive displays laden with video and audio, museum leaders hope visitors will consider where they fit into civil rights history and how they can impact human rights issues today. This could be a first taste of civil and human rights understanding for many visitors to the tourist-heavy area where the museum stands, Shipman said. It's located beside the Georgia Aquarium and World of Coca-Cola, in eyeshot of a large Ferris wheel and fountains often packed with gleeful children. Turner and CNN are among the museum's corporate sponsors. Shipman said they wanted the center to appeal not just to those who remembered the history it captures, but also to the 22-year-olds who can't imagine it. He wants to hear grandparents sharing their protest memories and teens explaining their school campaigns against bullying. Visitors can tour museum exhibitions designed by Tony Award winner George C. Wolfe and human rights activist Jill Savitt in as little as 75 minutes. Another gallery displays a rotating collection of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s personal papers, which are housed at nearby Morehouse College. The exhibits could be the gateway that leads visitors a few miles away to the historic Sweet Auburn district, King's birth home or the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library and Museum, Shipman said. ""This was trying to bring the stories to people who might not find them otherwise. Stories are the most powerful tools,"" Shipman said. ""If someone goes to one (attraction) and they're inspired, it makes them more likely to go to another. ""Civil rights and human rights should be Atlanta's signature, destination topic, like New Orleans and jazz."" 'It's not over' Around the country, other cities are sharing their stake in the same story. Many realized they were losing the opportunity to capture the memories of those who witnessed the civil rights movement and were coming up on milestone anniversaries that would spur conversations around ""freedom summer,"" school desegregation, civil rights policy and touchstone events of the civil rights movement. The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture is scheduled to open in 2016 on a five-acre tract on the National Mall in Washington. In Memphis, the National Civil Rights Museum -- the former Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed -- reopened in April after a $28 million renovation, including new, interactive exhibitions. The International Civil Rights Center and Museum opened in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 2010 to showcase the site where four black students sat-in at a whites-only Woolworth's counter in 1960. Jackson, Mississippi, broke ground last year on a civil rights museum to sit beside a forthcoming state history museum. Charleston, South Carolina, is planning an International African American Museum. These join myriad other museums and historic sites that consider the legacies of women, Native Americans, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, or subjects like the African diaspora and the Holocaust. ""If you name a societal problem, I will find you a museum that's working on it,"" said Bell, the American Alliance of Museums leader. ""The challenge will be to engage people, to help them learn important history ... and how do they keep them looking forward?"" Explorations of civil and human rights can be good business for museums, industry leaders said, presenting history in new ways to young, diverse audiences while building lifelong educations for baby boomers who now make up the core of museum members. By being ""neutral, optimistic"" spaces to consider civil and human rights, they're also expecting to draw in corporations and community groups that need to talk through the issues. They're reminders, too, that the work of the U.S. civil rights movement isn't done, said Ellen Zisholtz, director of the I.B. Stanback Museum and Planetarium at historically black South Carolina State University. Museums can continue to tell stories of persecution and protest due to religion, gender, education, citizenship and class, as well as race. ""It's important because it's stuff that gets lost,"" said Zisholtz, a member of the board of directors of the Association of African American Museums. ""It's not over. We're going backward, not forward, at a time when we're 50 or 60 years later (than the civil rights movement). ""The whole future of this country is for different communities who care about social justice to get together, and work together. If enough people committed themselves to it, what a difference it could make.""","The National Center for Civil and Human Rights opens in Atlanta on Monday .

"Authorities had three previous encounters with Jerad and Amanda Miller this year, including one instance days before the couple went on a shooting rampage in Las Vegas. The couple killed two Las Vegas police officers, Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, at a pizza restaurant Sunday. Shortly after, they fatally shot shopper Joseph Wilcox, 31, at a local Walmart. As more details emerge, assistant Sheriff Kevin McMahill said authorities had previous contact with the two shooters in February, April and May --  all without incident. The anti-police sentiment the couple expressed when they gunned down two officers was not evident at previous meetings, he said. The first meeting was in February, when detectives investigated Jerad Miller's threats against the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles, McMahill said. Miller threatened to shoot staff at the agency after his suspended driver's license was seized during a traffic stop, according to Danielle Dean, a spokeswoman for the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Nevada detectives who interviewed Miller about the Indiana incident did not see any signs of potential threats, according to McMahill. A second contact came on April 10. Las Vegas shooting victim's friend: 'You never expect it' At the time, officers interviewed the Millers as witnesses in a domestic violence case, McMahill said. They provided voluntary statements about the alleged assault and did not display any ""anti-police"" sentiments, he said. On May 31, the Millers again provided statements to police officers about an alleged sexual assault of a neighbor. In that case, their meetings were without incident as well. ""Because an individual may online espouse ideology that is anti-government or anti-police does not make them translate into a murderer,"" McMahill said. ""What happened to change these two people into murderers, we don't know."" The killers apparently considered law enforcement as oppressors, authorities said. When they killed the officers over the weekend, they placed a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag and a Nazi swastika on one officer and left a note saying, ""This is the beginning of the revolution,"" on the other officer's body. Who were the victims? They then ran to a nearby Walmart, where they killed Wilcox before barricading themselves inside the store during a firefight with officers. Sheriff's deputies fired the bullets that killed Jerad Miller, a sheriff's department official said Wednesday. His wife shot herself. Authorities had earlier said his wife killed him before taking her own life. But McMahill told reporters Wednesday that a review of forensic evidence and autopsy results showed that police fatally wounded the gunman. ""We do not believe any of her shots hit him,"" he said. McMahill said investigators were reviewing graphic video of the rampage. ""The video shows you exactly how vicious and coldblooded these murderers were,"" he said. A Walmart security video released by police showed the Millers in their final moments. In the video, they lay wounded in an aisle surrounded by items they used for cover. They are seen holding firearms, which they at times point at each other. At the end of the video, Amanda Miller turned the gun toward herself. She was not shown firing it.

"(CNN)ISIS is under pressure in parts of Iraq and battling a variety of adversaries in Syria, but it's metastasizing at warp speed elsewhere, most dangerously in Egypt and Libya. It also has support in Yemen, Afghanistan and Pakistan. And the leader of the group ravaging northern Nigeria, Boko Haram, has expressed his admiration of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The savage killing of 21 Egyptian Christians in Libya -- all of them dressed in ISIS' trademark orange prison garb -- is another indication of ISIS' ability to take advantage of collapsed or collapsing states and of its growing presence in North Africa. Most significantly, the atrocity took place in Sirte, a long way from ISIS' first stronghold around Derna in the east of the country. ISIS' presence in Sirte, a town of 50,000, has been growing. The Egyptians were abducted in November, and more recently, the extremists strengthened their presence by taking over government buildings and a radio station. ISIS first announced itself in Libya in October. Amateur video showed a large crowd of militants in Derna affiliated with the Shura Council for the Youth of Islam chanting their allegiance to al-Baghdadi. Sources told CNN at the time that ISIS had up to 800 fighters in the area as well as training facilities in the nearby Green Mountains. They were bolstered by the return from Syria and Iraq of up to 300 Libyan jihadists. A short while later, al-Baghdadi recognized three Libyan ""provinces"": Barqa (in the east), Tripolitania (west) and Fezzan (south) as being part of the ""caliphate."" Since then, ISIS has stepped up its presence across Libya. Late last month, a suicide bombing and gun attack on a hotel in the capital, Tripoli, killed 10 people, including an American. The attack was swiftly claimed by Wilayat al-Tarabulus, ISIS' name for the province. Politicians in Tripoli disputed the claim. ISIS has also been active in southern Libya, attacking a Libyan army checkpoint in Sokhna in January and killing 16 people. While a growing presence, the Libyan affiliate is some ways from being able to mimic ISIS in Syria and Iraq, with its bureaucracy and governing structure. Geoff Porter of North Africa Risk Consulting says that ""even in the jihadi stronghold of Derna, (ISIS) does not rule independent of a broader coalition of like-minded, but ultimately distinct groups."" ""While ISIS may prove to be an enduring terrorist threat in Libya, it is very unlikely to be able to develop to the point where it controls a meaningful amount of territory,"" Porter says. But as in Iraq and Syria, ISIS has launched an effective social media campaign in Libya. It has also made a concerted effort to attract seasoned fighters from other groups, such as Ansar al Sharia. ISIS Libyan affiliate has also started to exercise some forms of social control in areas where it is strong. ""The group has publicized hisba activities such as burning cigarette cartons; destroying water pipes used for smoking; demolishing ""polytheistic"" statues and shrines,"" says Andrew Engel of the Washington Institute. Hours after the Egyptian air force carried out retaliatory airstrikes Monday, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry warned that ""leaving the situation as it is in Libya without a firm intervention to curtail these terrorist organizations would be a threat to international peace and security."" The Italian government has suggested an international peacekeeping presence in Libya. Italy is acutely aware that it's the jumping-off point for a growing flow of migrants and a base camp for terrorism, just hours across the Mediterranean. Bernardino Leon, U.N. envoy to Libya, has floated the idea of international monitors when a peace agreement between rival factions is hammered out. But ""when"" seems a long way off, despite the beginning of talks between rival factions in Geneva. And U.S. and European officials fear that putting boots on the ground would be a bug light to ISIS supporters. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Leon admitted that ""terrorism is becoming a problem beyond the east [of Libya.] It is growing into the west and now the south, and from the west they might go to Tunisia and Algeria."" Porter agrees there is a risk to Tunisia. There are hundreds of Tunisians among ISIS' ranks in Syria and Iraq, and the government is already battling a jihadist presence at home in the Chaambi Mountains. ""Although Tunisian security services have improved their capabilities in the last 24 months, they fear that they would be overwhelmed by the emergence of a cross-border threat originating in Libya,"" Porter says. While Libya is ISIS' most notable franchise, jihadists in Egypt have made the vast Sinai desert almost ungovernable. Chief among them is ISIS' freshly minted Sinai Province, formerly called Ansar Beit al-Maqdis. Late in January, it killed at least 30 people in a series of co-ordinated attacks on security outposts, leading Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to shake up the military command in the Sinai. And just last week, it released a video showing the beheading of eight alleged spies. With Israel on one side and a military-dominated government in Cairo on the other, Sinai Province has powerful enemies close by. ""That said,"" writes Aaron Zelin, a leading scholar of jihadist movements, ""if the Egyptian government continues to operate in a brazen manner, militarily it will create new local recruits that could sustain the Islamic State in north Sinai."" Less developed but worth monitoring are self-declared supporters of ISIS in Pakistan and Afghanistan, which the group now calls the province of Khorasan. One of them was a former Taliban commander, Mullah Abdul Rauf, who was killed a week ago in a drone strike in Helmand Province. He had split from the Taliban, and analysts are watching for further fragmentation of the group. Several commanders of the Pakistani Taliban also pledged to al-Baghdadi, but it's unclear yet whether their departure has more to do with the rifts that have torn the group apart in the last two years. The Long War Journal concluded that most of the new ISIS group were low- to mid-level militants -- a sign of ""the competition between smaller and emerging militant groups in South Asia, some of which are seeking to align with the Islamic State brand."" within the group. The most intriguing development in recent months has been the desire of the Nigerian group Boko Haram to fly the ISIS flag, literally and metaphorically. It has begun to hold territory and talk of its own Caliphate in northern Nigeria. Its propaganda machine has become much more ISIS-like. And it has incorporated the ISIS symbol into its own flag. It has also begun inflicting ever more gruesome punishments, including beheadings, on its victims. Boko Haram's leader, Abu Bakr Shekau, has expressed his admiration for ISIS and al-Baghdadi on more than one occasion -- but ISIS has not officially acknowledged any link between the two groups. For now at least, it is the long coast of Libya and its deep empty interior, its lack of government and many porous borders that seem the most promising territory for ISIS.","Libya seems to be the most promising territory for ISIS to extend its reach .

"Former newspaper editor and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson was found guilty Tuesday of conspiracy to hack phones in what is widely seen as an embarrassment for British Prime Minister David Cameron. But another of Rupert Murdoch's former newspaper chiefs, Rebekah Brooks, was unanimously cleared of all charges at the Old Bailey court in London after an eight-month trial, her lawyer said. Brooks was overcome by emotion in the courtroom as the verdicts were read out, the UK's Press Association news agency said. She left the Old Bailey accompanied by her husband, Charlie Brooks, but did not stop to speak to the waiting media. The jury went home Tuesday night without coming to a decision on charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office against Coulson and former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman. Jurors will return at 11 a.m.  (6 a.m. ET) Wednesday to resume deliberations. Tuesday's verdicts came three years after it was revealed that journalists on News of the World hacked the phone of then-missing teenager Milly Dowler in 2002, raising hopes that she was alive and checking messages, when in fact she had been murdered. The resulting public and political outrage led to the closure of the 168-year-old paper and the setting up of a public inquiry to examine journalistic ethics. At the time the schoolgirl's voice mail was intercepted, Brooks was editor of Britain's top-selling News of the World, and Coulson was her deputy. After Coulson succeeded her as editor, Brooks edited The Sun newspaper, and she later became chief executive of the parent company, News International. Coulson resigned as News of the World editor in 2007 after its then-royal editor, Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed for hacking into voice-mail messages left for royal aides. Coulson denied any wrongdoing and later became Cameron's director of communications. The former editor resigned from his Downing Street position in 2011 as coverage of the phone hacking scandal broadened. Cameron: Hiring Coulson 'wrong decision' Cameron, who has faced criticism for hiring Coulson, gave what he called a ""full and frank apology"" Tuesday in a statement to the media, saying he took ""full responsibility"" for his former aide's recruitment. The Prime Minister said he had decided to give the former editor ""a second chance"" on the basis of promises Coulson had given that he did not know about phone hacking. ""I am extremely sorry that I employed him, it was the wrong decision, and I am very clear about that,"" Cameron said. He added that there had been no complaints about the work Coulson did for him either at Downing Street or beforehand when Cameron was leader of the opposition. Coulson's guilty verdict on the charge of conspiring to hack phones ""raises important questions about David Cameron's judgment in employing him,"" said Matthew Ashton, an expert in politics and the media at Nottingham Trent University. ""In particular what warnings did he receive beforehand, and how rigorous was the vetting and interview process? ""Regardless of the verdicts, this trial has raised important questions about the relationship between the political, economic and media elites in the UK."" Brooks' husband, aide also cleared . Brooks resigned as News International CEO in July 2011 amid public anger over hacking allegations, and police arrested her the following week. Brooks and Coulson were charged in 2012, together with five other journalists, with conspiracy to intercept the voice mails of high-profile figures in Britain. All seven denied wrongdoing. Brooks also faced, along with her husband and her former personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, two charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. All three were cleared of those charges, the Press Association reported. Retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner, who was cleared of conspiracy to hack phones, thanked his legal team in a statement outside court. ""The diligence, the dedication and perhaps, above all, the passion of my lawyers over the past three years has been extraordinary, most remarkable -- and it is to them that I owe a huge and enduring thanks for the result, the unanimous verdict of the jury today."" News UK, the UK newspaper publishing arm of Murdoch's News Corp., said in a statement: ""We said long ago, and repeat today, that wrongdoing occurred, and we apologized for it.  We have been paying compensation to those affected and have cooperated with investigations."" The publisher said it was making changes to ensure this kind of wrongdoing did not recur and that it supported a new UK press watchdog expected to start work later this year. ""Out of respect for the fact that further legal proceedings will occur, we will have no further comment at this time,"" the statement added. Clandestine affair . During the trial, the jury heard how a private detective working for the tabloid allegedly made more than 6,000 hacking calls in a two-year period. The Metropolitan Police estimate there were more than 1,000 victims, including royalty, politicians and celebrities. The phone of Kate Middleton, now the Duchess of Cambridge and wife of Prince William, was hacked 155 times, it was revealed at the trial. In November, prosecutors alleged that Coulson had a clandestine affair with Brooks from 1998-2004, which they argued showed the pair's level of trust. Referring to a letter she had written to Coulson and that was produced in court, Brooks said: ""Andy and I were incredibly close at the time. He was my best friend. I think that comes across."" She denied there had been a long-standing affair but acknowledged there had been periods of physical intimacy. The BBC and Guardian newspaper reported that when Coulson testified in April -- with his wife watching from the public gallery -- he said the affair ""shouldn't have happened."" But he denied that it meant he and Brooks had shared sensitive stories, the outlets said. In her defense, Brooks denied in court that she had ever approved phone hacking while she was News of the World editor. Asked about the practice, Brooks said: ""No desk editor, no journalist ever came to me and said, 'We're working on such and such story, and we need to access their voice mails.' "" She told the court she would have felt it was ""a serious breach of somebody's privacy, especially if you did not have an overwhelming public interest,"" and of the newspaper industry's code of conduct.

"Observers around the world are stunned by the speed and scope of this week's assaults on every major city in the upper Tigris River Valley -- including Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city -- by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. But they shouldn't be. The collapse of the Iraqi government's troops in Mosul and other northern cities in the face of Sunni militant resistance has been the predictable culmination of a long deterioration, brought on by the government's politicization of its security forces. The politicization of the Iraqi military . For more than five years, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his ministers have presided over the packing of the Iraqi military and police with Shiite loyalists -- in both the general officer ranks and the rank and file -- while sidelining many effective commanders who led Iraqi troops in the battlefield gains of 2007-2010, a period during which al Qaeda in Iraq (the forerunner of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) was brought to the brink of extinction. Al-Maliki's ""Shiafication"" of the Iraqi security forces has been less about the security of Iraq than the security of Baghdad and his regime. Even before the end of the U.S.-led ""surge"" in 2008, al-Maliki began a concerted effort to replace effective Sunni and Kurdish commanders and intelligence officers in the key mixed-sect areas of Baghdad, Diyala and Salaheddin provinces to ensure that Iraqi units focused on fighting Sunni insurgents while leaving loyal Shiite militias alone -- and to alleviate al-Maliki's irrational fears of a military coup against his government. In 2008, al-Maliki began replacing effective Kurdish commanders and soldiers in Mosul and Tal Afar with Shiite loyalists from Baghdad and the Prime Minister's Dawa Party, and even Shiite militia members from the south. A number of nonloyalist commanders were forced to resign in the face of trumped up charges or reassigned to desk jobs and replaced with al-Maliki loyalists. The moves were made to marginalize Sunnis and Kurds in the north and entrench al-Maliki's regime and the Dawa Party ahead of provincial and national elections in 2009, 2010 and 2013. The dismantling of the 'Awakening' It's no accident that there exists today virtually no Sunni popular resistance to ISIS, but rather the result of a conscious al-Maliki government policy to marginalize the Sunni tribal ""Awakening"" that deployed more than 90,000 Sunni fighters against al Qaeda in 2007-2008. These 90,000 ""Sons of Iraq"" made a significant contribution to the reported 90% drop in sectarian violence in 2007-2008,  assisting the Iraqi security forces and the United States in securing territory from Mosul to the Sunni enclaves of Baghdad and the surrounding Baghdad ""belts."" As the situation stabilized, the Iraqi government agreed to a plan to integrate vetted Sunni members of the Sons of Iraq into the Iraqi army and police to make those forces more representative of the overall Iraqi population. But this integration never happened. Al-Maliki was comfortable touting his support for the Sons of Iraq in non-Shiite areas such as Anbar and Nineveh provinces, but he refused to absorb Sunnis into the ranks of the security forces along Shiite-Sunni fault lines in central Iraq. In areas with (or near) Shiite populations, al-Maliki saw the U.S.-backed Sons of Iraq as a threat, and he systematically set out to dismantle the program over the next four years. As this process played out, we saw its effects firsthand in our interactions with Iraqi government officials and tribal leaders in Baghdad, where it was clear the Sons of Iraq were under increasing pressure from both the government and al Qaeda. By 2013, the Sons of Iraq were virtually nonexistent, with thousands of their sidelined former members either neutral or aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in its war against the Iraqi government. The disappearance of the Sons of Iraq meant that few Sunnis in western and northern Iraq had a stake in the defense of their own communities. The vast system of security forces and Sunni tribal auxiliaries that had made the Sunni provinces of Iraq hostile territory for al Qaeda was dismantled. The militant gains in Mosul and other cities of the north and Anbar are the direct result of the removal of the Iraqi security forces commanders and local Sons of Iraq leaders who had turned the tide against al Qaeda in 2007-2008. Those commanders who had a reason to secure and hold territory in the north were replaced with al-Maliki loyalists from Baghdad who, when the bullets began to fly, had no interest in dying for Sunni and Kurdish territory. And when the commanders left the battlefield this week, their troops melted away as well. What can be done? The problem will only get worse in the coming months. Now that the Iraqi government's weakness in Sunni territories has been exposed, other Sunni extremist groups are joining forces with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  to exploit the opening. The Baathist-affiliated Naqshbandi Army and the Salafist Ansar al-Sunna Army are reportedly taking part in the offensive as well, and they are drawing support from a Sunni population that believes itself persecuted and disenfranchised by al-Maliki's government and threatened by Shiite militias that are his political allies. For six months, Shiite militants have been allowed or encouraged by the government to conduct sectarian cleansing in mixed areas around Baghdad, particularly in Diyala province between Baghdad and the Iranian border. These events contributed to the motivation of Sunnis who have taken up arms or acquiesced in the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's offensive. Even as the ISIS tide rolls southward down the Tigris, there is probably little danger of Baghdad and other Shiite areas falling into Sunni insurgent hands. The Shiite troops unwilling to fight to hold onto Mosul will be far more motivated to fight to protect Shiite territories in central and southern Iraq and to defend the sectarian fault line. This is their home territory, where they have the advantage of local knowledge, and where they have successfully fought the Sunni insurgency for years. In the north, however, al-Maliki now has two military options. He can reconsolidate his shattered forces along sectarian fault lines to defend Shiite territories in central Iraq, ceding Sunni areas to the insurgency, or he can regroup his security forces at their bases north of Baghdad and mount expeditions to conduct ""cordon and search"" operations in Sunni areas lost to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. If al-Maliki chooses to regroup and move on Sunni population centers controlled by the ISIS, we are likely to see Shiite troops unfamiliar with Sunni neighborhoods employing heavy-handed tactics, bluntly targeting Sunni military-age males (12-60) not affiliated with the insurgency and further inflaming sectarian tensions as they do so -- reminiscent of the situation in many parts of Iraq in 2005-2006. The problem at its core is not just a matter of security, but politics. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and its allies would not have had the opportunity to seize ground in the Sunni Arab-dominated provinces of Salaheddin, Nineveh and Anbar if there had been more inclusive and sincere political outreach to the mainstream Sunni Arab community. In the end, the solution to the ISIS threat is a fundamental change in Iraq's political discourse, which has become dominated by one sect and one man, and the inclusion of mainstream Sunni Arabs and Kurds as full partners in the state. If al-Maliki truly wishes to restore government control to the Sunni provinces, he must reach out to Sunni and Kurdish leaders and ask for their help, and he must re-enlist former Sons of Iraq leaders, purged military commanders and Kurdish Peshmerga to help regain the territory they once helped the Iraqi government defend. But these are steps a-Maliki has shown himself unwilling and unlikely to take. At this point, al-Maliki does not have what it takes to address Iraq's problem -- because he is the problem.","Writers: Troop collapse in Mosul predictable since Iraq's politicization of security forces .

"A 1-year-old boy who plummeted two stories from a fire escape in Brooklyn on Wednesday was saved when a quick-thinking passerby saw the child and caught him as he fell, according to police. The woman who caught the baby is Cristina Torre, daughter of famed Major League Baseball manager and former National League All-Star catcher Joe Torre. Joe Torre: Baseball champ and domestic abuse survivor . The boy crawled through the window of a second-story apartment after pushing aside a piece of cardboard that blocked an opening beside the apartment's air conditioning unit, according to NYPD Detective James Duffy. He then climbed onto the fire escape and fell onto the awning of a frozen yogurt shop directly below the apartment and bounced off, Duffy said. That was when 44-year-old Cristina Torre, who happened to be passing by, saw the situation and positioned herself beneath the awning in time to catch the child, Duffy said. The boy was taken to Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn and was in stable condition, Duffy said. Joe Torre released a statement Wednesday night saying, ""I am very proud of my daughter Cristina's actions today during an incident in Brooklyn involving a small child. Fortunately for that child she was in the right place at the right time to lend a hand."" The boy's parents were charged with child endangerment, Duffy said. Three other children, aged 2, 3 and 5, were taken into the custody of Child Protective Services.","The 1-year-old boy fell after crawling through a window .

"New York City has needled out Chicago for the title of America's tallest building. One World Trade Center in New York will be the United States' tallest building when completed, beating out Chicago's Willis Tower, according to an announcement Tuesday by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. The main issue was whether a 408-foot needle atop the One World Trade Center would be counted in the total height of the tower. The council's height committee met on November 8 in Chicago to rule on the height of the new skyscraper. On Tuesday, the council announced that the needle, which was completed in May, was in fact a ""spire"" -- a ""vertical element that completes the architectural expression of the building and is intended as permanent."" One World Trade Center's height to its architectural top is 1,776 feet (541.3 meters), according to the ruling. The Willis Tower's architectural height is 1,451 feet (442.1 meters). Confused? It's a bit technical. 25 great skyscrapers: icons of construction . The council, an independent organization that certifies the official height of skyscrapers and acknowledges record-setting buildings, counts spires and structural elements in its height calculations. But it doesn't count antennas, signage or flagpoles, which are considered ""functional-technical equipment subject to change."" ""It's about the authorship of the architect in some ways, and the permanence of the piece to reinforce the role of design,"" said council spokesman Daniel Safarik. As the building was originally designed, the needle atop the tower was to be enclosed in a radome, an architectural structure made of fiberglass and steel. But the proposed radome -- short for radar dome -- would not be able to be serviced or maintained, so the cladding plan was nixed. Coming soon: World's first 'invisible' tower . Project chief architect David Childs and the rest of the One World Trade Center team convinced the council's height committee that the spire was, itself, architectural. The designers noted that the top of the new building's steel parapet is located at 1,368 feet, the height of the original World Trade Center Tower 1. The spire reaches from that parapet to the new building's height of 1,776 feet. ""I feel completely satisfied that this building achieved what it set out to do,"" Childs said. ""We used the council's rules and designed around them. It's an important statement for all of us to make."" ""With respect to the events of 9/11 and what this building commemorates with 1776 and democracy and freedom ... we were very happy to find that the building fit our criteria to be 1,776 feet tall,"" said Timothy Johnson, the council's chairman. Because One World Trade Center isn't yet finished and hasn't received its certificate of occupancy, it cannot be ranked as a ""completed building,"" but ""its height is no longer in dispute,"" the council said in a Tuesday press release. Upon completion, which is expected in early 2014, the New York skyscraper is expected to rank as the world's third-tallest building, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and the Makkah Royal Clock Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia.","One World Trade Center ruled to be taller than Willis Tower .

"(CNN)Picture this: August 2014 and House Speaker John Boehner is on the campaign trail in Iowa stomping for then-congressional hopeful Mariannette Miller-Meeks. He's in front of a small, yet attentive crowd engaged in one of his favorite pastimes -- bashing President Barack Obama. In his talk, he criticized the President's response to Russia's takeover of Crimea, asking the group ""Does anybody think that Vladimir Putin would have gone into Crimea had George W. Bush been president of the United States?"" He then answers his own question.""No! Even Putin is smart enough to know that Bush would have punched him in the nose in about 10 seconds!"" Boehner even pantomimed what the proposed punch would look like, much to the delight of his audience. It was a theatrical showing. And a dishonest one. When Russia invaded the Republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally, in 2008, Bush did not come close to punching Putin or then-Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in the nose -- literally or diplomatically. In fact, the country's response to the invasion — which did not include military action -- was so weak one Georgian soldier fighting for his country's sovereignty told The New York Times that ""America and the European Union are spitting on us."" But the small band of voters in that room likely did not remember or ever even knew the truth. This is the mouthpiece House Republicans chose to speak on their behalf -- for a third time. And things will be different between Congress and the White House how? Much is said about Obama's low-to mid-40% job approval numbers -- but have you seen Congress? In six of the past seven years, its job approval average has been less than 20%, according to Gallup. Before 2008, only twice in the 40 years Gallup has measured Congress' approval has it been that low. In short, Boehner, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. Mitch McConnell have been the leaders, presiding over the worst stretch of job approval numbers this branch of government has had since 1974. Pandering, misrepresenting facts, massaging the truth -- these are all part of the game of politics. Boehner and his contemporaries are neither unique nor inherently bad people for playing by these distasteful rules. Yet there's something profoundly deflating about seeing the same leaders of what was routinely referred to as ""the worst Congress in history"" all back to reprise their staring roles in 2015 (though McConnell has swapped jobs with Reid as Democrats lost control of the Senate to the GOP in the midterms). ""Now We Can Get Congress Going"" read the headline of a Wall Street Journal op-ed Boehner co-penned with McConnell, as if someone else was stopping votes in the House. On the other side, Reid ignored more than 700 House-passed bills during the 110th Congress alone -- and that was when Pelosi was speaker. He was replaced by McConnell, who said ""there's only one Democrat who counts: the President,"" in the same interview in which he talked about reaching across the aisle. Yeah, I can see a lot of bipartisanship happening now. Barely a week in, and Republicans were threatening to defund parts of the department that helps protect the border to punish a president they say is not serious about protecting the border. Also in the hopper: The Keystone Pipeline, a project that studies found is neither the job creator nor the environment destroyer each opposing party claims it to be. This is why for all the hoopla about changes in Congress, 60% of Americans believe nothing will change. ""Long term incumbency leads to politicians who seem to care more about what is best for their career than what is best for their country,"" Sen. Rand Paul wrote in 2009, advocating for term limits. ""Some pundits like to remark that we already have term limits, they're called 'elections.' This glib response ignores the fact that incumbent U.S. senators start each election cycle with an average of $8 million dollars in the bank. The average U.S. representative starts with over $1 million in the bank."" In 1994, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich pushed a series of reforms designed to circulate more members through leadership jobs. Among those changes: term limits for the job of speaker of the House. Unfortunately, it was overturned by Republicans in 2003.  Worse yet, Gingrich failed to get the votes needed to impose term limits on members of Congress. That, too, was thwarted by some of his Republican brethren. ""If this were a trial, I'd call as my first witnesses the Founding Fathers, who directly and unanimously rejected term limits,"" Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Illinois, said in a debate on the floor at the time. I won't bore you with the list of things the Founding Fathers ""unanimously rejected"" that we consider common sense today.  I'll just point out the irony of Thomas Jefferson, the author of The Declaration of Independence, owning hundreds of slaves -- and slowly walk away. In any case, Congress appears to be stuck with Boehner and company, which means the country is. (All these four need to do to stay in power is to get re-elected in districts where they have strong support and then retain the votes of their colleagues in Congress. And as we saw in the aftermath of Boehner's re-election, dissenters will be punished.) Hopefully, the leaders of Congress will keep their promise and actually put the American people's needs ahead of their own pursuit of power. Or maybe enough voters will notice the correlation between the ""worst Congress in history"" and the quartet that's been leading it for nearly a decade. Call me a cynic, but I'm not holding my breath for either. Although it's worth noting that the only district in Iowa that Republicans lost in November was the one in which Boehner was seen telling his whopper about Bush punching Putin in the nose. Maybe those folks were paying attention after all.","LZ Granderson: Four leaders who brought Congress low in public esteem remain in place .

"As the White House convened a day-long summit on working families with a heavy focus on work-life balance, I remembered a major survey last year that took issue with the prevailing notion that juggling work and home life is mainly a woman's issue. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 56% of working mothers said it was very or somewhat difficult to balance the responsibilities of their jobs and their families; 50% of working fathers, nearly as many as working mothers, said the very same thing. And when it comes to who is doing more of the telecommuting, another survey also challenges the longstanding belief that it's mainly working moms. By a wide margin, more men than women are working not from the office, but from home, a business center or another location, according to the national survey by Flex+Strategy Group/Work+Life Fit Inc., which works with organizations and individuals to create flexible workplaces. Nearly one-third of the 556 full-time employed adults who were surveyed said they do most of their work remotely, and nearly three out of four of those telecommuters were men. Why do these findings matter? Because too often, when work-life balance is discussed among policymakers, in the media, even online, the general sense is that it's primarily a concern of women, especially working mothers. ""The significance of the research is that it proves that the way we think and talk about work-life flexibility doesn't track with reality,"" said Cali Yost, chief executive officer and founder of Flex+Strategy Group/Work+Life Fit Inc. ""As a result, both business and people aren't reaping the rewards of a more thoughtful, deliberate, strategic approach to managing work and life."" And when these misperceptions are held by C-suite executives, they can dramatically impact how far organizations might go to create more flexible workplaces for their employees. ""An everyone issue"" Consider a recent analysis of interviews with nearly 4,000 executives worldwide conducted by Harvard Business School students from 2008 to 2013. Both male and female executives considered the ""tension between work and family to be primarily a woman's problem,"" according to the report. ""As Rebecca Traister recently pointed out in the New Republic, when we're trying to solve the problem of not enough women in the upper echelons of business, tech, and politics, we always direct these conversations at women themselves,"" wrote Jessica Grose for Slate earlier this year. ""But the problem here isn't women's lack of ambition or, necessarily, their lack of support at home. The issue is that we need to get men to acknowledge work-life conflicts as an everyone issue, not a women's issue or a mom's issue,"" wrote Grose. Craig Cincotta, vice president for brand communications for Porch.com, an online home improvement network, said in today's 24/7 connected world, work-life balance becomes an issue for nearly everyone, women and men. WATCH: Why Zuckerberg's sister says to log off . ""In my experience people often feel the need to be accessible at all times to demonstrate their commitment to the job,"" said Cincotta. ""Answering e-mail at 3 a.m. becomes a badge of honor. When that becomes the societal norm, it makes it hard for people to find a healthy work-life balance."" Jennifer Styles, a co-owner and managing partner of The Workshop Collective, a marketing, public relations, design and Web development firm, said work-life balance is an issue for both genders, and not just working parents. ""I am not a parent. I am a co-owner of a company with over 20 employees (who are my family) and I feel guilty not 'working' all the time or being readily available for my team during all hours of the day,"" said Styles on Facebook. ""I try not to look at my phone after 9 p.m. but it is a challenge. ... Most business owners don't have the choice to not respond to their team/clients in a timely fashion."" Weakened commitment to flexibility? After Marissa Mayer of Yahoo! banned working from home shortly after taking over as the company's chief executive officer, many women and men wondered if more companies might follow her lead and move in the direction of less flexibility as opposed to more. The results of another survey by Flex+Strategy Group/Work+Life Fit Inc. show that, at least as far as employees' perceptions are concerned, that might be the case. While 97% of those surveyed said they had some flexibility at work, more than four out of ten said they perceive a ""waning commitment"" to flexibility at their company, according to survey results released in May. In addition, only 40% of those surveyed who had work-life flexibility received any guidance or training from their employer on how to use work-life flexibility most effectively. What all this means, said Yost, the expert on workplace flexibility, is that the majority of workers with flexibility ""are flying by the seat of their pants and are not optimizing the flexibility they have to benefit themselves and the business."" ""Everyone loses ... including women,"" she added. No ""one size fits all"" approach . Cincotta of Porch.com says as a manager and leader within his company, he wants to help people find work-life balance -- or life-work balance, as he thinks we should call it. But he says it's an issue that each person has to define for himself or herself. ""We cannot expect a 'one size fits all' approach to the solution,"" said Cincotta. ""Maybe it is working from home one day a week, perhaps it is a commitment not to check mail on the weekend. Whatever the solution people fundamentally develop as their own, they need to identify and respect the boundaries required to make it effective."" Expanding the conversation about work-life balance to include men and people without children can lead to more workplace changes that benefit more employees, men and women I talked with say. It can also provide more opportunities for working parents, especially mothers who would choose to continue their professional paths if they and their partners had more flexibility to balance the demands at home. ""Having a partner split the child-rearing duties enables you to juggle your art/career/work with the responsibilities and fun that come with raising a child,"" said Amy Glazer, who is head of the theater program at San Jose State University and the mom of a college-age son. ""The beauty of actually dividing the parenting labor, although it's chaotic, is that when the child grows up, as my child has -- we both still have careers to come back to and the nest is too busy to feel empty.""

"After two grueling months with no word from their loved ones, relatives of those on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will have to wait two more months before the search resumes underwater. The Bluefin-21 drone is completing its final mission in the Indian Ocean on Wednesday, marking the end of the underwater hunt -- for now. With no tangible evidence found by the drone, which costs an estimated $40,000 a day to operate, search officials are regrouping and preparing to deploy more high-tech equipment. Only a handful of companies have such devices, which will likely include towed sonar, an autonomous underwater vehicle with mounted sonar and optical imaging equipment, Australian officials said. Soliciting those companies and negotiating contracts will take time, and officials have said they want a single private contractor to lead the next stage of the search. That phase, which aims to scour 60,000 square kilometers, probably won't start for at least two months. The cost? About $60 million. Uncharted territory . In the meantime, China is using a specialized ship to map the ocean floor in a remote part of the Indian Ocean -- something that's never been done before. While the Bluefin-21 can provide greater resolution than deep-towed sonar devices, the drone could only go about 4.5 kilometers deep. It's unclear how deep the water is in the expanded search area because ""it's never been mapped,"" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said earlier this month. China's Zhu Kezhen ship will be joined by a contracted commercial survey vessel in June, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said. While 26 countries have participated in the hunt for the missing plane, Malaysia, China and Australia have held high-level talks about the future of the search. Malaysia is where the the plane is from, China had more than 100 passengers on board, and Australia had six passengers on board and is close to the stretch of the Indian Ocean where searchers have focused their hunt. Australia has estimated the next phase of the search will cost $60 million, with the breakdown of exactly who's going to pay for what yet to be determined. Satellite data released . With the underwater search on hiatus, analysts are combing through a 47-page document containing hundreds of lines of communication logs between the plane and the British company Inmarsat's satellite system. Relatives of passengers have been clamoring for the release of satellite data for months. It was the satellite data, along with other information, that led officials to zero in on a search area in the southern Indian ocean. And some families suspect officials may be searching in the wrong spot. But the document released Tuesday doesn't provide the whole picture. It's ""intended to provide a readable summary of the data communication logs,"" notes at the beginning of the document say. Some passengers' families, unsatisfied by the official explanation of the plane's fate, say they want an independent analysis of the complex information -- a process that could take weeks. CNN safety analyst David Soucie said certain key elements, which would allow independent experts to fully test the official conclusion, are missing from the data in the document. ""There's not enough information to say whether they made an error,"" he said. ""I think we're still going to be looking for more."" Inmarsat CEO Rupert Pearce acknowledged Tuesday that the company didn't release the model to which it applied the data to estimate the plane's path -- and said the decision on whether to release the model lies with the Malaysian government, which is leading the search. ""We'd be perfectly happy to put that model out,"" Pearce told CNN's ""New Day."" But Pearce also said the publicized data, along with engine and radar data, are enough for experienced third parties to plug into their own models and reach their own conclusions. Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was on the missing jet, said she was ""annoyed"" that Inmarsat and Malaysian authorities hadn't released everything they used to reach their conclusions. ""I see no reason for them to have massaged this before giving it to us,"" she said. Regardless of what information has been released, two pressing questions remain -- where is the plane, and what went wrong? Is Inmarsat right? Did Inmarsat data point Flight 370 searchers in wrong direction?","The Bluefin-21 drone wraps up its final underwater mission Wednesday .

"Washington (CNN)Josh Perry is a lanky, 26-year-old from Nederland, Texas with a good job on Capitol Hill and a healthy adoration for Taylor Swift. And every day, he pretends to be Ted Cruz on the Internet. As Cruz's in-house digital strategist, it is Perry's job to channel the freshman senator online, engage activists on Twitter and Facebook and promote Cruz's media appearances and speeches. In just a few years, Cruz has gone from working as the state Solicitor General and as a corporate attorney to become one of the most talked-about politicians on the Web. Cruz began traveling to Iowa and New Hampshire in 2013—and his many conservative fans are eager to see him run for president. Perry joined Cruz in the early days of his Senate campaign in 2011, when Cruz was an unknown candidate with little hope to defeat the establishment-backed Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. Perry's responsibilities on the campaign were two-fold: Help manage Cruz's online presence and drive him to events around the state. On the day of Cruz's first debate, Perry was driving Cruz in Houston when he ran a red light while fiddling with a GPS. An oncoming vehicle slammed into the driver's side of his Dodge Caliber with a brutal crunch. No one was seriously injured, but it left $8,500 in damage to his car. Perry says he was ""unceremoniously promoted"" after the accident--to behind a computer. ""It was amazing how quickly we decided I should focus full-time on just the digital stuff rather than driving him around as well,"" recalled Perry, who had driven Cruz around the state for ten months. While Cruz says he's on Twitter ""constantly"" through his iPhone, the senator leaves much of the leg work to his old driver, Josh Perry, who condenses the long-winded lawmaker into 140-character bites. ""Out of any staff in the office, Cruz trusts Josh the most with his voice,"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told CNN. ""Josh understands his voice and understands what he would want to promote."" According to data from Facebook and Twitter provided to Politico in December, Cruz is mentioned more on social media than any other politician. Between Sept. 1 and Dec. 1, Cruz's accounts were mentioned on Twitter, 4.5 million times, which is 1.7 million more than former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and 2.6 million more than the closest Republican, Rand Paul. Cruz's most popular tweets, unsurprisingly, tend to be when he sounds the most uncompromising. His most retweeted post in 2014 included a call to impeach Attorney General Eric Holder; on Facebook, a joke about President Obama being the worst president in history received nearly 80,000 ""likes"" and more than 18 million impressions on the site, according to data provided by Cruz office to CNN. That cohesion between Cruz and Perry dates back to the countless hours the duo spent alone together crisscrossing Texas during the campaign. Perry accompanied Cruz to scores of events and quickly memorized every line of Cruz's old speeches. Perry, who prefers to stay behind the scenes as much as possible—he declined to be interviewed on camera--says part of the secret to Cruz's success online is his willingness to engage on issues that supporters are eager to discuss. ""Half the time if you try to force issues and force messaging that's not what your activists want to talk about, you're doing damage to yourself,"" Perry said. ""If you had somebody who didn't speak as well [as Cruz] or have the same type of personality, I could see it being a lot more difficult. I think that's definitely a big part of it. But you've also got to know who your audience is and speak to them."" That approach, however, has left Cruz with a list of enemies in Washington, where some in his own party sees him as a rabble-rouser and an ideologue who refuses to compromise. ""If you're from Texas, that's the right thing to do. That's what they expect you to do,"" Perry said. It's easy to see why Cruz and Perry get along so well. In college, Perry was a member of the ""Young Conservatives of Texas,"" a group traditionally known to be more conservative than the College Republicans at the University of Texas in Austin. As a point of personality, Perry also knows a thing or two about being a troublemaker: Late last year, he logged onto Frazier's Twitter account when she was away from her desk and posted a string of silly tweets full of emojis and a solicitation of advice for where she could get a good dye job in Washington. ""Don't ever leave your computer unlocked around him,"" she tweeted after the prank. Perry got his start with the Texas Republican Party before joining Austin-based Harris Media, a digital strategy firm founded by GOP strategist Vincent Harris, who directed Cruz's digital operations until late last year. Last November, Harris, a digital whiz who deserves a great deal of credit for Cruz's success online, made a surprise move to work for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a potential future rival if both men run for the Republican presidential nomination. Perry said he didn't see it coming. ""We had just been meeting about some of the stuff that we would've liked to get done and then it just came out of nowhere,"" he said. ""It's been a little interesting since he left to go do Rand's stuff, but we still talk. We get along fine. No bad blood there."" In an email to CNN, Harris praised Perry's work, but predicted that Cruz would face serious competition in the online space if he competes in 2016. ""Josh has always worked incredibly hard and he has done a great job of remembering the importance of engagement when it comes to social,"" Harris said. ""It has been a space that Senator Cruz has excelled in since 2011 but I'm certain that it's going to get harder for them as other big names with big brands join the fray."" While Harris' departure came as blow to Cruz's operation, it put Perry in a position to play a stronger role in the senator's day-to-day online operation. Cruz's online break-out moment came in September 2013, when the senator began a 21-hour filibuster in protest of the presidents health care law on the Senate floor. Not knowing that his boss would remain on the floor for such a long time, Perry manned the Twitter feed through the night. Watching from a TV in his office that broadcast the Senate floor proceedings, Perry spent the night tweeting Cruz's best lines. Cruz had mentioned his admiration for how Paul had spent part of his filibuster earlier that year to read tweets from supporters. So before the speech, Perry put out a call on Cruz's Twitter account asking people to tweet at his account about Obamacare. Perry printed out the best submissions and ran them to the Senate Cloak room near the door of the Senate, where another staffer picked them up and put it in front of Cruz. ""Obamacare,"" Cruz said, reading from the tweet on the paper. ""Ain't nobody got time for that."" Perry immediately clipped a video of Cruz reciting that quote—a reference to a popular Internet video about a woman who described escaping a fire--from the Senate floor feed, uploaded it to YouTube and tweeted the quote from Cruz's official account. Today, it has nearly 900 retweets. Perry remembers the moment fondly as his contribution to American political history. ""No matter what else happens, 'ain't nobody got time for that' is in the congressional record because of lowly ol' me,"" he said. It wouldn't be the last time Perry would thrust Cruz into the pop culture conversation. Perry is an obsessive Taylor Swift fan—and yes, this began before she branched out from the country music scene, he'll have you know—and he uses every opportunity he can to incorporate her into his work. In November, Cruz tweeted an auto-tuned video of Jonathan Gruber, the MIT professor who helped construct Obamacare, using the beat from Swift's ""Shake it Off."" During Cruz's Senate campaign, Perry made a point to see four Swift concerts in Texas in less than two months. Colleagues say he even logs into Taylor Swift fan message boards, and his personal Twitter page is full of Swift music videos, GIFs and photos. ""I admit I probably like Taylor Swift more than I should,"" he said. His adoration seems to be spreading throughout the Cruz office, where a 2015 Taylor Swift calendar—courtesy of his colleague, Frazier--hangs on the wall. In December, the Cruz staff Twitter account posted a Vine clip from the ""Shake It Off"" music video of Swift, dancing in a leotard while singing, ""Can't stop cruising..."" When he's not thinking of Ted Cruz or Taylor Swift, Perry's head is in space. Perry, a self-declared NASA geek, originally planned to study aerospace engineering in college, but he switched to political science.  The shelf near his desk is decorated in toy spaceships that he's collected over the years, and his personal Twitter page, beneath the bio, ""I like space • Life is better in GIFs • Pardon my Texan"" is full of pictures of space shuttles (interspersed between Taylor Swift GIFs and emojis.) In early December he even traveled to Cape Canaveral, Fla. to watch the Orion space shuttle launch, which, of course, he live-tweeted. Perry's space knowledge may come in handy next year, because Cruz is next in line to be the chairman of the Senate Space and Science subcommittee. That, however, may not be the most exciting part about Cruz's year in 2015. Cruz is considered a possible presidential contender, and if he runs, Perry said he believes Cruz's digital groundwork that has served him so well in Texas would be ready to go national. ""Should it go that way,"" he said, ""we'd be in a good place to do it."" And for that campaign—if it happens--Perry won't be anywhere near a steering wheel.","26-year-old Josh Perry is the person Ted Cruz trusts most to speak for him online.
Cruz is a possible contender for president in 2016, and the most talked-about politicians on the Web."
"A Michigan referee of an adult-league soccer match died Tuesday, two days after being punched in the head by a player, authorities said. John Bieniewicz, 44, died at Detroit Receiving Hospital from injuries suffered in what police said was an unprovoked attack. The blow left the victim unconscious and not breathing on the field, Livonia Police Chief Curtis Caid said. After the attack, the player fled the field and waved his middle finger at the crowd. Bieniewicz was in critical condition when he reached the hospital and was pronounced dead Tuesday morning. ""John Bieniewicz was a man who lived life to the fullest,"" friends wrote on a website dedicated to his memory. ""He had a passion for his family, a passion for the kids at Mott Children's Hospital, and a passion for soccer. John died doing what he loved: Officiating a soccer game."" The Wayne County Medical Examiner's office will determine the cause of death, according to Livonia police. The alleged attacker, Baseel Abdul-Amir Saad, 36, was charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder. He was being held on $500,000 bail, police said. He pleaded not guilty. The investigation is ongoing and authorities ""anticipate the criminal charges to be modified as a result of Mr. Bieniewicz's death,"" police said. Defense lawyer Brian Berry expressed his condolences to the family of the referee, but also said all the facts in the case had not come out and that ""witness accounts may have been miscategorized."" A hearing was set for July 10. Bieniewicz is survived by his wife and two sons, age 13 and 9. On the website, the Bieniewicz's friends remembered him and sought to raise money for his family. The site said Bieniewicz was a licensed soccer referee at all levels, professional, collegiate, high school and children's leagues, was president of the Metro Detroit Soccer Officials Organization, and sometimes refereed three games on a Saturday. ""He also took a particular interest in all the children he worked with Monday thru Friday at the pediatric dialysis center at Mott, and reveled in their improvement and happiness,"" the site said. The site added, ""The boys will miss his fatherly guidance and support but they will also miss his financial support, and we are here to help that in a small way. If you were touched by John, or merely share his love of soccer, we ask that in his name you donate to his children's futures."" Last year, a 17-year-old soccer player in Utah pleaded guilty to homicide by assault in the death of referee Ricardo Portillo. A judge ordered the teenager, who was not named publicly, to keep a picture of Portillo in his cell for the remainder of his time in juvenile jail. The judge recommended a sentence of three years, said Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill. The teen also was ordered to write weekly letters to Portillo's family, telling them what steps he is taking to return to normal life.

"(CNN)It's official -- world football's controversial leader Sepp Blatter is set to enter the enemy's lair just weeks after accusing UEFA of plotting to depose him. The FIFA president is prepared to the risk of public humiliation in Vienna next month as he faces the three men who plan to usurp him with European governing body UEFA considering giving each candidate the chance to make their case at its congress on March 24. FIFA confirmed to CNN that Blatter plans to be in Austria for the congress as he steps up his campaigning to retain the presidency. With 209 federation votes at stake, the candidates will have the opportunity to influence over a quarter of them as they address UEFA's 54 member nations at an event that would be broadcast online. Seeking a fifth consecutive term in office at the age of 79, Blatter is facing challenges from Jordan's Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, Dutchman Michael van Praag and former Real Madrid and Barcelona star Luis Figo. All three of Blatter's opponents have declared their willingness to take part in a live debate with the Swiss, who has previously rejected such offers by claiming football should not ""imitate politics."" That's a reference to the political debates, for example in the United States and Britain, where politicians slug it out in front of the cameras ahead of elections. While Prince Ali has called for an open debate and Van Praag even suggested a Google hangout, UEFA is examining the possibility of giving each candidate an allotted amount of time to outline their plans to repair FIFA's battered image. The world governing body's reputation has been dragged through the mud by the furor over alleged corruption surrounding the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. That criticism reached a fever pitch when the man brought in by FIFA to investigate, U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia, resigned in protest last year, unhappy that his published summary did not accurately reflect his findings. While an actual debate is unlikely at this stage, the opportunity for Blatter's opponents to speak to congress and potentially highlight the incumbent's failings right in front of him could potentially prove embarrassing to the Swiss. Speaking at his campaign launch in London on Tuesday, Prince Ali threw down the gauntlet to Blatter, suggesting an open debate between candidates should take place. ""If we are talking about transparency, I would like to see, at least before the elections a public debate, including the incumbent,"" Prince Ali said. ""If we talk about reform, proper reform, I'm not confident I've seen it. He's had the chance to do it,"" added Prince Ali referring to Blatter. ""We've also had promises from him that he would not run again. He has been the president and, definitely, the president needs to be held responsible for what happens."" Both Prince Ali and Jerome Champagne, who failed to gain the required number of backers to qualify for the election, have been scathing over FIFA's image in recent days. In an open letter, Champagne said that he was unable to collect the five nominations needed as a number of associations feared they would be punished for supporting him. ""I warmly thank the three federations that have endorsed me and the many presidents who explained, with candor and friendship, that they could not do it despite their interest in my program,"" he wrote. ""The reasons were numerous. Because they feared reprisals from their confederations having issued 'recommendations.' ""Because their federations were candidates to host continental competitions. Because they relied too heavily on the financial support. Because they were committed to defend a united continental front."" Prince Ali has gone as fas as to suggest that FIFA is run by a ""culture of intimidation"" with some national associations fearing retribution if they back any other candidate other than Blatter, though the Jordanian didn't provide specific examples. FIFA declined to comment when contacted by CNN over Prince Ali's ""intimidation"" reference. Allegations of corruption have blighted Blatter's 17-year reign and Michel Platini, president of UEFA, has been outspoken of his desire to see the Swiss removed from the top of world football. Blatter is aware of Platini's stance and speaking to CNN last month, he insisted UEFA was waging a campaign to depose him. They want to get rid of me,"" he told CNN. ""All this opposition is coming now it's unfortunate to say it, it's coming from Nyon, from UEFA. They don't have the courage to come in. ""So let me go (on) -- be respectful! Because in football you learn to win but you also learn to lose. So I'm going now. If I win the better, if I lose OK!""","Sepp Blatter could face his presidential rivals in Vienna next month .

"(CNN)Last Wednesday, the number was 59. Nine days later, there are 91 cases of measles in California. The California Department of Public Health sent out the latest numbers Friday of confirmed cases since December and while the total is still small, the jump was a startling 54% in just more than a week. Most cases -- 58 -- are linked to an outbreak at Disneyland in mid-December. Health officials said 40 of the cases were employees or park patrons, while 18 of the cases were secondary infections. The new numbers include two cases in Marin County, near San Francisco, where one parent of a 6-year-old has asked school officials to bar any children who have not been vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Father asks school district to ban children who haven't been immunized . ""Fortunately, there is no need to exclude any students from a Marin County school at this time as there is no evidence for school-based exposure,"" the county public health office said in a statement. The two measles patients are siblings, both of whom are unvaccinated. Their cases are related to the outbreak at Disneyland. CNN affiliate KGO reported the children aren't going to school and aren't in the county. The health department said 63% of the people with measles are more than 20 years old. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. Opinion: Why I won't let unvaccinated people around my kids . The disease outbreak became apparent when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from December 15 to December 20. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said. Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, which means it is no longer native to the United States but continues to be brought in by international travelers. Arizona measles exposure worries parents of at-risk kids . Last year, the United States had its most number of measles cases -- at 644 -- since 2000, the CDC says on its website. In the first 28 days of January alone, 84 measles cases were reported in 14 states, including California, according to the CDC. The larger California statistic that the state released Friday encompasses December and January. New cases are being reported regularly, as are public notices for those who might have interacted with infected people. For example, the New York state health department on Friday announced a new measles case in Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, which is 100 miles north of New York City. The infected student rode Amtrak train No. 283 from New York City's Penn Station, a train that went to Albany and eventually to Niagara Falls. The CDC recommends that children get two doses of the MMR vaccine beginning at 12 months, with the second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years old. Infants 6 to 11 months old should get the vaccine before international travel. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.","Number of cases rises by 54% in nine days .

"The U.S. government moved on Friday to essentially prohibit the sale or distribution of three synthetic forms of marijuana, also known as ""fake pot."" The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a legal notice classifying the substances as Schedule 1 drugs. It said they are popular on the street and represent a serious public health issue. The Justice Department, working with federal health officials, has determined the  substances, with street names like Spice and K2, have resulted in many visits to emergency rooms or calls to poison control centers. Teen narrowly escapes death after smoking synthetic marijuana . The most common reactions are vomiting, anxiety, hallucinations, seizures, high blood pressure, or loss of consciousness, the DEA said. Officials say nearly all the synthetic marijuana mixtures are imported from Asia — mostly China and India. Five other forms of ""fake pot"" were banned two years ago, authorities said. The posting of the notice on Friday means the prohibition can take effect within 30 days.","Drug Enforcement Administration and Justice Department take action .

"(CNN) -- Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has delivered an emotional tribute to friend and fellow cricketer Phillip Hughes at his funeral, telling mourners he felt his spirit with him. Breaking down at times, Clarke spoke of visiting the pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground where Hughes fatally injured when hit by a ""bouncer"" -- a short-pitched, aggressive delivery that bounces up towards the batsman's torso -- while batting for the South Australia side against New South Wales. ""I walked in the middle of the SCG on Thursday night, those same blades of grass beneath my feet where he and I and so many of his mates here today had built partnerships, taken chances, and lived out the dreams we painted in our heads as boys,"" said Clarke. ""The same stands where the crowds rose to their feet to cheer him on, and that same fence he sent the ball to time and time again, and it's now forever the place where he fell."" He continued: ""I stood there at the wicket, I kneeled down and touched the grass. I swear he was with me, picking me up off my feet to check if I was okay, telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea."" In a tribute referencing the ""spirit of cricket"" and the outpouring of grief from the sport's fans around the world in the wake of Hughes' death, he said his friend had ""left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment."" ""I don't know about you, but I keep looking for him. I know it's crazy, but I expect any minute to take a call from him, or to see his face pop around the corner,"" said Clarke, who also acted as a pallbearer. ""Is this what we call the spirit? If so, then his spirit is still with me, and I hope it never leaves."" Hughes' funeral service took place Wednesday in a packed school hall in his home town of Macksville, New South Wales -- a small town on Australia's eastern coast, where he was raised on a banana and beef farm. Other mourners gathered to watch from the school fields outside, while Australian television broadcast the funeral live. It was also screened on big screens at Australia's major cricket grounds. Delivering a eulogy on behalf of the family, his cousin, Nino Ramunno, remembered the cricketer as ""a young kid from the country who dared to dream big."" He recalled how his cousin was introduced to cricket through backyard cricket games with his brother and neighbors in the country. ""There was no quarter either asked or given in those backyard test matches,"" said Ramunno. Although initially reluctant to take part, Hughes took to the sport with a passion, and never looked back. OPINION: The unspoken 'if only' in Hughes' death . The left-handed batsman represented Australia in 26 Tests, the highest standard of the game, after making his debut in 2009 at the age of 20. Australian cricket writer Gideon Haigh told CNN that although Hughes, who was named Australia's domestic cricket player of the year in 2013, had been dropped from the national side on occasion, ""no one seemed to doubt that he was a character that we would be watching for the next 10-15 years."" ""No one had a greater appetite for the game,"" said Haigh. ""He had that drive, he had that enthusiasm."" Hughes' cousin Ramunno spoke of his response to those setbacks in his career. ""I never, ever once heard him complain about being dropped from the Australian team,"" he told mourners. ""He believed he would come back bigger and better, and continuing to pile on runs."" Hughes' friend, Corey Ireland, recalled the cricketer's love of Angus cattle -- and a deal he made with himself to add to his herd every time he scored a century, an innings of 100 runs or more. ""His herd grew very quickly,"" said Ireland. A host of past and present Australian and other international cricketers attended the funeral -- as did Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The streets of Macksville were decorated with cricket bats, following a social media-led tribute using the hashtag #putoutyourbats. There were also numerous references to the numbers ""408"" -- Hughes was the 408th Australian Test cricketer -- and ""63 not out,"" the score Hughes was on when injured. Haigh told CNN that cricket fans and the wider Australian public were ""all making it up as we go along"" in terms of mourning Hughes, he said. ""People want to make some form of communal gesture,"" he said. ""It's unprecedented in any era for a player of his profile to have been cut down in his prime in this way.""","Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes' funeral took place in his hometown Wednesday .

"Washington (CNN)While Mitt Romney announced he wouldn't run for president on Friday, he had personally come to that decision a week prior -- well before he made campaign-style stop in Starkville Mississippi, on Wednesday that kept the national press scrutinizing his every statement for any hints about his political future. He shook hands and took selfies with young voters, attacked Hillary Clinton in a high profile speech, and laid out his thoughts about foreign and domestic policy—all signs that suggested he was gearing up for a third presidential bid. But a closer look at the day's events—and the benefit of hindsight—reveal some clues that Romney knew at the time he wouldn't be throwing his hat in the ring. He talked more about the past than the future . Speaking at Mississippi State University, Romney spent the first half of his speech talking almost entirely about his 2012 campaign when he was the Republican nominee. Many of the light-hearted and funny moments in the speech occurred while Romney used self-deprecating humor to describe the last presidential cycle. ""You may not have heard: I lost,"" Romney said towards the beginning of his speech. He drew a big laugh from the audience when he said a supporter once advised him to stop shaving so he can ""grow a little more stubble for a few days to look more sexy."" ""As if I needed that,"" Romney continued flatly. He lovingly recalled people he met on the campaign trail, labeling some of his most devoted followers in Iowa and New Hampshire ""heroes"" because they adamantly supported someone they believed in. He described the campaign as one of ""the most remarkable of my life's journeys"" but spoke with a tone of finality when recalling that it would eventually come to an end. ""What we knew at the beginning was that win or lose, any acclaim would eventually be forgotten,"" he said. ""As the 1940s song Jimmy Durante used to sing: 'Fame if you win it, comes and goes in a minute.'"" Granted, it's a line he has used in previous speeches, but it's an example of how he was in a reflective mood. He declined to answer a question from the moderator about how he would run a potential campaign differently from 2012—""That's another question I won't answer""—and went on to talk about how Republicans should do better at having a ""clear and compelling message,"" especially when talking to nontraditional GOP voters, like minorities and young people. He even suggested that Republicans have ""to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election."" That's pretty bold—if not daring—talk for a potential candidate. Jeb Bush, for example, got hammered in the conservative media for making a similar suggestion back in December. Romney appeared to sound more like he was angling to become a kingmaker than a candidate. He continually referred to a need for ""strong leaders"" and ""leadership"" but didn't narrow down his remarks to talk rhetorically about a single leader. His policy ideas were vague . It was on that very topic—minority outreach—that political observers were most closely trying to examine Romney's recent statements and comments. He won only 6% of the African American vote and 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012. Speaking to the Republican National Committee earlier this month, Romney suggested the party needed to focus more on anti-poverty policies, and in his speech on Wednesday he laid out some of his ideas for tackling the issue. But his ideas were vague and lacked the kind of depth that would churn more interest in a potential campaign. He argued that the government, for example, was providing incentives for single mothers to stay on federal assistance and avoid marriage because they could lose their benefits once they became married. ""If marriage ... is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty, then we want to do the opposite,"" he said. ""We want to create incentives for them to get married, not to not get married."" He also said K-12 education needs to improve, and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who haven't worked before, but didn't outline specifics.

Rand Paul -- who have made efforts to address poverty through criminal justice reform. Mystery and pulled pork . Romney was noticeably more relaxed, not only in his speech, but at a barbecue joint he stopped at earlier in the day to meet with voters. He joked with the national reporters following him in the cramped space that there's an ""unwritten rule"" that politicians shouldn't be photographed while eating. But he continued to eat anyway. ""Do you still consider yourself a politician, then?"" one reporter asked, to which Romney replied: ""You're taking my picture. What can I say?"" Another asked if this is ""the new Romney,"" noting that he appeared not to care that he was eating before the cameras. ""I didn't know I had a choice,"" he shot back, drawing some laughs. A conversation Romney had with Mississippi State football coach Dan Mullen at the table also seemed to provide a window into perhaps some bitter feelings Romney still has about coverage from 2012. In politics, Romney argued, there's too much emphasis on what a person says, rather than what a person does. ""It'd be nice if people who run for office, that their leadership experience and what they've accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on, but it's not,"" he said. ""It's mostly what you say."" What you do, Romney told Mullen, ""is a lot more important that what you say,"" noting how a football coach's reputation is almost entirely based on his record. ""You could be the sweetest talking person in the world, but unless you got a record, you're in trouble,"" he said. Still, he was doing a meet-and-greet—in his jeans and a plaid shirt like he used to—and anyone watching him could have walked away thinking this was a ""go."" The mystery of his barbecue outing--the will he or won't he--was perfectly captured in a response Romney gave to one man who urged him to run again. ""You're very kind,"" Romney replied, patting the man on the arm. ""I wish I were there right now, I gotta tell ya."" CNN's Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","Mitt Romney announced Friday he won't run for president again -- a decision he made a week ago .

"(CNN)While President Barack Obama said he is committed to withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by 2016, leaving local security forces in charge of their country's own policing, the newly elected Afghan president said Obama should ""re-examine"" his timeline.

"An investigation into an Oklahoma dentist accused of potentially exposing patients to disease confirmed one case of patient-to-patient hepatitis C transmission, health officials said Wednesday. A total of 89 of W. Scott Harrington's patients tested positive for hepatitis C, but at this point only the one case has been directly tied to his dental practice in suburban Tulsa, officials said. Four cases of HIV were also found in his patients; the CDC is conducting genetic testing to determine whether those cases are tied to the dental office. ""This is the first documented report of patient-to-patient transmission of hepatitis C virus associated with a dental setting in the United States,"" state epidemiologist Dr. Kristy Bradley said. ""While dental procedures are generally safe, this reinforces the importance of adhering to strict infection control procedures in dental settings."" State health investigators shut down Harrington's dental practice in March -- and asked 7,000 of his patients to be tested for hepatitis and HIV -- after health officials found sterilization and other infractions at the oral surgeon's offices. Investigators observed ""unauthorized, unlicensed"" employees using IVs to sedate patients and improper handling of needles. The drug cabinet was also rife with issues, they said. ""I will tell you that when ... we left, we were just physically kind of sick,"" Susan Rogers, executive director of the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry, told CNN earlier this year. ""That's how bad it was, and I've seen a lot of bad stuff over the years."" The dentistry board launched its probe after one of Harrington's patients came down with hepatitis C. The Oklahoma Public Health Laboratory has since completed testing for 4,202 of his patients. An unknown number of patients also sought testing though their private health providers, health officials said. Scores of Tulsa dental patients tested for hepatitis, HIV exposure . Harrington voluntarily surrendered his dental license on March 20. Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that can lead to liver failure and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 70% to 80% of people living with the virus do not have any symptoms. Hepatitis B is a similar liver disease that can range from a mild illness to a serious, chronic condition. Hepatitis is of particular concern for the Baby Boomer generation -- people  born between 1945 and 1965. This population is five times more likely to have hepatitis C than other generations, the CDC says. More than 55% of Harrington's dental patients who have been identified as having hepatitis C were over the age of 50, the Tulsa Health Department reports.","One case of patient-to-patient transmission of Hepatitis C linked to dental practice .

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN)Eugene de Kock was the most notorious assassin of South Africa's apartheid era, commanding a death squad that kidnapped, tortured and killed black activists. His nickname: Prime Evil. After apartheid fell, he was put on trial and sentenced in 1996 to two life sentences plus 212 years in prison. But de Kock showed remorse, meeting with victims' families, some of whom publicly forgave him, and helping the Missing Persons Task Force locate bodies, a fact noted by South African Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha. ""In the interests of nation building and reconciliation,"" Masutha said Friday, he was granting parole to de Kock. De Kock was a police officer who ran the C10 counterinsurgency unit, designed to battle the foes of apartheid, including members of the African National Congress. He operated from Vlakplaas, a farm outside Pretoria. When apartheid fell and the ANC gained control of the government, de Kock cooperated with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, established in 1994 to achieve full disclosure of apartheid-era misdeeds. De Kock was convicted of murders, such as the deaths of five unarmed people in a van in 1992, and many other crimes. He was sentenced in 1996 after an 18-month trial. South Africa doesn't have the death penalty. In asking for a mitigated sentence, de Kock said the unit he commanded ""was established with the full knowledge and approval of senior government officials and police generals,"" according to the ANC's webpage. Masutha granted de Kock's request that the date and conditions of his parole not be made public.","Eugene de Kock had been sentenced to two life sentences, plus 212 years .

"(CNN)The terrorist who gunned down four people at a kosher market in eastern Paris earlier this month recorded the attack on a camera, a U.S. intelligence official told CNN on Friday. The information backed up a report by Eric Pelletier, a national security reporter at the French magazine L'Express, who wrote that Amedy Coulibaly recorded seven minutes of the attack, including the moments when he killed three people. Citing a French source close to the investigation, Pelletier reported Friday that Coulibaly was able to use a computer at the market to email a copy of the attack video before he was killed by police. Coulibaly was carrying the GoPro camera on his torso during the January 9 attack and subsequent standoff, the source told L'Express. French investigators have viewed the recording, said Pelletier, who shared details of his reporting with CNN. But a second police source told L'Express Saturday that it could not yet be determined whether Coulibaly had managed to email out the video. ""There is a strong probability that this video may have been transmitted to a recipient and not to a traditional media outlet,"" an investigator told L'Express. The investigator expressed his fear to see that video surface online one day. The source said French investigators have examined computers recovered from the grocery store and are looking into what accomplices Coulibaly may have connected with around that time. Several survivors said Coulibaly tried to connect to the Internet on his own computer but failed. He then went to a second computer in the store after forcing a hostage to help him. He inserted his memory card into the computer and appeared to be manipulating video or image files on the computer. Coulibaly reportedly had proclaimed his allegiance to ISIS. He is believed to have killed a policewoman a day before the market attack. Officials said they believe Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly's widow, may have played a role in the plans and has fled to Syria. Two days before Coulibaly was killed, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi attacked the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people and injuring 11. They died the same day as Coulibaly as police moved in to end a separate siege.","Amedy Coulibaly killed four people at store .

"When federal safety investigators meet on Tuesday to determine the cause of the Asiana Flight 214 crash, they will have studied not only last summer's deadly accident but also a little-known incident years earlier. In August of 2010, Eugene Francis Arnold, one of the Federal Aviation Administration's top test pilots, was descending into Seattle's Boeing Field when he leveled off to avoid another plane. To his surprise, his speed fell 10 or 15 knots below his target speed, even though he believed the jet's automated speed control, or auto-throttle, was engaged. Arnold pushed the throttle manually to increase the plane's speed and landed safely. Arnold, investigators believe, experienced the same type of ""mode confusion"" that caught Asiana's pilots off guard -- at a much lower altitude -- shortly before they plowed into the sea wall at San Francisco International Airport. In both cases, the pilots believed they had selected modes of autopilot and auto-throttle that would ""wake up"" the auto-throttle if necessary, much as a car's cruise control kicks in when the car heads uphill. But they hadn't. Complex system . There lies the big question before the National Transportation Safety Board when it meets Tuesday: Is Boeing to blame for creating a system so complicated that it befuddled even a top FAA test pilot? Are the pilots to blame for not understanding the intricacies of the system and for failing to monitor the plane's speed? Or is Korea-based Asiana Airlines to blame for not adequately training its pilots? At a December hearing on the crash, experts told the safety board that while automation has vastly improved aviation safety, it has a flip side. The same technology that makes it possible for pilots to fly coast to coast without touching a yoke are complicated and hard to master. Thus, flying is getting easier and harder at the same time. ""Automation can be extremely supportive of human operators if it is designed properly,"" expert Nadine Sarter of the University of Michigan testified. ""But we also have seen in a number of incidents (where) automation can actually get in the way."" ""We have heard things like 'clumsy' automation, where automation ... helps the most when the pilot actually might need the help the least. But when they need the help the most -- in very time-critical conditions -- it might be very difficult for them to actually operate the automation,"" she said. Different opinions . Not surprisingly, Asiana Airlines, the pilots union, and Boeing, which manufactured the 777 involved in the crash, have starkly different opinions of what role the pilots played in the crash, and the role of automation. ""The airplane and all airplane systems were functioning as expected prior to impact and did not contribute to the accident,"" Boeing said in a March submission to the safety board. The accident was caused by the pilots' failure to monitor and control the plane's airspeed and direction, and could have been avoided if they had initiated a timely go-around. Asiana, meanwhile, blamed Boeing and the pilots. The pilots, just three months before the accident, had received ""specific instruction"" about the possibility the airspeed protection would be disabled in a certain mode, Asiana said. The airline assigned blame to the pilots for not ensuring ""a minimum safe airspeed,"" and Boeing for creating an autopilot system that led to an ""unexpected disabling"" of speed protections. The warning system, the airline says, also did not give the pilots enough time to recover. The Asiana Pilots Union blamed crew training, saying pilots were not trained that a combination of autopilot and auto-throttle modes would not prevent the plane from going too slowly. ""In this case, a key piece of information was not provided as part of the normal training program at Asiana,"" the union said. Boeing said it was without fault. ""All airplane systems were functioning as expected prior to impact and did not contribute to the accident,"" it told the safety board. Asked why the ""hold"" mode did not protect against dangerous drop-offs in speed, Boeing told the board, ""To do this would violate (Boeing's) design philosophy: the pilot is the final authority for the operation of the airplane."" ""If the auto-throttle automatically (switched mode to prevent an aerodynamic stall), it would be overriding the crew's selection,"" Boeing said. Fly the plane manually . If pilots are confused by the technology, there is a simple solution: Fly the plane manually, Boeing said. ""This accident would have been avoided had the flight crew followed procedures and initiated a timely go-around,"" Boeing told the safety board. What no one contests is that by the time the plane's captain recognized the plane was traveling too slowly, it was too late. At 11 seconds before impact, the plane's low airspeed alert was triggered. Eight seconds before impact, one of the pilots pushed the throttles forward. But it takes engines seven to eight seconds to spool up from idle to full power. The plane slammed into the seawall, ripping off the landing gear, the tail and both engines. It spun 330 degrees in a shower of sparks and debris. Of the 307 people on board, three died. Almost 200 were injured. Asiana Airlines fined $500,000 for failing to help families . Asiana crash victims sue Boeing .","NTSB votes Tuesday on cause of 2013 Asiana crash in San Francisco .

"(CNN)Ukraine's military said Wednesday that 80% of Ukrainian armed forces have now pulled out of a strategic railroad hub that's been the focus of bitter fighting with pro-Russian separatists. The two sides have been battling for weeks for control of Debaltseve, and continued conflict there has undermined a truce that apparently went into effect Sunday, raising concerns it is all but dead. The ramifications for the West are huge because the 10-month-long conflict in eastern Ukraine has hiked tensions with Russia to a level not seen since the end of the Cold War, affecting trade and raising the specter of Russian expansion into Eastern Europe. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh called the loss of Debaltseve a huge blow to the Ukrainian government and a win for the separatist militants, who regarded it already as their territory when the front lines for the ceasefire were drawn. It's not yet clear how Kiev will respond. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, in a taped statement, said Ukrainian armed forces in the area had left Debaltseve according to plan and that Kiev was waiting for two remaining columns to pull back to the new defensive line. ""Debaltseve was under our control, there was no encirclement, and our troops left the area in a planned and organized manner with all the heavy weaponry,"" he said, according to his office. Poroshenko said in his conversations with U.S. and European Union leaders he had called for ""a firm reaction from the world to Russia's brutal violation of the Minsk agreements,"" referring to the ceasefire agreed upon in Belarus. The President, wearing a camouflage jacket, said he was on his way to the front line to meet with some of the soldiers who have pulled back. ""I will be honored to shake their hands,"" he said. Ukrainian defense spokesman Andriy Lysenko told a Kiev news conference that the ""organized retreat"" from Debaltseve should be complete ""within hours."" The official news agency of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, DAN, earlier quoted separatists as saying there had been a large handover of weapons to the separatist forces in Debaltseve. CNN's Paton Walsh, who is near Debaltseve, said deserted roads in the area are strewn with the wreckage of what, only hours earlier, were Ukrainian military positions. A CNN team passed a checkpoint that had been obliterated as well as an armored personnel carrier that seemed to have been hit by a large explosion. What appeared to be the bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers could be seen there. Only kilometers away from Debaltseve, the kind of intense shelling that would be expected with bitter fighting could no longer be heard. It's not clear where the civilians who were trapped by the conflict will go now, Paton Walsh said. The separatists have said they may try to evacuate them later, he said, but they would have to pass through areas that are still contested. Speaking after news of the withdrawal, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urged Russia to withdraw its forces from eastern Ukraine. ""I urge Russia to withdraw all its forces from eastern Ukraine, to stop all its support for the separatists and to respect the Minsk agreement ... and to also use all its influence on the separatists to make them respect the ceasefire,"" he told reporters in Riga, Latvia. Russia has steadfastly denied allegations by Kiev and the West that it is sending heavy weaponry and troops over the border into eastern Ukraine. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told a news conference in Moscow that Russian President Vladimir Putin had tried to highlight the danger to thousands of Ukrainian troops encircled in Debaltseve before the ceasefire agreement was signed, but that Poroshenko had denied they were trapped. The main goal now must be to save the troops' lives, he said. Lavrov suggested that outside Debaltseve, the weekend ceasefire had taken hold. ""Across all conflict lines we can see hostilities have ceased and heavy armor started to be moved,"" he said. He urged Kiev and the West not to try to use the situation in Debaltseve as ""an excuse to derail the process,"" saying such reasoning had been used in the past to hinder peace efforts. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is tasked with monitoring the ceasefire and a supposed withdrawal of heavy weapons by both sides to create a buffer zone, has not been able to gain access to Debaltseve because of the continued conflict. The chief monitor of the OSCE monitoring mission in Ukraine, Ertugrul Apakan, said Tuesday that he was ""profoundly disturbed"" by reports from the town. His monitors plan to try to gain access again Wednesday. ""I am especially concerned about the civilian population of the town,"" Apakan said. ""The sides have a duty to them as well and to each other to adhere strictly to the ceasefire. ""I condemn any attempts to create new facts on the ground, and so to change the basis on which the latest package of measures has been agreed."" He pointed the finger at the separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk, saying that they had effectively denied the OSCE monitors access to Debaltseve, and urged them to end their offensive and allow ""unfettered access."" EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Wednesday that the separatists' actions in Debaltseve were ""a clear violation of the ceasefire"" and called for the OSCE observers to be allowed in. ""The separatists must stop all military activities. Russia and the separatists have to immediately and fully implement the commitments agreed to in Minsk,"" she said. ""The EU stands ready to take appropriate action in case the fighting and other negative developments in violation of the Minsk agreements continue."" Diplomats in New York scrambled Tuesday to shore up the shaky ceasefire agreement, hammered out by the leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany last week in Minsk. The U.N. Security Council unanimously approved a resolution calling on all parties to abide by the truce, and issued a statement expressing ""grave concern at the continued fighting in and around Debaltseve, Ukraine, which has resulted in numerous civilian casualties."" In a call with Poroshenko, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden warned that if Russia continues to violate the Minsk agreements, ""the costs to Russia will rise,"" according to a White House statement. Lavrov dismissed Biden's words as ""just another example of how the American position is not constructive."" In the beleaguered village of Shyrokyno, Ukrainian forces are struggling to keep control of territory. Mortar shelling and small arms battles broke out in Shyrokyno on Wednesday morning. Two Ukrainian soldiers were injured, Dmytro Chalov, a spokesman for Ukraine's army in the Mariupol sector, told CNN. ""Right now, only about a third of the village is under our control,"" a machine gunner named Yury told CNN's Frederik Pleitgen a day earlier. Oleg Shiryayev, commander of Ukraine's East Corpus battalion, said the ceasefire ""is a farce."" ""The fighting is continuing now the way it did before,"" Shiryayev told Pleitgen. ""They continue to attack us, shell us; they use artillery, mortars."" But it's impossible to tell which side is responsible for breaking the ceasefire in Shyrokyno. To some residents, it doesn't matter. ""The fighting is very heavy. All the windows (of) our house are broken,"" one woman said. ""It is very terrifying. We saved all our lives to buy our house, and now we have nothing."" CNN's Lindsay Isaac, Nick Paton Walsh, Emma Burrows, Holly Yan, Khushbu Shah, Claudia Rebaza and Diane Ruggiero contributed to this report, as did journalists Victoria Butenko and Azad Safarov.","NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg urges Russia to ""withdraw all its forces from eastern Ukraine""

"(CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration stood by its security officers Sunday after a Florida woman complained that her cancer-stricken, 95-year-old mother was patted down and forced to remove her adult diaper while going through security. Reports of the incident took hold in social media, with scores of comments on the topic and reposts appearing hourly on Twitter Sunday afternoon. The TSA released a statement Sunday defending its agents' actions at the Northwest Florida Regional Airport. ""While every person and item must be screened before entering the secure boarding area, TSA works with passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive manner,"" the federal agency said. ""We have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and determined that our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure."" Jean Weber told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Sunday that the security officers may have been procedurally correct, but she still does not believe they were justified, especially given her mother's frail condition. ""If this is your procedure -- which I do understand -- I also feel that your procedure needs to be changed,"" she said. Weber said the two were traveling June 18 from northwest Florida to Michigan, so her mother could move in with relatives before eventually going to an assisted living facility. ""My mother is very ill, she has a form of leukemia,"" Weber said. ""She had a blood transfusion the week before, just to bolster up her strength for this travel."" While going through security, the 95-year-old was taken by a TSA officer into a glassed-in area, where a pat-down was performed, Weber said. An agent told Weber ""they felt something suspicious on (her mother's) leg and they couldn't determine what it was"" -- leading them to take her into a private, closed room. Soon after, Weber said, a TSA agent came out and told her that her mother's Depend undergarment was ""wet and it was firm, and they couldn't check it thoroughly."" The mother and daughter left to find a bathroom, at the TSA officer's request, to take off the adult diaper. Weber said she burst into tears during the ordeal, forcing her own pat-down and other measures in accordance with TSA protocol. But she said her mother, a nurse for 65 years, ""was very calm"" despite being bothered by the fact that she had to go through the airport without underwear. Eventually, Weber said she asked for her mother to be whisked away to the boarding gate without her, because their plane was scheduled to leave in two minutes and Weber was still going through security. By this weekend, the 95-year-old woman -- who was not identified by name -- was doing ""fine"" in Michigan, where her niece and her family  ""was treating her like royalty because they love her so much."" ""My mother is a trouper,"" Weber said. This is not the first time that the TSA's pat-downs of passengers have come under fire, nor the first time that the agency has rallied behind its officers and policy. Last year, the administration announced it was ramping up the use of full-body scanning and pat-downs to stop nonmetallic threats, including explosives, from getting on planes. The goal is to head off attacks such as the one allegedly attempted in Christmas 2009 by Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who allegedly had a bomb sewn into his underwear on a flight from the Netherlands to Michigan. The TSA estimates that only 3% of passengers are subjected to pat-downs -- and then only after they have set off a metal detector or declined to step into a full-body scanner. Yet the new policy has triggered an uproar online and in airports, from a relatively small but vocal number of travelers who feel their rights and privacy were being violated. But the federal safety agency hasn't backed down, making some adjustments but no major changes to its policy. ""Every traveler is a critical partner in TSA's efforts to keep our skies safe,"" Administrator John Pistole, who ordered the new approach, said last fall. ""And I know and appreciate that the vast majority of Americans recognize and respect the important work we do."" More recently, outrage erupted over a video-recorded pat-down of a 6-year-old passenger last April at New Orleans' airport. The video, which was posted on YouTube, shows the girl protesting the search by a female security officer at first, though she complies quietly while it is underway. Pistole addressed this controversy at a Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee meeting last week, explaining the pat-down was ordered because the child had moved while passing through a body imaging machine. He told committee members that ""we have changed the policy (so) that there'll be repeated efforts made to resolve that without a pat-down."" The next day, TSA spokesman Greg Soule said that the new policy -- which will apply to children age 12 and younger -- is in the process of being rolled out. It will give security officers ""more options,"" but does not eliminate pat-downs as one of them. ""This decision will ultimately reduce -- though not eliminate -- pat-downs,"" Soule said.","A 95-year-old woman was held up by TSA officers at a Florida airport, her daughter says .

"The militant group ISIS represents a ""very significant potential threat to homeland security,"" and officials have a ""good sense"" of the individuals from the United States who are trying to travel to Syria and fight with the terrorist group, the secretary of Homeland Security said Monday on CNN. ""They are a dangerous organization that has acquired territory in Iraq and Syria from which they could launch attacks, train, command and control,"" Jeh Johnson said on ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" ""They've demonstrated a depravity and a willingness to kill Americans because they are Americans,"" he continued. ""So we've got to take the fight to this organization."" His comments come as the group has released a new online video in which its leader specifically calls for lone wolf attacks in the United States and France -- two countries that have been conducting airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. Western allies reject ISIS leader's threats . The group has beheaded two American journalists and a British aid worker. Separately on Monday, the French government said one of its citizens was abducted in a mountainous region of Algeria. A video claim of responsibility was later released by the Islamist militant group, Jund al-Khilafa fi Ard al-Jazaair, or Soldiers of the Caliphate in Algeria, whose leader recently pledged allegiance to ISIS. Johnson said Monday that ISIS ""represents a very, very dangerous organization and a very significant potential threat to homeland security."" Asked which group is a bigger threat-- Al Qaeda or ISIS -- Johnson said the United States should carefully watch both. ""We've got to continue to keep our eye on all of this,"" he said. ""We're in an environment now where these groups are competing for recruits, for fundraising and probably attention. So I'm focused on all of it."" The anatomy of ISIS: How the 'Islamic State' is run . At least 100 Americans have either left or attempted to leave to go to Syria and help ISIS, Johnson said. ""From various records and our capability to track the travel of these people through intelligence efforts, we have a reasonably good sense of who we're interested in, who the individuals of suspicion are,"" he added. ""There have been some arrests made already. And we've got to stay focused on it."" Such ""foreign fighters"" are a new concept for counterterrorism efforts, he continued. ""It's not something, for example, that we faced in 2001 on 9/11. This is a new phenomenon,"" he said, adding that their social media capabilities are also a new tactic.","Jeh Johnson says ISIS is a ""very significant potential threat"" to the homeland .

"Smartphone usage has skyrocketed at sporting events, as anyone who's attended a recent game can tell you. Look around the stands and you'll see fans checking stats, sharing pictures on social media, or just killing time between plays. While stadiums have boosted cellular and Wi-Fi infrastructure to keep fans connected during games, there's always the possibility that there won't be enough bandwidth for everyone. That's why on Super Bowl Sunday, the NFL is planning to block live streams of the game inside the stadium. Super Bowl XLVIII, between the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, will be streamed by NFL.com and Fox Sports, but both of those sources will be blocked on the Wi-Fi and cellular networks at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, NFL CIO Michelle McKenna-Doyle told Ars in a phone interview. The NFL.com and Fox Sports blocks will be implemented both for mobile apps and within Web browsers. The decision stems from last year's Super Bowl, when streaming was initially allowed but eventually blocked when it took up too much bandwidth. ""We [blocked] it last year, but we did it on the fly when we started having some challenges. This year we planned ahead to do it,"" McKenna-Doyle said. She said the 82,500-seat stadium will be able to handle 25,000 to 30,000 concurrent Internet users across cellular and Wi-Fi. The NFL didn't tell us what the anticipated speeds are because Verizon, which led the Wi-Fi and cellular buildout, preferred to keep that information under wraps. But the plan is to prioritize upload speeds over download because fans generally spend a lot of time posting photos and statuses to social media. The NFL is providing a Super Bowl app to attendees with an event guide and ""exclusive content,"" but it won't include streaming video or replays. ""While we do know that people like to look at replays on their phones and there are some people who like to stream certain amounts of video in the game, the vast majority of our fans want to watch the game on the field, watch the replays on the jumbo board, and participate in the event more than they want to be checking their phone,"" McKenna-Doyle said. ""While we could have made some of that available, it might have impacted the ability for the majority of the fans to be able to stay connected to social media, tweet, Facebook, that kind of thing."" Big games, big network usage . At last year's Super Bowl, the Wi-Fi network stayed up even during the infamous mid-game power outage. While some attendees told Ars after last year's game that Wi-Fi access was problematic at times, a broadcast engineer we spoke with measured the network at 23Mbps down and 44Mbps up. It's common at high-density events for fans to have trouble sending text messages or uploading photos, McKenna-Doyle noted. Network congestion is especially pronounced at key moments of each game. While attending the final game of last year's World Series at Fenway Park in Boston, I was able to upload, e-mail, and text photos on the cellular network during the game. Immediately after the final out however, fans swarmed the network and uploads became impossible. ""When you can't do the basics, it's all of a sudden not that cool that you can show replays or stream the game,"" McKenna-Doyle said. ""It's a fine balance. We're pushing the envelope every year. As technology gets better and better I'm willing to take more and more risks about what we allow."" McKenna-Doyle is optimistic that multicast technology, as opposed to the unicast tech used today, will limit the amount of data needed for streaming video at future Super Bowls. ""A Unicast transmission/stream sends IP packets to a single recipient on a network. A Multicast transmission sends IP packets to a group of hosts on a network,"" explains network video Visionary Solutions. But that won't be used at this year's game, because multicast streaming isn't commonly supported on smartphones yet, McKenna-Doyle said. Keeping fans connected . The Super Bowl restriction doesn't mean live streaming is blocked at every NFL game. For example, the New England Patriots' app provides access to NFL Red Zone video when users are connected to Gillette Stadium's Wi-Fi network. ""It depends on the stadium,"" McKenna-Doyle said. ""Each team manages every game themselves and they have mobile apps that they run. Some allow it based on their infrastructure, and some block it."" The Wi-Fi network, open to all fans, has about 900 access points, using Cisco equipment powered by the new 802.11ac standard, according to the NFL. Verizon is providing the Internet connectivity, with about 4Gbps coming into the stadium. While Verizon is the lead vendor, all four major carriers invested in upgrading their Distributed Antenna Systems at the Super Bowl site, McKenna-Doyle said. One nicety provided to attendees is a radio providing four audio feeds from Fox, Westwood One, ESPN Deportes, and the in-stadium public address. While it would be possible to provide audio feeds to a mobile app, McKenna-Doyle noted that ""We've always given this radio for broadcast, and fans have told us they really love it."" As usual, the Super Bowl crew will use monitoring tools to identify hacker attacks on the network or technical problems that prevent fans from getting on the Internet. Monitoring user activity helps plan capacity for future events and fix problems as they arise. Network monitoring tools divide the stadium into sectors, and this year ""we cut the stadium into more sectors than we had in the past so we can pinpoint more quickly where issues are in a section of the stadium,"" McKenna-Doyle said. ""If we start to hear we're having issues in a certain part, we can work on a smaller segment of the stadium without it impacting as many people.""","Fans won't be allowed to stream video on their phones at the Super Bowl .

"A gift shop set to open to the public on Wednesday at the 9/11 Memorial Museum has sparked controversy among some victims' families. Among the items sold: hats emblazoned with the FDNY symbol, search and rescue stuffed-dog animals and a slew of books relating to the attack and building of the memorial. Organizers of the museum acknowledge that the cost of operation, about $65 million yearly, will require the support of revenue generated from the gift shop, and the museum's admission fees, with $24 for an adult.  It will also help maintain the free admission to the museum's outside memorial. ""To provide an opportunity to buy a keepsake and have those proceeds support this open and free memorial is something I would do seven days a week,"" said Joe Daniels, president of the National September 11 Memorial Museum. He says the gift shop is situated in a ""respectful space"" in the museum and notes that the No. 1 sellers so far are the DVDs and books they sell that educate the public about the history behind the events of September 11. But some in the 9/11 community are bristling at the idea of monetizing their families' final resting places. ""I think it's a revenue-generating tourist attraction,"" Jim Riches said of the museum. Riches, who is retired from the New York City Fire Department, lost his son, a firefighter, in the attacks. ""Basically, they're making money off of my son's dead body.  I think that's disgusting,"" Riches said. Also at issue? The roughly 8,000 unidentified human remains that will be housed in the museum. Riches likens the accompanying admission fee to ""charging people to get into a cemetery."" ""Let's bring the remains up to a respectable location ... above ground with an eternal light.  Everybody can visit them, you won't pay $24 to get in there,"" he said. But Lee Ielpi, a member of the museum's board of directors who lost his son Jonathan, a firefighter, in the attack, hopes that the revenue generated will help maintain the museum. ""We have an obligation to society ... 20 years from now, we need to make sure the people that step foot on this plaza know where they're stepping and when they go into the entrance and go into the museum, they need to know what they're going to see there,"" he said.

"Australian swimming officials have vowed to ""win back the admiration of a nation"" following the release of a damning report that blamed a ""toxic"" team environment at London 2012 which led to the country's worst Olympic pool performance in 20 years. It was the first time Australia had failed to win more than one swimming gold medal since 1992, and the subsequent independent review revealed problems throughout the team -- from lack of leadership at the top to unacceptable behavior by the athletes. ""Standards, discipline and accountabilities for the swim team at the London Olympics were too loose,"" the report said, having canvassed 94 individuals and received 30 submissions. ""There were enough culturally toxic incidents across enough team members that breached agreements (such as getting drunk, misuse of prescription drugs, breaching curfews, deceit, bullying) to warrant a strong, collective leadership response that included coaches, staff and the swimmers. No such collective action was taken."" Coming soon after this month's government report claiming widespread use of drugs by Australian athletes, it is another serious blow to the country's image of sporting excellence. Swimming Australia said Tuesday it had already begun to address some of the issues raised in the review, and had a 100-day plan to tackle them further. ""Swimming has a proud history in this country and everyone in the sport wants to maintain and improve on the credibility and integrity which has developed over more than a century of success,"" said its president Barclay Nettlefold. ""Before we look at winning gold medals, we want to win back the admiration of the nation, and we want to engage with our swimming community like never before at every level."" One of the review's key criticisms was that team officials had been so focused on winning gold medals that the morale of the athletes suffered. Swimmers complained of being ignored if they failed to achieve expected standards, describing it as the ""Lonely Olympics"" and the ""Individual Olympics."" ""Things were quiet and weird when someone lost. You just sort of went to your room and got out of the way,"" said one in the report. Some respondents felt that team officials were only interested in presenting the most well-known swimmers to the media, with 24 of the 47-strong squad being first-time Olympians, while some did not turn up to support their colleagues on race days. ""The consequence was an undertone of divisions, now and then, us and them, men and women, the best and the rest,"" the report said. ""Poor behavior and disrespect within the team were not regulated or resisted strongly by other team members, and it was left unchecked or without consequence by staff and coaches on a number of occasions. ""Some individual incidents of unkindness, peer intimidation, hazing and just 'bad form' as a team member that were escalated to personal coaches were not addressed and had no further consequence."" These problems were magnified by a lack of control of the team's social media activities, the report said. Emily Seebohm claimed her overuse of Twitter cost her a gold medal in the 100 meters backstroke event in which she was favorite, while Stephanie Rice made headlines after posting a picture of herself in a skimpy bikini just before the Games. Teammates Nick D'Arcy and Kenrick Monk were forced to remove a picture they posted online showing them with weapons in a U.S. gun shop. They were banned from using social media at London 2012. ""The media search for controversy is nothing new, but London was the first Games where the influence of social media was so dramatic,"" the report said. ""Some athletes engaged deeply in public debate on what they were doing, how they were doing, and even on who they actually were as individuals. This served to fuel emotions, good and bad, at a time where calmness, intensive focus and consistency should have prevailed. ""Social media also allowed already disconnected athletes to seek support from sources external to the team, which again diminished the reliance on a unified team."" The report said the lack of team spirit was partly caused by letting the swimmers prepare under individual programs with their own coaches, which caused a disconnect at all levels of the squad. Meanwhile, the Olympic village environment was described as ""mayhem"" and ""a candy shop of distractions."" ""Fragmentation was compounded in the absence of familiarity and sufficient opportunities to connect formally and socially. Greater cohesion as a team would have needed to be intentional and cultivated by design,"" the report said. The Australian Sports Commission welcomed the review's findings. ""Swimming Australia has already commenced recruitment for a new high performance director and has also taken steps to improve its relationship with key stakeholders,"" said ASC chief executive Simon Hollingsworth. ""This report is a clear message to Swimming Australia to continue its reforms to enable it to return to the top table of international swimming.""","Independent review criticizes ""toxic"" culture of Australia's Olympic swimming team .

"Two more HIV patients have no signs of the virus in their blood following bone marrow transplants, according to the Boston researchers who treated them. However, experts stopped short of calling the two cured and said the treatment is not a viable option for the majority of HIV patients. The findings were presented Wednesday at the International AIDS Society Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The two men, whose identities are being withheld, had been on antiretroviral (ARV) drug therapy for years before being diagnosed with lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes. Both underwent intensive chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplants to treat the cancer. They remained on antiretroviral therapy. Approximately four months after the transplant doctors were still able to detect HIV in their blood, but six to nine months later, all traces of the virus were gone. ""Because of those findings, we thought it was justified to take the patients off of their therapy to see what happens,"" said Dr. Timothy Henrich, who conducted the clinical trial. ""Now, in a normal person who has HIV, who has been on long-term antiretroviral therapy for years, usually the virus comes back within two to four weeks after stopping therapy, it comes right back. "" Some patients make it up to eight weeks before the virus returns, said Henrich, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, but the virus returns eight to 10 weeks after therapy is stopped in the vast majority of patients. HIV discovery 'will change your life forever' Not so for these two, however. ""We are now recording 15 weeks after therapy and eight weeks after therapy for our two patients, and to date we are unable to detect HIV rebounding in the bloodstream after we stopped the therapy,"" Henrich said. ""We do weekly monitoring, as well. We've been looking at the virus in the blood and the cells in the blood essentially every week since we've taken them off therapy, and we have not been able to detect virus at this time."" The two men are being compared to Timothy Ray Brown, also known as the ""Berlin Patient."" Brown is thought to be the first person ever ""cured"" of HIV/AIDS. In 2007, Brown had a stem cell transplant to treat his leukemia.  His doctor searched for a donor with a rare genetic mutation called CCR5 delta32 that makes stem cells naturally resistant to HIV infection. Today, the virus is still undetectable in Brown's blood, and he is still considered to be ""functionally cured.""  A functional cure means the virus is controlled and will not be transmitted to others. The stem cell transplant procedure, however, is very dangerous because a patient's immune system has to be wiped out in order to accept the transplant. Using a bone marrow transplant to treat HIV is not a feasible treatment for most patients, and only 1% of Caucasians -- mostly Northern Europeans -- and no African-Americans or Asians have the CCR5 delta32 mutation, researchers say. The transplant is still not a practical strategy for the majority of HIV patients, and the risk of mortality is up to 20%, Henrich says. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, agreed. ""This is not a practical approach for someone who does not need a stem cell transplant since the transplant and its preparation and its subsequent need for chronic immunosuppression is a risky procedure,"" Fauci said. ""If you have an underlying neoplasm (tumor) like these patients had, then the risk outweighs the benefit,"" he said. ""However, if you are doing well on ARVs and you merely want to get off antiretroviral therapy, then the risk seems greater than the benefit."" HIV 'cure' in toddler offers 'global hope' Even though the two patients showed a reduction of the virus in the blood, it could still be in some tissue -- the brain or gastrointestinal tract, for instance, Henrich said. The virus ""could certainly return,"" he said. ""It's possible, again, that the virus could return in a week, it could return in a month -- in fact, some mathematical modeling predicts that virus could even return one to two years after we stop antiretroviral therapy, so we really don't know what the long-term or full effects of stem cell transplantation and viral persistence is."" Still, he feels the information will help move the curative field of HIV research forward. ""We're going to learn different strategies about how we can attack the viral reservoir, how we can harness the immune system better and what exactly caused the lack of virus in the two patients at least in the short term."" Earlier this year, researchers said an HIV-positive baby in Mississippi was given high doses of three antiretroviral drugs within 30 hours of her birth, with doctors hoping that would control the virus. Two years later, there is no sign of HIV in the child's blood, making her the first child to be ""functionally cured"" of HIV. The Foundation for AIDS Research, or amfAR, helped fund the study. ""These findings clearly provide important new information that might well alter the current thinking about HIV and gene therapy,"" said amfAR CEO Kevin Robert Frost. ""While stem cell transplantation is not a viable option for people with HIV on a broad scale because of its costs and complexity, these new cases could lead us to new approaches to treating, and ultimately even eradicating, HIV."" ""Dr. Henrich is charting new territory in HIV eradication research,"" said Dr. Rowena Johnston, amfAR vice president and director of research. ""Whatever the outcome, we will have learned more about what it will take to cure HIV.  We believe amfAR's continued investments in HIV cure-based research are beginning to show real results and will ultimately lead us to a cure in our lifetime."" In the meantime, Henrich says he and other groups are actively enrolling patients for these types of studies.

"Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 broke apart in the air after it was hit by a burst of ""high-energy objects"" from outside, a preliminary report by Dutch aviation investigators said Tuesday. Flight 17 came down in eastern Ukraine on July 17 in an area controlled by pro-Russian separatists. Of the 298 people killed, around two-thirds were Dutch. The U.S. and Ukraine have accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane with a missile. The Dutch Safety Board report supports the theory of a warhead exploding in close proximity to the passenger jet, but it doesn't point any fingers at who might have fired it. ""Anybody who's looking for blame, or somebody who says that the rebels did it or that somebody else did it, is going to be disappointed,"" said CNN Aviation Correspondent Richard Quest. ""That's not what this report says."" Plane pierced 'from outside' The Boeing 777 ""broke up in the air probably as the result of structural damage caused by a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside,"" a press release accompanying the report said. ""There are no indications that the MH17 crash was caused by a technical fault or by actions of the crew,"" the statement said. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said the report ""leads to the strong suspicion that a surface to air missile brought MH17 down, but further investigative work is needed before we can be certain."" The separatists, who deny responsibility for bringing down the plane, took control of the crash site for weeks, combing through the wreckage and hindering access to investigators. The flight recorders, generally known as black boxes, weren't handed over to international investigators for several days. But the Dutch report says investigators found ""no evidence or indications of manipulation of the recorders."" It said there was no sign of any audible alerts or of any malfunction or worries communicated between the crew on the flight data recorders. Why does crash report avoid the word 'missile'? Unable to visit site . The Dutch investigators say they still haven't been able to visit the site amid the unstable situation in eastern Ukraine. ""Coordinated access to the wreckage site by the international team of air safety investigators has not yet been possible,"" it said. ""It is the intention of the Dutch Safety Board to visit the site whenever it is possible to safely conduct further investigation of the wreckage."" The investigation team had to rely on photographs of wreckage taken by officials from Ukraine's National Bureau of Air Accidents Investigation during a series of short visits to the site in July, the report said. The Dutch investigators set out a list of areas that still need further investigation, including forensic examination of wreckage and any foreign objects found.","Anyone ""looking for blame ... is going to be disappointed,"" CNN's Richard Quest says .

"Washington (CNN)White House officials pressured Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel to increase the pace of detainee transfers from the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay, the outgoing secretary acknowledged to CNN's Barbara Starr in an interview Friday. Those comments come just one day after reports surfaced that a Guantanamo detainee released as part of the deal that freed American POW Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl may have sought to return to militant activity. ""Not everyone at the White House has agreed with me,"" said Hagel of his methodology for deciding on detainee releases. The outgoing secretary also said the United States could find it necessary to send noncombat troops to the front lines in Iraq to help Iraqi troops in their fight against ISIS. ""We have to look at all the options, and I think it may require a forward deployment of some of our troops -- not doing the fighting, not doing the combat work that we did at one time for six years in Iraq and we did for many, many years in Afghanistan, but to help airstrike precision (locate targets),"" he told Starr. ""I would say, though, we're not there yet. Whether we get there or not, I don't know,"" Hagel added, reiterating his position on the issue. In November, Hagel acknowledged the possibility of ground forces in Iraq but said these would not be combat troops. That same month, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, told a congressional committee that he would not rule out asking the President to send U.S. ground troops into Iraq. Throughout the hearing, Dempsey and Hagel described a mission in Iraq and Syria that will likely be long and fraught with setbacks. Disagreements between Hagel and officials in the President's inner circle have been widely reported during his short tenure as secretary of defense. But in his interview with CNN, Hagel spoke with uncharacteristic candor about friction related to the prisoner release. ""We've had a lot of conversations,"" Hagel said. ""With the White House?"" Starr pushed back. ""Yes,"" said Hagel. ""And Congress. And the press."" But Hagel also said he isn't fazed by the pressure on the issue of detainee transfers. ""Because I have the responsibility and I play my own game here,"" he emphasized. ""And that is because, by law, I am the one official in government charged with certification of release of detainees. I take that responsibility very seriously."" Debate about detainee transfers was rekindled Thursday when news emerged that one of the five former prisoners freed to Qatar in exchange for Bergdahl's release by the Taliban may have attempted to rejoin the fight by making contact with suspected Taliban associates in Afghanistan. Detainee swapped for Bergdahl suspected of militant activities . The administration insists that the released detainees are being monitored, and officials remain confident the potential risks are mitigated by the measures they have in place. In his interview with CNN, Hagel echoed that view, and said he has no regrets about making the deal. ""Absolutely it was the right decision,"" he said. ""It was the right decision ... because we don't leave our troops behind."" ""It was a prisoner of war exchange and I'm absolutely as committed to that decision today as when the decision was made."" he added. ""It was the right decision."" And when the White House ramped up pressure, Hagel said he knew how to take the heat. Said Hagel: ""If you're not prepared to deal with pressure, every day, in the job you're in, coming from a lot of different directions, then you shouldn't be in the job. It's just part of the process, part of any job I think."" Who were the detainees swapped for Bergdahl? Hagel's candor as he prepares to leave the Pentagon was evident on other issues as well. He was blunt in addressing the budget cuts the military has grappled with in recent years as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan draw to a close. ""I am concerned about the future of our force, the quality of that force,"" said Hagel, adding that he hears frequently from soldiers who worry they won't have the same career prospects in the military they'd have in the private sector. About half of those soldiers say they plan to leave the military as a result, he added. ""I don't think Washington understands the depth of that issue because that's a difficult quantifiable issue,"" Hagel said. ""It's not a budget line."" The secretary also addressed the ongoing fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, where the United States is leading an international coalition to take on the terror group. ISIS poses a threat to U.S. interests, Hagel said, but the problem cannot be solved using military power alone. ""Big societal problems -- historic injustices, conflicts -- don't get solved militarily,"" said Hagel. ""There is a military component to it, of course. But it's going to require -- always does and always will -- political settlements."" And that military component comes with risks, Hagel acknowledged, even when the United States doesn't commit ground combat troops. ""Any time you introduce American military power anywhere in the region ... there's always risk,"" he said. ""There's risk to our people in Iraq, to our people in Afghanistan, to our people who are conducting strikes in Syria."" It's a risk the secretary understands well, having been a soldier during the Vietnam War. ""I think it has helped me a tremendous way to connect with second- and third-level issues of the men and women and their families who make the sacrifices,"" Hagel said of his experience in the military. ""I think I understand it."" ""It doesn't mean I'm any better,"" he added. ""It doesn't mean I'm any smarter. But I think I understand it maybe in ways that I might not otherwise unless I had served."" From soldier to secretary of defense -- it's a transition even Hagel could not have imagined for himself during his time in uniform. ""Had I been told 48 years ago when I joined the Army I would end up being secretary of defense,"" he said, ""I just would have laughed.""","U.S. eventually may find it necessary to deploy noncombat troops to Iraq front lines, Hagel says .
Hagel says ""not everyone at the White House"" has agreed with him on how to release detainees .
But Hagel still backed the White House on the decision to swap a Gitmo prisoner for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl ."
"(CNN)Roger Goodell has made a lot of noise lately telling the world how much the NFL has changed when it comes to respecting women. The commissioner tells us he has had an epiphany since his botched decision-making in the Ray Rice domestic abuse case and the resulting backlash from well beyond the sports world. Since then, Goodell said he has visited shelters and spoken to abused women and saw the pain and despair that come to families when women are not valued. His mission is to make amends. He's updated the personal conduct rules to include a mandatory, six-game, unpaid suspension for personnel who violate the league's domestic abuse policy. And Goodell wants to make it absolutely clear that the NFL culture has no room for abusive attitudes or behavior toward women -- who are the fastest-growing NFL demographic, making up 45% of the more than 150 million American fans. It all sounds nice. But strangely, that changed man was nowhere in sight this week as Goodell responded with not only disrespect but disdain when CNN reporter Rachel Nichols respectfully questioned him during the NFL State of the Union press conference during Super Bowl week in Phoenix. Nichols was correct to ask Goodell about the league's conflict-of-interest problem as it pertains to the internal investigation process in cases of domestic abuse, or allegations of cheating on the field, such as Deflategate. ""When you do something like hire an outside investigator like Ted Wells into the Patriots investigation, you're still paying him and Robert Kraft, who owns the Patriots, is paying you,"" Nichols said, referring to Wells, who is investigating Deflategate. ""What steps can you guys take in the future to mitigate some of those conflict-of-interest issues?"" Nichols was spot on. Not only did she raise a legitimate concern but she struck at the heart of the ""integrity"" issue plaguing the league. An issue Goodell says he wants to address. But it seems he only wants to address the problem on his own terms. ""Somebody has to pay them, Rachel, and unless you're volunteering, which I don't think you are, we will,"" was Goodell's snarky and condescending response. Roger has a lot to learn. The first step toward respecting women begins in the workplace -- valuing our voices, our intelligence, and our hard work -- especially when it goes against the grain in a male-dominated culture. Our innovation should be encouraged. Clearly, the commissioner is struggling with this part. Instead, Goodell gave viewers a look at what happens to women in his workplace when they dare to challenge norms, or challenge him. Hearing Goodell's response, I cringed. And if Twitter is any indicator, so did many women and many men who understand the code language of the Boys Club. @espn1420 tweeted: ""So, Roger Goodell got defensive, then he actually attacked Rachael Nichols' integrity...getting a little nervous, Mr. Commish?"" From @janesports: ""Given that Rachel Nichols is trending, I'd say Roger Goodell undermined that message of humility and change. #NFL"" For many women who've worked in corporate America, Goodell's chastising sounded familiar. We have all been there. The belittling comes in many forms. And it is often constant. For me, while at ESPN, it was a senior colleague who liked to speak for me at meetings whenever he thought an idea I suggested or a comment I made was out of line and did not fit his agenda. ""What Rox means is ..."" he'd offer with a chuckle, before completely taking over the conversation. Never mind that we weren't friendly enough for him to give me a pet name, or, that he could have no possible idea what I meant since we'd never spoken about the topic at hand. It took me a few years to build enough confidence to counter my colleague, by saying -- 'No actually, I meant exactly what I said. But thank you for having my back on this ...' Luckily for me, most of the men I worked with at ESPN were respectful and supportive. Pet names, talking over you, and belittling your questions as Goodell did with Nichols, are common strategies men sometimes use to degrade women in the workplace and label us not ready to play with the big boys. Nichols handled Goodell's slight with grace. She said nothing and instead let him indict himself with a string of sarcastic comments. Good move. Everyone in that room knew Goodell was out of line. And worse, his comments were bad for business. The NFL's future depends on women. In fact, from 2009 to 2013, female viewership overall was up 26%, compared with an 18% rise for men. Yes, women are changing the game. And we demand respect. But we realize that shifting a culture is not easy. Long-held attitudes will not disappear overnight. But with the right leadership, change can slowly happen one day at a time, one mind at a time. So let's give the commissioner credit. He's realized that negative attitudes about women need to change around the league. It just hasn't dawned on him yet how closely we are all listening and watching his every move. And it will take more than a compelling TV commercial and star-studded, multimillion-dollar marketing campaign to convince women that the NFL is serious about respecting us. Roger Goodell will have to show us that his own actions can live up to his lofty words.","CNN reporter Rachel Nichols calls out Roger Goodell at a press conference .

Northern white rhinos and southern white rhinos are different subspecies genetically. Last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature declared the northern white rhino as ""teetering on the brink of extinction."" Rhinos are killed by poachers almost exclusively for their horns, which sell for tens of thousands of dollars. Experts say that rhino horn is becoming more lucrative than drugs. The demand is driven primarily by buyers in East Asia, who believe it cures a series of ailments. Organized crime syndicates are using military-grade helicopters, night-vision equipment and guns fitted with silencers, taking rhino poaching to a whole new level and leaving conservationists struggling to keep up.

"This has been a big week for food product recalls and the risk of food borne illness. Seven confirmed and three likely cases of E. coli infection linked to raw clover sprouts have been reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. The patients are all in either Idaho or Washington. Half the people who have fallen ill have been hospitalized. Preliminary investigations indicate the likely source of this outbreak are raw clover sprouts produced by Evergreen Fresh Sprouts LLC of Idaho, the CDC said. The state departments of health in Washington and Idaho are telling consumers not to eat raw clover sprouts produced by Evergreen Fresh Sprouts. Meanwhile, hummus and dip products totaling about 14,860 pounds are being voluntarily recalled by Lansal Inc. amid concerns about possible bacterial contamination. At the same time, Sherman Produce is recalling some bulk and packaged walnuts sold to retailers in Missouri and Illinois. These two recalls are precautionary measures against possible Listeria monocytogenes, which may cause serious and even fatal infections in people with weakened immune systems, such as the elderly. No illnesses have been reported in connection with either recall, the respective companies said. Both companies advise consumers who bought the recalled products to throw them out or return them for a full refund. The products should not be eaten. Also this week, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said 1.8 million pounds of ground beef products were being recalled because they could be contaminated with a strain of E.coli. Consequences of food-borne bacteria . Escherichia coli is a large group of bacteria; most are harmless, while some can cause serious illness. The strain involved in the sprout-linked outbreak is Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O121. E. coli infection can lead to severe diarrhea, abdominal pain and vomiting, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Most people recover within seven days, but some have severe complications, the CDC said. A type of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic syndrome may result; the elderly and children under 5 are most at risk. Most listeria infections may not be noticed because the symptoms are mild, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms of a listeria infection in an otherwise healthy person include fever, muscle aches, stiff neck, headache, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Diarrhea or other gastrointestinal problems may occur before these symptoms. Pregnant women infected with listeria may suffer miscarriages, premature delivery or stillbirths. The newborn may have a serious infection if the mother has been sick with it. Why sprouts? Evergreen Fresh Sprouts was also involved in a 2011 salmonella outbreak. Consumers then were discouraged from eating the brand's alfalfa sprouts and spicy sprouts. Sprouts have a history of being involved in bacterial infection outbreaks. According to a study commissioned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the warm, moist conditions that are conducive to growing bumper crops of sprouts are also an ideal breeding ground for bacteria. In the study, Kevin Allen, a microbiology professor at the University of British Columbia, tested 44 samples of prepackaged sprouts (as well as 48 samples of leafy greens and 58 samples of various herbs) and found, ""Over 78% of sprouts had levels of microorganisms too numerous to count."" Why sprouts make you sick . Hummus and dips . In the case of Lansal, the Texas Department of Health identified the potential for listeria contamination while routinely testing a Target Archer Farms Traditional Hummus product. ""Lansal Inc. is voluntarily recalling all products manufactured at the same facility and distributed to both wholesalers and retailers during the same time,"" the company said.

"The largest study of mental-health risk ever conducted among the U.S. military has found that many soldiers suffer from some form of mental illness, and rates of many of these disorders are much higher in soldiers than in civilians. The study's findings, related to suicide attempts and deaths, were released in a series of three reports published in this week's edition of JAMA Psychiatry. Authors found significant differences in the rates of disorders like major depression, intermittent explosive disorder and post-traumatic stress, said Harvard epidemiologist Ronald Kessler, the lead author on one of the studies. Almost 25% of nearly 5,500 active-duty, non-deployed Army soldiers surveyed tested positive for a mental disorder of some kind, and 11% within that subgroup also tested positive for more than one illness. Some of those conditions are related to the hard experience of a wartime Army, but Kessler said nearly half of the soldiers who were diagnosed with a mental disorder had it when they enlisted. ""Obviously, the kind of person who joins the Army is not the random person in America. You're patriotic and adventurous and maybe a little more aggressive,"" he said. But the rates of conditions like attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder and intermittent explosive disorder in the study matched a pattern researchers also found in the newest recruits. ""We've gone back to some new soldiers the very first day they're in the Army,"" said Kessler, the McNeil Family professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. ""They get their hair cut, they get their blood tested and they sit down and talk to us -- and they have the same high rates."" At the Pentagon, Lt. Col. Cathy Wilkinson said the Defense Department is reviewing the results and would work to include them into the military's mental health procedures. ""Our most valuable resource within the department is our people,"" Wilkinson said in a statement issued to CNN. ""We are committed to taking care of them, and that includes doing everything possible to prevent suicides in the military."" The rate of major depression is five times as high among soldiers as civilians; intermittent explosive disorder, which results in episodes of extreme anger, is six times as high; and post-traumatic stress disorder was nearly 15 times higher than among civilians, the study found. Much of the data used in the reports was taken from the Army's STARRS (Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers) survey of almost 5,500 soldiers. The project was collaboration between the U.S. Army and the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health.  The survey looked at disorders that included clinical depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder and PTSD.  Authors also noted that alcohol and drug use were common. When it came to suicidal thoughts, one study found about 14% of soldiers had thought about taking their lives, while 5.3% had planned a suicide and 2.4% had actually made one or more attempts. Most suicides occurred back home, not in Afghanistan or Iraq, and the rate has increased among troops who have never been deployed overseas, Kessler said. Despite concerns about the effects of multiple combat tours and shorter stints at home during more than a decade of war, Kessler said veterans appear to fare better than younger soldiers. Those who suffer from mental health problems are ""substantially less likely"" to re-enlist, while troops on their second or third hitch are more likely to enjoy Army life. ""If you can get them through the first tour, if they deploy, they come back and they decide they want to sign up again, those are the people who have lower rates,"" he said. The problems are largely among ""the young guys who are in their first tour, who don't know what they're getting into."" But overall, the three papers painted a disturbing picture of the military and mental illnesses. Although the causes for the rise in Army suicides still remain unknown the authors hoped their data might be useful to the military to help develop outreach programs for new soldiers as well as those who are already in the service. ""These studies provide knowledge on suicide risk and potentially protective factors in a military population that can also help us better understand how to prevent suicide in the public at large,"" said National Institute of Mental Health Director Dr. Thomas R. Insel. Kessler said the Army ""does a very good job"" of making mental health services available to its soldiers and encourages them to step forward when they have a problem. But he said the study shows how many people are coming into the service ""with emotional problems that need to be addressed in the United States."" ""We've got to figure out some ways to get people early in the process, as part of the process, saying, 'Look, you're making yourself the most complete soldier, the most effective person. You've got to prepare yourself mentally, as well, and be willing to admit that everybody has problems,' "" he said. At last, suicides among military family members could be tracked .

"(CNN)Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, is ending his weekend program on Fox News -- effective immediately -- as he contemplates another run for president. ""I won't make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them,"" Huckabee wrote in a letter to supporters Saturday evening released before his show started airing. ""The honorable thing to do at this point is to end my tenure here at Fox so I can openly talk with potential donors and supporters and gauge support,"" he added. On his Saturday night program, titled ""Huckabee,"" he said goodbye to viewers while insisting he hadn't made up his mind yet about actually running. He put it this way: ""As much as I have loved doing the show, I cannot bring myself to rule out another presidential run. Oh, to be clear, I'm not making that announcement right now."" He said he'd probably continue to make guest appearances on Fox -- ""I hope so!"" -- and he thanked the network's chairman Roger Ailes for ""the past six and a half years of support."" Some of Huckabee's rivals might say the weekly platform on Fox — where he reached about 1.3 million viewers — gave him a leg-up. In a recent CNN/ORC poll about potential Republican presidential candidates, Huckabee received the support of 6 percent of respondents, putting him tied for fourth place. RELATED: CNN/ORC Poll: Bush surges to 2016 GOP frontrunner . On Saturday afternoon Huckabee had urged his followers on Facebook and Twitter to tune in for an announcement ""that will make news for sure."" In his subsequent letter, he wrote, ""As much as I have loved doing the show, I love my country more, and feel that it may be time for me to enter a zone of comfort to engage in the conflicts that have almost destroyed the bedrock foundations of America."" ""I feel compelled to ascertain if the support exists strongly enough for another Presidential run. So as we say in television, stay tuned!"" A spokeswoman for Huckabee reaffirmed that he would make a decision about a run by ""late spring."" But by quitting the program now, Huckabee avoids further questions about the conflict between his television perch and a tantalizing bid for the presidency. Those questions arose two months ago after The Washington Post reported that Huckabee was rebuilding a political team. It has been no secret that Huckabee has been pondering another run for president. He has been holding meetings with GOP donors and recruiting staffers for a potential campaign. But he has been ""very careful about this"" -- his words, in an interview with The Washington Post, in November -- because of the potential conflict between his television show and a campaign. Huckabee mounted an unsuccessful run for the Republican nomination in 2008. Later that year, he started to host the show. Amid speculation about a possible run in 2012, he teased an announcement in May 2011 but ended up telling viewers that he'd opted against a bid: ""All the factors say 'go' but my heart says 'no.'"" Political prognosticators have said that a Huckabee run is more likely this time around. After The Post story in November, a Fox News executive said the network was ""taking a serious look"" at his political activity and ""evaluating his current status."" In the past, Fox has terminated the contracts of employees who take clear steps toward political candidacies, by forming an exploratory committee, for instance. In early November it severed Ben Carson's contributor contract. RELATED: Ben Carson leaves Fox News, mulls run . Fox said nothing further about Huckabee's status until Saturday, when a network spokesperson confirmed that it had ""amicably parted ways with Huckabee."" Huckabee, in his on-air sign-off, positioned it the same way. ""I agree with Fox that this is the right thing, and now is the right time,"" he said, while acknowledging the network's ""generous paycheck."" While hosting a show and abiding by Fox's restrictions, he said, it is not ""possible for me to openly determine political and financial support to justify a race."" Now that process will presumably begin. Huckabee is already scheduled to visit Iowa later this month. He also has a new book coming out. So what will Fox do with Huckabee's time slot? A spokesperson said the network would run ""various specials"" for the next few weeks and try out ""a few new ideas."" Ashley Killough and Peter Hamby contributed to this report.","Mike Huckabee told his TV viewers and emailed his supporters that he was ending his show and considering a 2016 bid .

"Being in the middle of an animal sanctuary in Jakarta, Indonesia was a huge change from the rugged Sumatran jungle where the Expedition: Sumatra crew and I had spent the last week and a half. We didn't set out to go to an animal sanctuary during Expedition: Sumatra. One of the local people we were working with suggested it while we were filming in the rainforest. We had a few hours in the schedule between leaving Jambi and flying out of Jakarta, so we decided to go see some of the animals we weren't able to see while we were exploring. Read more: The devastation of Indonesia's forests . We had a few obstacles to overcome, as usual, like rain and the nightmarish Jakarta traffic, but we arrived at Taman Safari Indonesia around lunchtime. At first, this seemed like a typical zoo tour. But, the head of Taman Safari Indonesia had other plans for us. We were going to see the highlight of the work being done at this facility: the animals bred in captivity to help preserve the species. We went to this small playroom which was the baby animal nursery. Here, there were a few caretakers and several Sumatran orangutan babies. There were also three baby cats: a leopard, a Bengal tiger and a Sumatran tiger. Philippe Cousteau and I did a debrief interview for the last show of Expedition: Sumatra and we talked about the experience at Taman Safari Indonesia. We didn't include it in the show, but he described the scene: . ""We get in and the whole crew, everybody's eyes just got big and there's lots of giggling and energy. People were shaking. Oh my goodness. These are just the most adorable things on the planet."" Read more: The battle to save Sumatra's elephants . It's an experience none of us will ever forget. Each of us was able to hold one of the tigers. We even talked about what it would be like to be baby animal caretakers. After the initial excitement wore off, Philippe reminded us that this is ultimately a sad situation. The Sumatran tiger cub had a defect in its back leg and was rejected by its mother. The orangutans were orphans. These animals will grow to adulthood and likely never live in the wild. The greater purpose of this nursery of babies is to make sure their species doesn't go extinct. It's a reminder of the tragic circumstances going on in the rainforst of Sumatra right now. If wildlife habitat cannot be saved, this kind of facility could be the only place where Sumatran tigers, orangutans and elephants will live.

"Most anyone who has snacked on a Samoa or thrown down a Thin Mint knows they can be hard to resist. But selling them? One Girl Scout in Oklahoma has found that she, too, just can't get enough. Having broken her state record for cookie sales two years running, Katie Francis did herself -- and everyone else, ever -- one better this year by selling more than 18,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies. ""I'm really, really happy,"" the sixth-grader told CNN affiliate KOCO. ""I can go around knowing that I now hold a world record."" The Girl Scouts, of course, are about more than baked goods. Since its founding in Savannah, Georgia, in 1912, the group has grown in its mission to give millions of young women a forum to build ""courage, confidence and character,"" according to its website. That said, especially in recent decades -- and perhaps especially for those not directly involved in scouting beyond buying a box -- the Girl Scouts have also become synonymous with Do-si-dos, Tagalongs, Trefoils and other popular cookies. Selling them is important to local councils, bringing in money that's used to offer scouting opportunities for some, maintain camps and the like. Cookie sales' importance is one reason why, every year, you can reliably see Girl Scouts out and about asking you to buy a box. Katie Francis, though, officially took salesmanship to a whole new level. ""Katie is an example of the entrepreneurial spirit and can-do attitude that exemplifies Girl Scouts,"" the organization's CEO, Anna Maria Chavez, said Tuesday. In her four years as a cookie-selling scout, the member of Troop No. 3469 has always been a big-time seller. This time around, she decided to go even bigger -- aiming for not just a state record, but a world record. Why? Her mother, DeLee Francis, told KOCO admits, ""It's very time consuming, and it takes a lot of energy, and a lot of adrenaline."" Thankfully, the northwest Oklahoma City resident doesn't seem to be lacking in the energy or eagerness department. ""Cookie selling is just so much fun for me,"" Katie said. For three weeks, every day after school and on weekends, she pitched her products door to door. After that, Katie set up booths at hot spots and stores around Oklahoma City. Every step was monitored, such that if the hourly sales goal wasn't met, she and her mother would head somewhere else. Sometimes the cookies practically sold themselves. But the 12-year-old also offered incentives, like drawings for prizes, and a little song and dance to lure customers. Katie recalled: ""Some people bought cookies only because they saw me singing."" When she found out she'd broken the record dating to the 1980s, Katie said she was the one dancing, she was so excited. What this achievement did not do, however, was break her cookie-selling groove. In fact, she's still at it. Katie hopes to smash the 20,000-cookie mark before the official end date for cookie sales on Sunday, March 30. To put this milestone in perspective, nationally each Girl Scout sells 150 boxes a year on average. She and her mom have wagons and a hatchback car packed with shortbread cookies and Savannah Smiles, looking for customers. They're also keeping in mind what Katie says are the three ingredients for cookie-selling success. As she explained: ""It takes a lot of time, commitment and asking everybody that I see.""","Katie Francis sells more than 18,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies, and she's still going .

"Rock icon Neil Young and the Canadian government don't see eye to eye on the country's oil sands energy projects and they most definitely have different views on how rock stars live. Young, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, began a four-stop concert tour this week to support the efforts of First Nations indigenous groups to stop the mining of the oil sands, a process in which the heavy crude is extracted from the sand, minerals and water with which it is mixed. Young says the mining damages the environment and the Canadian government is not honoring treaty obligations with First Nations groups in allowing it, according to CBC News reports. The government says the mining benefits Canada's economy and standard of living. ""The resource sector creates economic opportunities, and employs tens of thousands of Canadians in high wage jobs, contributing to a standard of living that is envied around the world, and helping to fund the programs and services Canadians rely on,"" Jason MacDonald, a spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Monday, according to a CBC report. ""Even the lifestyle of a rock star relies, to some degree, on the resources developed by thousands of hard-working Canadians every day,"" MacDonald continued. And that's where Young begs to differ. ""Rock stars don't need oil,"" Young replied in a statement, according to the CBC.  ""I drove my electric car from California to the Tar sands and on to Washington DC without using any oil at all and I'm a rock star. My car's generator runs on biomass, one of several future fuels Canada should be developing."" There's evidence to back up Young on that point. In a blog post dated September 3, he talks about driving his ""Lincvolt,"" a modified 1959 Lincoln Continental, on a trip from San Francisco to Alberta. ""On my recent trip to Fort Mac in Alberta, I drove Lincvolt about 1800 miles from San Francisco running on Cellulosic Ethanol fuel. I have chosen to use Ethanol, a much cleaner fuel created from plants nourished by the sun and rain and grown by farmers rather than run on gasoline,"" Young's blog post said. It does go on to point out that on the way out of Alberta, Young ran out of the ethanol fuel for the Lincvolt and couldn't find any in Canada. No word on how he got the car back on the road. Let's hope it didn't require a tow truck because, then, a rock star would need oil. Maybe.","Young is on a concert tour to protest oil sands projects .

"On Sunday, as he has for more than 20 years, Rabbi Levi Shemtov presided over the annual lighting of the National Menorah. The event dates back to 1979, but it was President Ronald Reagan who officially designated the candelabrum, placed in the Ellipse just south of the White House, the National Menorah. Reflecting on his most memorable moment attending the menorah lighting through the years, Shemtov, executive vice president of the American Friends of Lubavitch, said, ""I was up there (on the stage) on a windy day and my hat blew off, and everyone cheered,"" even though it was at his expense, he reminisced. The moment, he said, lives on the Internet. Just adjacent to the White House Christmas tree, the 30-foot menorah stands high enough to be seen from afar, and its height is regulated under Jewish law. ""It's got to be visible, so it has to be at least two and half feet off the ground minimum, and not higher than 30 feet, because the rabbinical authorities deem that to be the height at which a person has to crane their neck to see it,"" Shemtov said. The Chabad group of Orthodox Jews who organize the event say that for the thousands of people who watch the broadcast of the illumination of the menorah, it is a signal that the eight-day religious holiday has begun. Jeffrey Zients, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, was among the guests of honor to help light the first candle.

"(CNN)  -- California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to sue the federal government over its decision not to allow a California plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he announced Thursday. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger says the state will sue the federal government. Environmental Protection Agency chief Stephen Johnson announced the decision Wednesday, refusing the state's request for a waiver that would have allowed it to cut emissions faster than a new federal plan the president signed into law Wednesday. ""It's another example of the administration's failure to treat global warming with the seriousness that it actually demands,"" the governor said at a news conference Thursday. Bush on Thursday defended the decision of his EPA administrator. ""Is it more effective to let each state make a decision as to how to proceed in curbing greenhouse gases? Or is it more effective to have a national strategy?"" he said. Citing the new energy law -- which sets a fuel economy standard for the whole country -- Bush said Johnson ""made a decision based upon the fact that we passed a piece of legislation that enables us to have a national strategy."" But Schwarzenegger said he would like to set a higher standard for California. ""Anything less than aggressive action on the greatest environmental threat of all time is inexcusable,"" he said.  Watch Schwarzenegger slam the Bush administration for denying California the waiver » . The new federal law will increase fuel efficiency standards by 40 percent by 2020, requiring automakers to bring their fleets to an average of 35 miles per gallon. The California plan, however, would cut emissions by nearly 30 percent by 2016, raising fuel efficiency standards in the state to 43.7 miles per gallon for passenger cars and some SUVs and trucks, while larger vehicles would need to reach 26.9 mpg by that year. In all, 16 states had either adopted California's tough standards or announced plans to do so. A top aide to Schwarzenegger said the governor has been frustrated with the White House over emissions standards, and was very exasperated after a February meeting with Johnson. EPA officials say they went the extra mile with Schwarzenegger, even taking the unusual step of holding a second hearing in California on emissions. They say they're sorry he's upset, but they believe a national standard on emissions is going to be more effective. A White House official would only react to Schwarzenegger's frustration by saying the administration ""looks forward to working with him on a variety of issues."" In the ebb-and-flow relationship between Schwarzenegger and Bush, sources close to the governor say this is a low point. ""It's never been a warm, throw-your-arms-around-the-shoulders kind of relationship,"" said former Schwarzenegger adviser Joel Fox. ""Even during the re-election campaign for the president, he would come to California and the governor wouldn't always be there to greet him."" Fox said Schwarzenegger and Bush have cooperated on issues like immigration, but the two have differed on several issues, including stem cell research funding, the expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program and climate change. ""He's got a pretty strong personality, the governor has, and wants to get things done. If the federal government is one of those obstacles, then he'll run that tank he has over it. It's not particularly anything personal, I think."" Schwarzenegger is much closer -- personally and politically -- to the president's father, former President George H.W. Bush, another aide said.

"The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane will be entering a new phase that will use private contractors and may cost about $60 million, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday. ""I regret to say that thus far none of our efforts in the air, on the surface or under sea, have found any wreckage,"" he said. The new phase will focus on searching the ocean floor over a much larger area -- 60,000 square kilometers, a process that will take about six to eight months. ""We do not want this crippling cloud of uncertainty to hang over this family and the wider traveling public,"" he said. It is ""highly unlikely"" that any debris will be found on the ocean surface, Abbott said. By this time, most of the debris will have become waterlogged and will have submerged, he said. As such, authorities will be suspending aerial searches. Words of praise . Malaysia's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and disclosures of its investigations. But on Sunday, U.S. President Barack Obama had words of praise during a visit to the southeast Asian country. He said the Malaysian government has been ""forthcoming"" with the United States about the information it has. ""The Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened,"" Obama told reporters. He reiterated that the United States would continue to aid in the search and offered condolences to loved ones of those lost. Narrowed search nears end . Obama's visit came as the initial search by the Bluefin-21 neared its end. The submersible, which is on contract to the U.S. Navy, had been scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane. Previously, another device, a towed pinger locator, detected signals that officials believed were from the jet's flight recorders, which determined the current search area for the Bluefin. The plane disappeared on March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for Beijing. Preliminary report . Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak  has said a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week, his office said. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body for global aviation, but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. ""Anytime there is a tragedy like this, we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again,"" Obama said. ""That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world, and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. One thing is already clear, however, is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations.""
